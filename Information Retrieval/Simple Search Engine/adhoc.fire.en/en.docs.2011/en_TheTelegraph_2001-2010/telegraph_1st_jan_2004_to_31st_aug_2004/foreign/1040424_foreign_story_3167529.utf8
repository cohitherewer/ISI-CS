A total of 360 pictures of the coffins taken by the air force at the base was released to www.thememoryhole.org by the Pentagon after the website requested them under the Freedom of Information Act. (AFP) 																								Baghdad, April 23 (Reuters): A rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr threatened today to unleash suicide bombers if US forces attacked Iraqs holy city of Najaf and US marines said they might renew an assault on the Sunni bastion of Falluja.																								Fighters loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr ambushed a military convoy in the Shia shrine city of Karbala and clashed with Bulgarian troops deployed there.																								The Bulgarian defence ministry said one of its soldiers wounded in the ambush of an armoured troop carrier near Karbala city hall died.																								We will shed blood to keep our holy city, Sadr, who is based in Najaf, said in a Friday prayer sermon in the nearby town of Kufa. He said many men and women had asked his blessing for martyrdom operations against the Americans.																								I keep telling them to wait. But if there was an assault on our cities or on our religious authorities, we will be time bombs and will not stop before destroying enemy forces.																								US forces are poised just outside Najaf and have vowed to kill or capture Sadr and destroy his Mehdi Army militia, but have allowed time for talks to defuse the standoff.																								The Mehdi Army rose up across the mainly Shia south this month, but US-led forces have regained control of most towns. Sadrs fighters still operate in Karbala and Najaf, which lie in a swathe of south-central Iraq supervised by a Polish-led multinational force.																								Further south, an Italian soldier was wounded when his patrol came under fire near a polling station for a local election in Gharraf, near the town of Nassiriya. An Italian military spokesman said the election had been postponed.																								Guns were quiet in the Sunni stronghold of Falluja, but a US officer said Marines were ready to resume an offensive against insurgents in the city of 300,000.																								Civilian volunteers used picks and shovels to dig bodies from houses flattened in fierce fighting in Falluja earlier this month. Witnesses said three bodies had been recovered in the battered Golan district. Seven were found yesterday. Moqtada al-Sadr 																								Colonel John Coleman, chief of staff of 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, said a possible new offensive would take on Saddam Hussein loyalists, foreign fighters, Muslim militants and armed criminals he said might join the fray.																								Such a battle could shape Iraqs future, Coleman told reporters at Camp Falluja, a US base near the town. As Falluja goes, so goes central Iraq. As central Iraq goes, so goes the nation, he said. Falluja is the centre of gravity.																								Over 2,000 Marines ring Falluja, ready for action if the US military decides that rebels have failed to turn in enough heavy weapons under a peace deal reached with civic leaders.																								Asked whether a new offensive was imminent, Coleman said: Isnt that clear from what I just said?Spain frees Indians																								The Spanish judge investigating the March 11 train bombings in Madrid today freed two Indian suspects, Vinay Kohly and Suresh Kumar from custody, though the pair will remain under judicial supervision, judicial sources said.

 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Blair runs into public backlash
																								London, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Britains Tony Blair dismissed a fresh assault on the case he made for attacking Iraq but the Prime Minister was hounded by members of the public today as he failed to quell the furore over Iraqs missing weapons of mass destruction.																								Former British weapons expert Brian Jones alleged the government had overruled intelligence analysts to present a misleading pre-war dossier on Iraqs banned weapons  the primary Anglo-American motive for war.																								Blair told parliament that Jones concerns were heard by his superiors and were not taken up and he defended the conclusions of senior British judge Lord Hutton who last week cleared the government of exaggerating evidence on the threat from Iraq. 																								Jones remarks poured fuel on the row over the justification given for war, frustrating Blairs attempts to draw a line under one of the most gruelling periods of his premiership.																								Bowing to pressure, Blair yesterday set up an independent inquiry into possible intelligence flaws on Iraq but the move failed to silence his critics. As he led a debate in parliament on Huttons findings, five anti-war protesters heckled the Prime Minister. 																								No more whitewashes! shouted one from the public gallery, before being evicted.

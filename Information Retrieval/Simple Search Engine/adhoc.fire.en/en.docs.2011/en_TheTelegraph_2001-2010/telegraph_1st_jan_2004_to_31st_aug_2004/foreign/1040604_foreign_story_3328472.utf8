 STEWART PAYNE																								London, June 3: It may have settled a few old scores in the racing world, but to the impartial observer it was a one horse race. Well, one horse and a greyhound to be exact.																								The contest was over so quickly that if you blinked you would have missed it. Its promoters would have us believe that the outcome would finally lay to rest the debate over which four legs in competitive racing was the quickest.																								The smart money went on the horse, a six-year-old bay gelding called Tiny Tim. It had been a runner up in its last two starts. Make that three, because Simply Fabulous, an eight-year-old greyhound brought out of retirement, beat the horse by seven lengths.																								The race, staged at Kempton Park, proved little except that over a carefully selected distance of two furlongs the greyhound is the quicker.																								Another furlong, said the jockey Fergus Sweeney ruefully, and the horse would have won. Tiny Tim was only just getting into his stride.																								The race was welcome publicity for greyhound racing, the poor cousin of the sport of kings.																								 It was no accident that Simply Fabulous is owned by David Hood, who just happens to be the press officer for William Hill bookmakers.																								Nor was it a coincidence that on Saturday, William Hill is sponsoring the Greyhound Derby at Wimbledon Stadium, an event overshadowed by the Vodafone Derby at Epsom on the same day.																								The race caused some excitement among racegoers at the evening meeting at Kempton. Whether they can be persuaded to put down their binoculars and don flat caps instead remains to be seen.																								The horse started the favourite with punters.																								Most of the money was on the horse, said Hood, 36, who was once a jump jockey, but now owns several greyhounds. 																								The biggest single bet on the horse was 11,000 with 200 being the biggest sum put on the dog.																								Simply Fabulous, winner of 14 out of 35 starts before being retired 18 months ago, was quick out of his trap, chasing the hare down the outside with Tiny Tim trying to gain ground on the inside. 																								Hood, who said that his dogs favourite meal was sausage and mash, was delighted with the result, and honest enough to admit that the whole thing was a bit if a stunt. Yet today has demonstrated just what wonderful athletes these dogs are. They are the ultimate racing animal and go from 0 to 40 miles per hour in a second, he said.																								Sweeney said: I am a little bit disappointed and a bit surprised. I think I was closing the greyhound down and would have won over a longer distance. But it was just a bit of fun. The winning time was 23.29 seconds, with the horse crossing the line in 24.63 seconds. The winning distance translates to 15 greyhound lengths. Not a bad effort from an old dog, said Hood.

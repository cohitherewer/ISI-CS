 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Bush must testify on abuse, says lawyer
				 	 George W. Bush: In the dock																								Baghdad, June 21 (Reuters): George W. Bush and secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld should take the witness stand at the trial of a US soldier charged with abusing prisoners in Iraq, the soldiers lawyer said today.																								Policies adopted in Bushs war on terror created a climate encouraging cruelty, said lawyers for US soldiers accused of subjecting detainees to sexual humiliation and physical abuse at Iraqs Abu Ghraib prison.																								No one can suggest with a straight face that the MPs (military police) acted alone, said defence lawyer Guy Womack, representing Specialist Charles Graner, who faces the most serious charges of the soldiers to be court martialed.																								They were directly under the supervision of military intelligence officers, he said after a pre-trial hearing.																								Pre-trial hearings were held today for Specialist Charles Graner  who faces the most serious charges of all the Abu Ghraib accused  and Sergeant Javal Davis.																								Davis defence counsel Paul Bergrin said Bush and Rumsfeld sidestepped the Geneva Convention, encouraging abuse that stretched down the chain of command to the soldiers at Abu Ghraib, notorious as a torture centre under Saddam Hussein.																								He said his client  accused of jumping on a pile of prisoners and stomping on their feet  was instructed on a daily basis to soften up Iraqi prisoners to obtain intelligence.

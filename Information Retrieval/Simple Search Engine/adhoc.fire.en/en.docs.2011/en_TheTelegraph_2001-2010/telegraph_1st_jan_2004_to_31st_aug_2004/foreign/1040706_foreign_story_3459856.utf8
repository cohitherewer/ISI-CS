				 	 Aisha Gaddafi: Defender																								Amman, July 5 (Reuters): Saddam Husseins Jordan-based defence team said today a convoy of buses is being arranged to transport hundreds of legal experts to Baghdad in a show of support for the ousted Iraqi leader.																								Issam Ghazawi, a prominent lawyer and one of the 21-strong defence team hired by Saddams wife, said among the large contingent of lawyers ready to defend Saddam are 700 non-Arabs, including 400 Americans and Europeans. 																								Two hundred legal consultants from across the world have also pledged to help in the case, he said. More than half of the over 2,000 lawyers volunteering to defend President Saddam are expected to join the trip, Ghazawi said. 																								Lawyers have voiced fears about their personal safety in Iraq, citing remarks by officials who attacked Arabs who defend Saddam as a nationalist hero who fought the Americans.																								They also expect to encounter objections by Iraqi lawyers who say existing laws bar foreigners from defending their countrymen in local courts. The defence team again contacted US officials last week to allow them access to their client. They say past requests have been ignored.																								The Iraqi leader, who was driven from power by US-led forces in April 2003, appeared before an Iraqi judge last Thursday to face charges that may lead to a formal indictment for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.																								Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafis daughter, Aisha Gaddafi, told Saddams lawyers she wanted to join them after seeing the televised court appearance. A team of three Jordanian lawyers has left for Tripoli to meet Aisha, who is said to have a doctorate in international law and runs Libyas largest humanitarian charity.Iraq law																								Iraqs interim government today again postponed an announcement on a security law to curb insurgents but gave no explanation for the latest delay.																								Despite the delays, foreign minister Hoshiyar Zebari said the government would soon introduce the security law, reinstate the death penalty and offer a temporary amnesty to insurgents.

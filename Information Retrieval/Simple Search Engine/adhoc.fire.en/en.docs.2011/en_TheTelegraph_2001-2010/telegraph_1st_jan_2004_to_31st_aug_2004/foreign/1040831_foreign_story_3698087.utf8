The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Bellucci keeps Hollywood at bay
				 	 Bellucci: Pouty Polygot Los Angeles, Aug. 30 (Reuters):  Following her standout role as the cybersassy creation Persephone  in the final two Matrix movies  not to mention playing  the female lead in Mel Gibsons blockbuster The Passion  of the Christ  youd think citizen-of-the world Monica  Bellucci already wouldve turned in her passport for a one-way  ticket to Hollywood.																								But the pouty polyglot instead lined up roles in a spate of European independent films. I come to America if there is something interesting to me, the Italian screen siren, who is expecting her first child with French actor husband Vincent Cassell at the end of next month, said from their Paris apartment. If you want to work (in Hollywood), you dont have to live there.																								She then added a line or two sure to drive any agent up a wall. I have to find the right character for me, she says. Sometimes they offer me big movies, but its not my type. They have to be good. I dont just want to play a vampire jumping on the wall!

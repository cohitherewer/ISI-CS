The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Tigers ready for battle, blame government
				 	 Karuna																								Colombo, July 12 (Reuters): Tamil Tigers accused the government today of thrusting a war on them by using a rival rebel faction to weaken their forces and said they were ready to return to the battlefield.																								The warning came less than a week after a suicide bomb blast blamed on the LTTE killed five people at a police station in the capital, the first such attack since the government and rebels agreed to a truce in 2002.																								Both the rebels and the government have said they do not want to break the Norwegian-brokered truce that has given the island its best chance to end the war that killed 64,000 over more than two decades.																								The LTTE says the military is aiding a rebel faction led by a breakaway eastern fighter known as Karuna, and is complicit in ongoing violence in his home base of Batticaloa.																								This would make it plain to the Tamil people that the Sri Lankan state is not interested at all in taking forward the peace process but is only bent on using the talks and the ceasefire to wage a terrorist war on us, E. Kausalyan, head of the Tigers political wing in Batticaloa said on the Tamilnet website.																								We are ready to face the war that the Sri Lankan state has decided to thrust on us thus, he said on the pro-rebel site.																								Defence secretary Cyril Herath said security forces were under strict instructions to stick to the ceasefire and denied they were involved with Karuna.																								Karunas people can act on their own  they dont need help, he said. The instructions we have given to security forces is that they should in no way in word or deed do anything to perpetrate violence, he said.																								Nordic monitors overseeing the truce said they met the Tigers political wing in the rebel-held north yesterday, but it was a routine meeting not prompted by the suicide bomb.																								They want to respect the ceasefire, spokeswoman Disa Finnboga said.																								The Tigers have denied a role in the suicide blast, but police said the target was Tamil government minister Douglas Devananda, one of their most outspoken critics and a challenge to their claim to be the sole legitimate representative of the islands minority Tamils.																								Devananda said he has had contact with Karuna.

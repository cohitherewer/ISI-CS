 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 UK outlines identity card plan
																								London, April 26 (Reuters): Britain outlined plans today to introduce identity cards for the first time in 50 years, in an attempt to clamp down on terrorism and illegal immigration.																								But home secretary David Blunkett admitted the high-tech ID cards would by no means protect the country against terror attacks as he prepared for a drawn-out battle with civil liberties groups and parliamentarians over the draft legislation.																								In the past, Britons have only had to carry ID cards in wartime, unlike most Europeans. The last compulsory identity papers were abolished in 1952 by the government of Winston Churchill. It wont solve the problem (of terrorism)... nor will it necessarily guarantee safety for the future but it will make a contribution, Blunkett told BBC Radio.																								The card would protect public services and discourage clandestine entry and organised fraud, he added. 																								The government plans to set up a national database of peoples facial dimensions, iris images and fingerprints and pilot trials began across the country with 10,000 volunteers to test the technology.																								Voluntary ID cards will not be introduced until 2007  after the next general election  and they are not expected to be made compulsory until 2013, and only if the sitting government and parliament agrees.																								Blunkett said the cards will help the police crack down on identity theft.

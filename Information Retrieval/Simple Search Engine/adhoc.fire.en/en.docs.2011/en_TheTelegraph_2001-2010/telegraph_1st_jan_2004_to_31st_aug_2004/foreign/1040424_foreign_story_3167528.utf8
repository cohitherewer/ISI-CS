 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Do not strike Falluja again: Sunni cleric
																								Baghdad, April 23 (AFP): A Sunni leader today warned that the US-led coalition would face an uprising throughout Iraq if its forces attack Falluja, which has been besieged by US marines since April 5.																								I have an urgent message for US forces. You have overstepped the red line. Make sure you do not strike Falluja again, Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Ghafur Samarrai said during Friday prayers at a Baghdad mosque.																								We will not allow the shedding of Iraqi blood. If you strike again, the whole of Iraq, from north to south, from east to west, will become Falluja, the Sunni cleric said. Located 50 km west of Baghdad, the Sunni city has been the scene of fierce fighting between coalition troops and insurgents in recent days.																								Official figures show that a total of 271 Iraqis and dozens of US marines have been killed in Falluja since the troops lay siege to the city on April 5 following the slaying of four American contractors.

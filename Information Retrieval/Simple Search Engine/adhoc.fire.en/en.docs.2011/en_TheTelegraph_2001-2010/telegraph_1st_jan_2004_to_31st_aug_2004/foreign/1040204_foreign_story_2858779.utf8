The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Poison on Capitol
																								Washington, Feb. 3 (Reuters): US Senate hearings were disrupted today after a powder which initially tested positive for the poison ricin was found in a congressional mailroom, stirring memories of a deadly 2001 anthrax attack.																								Senate majority leader Bill Frist said he was convinced the powder, found yesterday afternoon, was ricin, but officials awaited confirmation from tests at an army laboratory. 																								He said 16 people were nearby when the powder was found but not all had been exposed and there were no reports of illness.																								We made a decision based on procedures that are quite thorough and comprehensive to close the three Senate (office) buildings today, a Tennessee Republican who is also a physician, said. He was speaking on the floor of the Senate, which, like the House of Representatives, remained open.																								A government official said the incident bore the hallmarks of a domestic criminal action not a terror attack.

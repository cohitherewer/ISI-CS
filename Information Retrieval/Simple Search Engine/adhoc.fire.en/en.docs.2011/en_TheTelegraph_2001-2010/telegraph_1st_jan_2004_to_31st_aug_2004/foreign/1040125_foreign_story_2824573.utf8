 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Jan 24: Majida Rizvi, a leading Pakistani jurist and chairperson of Pakistans National Commission on Status of Women, has called for an end to the tradition of honour killings that is so pervasive in rural Pakistan.																								We are conducting a research into the growing murders of innocent girls in the name of family honour, she told The Telegraph today. 																								According to the Independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), more than 450 honour killings have taken place in urban and rural Pakistan in 2003 as compared to 278 in the year 2002. A former High Court judge, Rizvi said the commission held meetings with religious scholars, lawyers and retired judges to find out what can be done to amend the controversial Islamic laws which worsened the honour killings.																								Under the controversial laws, most of which were promulgated by former military dictator Zia ul-Haq in 1979, the perpetrator of the crime can escape punishment by paying compensation to the victims family through the use of force or with the help of the police.																								In rural areas, feudal lords are also known to put their weight behind this custom and Jirgas (a council of local elders) are pressured to punish the victims by handing down judgments in the name of honour. 																								Even penalties are imposed on the victims families to settle honour disputes with underage girls sometimes used as a commodity. This is happening because of serious flaws in existing laws, which need amendments, Rizvi said adding that it is no crime if a girl marries a boy of her choice. However, in Pakistan it becomes a question of honour.																								The issue re-surfaced in Pakistan recently when newly-wed Shaista Almani, 22, hailing from Pakistans southern province of Sindh, received death threats from her Almani tribe for marrying Balkh Sher Mehr of another tribe. Under pressure from both families, Almani and Mahar were forced to divorce.																								Presently languishing in a womens police station in Karachi, Shaista got official protection following an intervention by President Pervez Musharraf that was made on her request.																								In another case in southern Punjab last year, a father strangled his daughter, 22-year-old Afsheen, to death for marrying her lover in opposition to her parents choice. Majida Rizvi, who last week presented the report of her commission to Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Jamali on the status of Women, said the commission would recommend amendments in the law after consulting people from a cross section of society.																								In its report, the commission, which conducts reviews of laws affecting the status and rights of women, called for repeal of the controversial Islamic Hudood law which is widely considered oppressive to women.																								There is a dire need of a pro-active approach by the government and parliament to deal with the issue, said Rizvi.																								Under the law, rapists often escape punishment as it requires a female victim to produce four eyewitnesses to her ordeal. 																								This is ridiculous... how a women who is raped while walking down the street can produce four eyewitnesses, Rizvi said. 																								She, however, appeared sceptical about the law being repealed but said majority of the religious leaders, who used to declare recommendations for repeal of the laws as unIslamic, are now ready to discuss the issue, which is a major achievement.

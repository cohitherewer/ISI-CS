 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Washington unleashes the twins
 DAVID RENNIE				 	 Barbara (left) and Jenna BushWashington, May 25: The news has excited and alarmed Washington society in equal measure  the Bush twins are on the loose and heading for the capital.																								Jenna and Barbara, the much-indulged 22-year-old daughters of President George W. Bush, graduated from their universities last weekend, and officials confirmed that they would soon be working at their fathers campaign headquarters, possibly even delivering speeches on his behalf.																								First, in the modern-day equivalent of a debutantes coming out, the twins are to be profiled in a forthcoming issue of Vogue after giving a joint interview and sitting for photos in New York in a variety of classy outfits.																								For the cowed Washington press corps  which has spent the last four years studiously ignoring the twins for fear of a tongue-lashing from the White House  the implications could not be clearer. The kid gloves are coming off, the Washington Post declared yesterday, ominously. To a degree which would probably be impossible in Britain, the Bush family has maintained a strict zone of privacy around the Presidents children, smuggling them from back doors to the White House or on to Air Force One and even mustering aides to shield them with suit carriers.																								Media restraint was tested in the summer of 2001 when the twins had a string of run-ins with law, each time involving drink. First, Jenna, an English student at the University of Texas in Austin used her bodyguards to free a male friend arrest for intoxication.																								During the months that followed, Jenna twice landed in court for trying to buy alcohol despite being under the legal drinking age of 21, once with a false driving licence. On the second occasion Barbara was also charged. An Austin police report quoted Jenna pleading with the arresting officer and telling him he had no idea what it is like to be a college student, and not being able to do [what] other students get to do.																								Now, Jenna plans to move to New York to work with children as a volunteer. Barbara, who studied humanities at Yale, is to be an intern on a paediatric Aids programme in clinics in Eastern Europe and Africa. Bush and his wife did not attend either of their daughters graduations, saying they did not want to subject other parents to the disruption caused by presidential security. Instead, the couple hosted private dinners for each in Austin, and New Haven, Connecticut.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Left-wing plot hits Air Force One 
Oak Ridge (US), July 13 (AP): A Left-wing conspiracy? 																								A flap on the wing of Air Force One left its track, forcing President George W. Bush to return from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in a smaller presidential plane, a Boeing 757 rather than the 747 he arrived in, yesterday. 																								Just over a week earlier, on the Fourth of July, a problem with an engine starter valve on the wing of his plane  this time a 757  delayed Bushs departure from Hagerstown, Maryland. Another plane from the presidential fleet was flown in from Andrews Air Force base to take him on to West Virginia. Two different planes. Two different wings. 																								 The plane troubles for the Republican President apparently were just a coincidence. And the White House said neither malfunction endangered Bush. One of the flaps on the wing was off its track and they thought it was best to have a 757 fly down from Andrews, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said yesterday.																								The replacement plane arrived moments before Bushs motorcade rolled onto the tarmac at McGhee-Air National Guard Base near Oak Ridge.

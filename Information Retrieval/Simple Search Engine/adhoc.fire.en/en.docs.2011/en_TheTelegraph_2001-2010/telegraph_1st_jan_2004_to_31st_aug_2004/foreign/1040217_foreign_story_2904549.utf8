The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, February 17, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Bridgets boy																																	 London, Feb. 16 (Reuters): British writer Helen Fielding, author of Bridget Joness Diary, has given birth to a baby boy, her publicist said today.																																	Fielding, 43, gave birth to the 7 pound baby at Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening.																																	It all went very well and all three of us are overjoyed, Fielding and her partner Kevin Curran said. The baby currently has 12 names but we are working on narrowing it down a bit.																																	Fieldings lovelorn heroine Bridget Jones became famous around the world after actress Renee Zellweger played her in a hit film in 2001. 																						A sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is due for release later this year. 																													 																Cash Cut Boston (AP): Although Meg Ryans last  movie didnt do so well at the box office, she didnt get  involved in it simply for the cash. While doing publicity  for the boxing movie Against the Ropes, Ryan talked  about her role in Jane Campions controversial thriller  In The Cut, which generated lots of publicity for  her in-the-buff lovemaking scenes. I learned on the last  movie out that theres a very particular idea of me that  people dont want to give up. And you know what? Thats  fine, Im happy to do comedies as well, Ryan told the Boston  Herald in yesterdays editions. I mean, Im an actor,  and I want to do all kinds of different things. But that  was never a movie for everyone. That was always a movie  that has a great director telling a very, very personal  story. Its great to serve that kind of vision as well as  a more commercial vision. Theyre just two entirely different  things.																													 																Bard read																																	 Wellesley, Massachusetts (AP): A college drama group with a soft spot for William Shakespeare began a marathon session on Sunday evening to read all the legendary playwrights works in 24 hours. Unabridged. The Wellesley College Shakespeare Society is hoping their efforts dont turn out to be The Comedy of Errors and instead land them in the Guinness Book of Records as the first to read the works in such a short amount of time. Its a huge overnighter. We are going to be crazy with iambic pentameter, said Alison Buchbinder, president of the society at the all-womens college outside Boston. Though the exact number of works in Shakespeares canon has been disputed, the reading will include 39 plays, 154 sonnets and five poems from sunset to sunset.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Hunt for Thai mastermind
				 	 A Thai prays at the Krue Se mosque where 34 militants were killed last week. (Reuters)																								Bangkok, May 5 (Reuters): A Thai court has issued an arrest warrant for a religious teacher suspected of masterminding attacks in which 108 militants and five security men were killed, police said today.																								Two men held after the raids on security posts across the troubled Muslim south last week had given enough evidence to justify the arrest of 33-year-old Yusof Rayalong, also known as Ustas Ishma-aecompostella, a teacher at a religious school.																								The warrant has been issued, a police officer in the southern province of Yala said. The Yala district court issued the warrant, officials said. Police searched Yusofs home at the school in Yala, but he was nowhere to be found and they suspected he had fled after the carnage, which analysts say looks like the resurgence of a Muslim separatist rebellion dormant since the 1980s.																								During their interrogation of the two suspects, police said detainee Asae Wadeng had confessed to attacking a Yala army base on April 28, but said he had been egged on to do it by Yusof, who had indoctrinated him with separatist ideas.																								Yusof had recruited at least 20 teenagers to launch the raids and given them a magic spell to recite one day before the attacks, police said. On April 27  the day before the attacks  Yusof gave the youths shirts and sacred white cloth, along with seven swords and daggers. He then told them to go and steal guns and harm soldiers at two different spots.																								The second suspect also mentioned Yusof, the policeman said.																								Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has said the machete-wielding attackers were drug-crazed gangsters manipulated by criminal networks. 																								But some top officials say they suspect the attacks are the work of true believers who have support from foreign militant groups.																								Whatever their motives, the deaths have tarnished Thailands image as the tourist paradise Land of Smiles, and upset relations with neighbouring Malaysia, where there is strong sympathy for the souths Malay-speaking, Muslim population.																								Thaksin, facing the biggest challenge in his more than three years in office, will head to the troubled region tomorrow for a three-day visit.																								Despite Bangkoks peace-loving assertions and pledges of money to repair the damage, anger in Buddhist Thailands deep south  with its history of often violent Muslim separatism  refuses to die down. 																								The government is turning itself into an enemy of our Islamic brothers in the rest of the world, said Abdulfahtah Husen, a 38-year-old merchant who drove with five friends from neighbouring Yala province to see the bullet-riddled mosque.

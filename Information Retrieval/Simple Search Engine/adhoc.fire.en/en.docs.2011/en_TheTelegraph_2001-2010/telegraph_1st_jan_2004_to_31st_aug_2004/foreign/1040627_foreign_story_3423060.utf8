 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Militants threat to kill Turks in Iraq
Dubai, June 26 (Reuters): Suspected militants from Abu Musab al-Zarqawis group have kidnapped three Turks in Iraq and are threatening to behead them unless Ankara pulls out all forces within 72 hours, al Jazeera television said today.																								Jazeera said it had received a statement and a video tape purportedly from the Jamaat al Tawhid and Jihad of al Qaida-linked operative Zarqawi urging Turks to demonstrate against Bushs visit to Turkey to attend a Nato summit. The deadline would expire before the end of the two-day summit.																								A brief video image showed three men  holding what appeared to be passports  crouching before gunmen, whose faces were covered. Jazeera said the men had read out their names in Turkish on the recording.																								Turkey is not part of the multinational occupation force in Iraq but many Turks work as contractors supplying and supporting US-led forces. According to al Jazeera, the statement called on Turkish forces and companies that support the occupation forces in Iraq to leave by the deadline or the three workers would be killed. 																								Last week, the same group claimed responsibility for beheading a South Korean hostage after Seoul rejected demands to pull out of Iraq.

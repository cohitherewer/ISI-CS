 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Explosive cocktail of anger and dissent
				 	 Palestinians show the destroyed wheel of Sheikh Ahmed Yassins wheelchair in the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City. (AFP)																								London, March 22 (Reuters): Israels assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin today was greeted with Palestinian vows of revenge, European condemnation, traces of dissent in Israels cabinet and US denials it gave a green light to the killing.																								The battle is open and war between us and them is open. They are the killers of prophets and today they killed an Islamic symbol, said senior Hamas political leader Abdel-Aziz al Rantissi. The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, part of Palestinian President Yasser Arafats Fatah faction and like Hamas responsible for past suicide bombings, called for war, war, war on the sons of Zion. An eye for an eye. There will be a response within hours, God willing.																								On the less militant end of the Palestinian political spectrum, Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie called the missile attack on the spiritual leader of Hamas as he left dawn prayers in a wheelchair a crazy and very dangerous act.																								It opens the door wide to chaos. Yassin was known for his moderation and he was controlling Hamas. Therefore this is a dangerous, cowardly act, Qurie said. Within hours of Yassins death, there was shooting on the Lebanese-Israeli border. A Palestinian wounded three people with an axe near a Tel Aviv army base and an Arab stabbed three passengers on a bus in Jaffa.																								A dissenting voice in the Israeli cabinet, interior minister Avraham Poraz, said Yassin had not been a ticking bomb and his death could lead to the loss of more Israeli lives in suicide attacks. White House national security adviser Condoleezza Rice denied suggestions by Hamas that Washington gave Israel a green light for the assassination, or at least had advance warning. It is very important that everyone step back now and try now to be calm in the region. There is always a possibility of a better day in West Asia, she said.																								There was anger across Arab societies and in the wider Islamic world. Mohamed Mahdi Akef, leader of Egypts Muslim Brotherhood which shares the Islamist views of Hamas, called it an unforgivable crime and said violence was the only language that Israel understood.																								We will not rest, we will not sleep until the last Zionist leaves our territory, Akef said. Lebanons Hizbollah said Israelis would pay a heavy price for their ugly crime. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said the assassination aborted the peace process. Arab television stations replaced scheduled programmes with live coverage of Yassins funeral. 																								Mourners reached to touch the flag-draped coffin in the biggest turnout in Gaza since Arafats triumphant entry in 1994 after interim peace deals with Israel. Iran called the killing a further example of the Zionist regimes barbarity.																								In Mosul, the third-largest city of US-occupied Iraq, about 500 students demonstrated against the killing of Yassin on the campus of the university, burning an Israeli and an American flag and chanting anti-American slogans. 																								Pakistans minister for information and broadcasting Shaykh Rashid Ahmad said the Hamas leader had embraced martyrdom.

 Wednesday, June 09, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Chirac lift for veteran																																	 London, June 8 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac gave a D-Day veteran a lift back to Paris in one of his jets after the New Zealander got lost following Sundays ceremonies in northern France to honour World War Two Allied troops.																																	Keith Coleman hopped on a coach after the main international ceremony in Arromanches to mark the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, but instead of taking him back to the French capital he ended up at a remote military airfield where all the other veterans got on a plane.																						There was this important looking guy wearing gold braid who I told my story to and I guess he must have felt sorry for me, because he made a few phone calls and told me he thought he could get me back to Paris, Coleman, who speaks no French, told Britains Guardian newspaper today. The 86-year-old former gunner with Britains Royal Air Force was whisked by car to another airfield where two jets were waiting. A cavalcade pulled up and the French President got out. 																																	He came over ... I snapped to attention and gave him a little salute ... he put his arm round me, he told the paper. He said he would be happy for me to travel in one of the aeroplanes and gave instructions that I was to be driven to the door of my hotel.

The thief who returned loot																																	 London (Reuters): A British robber who stole 115,000 in cash from a bank broke back in a week later to give most of it back, police said on Tuesday. The thief got into the Barclays Bank in east London, smashed a window and helped himself to the cash in the ATM machine. A week later baffled staff called detectives to say the robber had returned 104,000. We were contacted by staff saying a large amount of cash had been found in a black bag in the premises, police said. They are probing whether the bizarre double break-in, thought to be unique in Britain, was an inside job, the Sun newspaper said.

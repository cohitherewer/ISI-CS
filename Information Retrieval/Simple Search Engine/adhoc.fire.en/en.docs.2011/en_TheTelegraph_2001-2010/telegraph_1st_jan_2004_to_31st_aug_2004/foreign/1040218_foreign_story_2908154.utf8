 Wednesday, February 18, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Message madness																																	 Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 17 (Reuters): An intimate Valentines Day text message nearly caused a Malaysian couple to split when it landed on the wrong mobile phone number, a newspaper reported on Sunday.																																	A 27-year-old man and his wife of two months were taking a romantic drive around a park in Seremban, south off Kuala Lumpur, when his phone beeped just after midnight, The Sunday Star said.																																	He asked her to retrieve the message, which read: Darling, I really miss you, always thinking of you even when you are not here tonight beside me in the bed, I am waiting, lots and kisses and hugs  Jane.																																	The wife demanded her husband stop the car, accused him of infidelity and left for her parents home in a taxi. She refused to take his calls and his father-in-law later told him she would be filing for a divorce. 																																	It took 12 frantic hours before the sender of the message was traced. She called the wife with an explanation, and the couple made up with a hug in front of their families. 																													 																Read rush Wellesley, Massachusetts (AP): To read or not to read. And in 24 hours? That was the question for the Wellesley College Shakespeare Society, which now has the answer. The group, assisted by other enthusiasts, on Monday finished an all-night read-a-thon of William Shakespeares complete works in what may be a record 22 hours and five minutes. More than 150 people read aloud from Sunday at sunset until about early morning on Monday. Five groups read simultaneously and continuously, banging a cymbal as each play, sonnet or poem was finished.

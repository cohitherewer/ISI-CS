 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Fighter robots have long way to go
Barstow (California), March 14 (Reuters): Thirteen robot vehicles set out on a 224-km race across Californias Mojave desert yesterday with the goal of one day running missions in war zones without risking the lives of US soldiers.																								But most of the vehicles, which included modified Humvees, pickup trucks and dune buggies, broke down within sight of the starting line near Barstow, California, and none travelled more than 11 km.																								The race, sponsored by the Pentagons Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), had offered a prize of $1 million for any vehicle that could complete the course.																								It was set to end in Primm, Nevada, roughly the distance from Iraqs capital Baghdad to Saddam Husseins hometown of Tikrit.																								DARPA appeared upbeat despite the breakdowns. It is tough terrain, it was a tough test. We are very pleased some vehicles managed to travel five, six, even seven miles, DARPA spokeswoman Jan Walker said.																								Fifteen vehicles qualified for the race but two withdrew before the start. Nine of the remaining 13 travelled less than three km. All vehicles were fully autonomous and guided by devices such as infrared sensors. A modified Humvee dubbed Sandstorm, operated by a team from Carnegie Mellon University, was the first to leave shortly after sunrise.																								It was widely regarded as the most likely to succeed. But after just 11 km, it got caught on an obstacle and rubber on its front wheels caught fire.																								Only one other vehicle, a modified dune buggy, equalled that achievement. Some broke down within metres of the start. One flipped onto its side, another got snagged in barbed wire and a third had problems with its brakes.																								Speed is not an issue. I will tell you the turtle will win this race. If you are a rabbit you will not win this event. The roads are that difficult out there, programme manager Col Jose Negron told reporters before the race.																								Pasadena, California-based Team Caltech and its modified Chevrolet Tahoe 4x4 named Bob seemed to take that advice to heart. Bob was still visible from the starting gate after 2-1/2 hours and did not appear to be moving.																								One of the most bizarre competitors, a riderless motorcycle, was withdrawn before the start of the race.																								Team leader Anthony Levandowski, who said the bike had crashed some 150 times in practice, nevertheless held a demonstration before an enthusiastic crowd. It travelled less than one metre before toppling over. DARPA director Tony Tether said he hoped driverless vehicles would one day carry water, fuel and other supplies to the US military during a conflict.																								Officials held the competition in the California desert because US forces are confronting similar terrain in Iraq and Afghanistan.

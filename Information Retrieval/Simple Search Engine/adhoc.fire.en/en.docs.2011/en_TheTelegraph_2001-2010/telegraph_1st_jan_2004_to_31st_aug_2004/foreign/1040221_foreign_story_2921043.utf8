 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Iran hawks slap US to bring out voters
				 	 Women wait to cast their vote at a polling station in Tehran. (AFP)																								Tehran, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Iranians appeared to have largely ignored boycott calls in a disputed parliamentary election today and were poised to elect hardliners opposed to reformist President Mohammad Khatami.																								With polling extended by four hours beyond the official closing time to allow latecomers to vote, an interior ministry source said first estimates suggested a reduced but respectable national turnout of between 47 and 52 per cent. That compares with 67 per cent in 2000 when reformers linked to Khatami swept two-thirds of the parliament seats. Most prominent reformists were banned from running this time by a watchdog panel of unelected hardline clerics.																								Irans clerical leaders and state media had exhorted voters to slap America in the face by turning out in droves, seeking to tap a deep vein of nationalism and suspicion of foreign interference among many Iranians.																								The main reformist party, led by Khatamis brother Mohammad Reza, and the main pro-reform student movement boycotted the poll. 																								In Tehran, where their support is strongest, the ministry source said turnout was down to 20-25 per cent.																								But the reformers predictions of a nationwide turnout of 40 per cent or less appeared to have been dashed. Conservatives had forecast up to 60 per cent but were quick to note that around 50 per cent would be comparable to US presidential elections. With most reformists barred and a conservative victory virtually assured, Irans clerical rulers sought a high turnout to endorse the legitimacy of the Islamic system.																								Official participation figures and first results were not expected until early tomorrow.																								Reuters correspondents around Tehran said many voters were choosing the main conservative Alliance for the Advancement of Islamic Iran, which opposed Khatamis policy of allowing greater political, media and cultural freedom. The interior ministry extended voting in Irans 28 provinces by four hours to 1830 GMT to accommodate late voters. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, among the first to cast his ballot, said the Islamic Republics enemies were trying to deter young people from voting.																								You see how those who are against the Iranian nation and the Islamic revolution are trying so hard to prevent people from going to the polls, Khamenei told state television.

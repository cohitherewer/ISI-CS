 SEAN RAYMENT																								London, May 23: The army is offering soldiers year-long sabbaticals in an attempt to staunch the long-term damage being caused by troops leaving to take up highly-paid private security work in Iraq.																								About 500 soldiers a month are ending their military careers early, with many of them tempted by the prospect of earning up to 500 a day  10 times what the average soldier earns  for protecting politicians or businessman in Baghdad.																								The army, alarmed at the loss of some of its best men, has told soldiers that their jobs will be kept open for a year in the hope that they might consider returning.																								Elite regiments such as the SAS, the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Marines have been particularly affected as their troops are most highly prized by security companies.																								Those most in demand are senior non-commissioned officers such as sergeants and sergeant majors, who have highly valued operational and organisational skills.																								The Parachute Regiment has lost 195 soldiers in the past year  equivalent to 11 per cent of its total strength of 1,795  under the armys premature voluntary release scheme. It is understood that most immediately joined private security companies and are working in Iraq.																								Gordon Robertson, who until last month was a member of the Parachute Regiment, left the army to work in Iraq after he was promoted to colour sergeant and awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for bravery.																								Everyone I know in the army has thought or is thinking about leaving and working in Iraq. Most probably wont leave but some will. Ive got friends out there who e-mail me every week telling me to join them, he said before quitting.																								They are making a fortune and its extremely tempting for any soldier because of the amount of money they can earn in such a short time  and who can blame them, he said.																								On the last day of his service, Robertson was told by a senior officer that his job would be kept open for a year.																								Estimates suggest that up to 45,000 private security staff are working in Iraq. It is thought that about 2,500 of them are former British servicemen who have left the armed forces in the past year.																								The US defence department believes that the total number of security personnel will grow to 125,000 by the end of the year.																								Pay for a security guard depends on the risks involved, but ranges from 350 to 500 a day. A former soldier working a five-day week could earn 130,000 a year  compared with about 12,000 in the army. It is highly dangerous work, however. Five former British servicemen have been killed while working as security guards in Iraq.																								One officer, an infantry lieutenant colonel who is due to begin working for a security company in Iraq in the next few weeks, said: As far as soldiers are concerned, this is the equivalent of the Californian gold rush. Its dangerous work, which isnt going to last forever, but the financial rewards, providing you dont get killed, are very good.																								There is no point trying to tell a soldier that he is making a career mistake. The best thing to do is to try and entice him back.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

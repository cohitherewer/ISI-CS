 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Applause rings loud after Brazil tames finger pilot
				 	 American Airlines pilot Dale Robbin Hersh (centre) being arrested by federal agents at Cumbica airport, Sao Paulo. (AFP) Sao Paulo, Jan 16 (Reuters):  Police at Sao Paulos airport were deluged with calls of  congratulations yesterday for arresting an American Airlines  pilot who made an obscene gesture while being photographed  by immigration officials as part of a policy that has soured  US-Brazilian relations.																								The pilot, Dale Robin Hersh, 52, who was arrested for raising his middle figure in a photograph that was splashed across Brazilian newspapers, was fined nearly $13,000 before being allowed to leave the country, officials said.																								The American pilots defiant gesture brought renewed focus to a new Brazilian policy of fingerprinting and photographing all US visitors in retaliation for a similar measure introduced by the US for many foreigners.																								Many Brazilians are annoyed by what they perceive as Washingtons arrogance when dealing with Latin America and welcomed Hershs arrest as well as the knowledge that the new airport controls have irked the US. A Reuters photographer at Sao Paulo airport said police had received almost nonstop phone calls of congratulations for arresting Hersh and forcing him to surrender his passport.																								Veronique Genevieve Claude, an official at the court where Hershs case was heard, said the pilot had paid a $12,775 fine and was free to leave the country. US passport holders have been subjected to long lines at Brazilian ports of entry since the new controls were implemented, prompting secretary of state Colin Powell to complain that Americans were being discriminated against.																								At a regional summit in Mexico this week, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva appealed to President George W. Bush to suspend visa requirements so the two countries could drop the fingerprint checks.																								In a bid to ease the tension for American travellers ahead of its famous Carnival in February, Rio de Janeiros tourism body laid on Samba dancers for arriving US tourists at the airport and handed them roses and T-shirts bearing the message: Rio loves you.																								Airports in Rio and Sao Paulo also began using an electronic fingerprinting and photographing system to speed up the processing of US citizens, which began on January 1.																								The process was quick and easy, said actor Kevin Boguel on clearing immigration at Rios Tom Jobim airport. I only feel a bit embarrassed because we North Americans are getting presents and the other tourists are not.																								American housewife Marilyn Ross also had no complaints after going through the immigration procedure at Rio airport. I think its normal, she said. If the US wants to fingerprint then Brazil also has the right to do so.

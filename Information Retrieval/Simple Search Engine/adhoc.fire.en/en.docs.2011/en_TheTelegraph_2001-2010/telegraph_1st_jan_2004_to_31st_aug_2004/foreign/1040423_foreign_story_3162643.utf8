 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Nuke Iran threat to Israel: Bush
																								Washington, April 22 (Reuters): A nuclear-armed Iran would pose an intolerable threat to peace in West Asia and a mortal danger to Israel, President George W. Bush said yesterday, adding that any such threat would be dealt with by the US and its allies.																								In strongly worded remarks before an audience of newspaper editors and publishers, the Republican President pressed the secretive leadership of the Islamic republic to heed US and European demands not to pursue a nuclear weapons programme.																								It would be intolerable to peace and stability in West Asia if they get a nuclear weapon, particularly since their stated objective is the destruction of Israel, Bush said in answer to a question about international cooperation against militant attacks.																								The development of a nuclear weapon in Iran is intolerable. And a programme is intolerable. Otherwise they will be dealt with, starting through the UN. The US accuses Iran of pursuing a nuclear weapons programme, but Tehran says its nuclear ambitions are confined to generating electricity. Washington hardliners have been pressing for UN sanctions against the Islamic state.

 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 No limits on tobacco suit penalties
																								Washington, May 25 (Reuters): A federal judge today refused to limit $280 billion in penalties the government is seeking from tobacco companies as part of the largest civil racketeering trial in history, sending their shares reeling.																								US district judge Gladys Kessler denied the companies motion to disallow the governments bid for disgorgement of some of their past profits. 																								The suit filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 is scheduled to go to trial in September. It accuses tobacco companies of deliberately misleading the public about the risks of smoking in a conspiracy going back to the 1950s.																								In her ruling, Kessler said the question of what penalties, if any, should be imposed on the industry should be determined at trial. Spokesmen for both Altria and R.J. Reynolds said the companies disagreed with the ruling and were considering appealing it directly to a federal appeals court. However, the two expressed confidence they would ultimately prevail. We have no doubt that once we get to trial, the evidence will demonstrate that this claim is absurd, said a spokesman.

 Wednesday, July 14, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Crafty chip																																	 Mexico City, July 13 (Reuters): Mexicos attorney general said yesterday he had had a microchip inserted under the skin of one of his arms to give him access to a new crime database and also enable him to be traced if he is ever abducted.																																	Attorney general Rafael Macedo said a number of his staff had also been fitted with chips which will give them exclusive and secure access to a national, computerised database for crime investigators that went live yesterday.																																	The system is here and I already have it. Its solely for access, for safety and so that I can be located at any moment wherever I am, he said. 																													 																Spa in soup																																	 Tokyo (Reuters): One of Japans best known spa resorts is in hot water after being caught adding chemical bath salts to keep the famous milky colour of its curative springs. The Shirahone spa, deep in the mountains of central Japans Nagano prefecture, has been known for centuries for the supposed ability of its milky white waters to alleviate stomach and other ailments. But with the water slowly losing its natural colour, several spa operators in the area began secretly adding bath salts seven years ago to keep up appearances.																													 																Sick shooter																																	 London (Reuters): A British man who accidentally shot himself in the testicles after drinking 15 pints of beer was jailed for five years on Tuesday for possessing an illegal firearm. David Walker, 28, was arguing with a friend at a pub in South Yorkshire, northern England, when he went home to get his sawn-off shotgun, which he jammed into his trousers. But as he walked back to the pub, the gun went off, blasting pellets into his testicles. Doctors later removed what remained of his testicles. Walker admitted possessing a weapon at a hearing in Sheffield.

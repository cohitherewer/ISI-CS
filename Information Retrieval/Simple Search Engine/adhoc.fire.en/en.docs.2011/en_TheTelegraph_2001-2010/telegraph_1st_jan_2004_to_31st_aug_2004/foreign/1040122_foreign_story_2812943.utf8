 IMTIAZ GUL				 	 A policeman shows bomb-making material recovered from a house in Karachi after a raid. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, Jan. 21: Pakistan today released three nuclear scientists who were questioned over the alleged transfer of nuclear technology to Iran.																								There were four officials investigated in the first phase and we have released all except Dr Farooq Ahmed. Now their movement is no longer restricted, Pakistans information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said at a press briefing.																								Dr Ahmed was among the three scientists who had been detained for debriefing in November, last year. Rashid said nine people, including two retired brigadiers and a retired major, are still being questioned. He added that the debriefings will conclude within a weeks time. No official or scientist who have been released will be required for future debriefings nor will there movements be restricted.																								Families and friends of officials being debriefed claim at least 25 scientists and administrative officials of the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) are being detained over allegations that some may have supplied nuclear information and materials to Iran and North Korea. Debriefings of scientists at KRL, Pakistans premier uranium enrichment facility, had begun in December, last year, based on information from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iran. The KRL founder and the pioneer of Pakistans nuclear programme, Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, was also grilled.																								However, Rashid clarified that all detained officials were either retired scientists or army officers who had been associated with the countrys 30-year-old nuclear programme.																								To a question, he denied Pakistans involvement in nuclear proliferation, saying: The debriefings reflect Pakistans responsible attitude to the issue.																								He also denied press reports that a former chief of army staff General Mirza Aslam Beg had also been questioned during the debriefings. The reports were part of a malicious propaganda campaign unleashed to malign Pakistan as an irresponsible state, Rashid said, adding that our record in the nuclear arena is impeccable.																								The families of detained officials today demonstrated in front of the Pakistan parliament to protest against the illegal arrests. 																								Yes, we have filed petition in the court of law against the detentions but it (protest) is a reflection of our anger, Saima Aadil, daughter of Dr Nazir Ahmed, said. Dr Ahmad was picked up from his residence over the weekend for questioning. 																								We will not trust official statements until our father and other officials are released, Saima said.																								The Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court has summoned the ISI chief, home secretary and Pakistan army spokesperson on January 23 in habeas corpus petitions filed by the families of two detained KRL officials to explain why the detainees have not been produced before the judicial magistrate.

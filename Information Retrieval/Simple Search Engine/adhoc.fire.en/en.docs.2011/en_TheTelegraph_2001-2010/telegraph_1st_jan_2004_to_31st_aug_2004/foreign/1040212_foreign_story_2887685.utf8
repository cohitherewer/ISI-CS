 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Murder blows up in Pervez face
 Multan, Feb. 11 (Reuters):  A Pakistani villager shot dead his sister and brother-in-law  for marrying without family consent, police said today,  the latest in an endless string of so-called honour killings  in rural areas.																								The murders took place yesterday  the same day that President Pervez Musharraf vowed to deal sternly with perpetrators of honour killings, where men kill female relatives ostensibly to protect the familys reputation. 																								Police said 21-year-old Sardaran Mai eloped with her lover, Sabir Hussain, about eight month ago and married him after her parents had tried to force her to wed someone else. Local police official Mir Ali said the couple returned to their village near the central town of Dera Ghazi Khan a few months later after Mai had made peace with her parents.																								But brother Mohammad Rafiq was still angry. Rafiq broke into the house of his sister yesterday and opened fire, killing her and her husband, Ali said.																								Hundreds of women are killed every year in feudal rural Pakistan for offences deemed to have offended family honour, including adultery, marrying without the families permission and failing to bring home an adequate dowry.																								In a separate incident in Punjab, a man reportedly axed to death his 17-year-old sister and wounded another sister on Monday over suspicions they were having affairs. Police said they had arrested suspects in both cases. Tribal militia																								A tribal council in remote western Pakistan is to raise a militia to hunt down foreign Islamic militants hiding in the rugged region, local officials said.																								Pakistans mountain region bordering Afghanistan is thought to be a haven for al Qaida and Taliban fugitives, including Osama bin Laden, because they enjoy massive support among the local Pashtun population.

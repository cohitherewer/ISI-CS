 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 US keeps Pak promise
																								Islamabad, June 16: President George W. Bush today named Pakistan a major non-Nato ally of the US, making it easier for the country to acquire US arms.																								The announcement rewards Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf for supporting the US-led war on terrorism.																								Secretary of state Colin Powell told Musharraf in March that his country would get the designation. A memorandum issued by Bush today made it official.																								The status of major non-Nato ally is also enjoyed by Australia, Bahrain, Israel, South Korea and Morocco. As a major non-Nato ally, Pakistan could use US funding to lease some defence items and would become eligible for loans of military supplies for research and development projects.																								It would also become eligible to buy depleted uranium ammunition, to have US-owned military stockpiles on its territory outside American bases and to receive US military training on easier financial terms. However, the designation does not confer the mutual defence and security guarantees enjoyed by Nato members. 																								The US imposed sanctions on Pakistan after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998 but most were lifted in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the US, when Pakistan became a key ally in the war on terror.																								Given Pakistans porous border with Afghanistan, its help is seen as vital if the US is to catch Osama bin Laden and defeat his al Qaida network.																								Many in Pakistan have not forgiven the US for refusing to deliver 28 F-16 fighters in the 1990s because of worry over Pakistans nuclear programme. The planes had been paid for, but it took eight years for the money to be refunded.																								India opposes the sale of F-16s to Pakistan and the decision to grant Islamabad major non-Nato ally status could trouble New Delhi, which does not have that status, although it has growing military contacts with Washington as part of their overall strategic partnership.																								India is one of our closest allies, a senior Bush administration official said. We have wonderful bilateral relations with India and we will continue to do so.Waziristan attack																								Despite army claims that they have secured full control of the Shakai area  a hideout for foreign militant in South Waziristan  military outposts in the area came under attack by alleged terrorists today and yesterday.																								A day after troops shot and killed a Chechen militant and his three accomplices at Jhandola on the outskirts of South Waziristan, two suspected foreign terrorists and a Pakistani soldier were killed in a shootout early today after 70 armed separatists attacked a military checkpost at Lada, 45 km northeast of Wana. 																								Chief military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said on Monday that the military operation in Wana was over and the security forces were in full control of the Shakai area, north of Wana. Officials claim hundreds of pro-al Qaida and Taliban militants  Chechens, Uzbeks, and Afghans  are hiding in the Shakai area.																								The attack was repulsed during which two foreign militants were killed and one soldier lost his life, the official said, without providing further details.																								Sources in Wana said the encounter began with a rocket attack on the Lada fort in which at least five soldiers were seriously wounded, in addition to the deaths of the two foreign militants. Another paramilitary base in Sarwaki, about 100 km from Wana, was also hit with a rocket early this morning with no details on casualties, the sources said.																								Lada is situated near the Shakai Hills, where Pakistani forces remain entrenched after a week of operations that reportedly killed 70 militants and destroyed their hideouts. Yesterday, Pakistani security forces shot and killed the Chechen militant and wounded his three colleagues in a pre-dawn shootout in the outskirts of South Waziristan after they refused to undergo a routine check and opened fire on the troops.																								Pakistani authorities on Monday ended their five-day operation in the Shakai valley and claimed that one of the main sanctuaries of foreign militants had been destroyed.																								A spy plane hovered low above the mountains north and west of Wana, where the army sent several vehicles yesterday to hunt militants, witnesses said. 					 AGENCIES AND IMTIAZ GUL

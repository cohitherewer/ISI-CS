(AFP)																								Washington, March 4 (Agencies): The US had intelligence warnings of the attacks that killed more than 140 people in Iraq, and probably prevented even greater carnage with special operations raids the night before on operatives of Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, the top US commander in Iraq said today.																								 General John Abizaid said US and Iraqi forces foiled a third planned attack in Basra and thwarted plans to attack several prominent Shia personalities.																								I believe the plan was for even greater carnage, and I think that joint action between Americans and Iraqis prevented that from happening, and we had better cooperation among various groups throughout Iraq in terms of security than is widely reported, he said.																								 The attacks bore the hallmarks of Zarqawi, hewing to a strategy for igniting a civil war between Iraqs Sunnis and Shias that was laid out in an intercepted letter attributed to the Jordanian extremists, he said.																								The general said coordination between the Islamic militant and the former intelligence carried a lot of danger for the force. Abizaid said that at least six suicide attackers, and possibly more, took part in the attacks, which he said killed more than 140 people.																								 Abizaid said security inside Karbala had been left to the police, civil defence and local authorities since the early days of the US occupation because of sensitivities about the presence of US troops near the holy sites. Swipe at Blair																								Former British minister Clare Short accused Prime Minister Tony Blair today of making political mistakes over Iraq and failing to prepare for the aftermath of war. Her remarks, the latest in a series of attacks on her former boss, came as Blair prepares a key speech on security and war in the Gulf.																								Short caused a storm last week by saying Britain spied on Kofi Annan ahead of the war.

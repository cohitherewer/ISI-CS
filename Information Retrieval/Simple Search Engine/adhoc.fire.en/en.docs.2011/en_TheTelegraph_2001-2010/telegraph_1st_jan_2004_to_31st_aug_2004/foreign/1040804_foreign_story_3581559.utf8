				 	 John Kerry and his wife Teresa on the deck of the Lake Express high-speed ferry that runs from Muskegon, Michigan, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (Reuters)																								Milwaukee, August 3 (Reuters): Teresa Heinz Kerry, the outspoken wife of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, pulled no punches yesterday in telling a rally what she thought of the Bush administration  hell.																								And later, discussing the war in Iraq, Heinz Kerry subtly questioned Republican President George W. Bushs intellect, saying: Its vital for anyone with intelligence to acknowledge mistakes and change positions  hello.																								When a Bush supporter with a bullhorn shouted: Four more years from the back of a large crowd packed into a downtown Milwaukee park, Heinz Kerry, who was introducing her husband, responded: They want four more years of hell.																								Three more months!, she declared, referring to the November 2 presidential election.																								Last week at the Democratic Convention in Boston, where Kerry formally accepted his partys nomination as Bushs opponent, Heinz Kerry briefly caused a stir when she told a reporter to shove it.																								She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth and shes pretty quick on her feet too, the Massachusetts senator said when he took the microphone in Milwaukee.																								Thats why America is going to embrace her and shell make a spectacular first lady of the United States of America. Kerrys turn in the spotlight at last weeks convention did not give him much of a bounce in opinion polls,.

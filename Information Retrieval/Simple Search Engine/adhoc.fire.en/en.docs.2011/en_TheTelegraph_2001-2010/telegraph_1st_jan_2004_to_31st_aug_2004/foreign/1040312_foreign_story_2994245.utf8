 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 US bets on Musharraf getting Osama
																								Washington, March 11 (PTI): The US administration has placed a huge bet on Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, relying on him to help hunt down Osama bin Laden and root out other Islamic terrorists inspite of the illicit nuclear sale and Islamic parties in the country, a US daily said today.																								The strategy has paid off in the short term, with hundreds of terrorists arrested, but the gains have involved a delicate diplomatic trade off for Pakistans illicit nuclear sale, and its Islamic parties are a worry for the US, the Wall Street Journal writes.																								Top American officials view of Musharraf, says the paper, boils down to this: though he is not perfect, he has been a firm and reliable ally. But the US does not have a clear answer to a question that is growing more urgent: how will Pakistan be ruled once General Musharraf leaves office? 																								The biggest long-term risk of the Bush administratons policy towards Musharraf, says the paper, involves nuclear proliferation. The assertion that A.Q. Khan illegally sold nuclear technology to North Korea, Libya and Iran without the knowldge of Musharraf and other military officials, says the paper, is doubted by many.																								US officials say they are concerned for Musharrafs life as he cracks down on militants and widens the bin Laden hunt. Among those arrested in the attempted assassination of the General in December was a member of an al Qaida-linked terrorist group. 																								Hundreds of armed tribesmen, poised to launch a hunt today for seven men accused of sheltering terrorists, postponed the search to mourn the death of one of their members, a tribal elder said. 																								Ahmedzai Wazir tribe members were to begin the hunt for the fugitives in Azam Warsak, part of the south Waziristan tribal region.

 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Iran holds out hope for release of UK men
				 	 A picture taken from Iranian television shows blindfolded British troops marching on the banks of the Shatt al-Arab waterway between Iran and Iraq. (AFP)																								Tehran, June 23 (Reuters): Eight British servicemen seized in Iran after their boats strayed into the Islamic Republics waters will be freed later, Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi said.																								The six Marines and two sailors were taken on Monday, increasing diplomatic tensions between the countries. It became clear for us that the detained British military men had no ill-intention and they will be released tomorrow, state television quoted Kharrazi as saying.																								Although the Arabic-language Al Alam satellite television channel said there was a possibility the handover could be delayed by a day if all the officials are not in place in time, Britain said it still expected the men to be freed sooner.																								The Iranian government has given us confirmation of their intention to release the men today, a British foreign office spokeswoman said.																								A delegation of British diplomats has already arrived in Khuzestan in southwest Iran for the handover and were headed to Bandar Mahshahr, a petrochemical centre. We have just landed in Ahvaz, a diplomat said, speaking from the provincial capital of Khuzestan, the oil-rich province on the Iraqi border. They travelled from the Iranian capital Tehran.																								The Iranian TV report said an Iranian delegation headed by Ali Ahani, in charge of European and American affairs at the foreign ministry, would arrive in the area later.																								The report, quoting its correspondent, said the servicemen were from special forces in the British Navy, adding their three boats and equipment including satellite positioning systems, cameras and detailed maps would stay in Iranian naval custody.																								Media reports that Iranian officials had threatened to prosecute the men revealed deep political divisions within the country, political analysts said 																								This was kind of a power display by part of the system that wants Iran to be isolated, said one political analyst. Talking about their possible prosecution and then suddenly freeing them, means that the system faces serious problems for making decisions, the analyst said.																								Al Alam showed pictures of the eight detainees blindfolded and walking in single file on a beach next to what appeared to be the wreck-infested Shatt al-Arab waterway along the Iraqi border.																								I offer my apologies to my family and the British government and the Iranian people for making this mistake, one of the men told the station.																								The official Irna news agency quoted a source as saying an inquiry had found the men had entered Iranian waters by mistake. A British military source acknowledged the men may have strayed into Iranian waters in bad weather in confined straits.																								The men had been delivering a small patrol boat to Iraqi river police. Britains ministry of defence said the men were carrying only their personal weapons.																								While deeply opposed to the US-led war in Iraq, Iran has in the past turned a blind eye to foreign aircraft and boats on its western border.India assurance																								India has assured the US that its military cooperation with Iran is not expected to reach the level where it would be a matter of concern for Washington or any other country.																								This was stated today in Washington by assistant secretary of state Christina Rocca at a hearing on South Asia by a subcommittee of the international relations committee headed by Republican Congressman James Leach. She said the US expected continuing close cooperation with India under the new government headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.																								The issue of Iran was raised by Gary Ackerman, a former co-chairman of the India Caucus, who referred to a report in Defence News concerning a high-level Iranian delegation visit to New Delhi to implement a strategic cooperation deal and wanted to know if the US has raised the issue with India of its military cooperation with Iran.

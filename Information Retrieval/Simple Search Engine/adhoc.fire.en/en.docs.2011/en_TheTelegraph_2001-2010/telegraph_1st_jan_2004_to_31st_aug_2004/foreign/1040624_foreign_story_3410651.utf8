 Thursday, June 24, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Sweaty deity																																	 Kathmandu, June 23 (Reuters): Priests offered special prayers as hundreds of devotees thronged a shrine in a remote Nepali village today to appease a Hindu deity after its stone idol began sweating, witnesses said.																																	Sweating of the deity at the temple in Dolakha, 140 km east of the capital, has in the past been followed by major political changes or tragedies in the worlds only Hindu kingdom, villagers say.																																	The prayers are to spare the country and the people from disasters or calamities, devotee Dambar Bahadur Shrestha said when reached by telephone. 																																	The special prayers were offered after devotees saw a vaporous substance on the stone idol of the god Bhimeshwor, revered as Lord Shiva. Goats were also sacrificed as part of the prayers.																																	Nepali newspapers said the last time the Lord Bhimeshwor idol sweated was in January 2001, six months before Crown Prince Dipendra shot dead his father, King Birendra, and eight other royals before turning the gun on himself in a drunken rage.																													 																Ape escapeBerlin (Reuters): A male gorilla escaped from his cage in the Berlin zoo and sent terrified visitors running for cover, the zoo said on Wednesday. Eight-year-old Bokito, who weighs 130 kg and stands more than two metres tall, climbed over the top of the glass wall surrounding his outside enclosure and roamed the zoo on Tuesday. Berlin newspapers showed shaky photos of the gorilla taken by an 18-year-old visitor who recorded how Bokito was grabbed by two burly zookeepers and marched back to his enclosure. Suddenly hysterical children and grown-ups came running towards us. They were all running towards the exit. Behind them we saw the huge ape leaping towards us on all fours, the visitor, Husam Shawabkeh, said.																													 																Doc DylanLondon (Reuters): Iconic folk-rock singer Bob Dylan will collect an honorary degree from Scotlands St Andrews University  only the second time he has accepted such an accolade in his 40-year career. The 63-year-old American who penned such classics as Like a Rolling Stone and Mr Tambourine Man will be made a Doctor of Music. Dylans other honorary degree, from Princeton University, was awarded in 1970 at a time when his anti-establishment songs had made him a firm favourite amongst students. Neil Corcoran, Professor of English at St Andrews, told BBC Radio: We are very honoured and flattered that he should be doing this for us. The university wanted to honour Dylan for his outstanding contribution to musical and literary culture, he said.

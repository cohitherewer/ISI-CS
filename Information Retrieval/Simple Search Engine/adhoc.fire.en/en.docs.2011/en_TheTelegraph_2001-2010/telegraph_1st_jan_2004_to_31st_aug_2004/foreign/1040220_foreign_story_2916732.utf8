 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Crackdown on reformists
 															- Hardliners strike on eve of polls 				 	 A couple mourn for their dead brother in Nishapur, Iran, who was killed after a fuel-laden, runaway train exploded on Wednesday. Grieving mothers on Thursday sifted through charred bodies in Nishapur for their loved ones as the toll from the blast rose to 320. (Reuters)																								Tehran, Feb. 19 (Reuters): A hardline crackdown on Irans reform movement widened today on the eve of a disputed parliamentary election when prosecutors sealed a campaign office of the main reformist party and blocked its news website.																								It followed the closure of the two most outspoken reformist newspapers yesterday for daring to report an unprecedented scathing open letter to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei by dozens of reformist lawmakers banned from tomorrows poll. 																								They are blocking our channels of communication with the people, Ali Shakourirad, one of the deputies and a leading member of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, said. The party is boycotting the election, which it says was rigged when an unelected clerical watchdog disqualified more than 2,500 mainly reformist candidates. Another 1,179 contenders have since withdrawn from the race.																								Criticising the absolute Islamic leader is an offence, and the Supreme National Security Council had ordered newspapers not to report the six-page letter in which deputies accused Khamenei of presiding over a system that trampled on peoples rights. The Yas-e No and Sharq dailies, and the Rouydad website were shut down when they disobeyed. Without directly mentioning the latest crackdown, pro-reform President Mohammad Khatami warned of the risk of despotism. In a speech to intellectuals and scientists today, carried by the official Irna news agency, Khatami said freedom meant people had the right to choose. Despotism and imposition of ideas will bring no result except corruption, but freedom and an open atmosphere, while it may do some harm, will cultivate virtue, he said.																								Issa Saharkhiz, a reformist journalist and former deputy culture minister, said he expected hardliners to ban more newspapers and possibly outlaw the Participation Front, led by the Presidents brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, and another reformist group, the Mujahideen of the Islamic Revolution Party.

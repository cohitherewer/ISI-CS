 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Scientists create new form of matter
																								Washington, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Scientists said yesterday they had created a new form of matter and predicted it could help lead to the next generation of superconductors for use in electricity generation, more efficient trains and countless other applications.																								The new matter form is called a fermionic condensate and it is the sixth known form of matter  after gases, solids, liquids, plasma and a Bose-Einstein condensate, created only in 1995.																								What weve done is create this new exotic form of matter, Deborah Jin, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technologys joint lab with the University of Colorado, who led the study, said.																								It is a scientific breakthrough in providing a new type of quantum mechanical behaviour, added Jin.																								Jin and her colleagues cloud of supercooled potassium atoms is one step closer to an everyday, usable superconductor  a material that conducts electricity without losing any of its energy.																								It is related to a Bose-Einstein condensate, Jin said. Its not a superconductor but it is really something in between these two that may help us in science link these two interesting behaviours. 																								And other researchers may find practical applications.																								If you had a superconductor you could transmit electricity with no losses, Jin said.																								 Right now something like 10 per cent of all electricity we produce in the US is lost. It heats up wires. It doesnt do anybody any good.

 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 China rebels held before Tiananmen anniversary
																								Beijing, May 27 (Reuters): Police in China have placed prominent dissidents under house arrest to prevent them from publicly commemorating the 15th anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen Square crackdown, they said today.																								Police started to surrounded the residences of known dissidents in the past week, preventing them from meeting journalists or carrying out rituals to honour the dead, the activists said.																								Liu Xiaobo, a former university lecturer who supported the protests and helped negotiate safe passage for some students out of the square in 1989, cannot leave his home in northern Beijing, he said. I cant go anywhere. There are five or six young men guarding me all the time, he said before his telephone line was cut off.																								On the night of June 3-4, 1989, the Peoples Liberation Army stormed central Beijing in tanks, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators and bystanders.																								Hu Jia, a 30-year-old activist for AIDS and environmental issues, has been under house arrest for nearly a week and has tried in vain to fight his way out.																								I was no match for the six of them, he said by mobile phone. Calls to his home telephone have been repeatedly cut off, though Hu said he could surf the Internet. He was detained by police three times in April for trying to place flowers on Tiananmen Square in honour of the fallen students and Hu Yaobang, the reformist Communist Party chief whose death in 1989 sparked the democracy protests.																								Police said Hu would be freed on May 29 as long as he leaves Beijing with his 68-year-old mother and two police officers on a vacation, he said. Hu was told he would be allowed to return to the capital on June 10.																								My mother is there as a hostage. They know I wont try to escape without her. This is despicable. She has heart problems and is afraid for me, he said.

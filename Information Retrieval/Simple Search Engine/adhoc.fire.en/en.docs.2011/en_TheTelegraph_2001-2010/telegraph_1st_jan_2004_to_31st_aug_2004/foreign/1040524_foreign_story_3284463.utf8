The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 20 die in Iraq mosque raid
																								Kufa, May 23 (Reuters): US forces and Iraqi soldiers launched a major offensive against a Shia militia today, killing about 20 in one raid on a mosque and pounding other positions around the holy city of Najaf.																								The fiercest fighting in the area for weeks killed at least 34 people and wounded dozens, including civilians, overnight and seemed a definitive response to a tentative truce offer made by an aide to the cleric leading the Mehdi Army, Moqtada al-Sadr.																								Pools of blood lay inside the green-domed Sahla mosque, one of three main shrines in Kufa near Najaf, and spent cartridges littered the courtyard. A tank had smashed down the door of the building, and the US army said weapons were found inside.																								It said American soldiers had not entered the mosque, instead an Iraqi counter-terrorism force had been sent in.																								We have no intention of entering the shrines, Major General Martin Dempsey, commander of the US-led force fighting Sadrs militia in its key strongholds, said in a statement.																								Sadr, a young firebrand preacher from a respected clerical dynasty, has irritated moderate leaders of Iraqs majority Shias with the use of holy places in his revolt. Shia leaders have also demanded the Americans show restraint in the shrine cities. The US military says it respects the sites but will attack mosques used in combat.																								Washingtons main military ally in Iraq, Britain, has voiced disquiet about heavy-handed US tactics, according to a foreign office memo leaked to the Sunday Times newspaper.																								London officials were also quoted complaining that the scandal over US troops abusing Iraqi prisoners had sapped the moral authority of the occupying forces, who are due to hand back sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government on June 30.																								An estimated 20 Mehdi militia were killed after firing on coalition forces during a raid on the Sahla mosque in Kufa, a US army spokesman said. No US casualties were reported.																								Staff at the main hospital in Najaf said they had taken in 14 dead and 37 wounded, mostly civilians.																								About 100 Kufa residents gathered to inspect the damage.																								I feel humiliated, said Ali Wasi. Our sanctity has been violated. These houses of prayer are the most valuable things we own, for Shiites. I will resist them until the last drop of blood in my body, he said, speaking in the mosques courtyard.																								The offensive came hours Sadrs aide floated a vague truce offer for the two main holy cities, Najaf and Kerbala. A coalition spokesman said Sadr must first give himself up and disb-and his force which began the revolt last month.																								Near the Sunni flashpoint city of Falluja west of Bagh- dad, a coordinated bomb and rocket-propelled grenade att- ack killed two US troops, soldi-ers who witnessed the attack said. An uneasy truce has been in force in the town since marines pulled out.

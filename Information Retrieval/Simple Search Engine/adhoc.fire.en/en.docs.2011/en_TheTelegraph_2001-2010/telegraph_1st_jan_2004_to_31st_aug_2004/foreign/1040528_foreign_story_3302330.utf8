																								Los Angeles, May 26 (Reuters): Film legend Elizabeth Taylor has asked a judge to declare her the lawful owner of a Van Gogh painting that heirs of a former owner say was stolen by the Nazis.																								In a federal lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Los Angeles, the Oscar-winning actress said she bought View of the Asylum and Chapel at Saint-Remy, painted in 1889, at a Sothebys auction in London in 1963. The lawsuit said four people claiming to be heirs of the paintings former owner, Margarete Mauthner, contacted Taylors manager to demand its return or the proceeds from its sale.																								Although the claimants believe Mauthner, a Berlin resident, lost the painting to the Nazis, evidence shows that she sold it in 1933 for financial reasons, the lawsuit said. According to the catalog from the 1963 auction, the painting passed from Mauthner to two reputable galleries before it was sold to a German Jew, Alfred Wolf, who himself fled the Nazis in 1933 for Buenos Aires, the lawsuit said.																								Mauthners sale of her Van Gogh collection to finance her familys emigration to South Africa also was documented in a 2001 German book, the lawsuit said. Taylor bought the painting for $257,000 from Wolfs estate and tried unsuccessfully to sell it in 1990 for $10 million, the suit said.

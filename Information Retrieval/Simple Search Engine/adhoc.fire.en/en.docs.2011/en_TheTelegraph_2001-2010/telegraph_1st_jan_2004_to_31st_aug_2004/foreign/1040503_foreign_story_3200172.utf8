 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Bid to resume Lanka talks
																								Colombo, May 2 (Reuters): Norwegian peace envoys met Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga today in a fresh bid to jump-start stalled peace talks between the government and Tamil rebels and end decades of ethnic bloodshed.																								Both the Norwegian embassy and the government described the closed-door meeting, which lasted several hours, as constructive and said the talks covered all aspects of the peace process.																								It might take some time before the parties are in a position to return to the negotiation table and in the meantime it is important for both sides to respect and abide by the cease-fire agreement..., the embassy said in a short statement.																								The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been battling since 1983 for a homeland in the north and east of the country, which is predominantly Sinhalese.																								Norway brokered a truce between the two sides in 2002 but pulled its peace team out of the Indian Ocean island in November, saying Colombo had to make up its mind whether its President or Prime Minister was in charge of the peace process.																								Direct negotiations to end the war have been on hold for a year amid the bitter power struggle between Kumaratunga and her rival, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.																								Kumaratungas party defeated Wickremesinghe in elections last month but only managed a minority government, raising doubts about whether it has enough power to revive the peace process.																								Norwegian deputy foreign minister Vidar Helgesen, peace envoy Erik Solheim and ambassador Hans Brattskar met Kumaratunga at a presidential retreat in the lush tea-growing region of Nuwara Eliya, about 180 km east of Colombo.																								Discussions focused on a range of issues related to the modalities and substance of the negotiations process and the need to commence development in the north and east without delay, with full participation of the LTTE, the government said.																								Solheim will travel to the rebel-held north to meet the Tigers tomorrow and brief the President on his return.																								Before anything else can happen, there is a need for relationship building as well as clarification on the parameters of Norways involvement and how to proceed with future talks, said Jehan Perera of the National Peace Council. The last exchanges between the President and the Norwegians were not very positive.																								Last year Kumaratunga demanded Norway fire the head of a body overseeing the truce. Others criticised the Norwegians, with one leader of her party calling them salmon-eating busybodies.

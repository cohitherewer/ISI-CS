 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 US troops in Pakistan by mistake
																								Islamabad, May 4 (Reuters): US troops hunting al Qaida and Taliban militants crossed over from Afghanistan into Pakistan to search a Pashtun tribal village in a rare violation of the border, Pakistans military spokesman said today.																								The incident took place on May 2.																								The troops searched shops and a petrol pump in the village of Alwara Mandi, in North Waziristan, one of Pakistans semi-autonomous tribal regions, during a night-time operation, according to Pakistans Major-General Shaukat Sultan. 																								Eyewitnesses said 60 US troops were involved in the operation. The village lies just 200 metres inside Pakistan, and the soldiers returned to Afghan soil immediately after they were told that they were on the wrong side of the border. The moment they were informed they went back. They stayed for no longer than 25 minutes, Sultan said.

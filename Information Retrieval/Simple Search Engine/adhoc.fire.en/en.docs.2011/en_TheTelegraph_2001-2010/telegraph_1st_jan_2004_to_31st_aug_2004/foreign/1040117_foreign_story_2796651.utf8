The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Covered-up Mariah for Malaysia
 Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 16 (AFP):  Mariah Carey will hold her concert in Malaysia next month  despite Islamic pressure for it to be cancelled but she  cannot wear sexy or revealing attire under strict stage  rules, officials and organisers said today.																								 The Opposition Islamic Party (PAS) has called for Careys concert at a Kuala Lumpur stadium on February 22 to be cancelled, saying it would encourage moral degradation and was also disrespectful to Muslims because it coincided with an Islamic religious holiday.																								 But Eric Chen, spokesman for concert organiser Galaxy Production, said the date of Careys concert has been fixed much earlier as part of her Charmbracelet world tour and was not intended to offend Muslims. He said the singer, who would also be performing in other Muslim nations including neighbouring Indonesia, would respect local sensitivities and abide by dressing guidelines issued by the tourism ministry.

 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 No US talks: Iran
																								Tehran, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Iran said today it had no plans to start talks with its long-time adversary the US, and that American policy towards the Islamic Republic must change.																								US secretary of state Colin Powell said yesterday Irans acceptance of US aid after the Bam earthquake had opened up opportunities for dialogue between the foes although there was no reason to expect a quick political rapprochement. Now there is no plan for starting negotiations, said Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi. US policy towards Iran must change, getting rid of its hostile atmosphere.																								We have said that it is important for the negotiations between the countries to be based on mutual respect and to take place on an equal footing, he added. In the aftermath of the December 26 earthquake in the city of Bam that killed more than 30,000 people, the US relief effort was seen as prompting moves towards improved relations between Washington and Tehran. Washington broke ties with Iran shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution when radical students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 hostages for 444 days.																								The US has accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, of supporting anti-Israeli Islamic militants and of fomenting violence in Iraq. US President George W. Bush said it was part of the axis of evilalong with North Korea and Iraq under Saddam Hussein.

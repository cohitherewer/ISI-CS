 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Impure Pak water kills 14
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Karachi, May 27: To err is human but the release of contaminated water, which killed at least 14 people in Pakistans southern city of Hyderabad, is simply too cruel to be ignored.																								Thousands of people, including men, women and children, are still being treated for gastroenteritis, acute dehydration and eye and skin infections, caused by the contaminated water.																								It all began two weeks ago after the local irrigation department had discharged contaminated water from the overflowing Manchhar Lake, 130 km north of Hyderabad, into the Indus river that supplies water to the city of around 1.4 million people. 																								Laboratory tests later showed, the water was contaminated that even a local soft drinks manufacturer halted production saying the water being supplied could not be used.																								Kafeel Ahmad Kanzada, a Water and Sanitation and Authority (WASA) official, said that water samples at the filter plant revealed high levels of total dissolved salts (TDS), hardness and chlorides, making it unfit for human consumption.																								While WASA is not ready to accept responsibility of supplying contaminated water as the authoritys filtration plants were not capable of treating saline water, the local irrigation department also is keen on washing its hand off the affair.																								The irrigation department has been releasing additional water from the lake for the last four years. The river has diluted the contaminated lake water, but this time the level of water in the river was low and the pollution was directly supplied to Hyderbad.																								Since the introduction of the Right Bank Outfall Drain project in 1976, marine life in the lake has been wiped out, ruining the livelihoods of local residents and fishermen, a senior official working on the project said.																								The lake is no more used for fishing nor for any tourist activity which was our bread and butter, said local Maula Buksh.																								A good number of families have moved from the area to find alternate means. 																								 In the interim, authorities have not supplied alternative safe water to the city. As a result, people continue to fall ill. 																								Enraged people staged a sit-in on the National Highway on Tuesday for hours to protest against the careless attitude of the irrigation department and the acute shortage of drinking water in the city. 																								Authorities now say that the supply of contaminated water to the city of Hyderabad has been stopped and fresh water introduced from the Sukkar Barrage, 491 km from Karachi.																								Pakistan has urged US forces hunting al Qaida fighters in Afghanistan to avoid any further trespassing into its territory.

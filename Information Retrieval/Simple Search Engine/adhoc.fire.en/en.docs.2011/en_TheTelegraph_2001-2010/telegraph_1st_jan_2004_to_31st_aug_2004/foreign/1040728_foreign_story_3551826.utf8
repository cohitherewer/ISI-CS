 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Palestine PM withdraws resignation
																								Ramallah, July 27 (Reuters): Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie withdrew his resignation today after Yasser Arafat granted him some powers to carry out reforms, easing a paralysing leadership crisis, officials said.																								Quries chief of staff said he had won effective control over police and internal security agencies, part of a security apparatus whose chaos and corruption is seen by international mediators as an obstacle to peacemaking with Israel.																								Arafats move, initially disclosed by a pro-reform committee of legislators after a meeting with the President, came after an unprecedented explosion of unrest over high-level inaction on demands for anti-corruption reforms.But Arafat, a former guerrilla leader, has not honoured similar promises in the past. Todays deal leaves him in charge of national security and intelligence which encompass the bulk of Palestinian security personnel.																								The President rejected my resignation and I will (now) comply, Qurie said after 10 days of turmoil that raised fears of a descent into anarchy in the West Bank and Gaza. I hope I will be up to this confidence and cooperate with (Arafat) in carrying out this very difficult responsibility, Qurie said.

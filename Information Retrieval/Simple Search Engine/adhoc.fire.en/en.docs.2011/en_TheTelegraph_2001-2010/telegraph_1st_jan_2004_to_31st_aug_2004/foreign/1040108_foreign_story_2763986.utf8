The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 08, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Phone problem																																	 Washington, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Motorists soon will have to holster their cell phones while driving in the US capital or face a fine under legislation approved yesterday by the district of Columbia City Council.																						The measure, effective from July 1, would limit cellphone use by drivers to those who use hands-free devices or people making emergency calls; violators would be fined $100, local media reported.																																	Mayor Anthony Williams supports the measure and will sign it into law, The Washington Post reported, citing a mayoral spokesman.																																	Only New York has a state-wide prohibition against the use of hand-held cellphones while driving. 																						Recent highway safety research has found that cellphones, children, rubbernecking and adjusting the radio or CD player created distractions that contributed to accidents.																																	However, large surveys for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year found few drivers considered those activities potentially dangerous.																													 																Super snake Kendal, Indonesia (Reuters): Its still  a big snake, just not a record-breaker. When a recreation  park in Indonesia put a huge reticulated python on show  last week, keepers insisted to reporters it was 15 metres  long. That made it the longest ever caught. But amid growing  scepticism of the claim, a photographer working for Reuters  returned to the Curugsewu park in the small central Java  town of Kendal on Wednesday with a measuring tape. The snakes  true length  around 6.5 metres. I have no idea why the  snake has shrunk, said one keeper when asked about the  discrepancy, as the snake lounged on a tree branch inside  its cage. According to the Guinness World Records,  the longest discovered snake was also a reticulated python  from Indonesia. It was 10 metres long when found in Sulawesi  island in 1912. In 2002, Samantha, a snake measuring eight  metres and which was dubbed the largest in captivity, died  in the Bronx Zoo in New York. Samantha came from Indonesias  side of Borneo island.

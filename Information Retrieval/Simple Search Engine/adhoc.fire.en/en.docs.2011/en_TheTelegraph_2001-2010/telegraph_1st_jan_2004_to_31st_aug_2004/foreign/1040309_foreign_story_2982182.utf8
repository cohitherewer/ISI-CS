 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Iraq finally signs interim constitution
																								Baghdad, March 8 (Reuters): Iraqs governing council signed an interim constitution today after weeks of wrangling, in a key step towards a planned handover of sovereignty by US-led occupying powers to Iraqis on June 30.																								The signing took place at a hastily arranged ceremony in Baghdad after Shia members of the 25-member council persuaded Iraqs foremost cleric at the weekend to go along with the document despite reservations.																								Just before the signing, guerrillas fired mortars at a Baghdad police station, wounding three civilians and two policemen. Another missile hit a civilian house. Yesterday, insurgents fired multiple rockets at the Baghdad headquarters of the US-led administration but nobody was seriously hurt.																								The signing had been delayed twice  first by bomb attacks on Shias last Tuesday that killed at least 181 people and then by last-minute Shia reservations that forced a high-profile ceremony on Friday to be abandoned.																								Adnan Pachachi, a senior member of the governing council, said at todays ceremony that the event was a great and historic day for Iraq. Iraqs US governor, Paul Bremer, also hailed the agreement and noted the difficulties it had faced. We are witnessing the birth of democracy and birth is painful, as weve learned over the last few evenings, he told the council. Not everyone got everything they wanted in this law  thats the way of democracy.																								Representatives of the five Shias who backed out on Friday spent the weekend in the holy city of Najaf talking with top clerics including Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who wields immense influence over Iraqs 60 per cent Shia majority.

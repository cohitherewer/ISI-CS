 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Diplomat bomb explodes on Blair
 AMIT ROY				 	 Tony Blair speaks on immigration at the London Business School. (AFP)																								London, April 27: Individually they could have been brushed off but like a swarm of angry killer bees homing in on their victim, a group of 50 former British ambassadors and high commissioners launched a massed and unprecedented attack yesterday on Tony Blairs West Asia policy.																								The diplomats chastised the British Prime Minister for blindly supporting President George W. Bushs policy on Israel, calling it one-sided and illegal, and on Iraq, describing it as doomed to failure. 																								Their statement is without parallel in the history of British foreign policy. In their letter addressed to Dear Prime Minister, the former British ambassadors, high commissioners, governors and senior international officials, including some who have long experience of Middle East (West Asia) and others whose experience is elsewhere, say they have watched with deepening concern the policies which you have followed on the Arab-Israel problem and Iraq, in close cooperation with the United States.																								Their letter was provoked by the press conference in Washington at which you and President Bush restated these policies. 																								What was now required was a fundamental reassessment of British policy. 																								The diplomats, among them former heads of the UK mission in the erstwhile Soviet Union, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Turkey, Morocco, Somalia, Germany, Jordan, UAE, Bahrain, Yemen, the UN, the Falkland Islands and Australia, say their hopes were raised by the road map to peace in West Asia disclosed just before the Iraq war. But the hopes were ill-founded. Nothing effective has been done.																								Worse was to come, they complain. After all those wasted months, the international community has now been confronted with the announcement by Ariel Sharon and President Bush of new policies which are one-sided and illegal and which will cost yet more Israeli and Palestinian blood. Our dismay at this backward step is heightened by the fact that you yourself seem to have endorsed it.																								This abandonment of principle comes at a time when, rightly or wrongly, we are portrayed throughout the Arab and Muslim world as partners in an illegal and brutal occupation in Iraq, they point out. 																								The diplomats effectively blow Blairs foreign policy out of the water by arguing: The conduct of the war in Iraq has made it clear that there was no effective plan for the post-Saddam settlement. 																								All those with experience of the area predicted that the occupation of Iraq by the coalition forces would meet serious and stubborn resistance, as has proved to be the case.																								Damning the current tough stance taken by American military, the diplomats say: It is not good enough to say that the use of force is a matter for local commanders. Heavy weapons unsuited to the task in hand, inflammatory language, the current confrontations in Najaf and Falluja, all these have built up rather than isolated the opposition. The diplomats also say: The Iraqis killed by coalition forces probably total between ten and fifteen thousand (it is a disgrace that the coalition forces themselves appear to have no estimate), and the number killed in the last month in Falluja alone is apparently several hundred, including many civilian men, women and children. 																								Phrases such as: We mourn each loss of life. We salute them, and their families for their bravery and their sacrifice, apparently referring only to those who have died on the coalition side, are not well judged to moderate the passions these killings arouse.																								The diplomats conclude by urging Blair to use his influence with Washington as a loyal ally. We believe that the need for such influence is now a matter of the highest urgency. If that is unacceptable or unwelcome, there is no case for supporting policies which are doomed to failure. 																								Blair has not reacted so far but foreign office minister Mike Brien insisted today that there had been no change in Britains West Asia policy. 																								He said: I think in many ways this is a cry of frustration that things are not going as quickly as we would all like, on West Asia in particular. 																								Brien acknowledged, however, that there was a limit to what British diplomacy could achieve. 																								I think we have got to be realistic. We can influence the US but we cant control the superpower. They listen to our quiet diplomacy but they also have their own policy, he said. 																								One of the former diplomats who signed the letter, Sir Marrack Goulding, hinted that their concerns were shared by current foreign office staff.																								He said: I think that almost all of us who signed that letter have the impression that the regional expertise in the foreign office wasnt as fully used as it should have been in the formulation of the governments policy on Iraq.																								But Israel has its supporters in parliament. Labour MP Louise Ellman, a member of the all-party parliamentary group on Israel, commented: The foreign office has long been known as a base for Arabists.

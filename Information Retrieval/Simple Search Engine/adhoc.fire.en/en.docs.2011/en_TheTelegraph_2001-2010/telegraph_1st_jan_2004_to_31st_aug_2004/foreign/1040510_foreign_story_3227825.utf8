Torture with music amp; lights
 DANA PRIEST AND JOE STEPHENS 				 	 A picture published in the New Yorker magazine shows a naked Iraqi detainee cowering under threat from two American military dogs in the Abu Ghraib prison. (AFP) 																								Washington, May 9: In April 2003, the defence department approved interrogation techniques for use at the Guantanamo Bay prison that permit reversing normal sleep patterns of detainees and exposing them to heat, cold and sensory assault, including loud music and bright lights, according to defence officials. 																								The classified list of about 20 techniques was approved at the highest levels of the Pentagon and the justice department, and represents the first publicly known documentation of an official policy permitting interrogators to use physically and psychologically stressful methods during questioning. 																								The use of any of these techniques requires the approval of senior Pentagon officials  and in some cases, of the defence secretary. Interrogators must justify the harshest treatment is militarily necessary, according to the document, as cited by one official. Once approved, the harsher treatment must be accompanied by appropriate medical monitoring. We wanted to find a legal way to jack up the pressure, said one lawyer who helped write the guidelines. We wanted a little more freedom than in a US prison, but not torture. 																								Defence and intelligence officials said similar guidelines have been approved for use on high-value detainees in Iraq  those suspected of terrorism or of having knowledge of insurgency operations. Separate CIA guidelines exist for agency-run detention centres.																								It could not be learned whether similar guidelines were in effect at the US-run Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, which has been the focus of controversy in recent days. But lawmakers have said they want to know whether the misconduct reported at Abu Ghraib  which included sexual humiliation was an aberration or whether it reflected an aggressive policy taken to inhumane extremes. 																								Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, the US military and the CIA have detained thousands of foreign nationals at the prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, as well as facilities in Iraq and elsewhere, as part of an effort to crack down on suspected terrorists and quell the insurgency in Iraq. 																								The Pentagon guidelines for Guantanamo were designed to give interrogators the authority to prompt uncooperative detainees to provide information, though experts on interrogation say such information is often unreliable. 																								Mark Jacobson, a former defence department official who worked on detainee issues while at the Pentagon, said at Guantanamo and the Bagram facility in Afghanistan, military interrogators have never used torture or extreme stress techniques. Its the fear of being tortured that might get someone to talk, not the torture, he said. 					 THE LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

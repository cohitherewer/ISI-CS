 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 UN raps Iran over nuclear information
Vienna, March 13 (Reuters): The UN atomic watchdog sharply reprimanded Iran today for withholding sensitive nuclear information, in a resolution that diplomats said left open the option of UN sanctions if Tehran did not cooperate.																								Irans chief nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rohani, angrily denounced the resolution by the International Atomic Energy (IAEA), telling the official Irna news agency it was like an ugly demon with dangerous horns and sharp teeth.																								Iranian officials also acknowledged that expectation of the resolution was part of why they called an abrupt halt yesterday to UN inspections  a move the US, which says Iran is trying to build an atomic bomb, called very troubling.																								The resolution by the IAEA board of governors deplores Irans omissions of sensitive atomic technology from an October declaration  including undeclared research on advanced P2 centrifuges that can make bomb-grade uranium.																								It said the board would decide in June how to respond to the omissions  a clause that several diplomats said keeps the door open for a possible report to the UN Security Council and economic sanctions.																								The passing of the resolution followed a week of intense haggling over a toughly-worded text drafted by Australia and Canada and backed by Washington. European and non-aligned states, Russia and China wanted milder wording.																								A compromise was struck after the US-led camp agreed to soften some language, although US ambassador Kenneth Brill said it remained a strong warning to Tehran.																								This information calls for Iran to provide proactive cooperation instead of having information dragged out of it, he said after the meeting.																								In remarks prepared for delivery in the closed-door meeting, Brill said: Iran... is continuing to pursue a policy of denial, deception and delay.

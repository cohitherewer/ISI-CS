Norwegian deputy foreign minister Vidar Helgesen made the comments following three days of talks with both sides, during which, he said, little progress was made toward restarting talks to end the civil war. 																								The peace process is in its most serious situation for two-and-a-half years and given that fact, Im disturbed by this complacency and the fact that people tend to take peace for granted, Helgesen said. He said trust between the two sides was also dissipating in the face of an upsurge in violence.

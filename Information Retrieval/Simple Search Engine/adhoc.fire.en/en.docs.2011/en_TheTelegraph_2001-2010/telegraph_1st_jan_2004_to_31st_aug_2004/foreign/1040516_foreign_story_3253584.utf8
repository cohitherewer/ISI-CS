The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Prescott plans future sans Blair
Tony Blair (top) and John Prescott																								London, May 15 (Reuters): His popularity flagging since the Iraq war, British Prime Minister Tony Blair faced renewed speculation today that he may resign after his deputy said senior ministers had discussed who might take his place.																								The Times ran an interview with deputy Prime Minister John Prescott on its front page under the headline: Race to seize Blairs crown is under way. Prescotts office issued a statement today saying the Times headline was untrue.																								In the interview, Prescott was quoted as saying senior ministers had discussed a future without Blair and suggesting they were preparing for a seismic shift in government.																								I think it is true that, when plates appear to be moving, everyone positions themselves for it, Prescott said in the interview with the Times. Asked if senior ministers were preparing for a new leader or had discussed it, Prescott said: Yes, people do talk about it and you get that discussion... every British Prime Minister goes eventually.																								But in the statement issued today Prescott played down the significance of his comments. Of course there has been speculation over the leadership, but the reality is there is no race for the Prime Ministers position, he said. Blairs office declined to comment. His spokesmen have repeatedly denied rumours he is planning to resign ahead of an election expected next year.																								Blairs trust ratings plummeted after the Iraq war and his government has been hit by negative headlines on issues from Europe and West Asia to health and public services.																								Blair, who swept to power with a landslide election win in 1997, dismissed talk of his resignation as froth yesterday.																								But newspapers have speculated there is growing support within the government for chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown, Blairs key ally and main rival for the leadership. 																								Prescott confirmed in the Times interview that Blair and Brown had a pretty serious breakdown in relations soon after Labour came to power, but said they had been working extremely well together more recently.																								Political folklore says the pair made a pact in 1994 that if Blair became Prime Minister he would one day step aside to allow Brown to take over.																								Prescott admitted that Labour had been rather dampened by the whole business of Iraq. We understand that it has been difficult, he told the paper. The latest Populus poll put support for Labour at 32 per cent, four points behind the Conservative Party.Evacuation plans																								The British government said yesterday it was preparing mass evacuation plans to clear large parts of London in the event of a terror attack on the city.																								Entire local populations will be moved out of the city by road and rail to temporary holding areas elsewhere, and roads will be cleared of normal traffic to allow swift movement if there is a terrorist strike.

 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Islamabad on scientists cash trail
																								Islamabad, Jan. 25 (PTI): Foreign bank accounts of two senior Pakistani nuclear scientists, who allegedly received money for passing nuclear technology to Iran, have been traced even as the government ordered all ministries and departments not to invite A. Q. Khan, the father of the countrys atomic bomb, to any official function.																								The foreign bank accounts in which the proceeds from the transfer of some nuclear technology to Iran have been deposited were traced back to at least two senior nuclear scientists, unnamed officials were quoted today as saying by the local daily The News. These accounts were being operated through a Dubai-based bank, which has already provided the required information to Pakistani authorities.																								It is an open and shut case. Their foreign bank accounts swelled by millions of dollars as the sensitive information and some hardware reached Iran, one official said. For investigation and security reasons, names of the scientists involved in the deal have not been revealed. The government also instructed all ministries not to invite Khan to official functions, the paper said.

 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Bush backs gay marriage ban
																								Washington, Feb. 24 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush endorsed a constitutional amendment today that would ban gay marriage as he leaped into a contentious issue that could energise his conservative base for the November election. Bush expressed alarm at events in San Francisco, where marriage licences have been issued to gays and lesbians, and in Massachusetts, where a court ruled gay couples have the right to wed.																								If we are to prevent the meaning of marriage from being changed forever, our nation must enact an amendment to protect marriage, Bush said.

 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Iran close to resolving poll row
																								Tehran, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Irans pro-reform government said today it was close to resolving a bitter row with hardliners over parliamentary elections that has plunged the Islamic Republic into its worst political crisis for years.																								The compromise deal over the exclusion of hundreds of reformist candidates from the February 20 vote appeared to have been hammered out thanks to the intervention of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali-Khamenei, who has final say on all state affairs. 																								We hope that by tomorrow afternoon we can reach acceptable results which could prepare the ground for the government to be able to hold the election, government spokesman Abdollah Ramazanzadeh said. He added that Khamenei had called on officials to ensure a high voter turnout.

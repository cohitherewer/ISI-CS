The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 US eats crow on terror toll
																								Washington, June 11 (Reuters): The US state department said today its report that the number of international terrorist attacks fell last year was wrong and in fact had risen sharply.																								The department also said the number of resulting deaths was expected to be higher for 2003 than the 307 initially reported, but officials said it may not exceed 2002s 725 fatalities.																								The admissions dented the claim by US President George W. Bushs administration that Washington is winning the war on terrorism, an argument critical to his re-election strategy.																								The state departments Patterns of Global Terrorism Report released on April 29 said terrorist attacks fell to 190 last year, their lowest since 1969, from 198 in 2002. It also said those killed dropped to 307, including 35 US citizens, from 725 in 2002, including 27 Americans.																								State department spokesman Richard Boucher said both totals were understated because of errors in compiling the data by the Terrorist Threat Integration Center.

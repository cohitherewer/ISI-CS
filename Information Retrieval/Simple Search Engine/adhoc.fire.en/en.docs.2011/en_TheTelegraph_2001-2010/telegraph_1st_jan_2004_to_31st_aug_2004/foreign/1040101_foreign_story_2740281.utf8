 Eyeball to eyeball:  Britney Spears (left) and Christina Aguilera 																								New York, Dec. 31 (AP): Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera arent exactly in the same Mickey Mouse club anymore.																								The pop stars, who both kissed Madonna a few months ago during a performance at the MTV video music awards, are now trading insults.																								In the December issue of Blender magazine, Aguilera said of Spears, She seemed very distant, even during rehearsals. Every time I tried to start a conversation with her, well, lets just say she seemed nervous the whole time. ... She seems to me like a lost little girl, someone who desperately needs guidance.																								Spears responds in the magazines January issue, I cant believe Christina said that about me. Then she relates a story about seeing Aguilera, her former friend and fellow mouseketeer, for the first time in two years: She comes up to me in a club in front of all these people and tries to put her tongue down my throat!

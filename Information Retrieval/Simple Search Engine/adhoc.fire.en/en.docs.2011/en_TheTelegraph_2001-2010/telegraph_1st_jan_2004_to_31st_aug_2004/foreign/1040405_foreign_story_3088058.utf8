 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Ignorant imams irk British MP
 London, April 4 (PTI):  Prejudiced and ignorant imams are doing great harm to  Britain and must be forced to sit tests in English language  and British culture, Lord Ahmed, Britains leading Muslim  Labour MP said.																								There is an increasing number of second and third-rate islamic clerics who come to this country for dubious means. They are not spreading the true message of Islam, which preaches peace and tolerance, he said in an article in the Mail on Sunday today.																								Theirs is a distorted version which is doing great harm to Muslims and Britain,  Ahmed, who originally hails from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, said. They bear responsibility for the alienation of some young Muslims who are being told to hate this country and are driven into the hands of extremists and terrorist sympathisers, he said. It is also important to state that there are many intelligent, deeply spiritual and responsible imams in the UK who preach the genuine teachings of Prophet Mohammed and Islam.																								Ahmed said if a Church of England vicar used the kind of abusive language about Muslims that some imams habitually use about the British, they would rightly be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred. The reason the imams are not prosecuted is because the non-Muslim community has no idea what goes on inside some mosques. 																								We must insist that imams who come to Britain are forced to sit tests in the English language and British culture. Secondly, they must be forced to show they have genuine qualifications. If they fail on either count, they should be turned away. And we should insist that all imams already here sit the same test, he added. Racist attack																								Scotland Yard is hunting two men in connection with the murder of an 80-year-old Asian man in a racially motivated attack in Northhalt, north-west London. Pensioner Akberali Tayabali Mohamedally from Pakistan died after he was assaulted in an underpass at a roundabout in Northholt, a Scotland Yard spokesperson said.

 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Britain ends donor anonymity
																								London, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Britain said today it would end anonymity for sperm and egg donors from next year, in a move that a fertility expert said could worsen the countrys already critical shortage of donations.																								Children conceived from donated eggs or sperm will have the right to track down their biological parents from the age of 18, public health minister Melanie Johnson told a news conference.																								 I firmly believe donor-conceived people have a right to information about their genetic origins that is currently denied them, including the identity of their donor, she said. Todays new regulations will remove the major discrepancy that exists between the rights of donor-conceived people and those of adopted people, she added.

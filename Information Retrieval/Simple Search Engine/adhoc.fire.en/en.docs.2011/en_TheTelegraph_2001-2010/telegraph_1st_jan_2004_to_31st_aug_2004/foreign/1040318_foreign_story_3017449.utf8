 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Exodus from wrecked war zone
 Wana (Pakistan), March 17  (Reuters): Pakistani families living near the Afghan  border fled their homes today, afraid of fresh clashes between  paramilitary forces and suspected al Qaida militants being  sheltered by local tribesmen.																								At least 16 soldiers and 24 rebels were killed in fierce fighting yesterday involving assault rifles, machineguns, light artillery and rockets, in the latest operation in Pakistans lawless tribal belt to flush out al Qaida militants.																								Hundreds of people, including many women and children, were driven away on tractors and trucks from Kaloosha, near the scene of the heaviest clashes, to the nearby town of Wana 15 km away. 																								We fear that our area will be bombed now, said Ali Shah Khan, who was fleeing the area with his family.																								Blackened wrecks of military vehicles littered the roads and some were still burning. A charred body was in one of the vehicles in Watchadana, 12 km from Wana. Residents said there was no fresh fighting today.																								An official said some rebels killed appeared to be foreign.																								The latest operation by Pakistani troops to hunt down suspected al Qaida and Taliban guerrillas came on the eve of a visit to Pakistan by US secretary of state Colin Powell.																								Addressing a news conference in Afghanistan before his arrival in Pakistan, Powell said today the operation was a sign Islamabad was intensifying its crackdown on militancy.																								The action in Pakistan yesterday suggests that Pakistanis have picked up the pace and we hope they continue to do that, Powell said. It shows the intention on the part of Pakistan not to allow these tribal areas to be used as a haven. Twenty-two troops were wounded and 18 Pakistanis were arrested at the scene of yesterdays clashes and detained for questioning. Their features are not local. They appear to be Chechens or central Asians, said Mohammad Azam Khan, a local government official																								Up to 600 foreign militants are believed to be hiding in the wild tribal belt near the Afghan border, where they are sheltered by Pakistani tribesmen. Kabul says members of the ousted Taliban regime use Pakistan as a base to launch attacks in Afghanistan. Local people say foreign militants who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s were hailed by Pakistani authorities as heroes of Islam.

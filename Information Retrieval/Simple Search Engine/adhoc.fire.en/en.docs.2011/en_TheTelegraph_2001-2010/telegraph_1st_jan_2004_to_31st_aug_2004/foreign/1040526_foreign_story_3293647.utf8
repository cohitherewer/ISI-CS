 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Asteroid detected in Earths orbit
																								Washington, May 25: Astronomers at Lowell Observatory have discovered an asteroid inside Earths orbit that rockets around the sun once every 184 days  the quickest trip of any known object in the solar system. 																								Lowell research assistant Brian Skiff observed the object known as 2004 JG6 on May 10, in the early evening during a brief window of time when objects close to the sun are visible. Skiff said the asteroid will also be relatively easy to see just after sunrise in autumn. 																								Theyre only lit up on the back side, so that if you saw one during the day, it would only be a tiny crescent, Skiff said in an interview from the Flagstaff, Arizona, observatory. When you look outward away from the sun, objects are lit up all the time. 																								Its no danger to us, at least not for the next 10,000 years, Skiff said.

 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Bushs turn to tap feel-good factor
																								Tampa (Florida), Feb. 16 (Reuters): George W. Bush said today that, contrary to recent polls and his Democratic challengers, there is an undeniable sense of economic optimism sweeping the country.																								Bushs upbeat message stood in contrast to charges by his Democratic presidential rivals about high unemployment and jobs moving overseas.																								Nearly 2.8 million factory jobs have been lost since Bush took office and the issue looms large ahead of Novembers vote.																								Bush acknowledged during a visit to a Tampa window and door manufacturer that a lot of economic growth depends upon the psychology of the people making decisions all throughout our economy.																								Bush did his part today to shape that psychology. 																								You can say: Well of course, they just pick the upbeat people. Well, the truth of the matter is people are pretty upbeat all over the country. Thats what Im here to report to you, he said.																								Bushs goal: to reverse his slide in recent polls by boosting confidence in his economic stewardship. 																								An ABC News/Washington Post survey released on Friday found Bush at a low point in public approval, his popularity depressed by questions about the Iraq war, continued economic frustration and interest in his leading Democratic rival.																								In his remarks at NuAir Manufacturing in Tampa, Bush steered clear of negative economic news, including a recent report showing Americans turned increasingly cautious on the economy. Analysts say weak jobs creation has dampened consumer confidence despite a strengthening US economy.																								Bush seized on NuAirs hopes to hire 40 more workers this year. Forty workers here, five workers there, begin to add up, he said.																								Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, derided Bushs two-day visit to the state that was at the centre of the 2000 recount controversy. Had he spent a little more time, he would have seen some of the suffering people, he said.																								Bush made no mention of the controversy surrounding the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw, who praised the shifting of US jobs abroad.																								The facts bear me out, Bush said. The last six months of growth have been tremendous. Housing starts are way up. Inflation is low. Interest is low. New jobs are being created... Things are looking better for America.																								Theres an optimism in our country that is undeniable, he added. The key question is: Are we wise enough to ... keep the policies in place that encourage growth. 																								Bush did his part for Tampa economy last night. After mixing with the masses at the Daytona 500 stock-car race, the President and his wife settled in at Tampas exclusive Berns Steak House with local political allies.

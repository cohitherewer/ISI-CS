 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Aristide plea to resist occupation
																								Port-au-Prince, March 8 (Reuters): Exiled Haitian leader Jean-Bertrand Aristide appealed to his supporters to peacefully resist an occupation of Haiti today, a day after blazing gunfire killed at least six people in a huge demonstration in Port-au-Prince celebrating his ouster.																								US marines, grappling to restore order in the chaotic Caribbean nation as part of an international peacekeeping force, rumbled on machine-gun-mounted vehicles through the sprawling citys tense streets early today.																								Hundreds of ragged slum-dwellers looted an industrial park near the capitals airport. Haitian national police chief Leonce Charles said his officers were going to raid neighbourhoods and disarm fighters with illegal weapons. 																								In the Central African Republic, Aristide repeated a claim US forces abducted him, which the United States denies. I am the elected President and I remain the elected President, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Spider-Man in a movie hurry
																								Las Vegas, March 25 (Reuters): Even before comic book hero Spider-Man can weave his crime-fighting web in movie theatres for a second time, Sony Pictures Entertainment yesterday set a May 2007 launch date and star line-up for Spider-Man 3.																								Returning for a third film in the hit series will be Tobey Maguire as the man with the powers of a super spider and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest, Mary Jane Watson. Sam Raimi will be back to direct, Sony Pictures Entertainment vice-chairman Jeff Blake said here at the ShoWest convention for movie theatre owners.																								Blake added that Sony is so excited about Spider-Man 2, the sequel to the 2002 box office smash Spider-Man, that it is debuting the second film on June 30 this year, two days earlier than planned.																								Spider-Man remains the record holder for the biggest box office debut over a three-day weekend with just under $115 million in domestic ticket sales. Overall in 2002, it took in about $800 million worldwide. The film studio gave ShoWest audiences their first glimpse of Spider-Man 2, and as promised it comes with all the action, romance and even the heartbreak of the first film.																								We set out to make a movie that had the excitement, humour and the humanity of the first movie  times two, said producer Laura Ziskin. In Spider-Man 2, the superhero battles a new nemesis Dr Otto Octavius, a.k.a. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina). Ocks four mechanical appendages give him superpowers, too, but unlike Spider-Man, Ocks heart is cold and hard.																								Along with fighting his rival, Spider-Mans alter ego, Peter Parker, battles personal demons and deals with his love for Watson. In one revealing clip shown yesterday, Parker gives up his Spider suit in search of true love.																								But dont mistake Spider-Man 2 for all romance because the comic hero wrestles with Ock high atop city skyscrapers and inside rushing subway trains.																								If Spider-Man fans cant wait for Junes Spider-Man 2 or, for that matter, the May 4, 2007, debut of Spider-Man 3, then Sony promises to have their newest promotional clips in theatres by next month.																								Sony Pictures is a unit of Japanese electronics giant, Sony Corp.

 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 US official in landmark visit to Libya
				 	 US assistant secretary of state William Burns. (AFP)																								Tripoli, March 23 (Reuters): US assistant secretary of state William Burns arrived in Libya today, the highest-level US visitor in more than 30 years.																								The visit capped a dramatic improvement in relations between Washington and Tripoli after Libyas surprise decision in December to scrap its weapons of mass destruction programmes. Burns was expected to hold talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi during his brief stay but government sources gave no time for the meeting.																								Burns landed at Maitiga airport, a former US military base outside Tripoli. There was no official ceremony as he was greeted by former Prime Minister Abdelaati Labidi. 																								The American visitor did not speak to reporters and was whisked by car to a Tripoli hotel.																								Diplomatic sources saw the visit as a sign that the US could soon lift sanctions against a country not long ago considered a pariah state because of Gaddafis espousal of radical causes in Africa, Europe and West Asia. Libya is still on a US blacklist as a state sponsor of terrorism.																								Burns visit, and the one expected on Thursday by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, were further proof that Gaddafi, in power since 1969, was breaking Libyas isolation after decades in which the West held it responsible for attacks such as the 1988 Lockerbie bombing of a US airliner over Scotland.

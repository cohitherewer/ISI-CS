(Reuters)																								Camp Falluja (Iraq), April 22 (Reuters): A US general warned insurgents in Falluja today they had days not weeks to hand over their arms or face the possibility of a renewed US offensive on the Iraqi town west of Baghdad.																								Lieutenant General James Conway, commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force based in western Iraq, said the response to a peace agreement between US forces and Falluja civic leaders had been disappointing.																								Under the agreement, marines agreed to stop offensive operations in Falluja if guerrillas handed over heavy weapons. We are not pleased at all with the turnover that we saw yesterday. The volume probably amounted to a pick-up truck full, he said at Camp Falluja, a US base near the town.																								He said he understood the weapons were junk... things that I wouldnt want my marines to begin to fire.																								US forces launched a crackdown on Falluja earlier this month in response to the killing and mutilation of four US private security guards in the town. Hundreds of Iraqis were killed in the fighting, many of them civilians.																								Talks to stabilise the shaky truce have led to relative calm in the past week, but this has been interspersed with bouts of fighting and air strikes.																								Conway said time was running out and that resuming offensive operations was an option. Over 2,000 marines are surrounding the town but say they only fight when under attack.																								Its days not weeks. The cordon cannot continue forever. If the negotiators dont deliver a peaceful scenario were going to do what we came here to do, he said.																								The people of Falluja, the negotiators have to understand that it is a give and take process. We are expected to give certain things and we think we have. We expect certain things in return and those things to date have not been forthcoming.																								The crackdown in Falluja sparked loud criticism from rights groups and prominent Iraqi politicians. US forces agreed to hold off offensive operations after talks with town leaders in order to give a negotiated solution a chance.																								Conway questioned the ability of Iraqi peace negotiators to influence guerrillas in Falluja, a hard-nosed town comprised of a volatile mix of Saddam Hussein loyalists, many tribes and, according to the US military, hundreds of foreign fighters.																								We have had reservations regarding their ability to peacefully influence because it is the other guys who have the weapons, he said.

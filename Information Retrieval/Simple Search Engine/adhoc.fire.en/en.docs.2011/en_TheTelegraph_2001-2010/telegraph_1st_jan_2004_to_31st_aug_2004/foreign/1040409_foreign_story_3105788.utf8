 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Japanese hostage in pullout standoff
Baghdad, April 8 (Reuters): Militants seized a number of foreign nationals as hostages in Iraq today, threatening to burn alive one group of three Japanese unless their country withdrew its troops.																								Seven South Koreans, seized while doing missionary work today, were later freed unharmed, Seouls foreign ministry said. But the three Japanese as well as two Israeli Arabs and a Briton were reported still to be hostages after being seized by militants. 																								An Iranian television station said the two Israeli Arabs were kidnapped by the Ansar a-Din group, and the uncle of one of the men identified him as an employee of a US aid agency.																								Gunmen frequently stage hold-ups on Iraqs lawless roads but taking hostages would mark an escalation of the growing conflict between US-led forces and Iraqis and foreign militants opposed to the occupation.																								The South Koreans were reported by YTN TV to have been freed after the gunmen confirmed their nationality.																								Lim Young-sup, a member of Korea Association of Christian Gospel Group, said they were held by 25 to 30 people dressed like Iraqi civilians.																								We were held for seven to eight hours and they offered us some food. Once they released us, they gave a ride to us near Baghdad, he said.																								US-ally South Korea has 600 military engineers and medics in Iraq and plans to send 3,000 more for reconstruction.																								The Briton was named as contractor Gary Teeley, 37, who was reported kidnapped on Tuesday in the southern town of Nassiriya, scene of heavy fighting between radical Shia militiamen and Iraqi troops.																								The foreign office in London confirmed Teeley was missing, but would not say what he was doing in Iraq or comment on the manner of his disappearance.																								Japan public broadcaster NHK said the Japanese woman was Naoko Takato, involved in relief work for children; one man was Noriaki Imai, doing field work on depleted uranium weapons and the other as free-lance cameraman Soichiro Koriyama. Arab television Al Jazeera showed them kneeling with their eyes bound with white cloth and surrounded by masked men holding rifles. The walls of the room were riddled with bullets.																								It said they had been taken hostage by a hitherto unknown Iraqi group called Saraya al-Mujahideen (Mujahideen Brigades), which threatened to kill them. We tell you that three of your children have fallen prisoner in our hands and we give you two options  withdraw your forces from our country and go home or we will burn them alive and feed them to the fighters, the group said.																								You have three days from the date of this tapes airing, it said in a statement, accusing Japan of betraying Iraqis by supporting the US-led occupation. A Japanese government spokesman demanded their immediate release and said there were no plans to pull out troops. Foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi urged Japanese civilians, including journalists, to leave Iraq immediately.

 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Hiroshima mine falls
Kinshasa (Congo), July 12 (AP): Part of the east Congo uranium mine that fuelled the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki collapsed, killing at least eight miners digging there illicitly, authorities said today. The collapse occurred on Friday at the Shinkolobwe mine, an open pit honeycombed with tunnels. News reached the capital only today because of poor communications. Congo mining minister Diomi Ndongala said denied claims by miners that upto 30 of their colleagues remained trapped inside.

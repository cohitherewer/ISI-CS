 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Commonwealth furore in Pak
				 	 Musharraf: Trouble within																								Islamabad, May 23 (PTI): Denouncing as unjustified the Commonwealths decision to re-admit Pakistan on the ground that democracy has returned to the country, opposition parties here said it is wrong to reward dictatorships.																								Reacting angrily to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) decision yesterday to revoke suspension of Pakistan, leader of the 15-party Alliance for Restoration of Democracy Mukdhum Amin Fahim said it was not justified.																								If the Commonwealth was to restore Pakistans membership despite whatever was happening in the country, then there was no need for suspending the same after the military takeover in October 1999, Fahim, who recently wrote a letter to the Commonwealth opposing lifting of suspension, said.																								Strongly defending his letter, Fahim, who is also senior leader of Pakistan Peoples Party led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, said his desire for restoration of genuine and full democracy manifested the depth of his love for the country.																								In a separate reaction, the PPP said the suspension was lifted for reasons other than restoration of democracy in Pakistan.																								The decision is not surprising as western countries, taking General (President Pervez) Musharrafs promise to fight against terror on its face value, wanted to reward his government, party spokesman Faratullah Babar said.																								We wanted to place on record that it is wrong to reward dictatorships. We did it not only for the sake of democracy in Pakistan but also to stop dictators waiting in the wings in other countries from striking, he said in a statement.																								However, Islamic alliance Muttahida Majlis-e Amal welcomed the CMAG decision to re-admit Pakistan. 																								Its leader Qazi Husain Ahmed, whose alliance has helped Musharraf to get his controversial constitutional amendments ratified by parliament, said the President would take off his military uniform by the end of the year, after which powers would stand transferred to parliament.																								He alleged that Pakistans membership of the Commonwealth had been suspended because of the grudge of certain countries rather than any principle.																								The fight for restoration of democracy was an internal problem of Pakistan and its political system, he said. Although the MMA was opposed to a military system, it was equally averse to foreign pressures on the subject, he was quoted as saying by the local daily Dawn. 																								He alleged that western countries had double standards on various issues which they kept changing according to their vested interests.																								PPPs Babar said his party has, however, taken note that the cmag has emphasised that Musharraf should shed his military uniform as agreed to by him.																								The Pakistan Muslim League- (pml-) of deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said despite the revocation, the Commonwealth and the EU should play their role in helping to restore democracy in Pakistan.																								Pml-chairman Raja Zafarul Haq said his party was grateful to various international organisations for bringing pressure on the military regime to restore constitutional rule.																								We did not want the Commonwealth (to) close its doors on Pakistan. But we still want the Commonwealth and the European Union (to) play their role for full restoration of the 1973 Constitution, Haq said.																								He pointed out that the office of the President was with a serving general, unheard of in democratic societies. 																								Haq said the ARD, of which his party is also a member, would not change its opinion that the country lacked a democratic system, no matter how international organisations viewed the prevailing system.																								Complaining that these organisations kept changing their yardsticks, Haq said at times they cooperated with various governments ignoring their democratic credentials and then they treated them like outcasts on the pretext that their record of human rights was not good.

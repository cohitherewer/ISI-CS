																								Baan Susoe (Thailand), April 30 (Reuters): The shooting of an entire team of 19 soccer players from the same Muslim village in southern Thailand after they attacked a security checkpoint has left relatives and neighbours stunned.																								Revelations about the soccer team give a disturbing insight into the minds, if not the motives, of those involved in Wednesdays violence, in which troops shot dead 108 machete- and gun-toting militants. 																								Three days after defending their annual county soccer title, the team of Baan Susoe village near the Malaysian border mounted nine motorcycles and rode 23 km through the night to launch a dawn attack on a security checkpoint. One of the youths, who were all aged between 19 and 26, struck a soldier with his blade. The rest were all shot before they even got close.																								Relatives of Kamaruding Baeprommi, 20, said he had the potential to secure a place in Thailands national team. 																								Officials said tests showed four used a heady mixture of methamphetamine and marijuana before launching the raid. We also found prayer beads and five commandments written in the Malay dialect, Yawi, in their backpacks, an official said.

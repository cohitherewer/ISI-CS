 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Email rips 9/11 suspect cover
 MASSOUD ANSARI AND TONY PATERSON 																								Karachi/Berlin, July 25: A key September 11 suspect who disappeared eight days before the attacks on the World Trade Center has broken his cover by emailing his wife in Germany, prompting Pakistani police to renew their hunt for him.																								Said Bahaji, 29, a German of Moroccan origin who is alleged to have been the link between the Hamburg al Qaida cell  which masterminded the attacks  and Osama bin Laden, is believed to have been hiding in Pakistan and Afghanistan ever since the attacks.																								In an email to his wife, Nese, who still lives in Germany, Bahaji revealed that he was being well looked after despite being on the run. Addressing her as My Rose, Bahaji wrote: The people here love Arabs. The simplest of people welcome us. Their wives cant wait to cook and do our laundry for us.																								German Federal Police (BKA) revealed last week that they have intercepted 14 emails and a number of telephone conversations between Bahaji, his wife, and other friends and relatives.																								On March 7, Bahaji is said to have spent over 23 minutes talking to relatives in Germany. 																								The most recent emails, intercepted on July 2, were delivered by Internet service providers in the Pakistan cities of Lahore and Islamabad.																								Bahaji is said to have travelled to Afghanistan immediately before September 11, to inform the al Qaida leader that the attacks were imminent.																								Pakistani police failed to find him and he was last traced to an unknown location in Karachi, from where he telephoned his mother in October 2001.																								BKA officials said that Nese Bahaji had repeatedly begged her husband to turn himself in, and had hired a lawyer to represent him. In one email, however, the terrorist suspect replied: No! I will not allow myself to be humiliated by an infidel.																								Pakistani police confirmed that their search had been stepped up. 																								We are in contact with the German investigators and are hoping to fine-tune the information. This may help us to reach him, a Pakistani police investigator said.																								Bahajis arrest would be a major breakthrough for investigators. 																								He is one of the last members of the Hamburg cell, run by the leading hijacker Mohammed Atta, still to be on the run.																								Jamil Yousif, a former Pakistani police investigator who was involved in the initial attempts to track down Bahaji after the September 11 attacks, warned that capturing him remained a difficult task.																								Many of the militants are hiding near the Pakistan-Afghan border. They have sophisticated satellite phones which enable them to use Iranian land phone lines to log on to the internet. 																								They are using land lines in one country and hiding in another, which enables them to dodge the security agencies, he said.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Thursday, July 01, 2004 Dictator dolls dance to rock n roll
				 	 Saddam dolls in a Baghdad toy store. (Reuters)																								Baghdad, June 30 (Reuters): Iraqis used to dance to his tune, but in Baghdad toy shops a chubby, gun-toting Saddam Hussein doll now wiggles his hips to the Hippy Hippy Shake.																								Toy stores around Baghdad are doing a quick trade in dancing Saddam dolls  foot-high battery-powered puppets of the former President, kitted out in full insurgent regalia, who swing their hips to cheesy pop music at the flick of a switch.																								Decked out with hand-grenades, daggers, a walkie-talkie, binoculars and an AK-47, and with a chubby plastic head topped by a skull-badged beret, Saddam dances to the Hippy Hippy Shake when turned on.																								Its funny, isnt it? said Mustapha al-Kadamy, a young father as he browsed through a toy store in the wealthy Mansoor district. Tomorrow Saddam will go before an Iraqi judge and so today is a good day to make fun of him, he said  we need to be able to smile after all the horrible things hes done to us.																								The owner of the store started offering the dolls shortly after Saddams regime was overthrown in April last year.																								A Turkish travelling salesmen turned up with the Chinese-made puppets, also featuring dancing Osama bin Ladens, Fidel Castros and George W. Bushes, and he placed an order.																								At first it was the hip-shaking Osamas that sold best, but slowly Iraqis grew less fearful of ridiculing their deposed President and started buying the Saddam ones too. At the beginning wed hide them under the counter and only sell them to those who specially asked because people were upset to see the former President as a doll, explained Asaad Majid, a salesman in the al-Jelawi toy store in Mansoor neighbourhood of Baghdad.

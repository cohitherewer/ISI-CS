				 	 Banderas: Success speaks																								Madrid, July 10 (Reuters): Spains Cinema Academy awarded actor Antonio Banderas a gold medal yesterday, honouring his rise from the early films of Spanish director Pedro Almodovar to Hollywood blockbusters.																								The academy praised Banderas, Spains best known actor, in recognition of his extraordinary work as an actor and for his work in promoting Spanish culture through his fruitful international film career.																								Spanish media reported Banderas, 43, had turned down the honour in the past because he thought he was too young.																								It may have been the biggest surprise of my career when they told me about the award, which generally is given to people much older then me, Banderas told Spains Cadena Ser radio.																								Banderas received the award in his hometown of Malaga on Spains south coast, also the birthplace of artist Pablo Picasso. He made his big-screen debut in Labyrinth of Passion in 1982, one of several appearances in films directed by two-time Oscar winner Pedro Almodovar.

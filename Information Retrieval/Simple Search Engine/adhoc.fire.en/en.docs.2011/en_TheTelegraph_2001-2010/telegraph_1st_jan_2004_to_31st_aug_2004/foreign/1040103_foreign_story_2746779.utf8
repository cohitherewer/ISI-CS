 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Pervez pledge
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Jan 2: A day after securing the vote of confidence from Pakistani legislators, President Pervez Musharraf today vowed never to exercise his powers of dissolving the National Assembly and dismissing the government. 																								Addressing the nation over radio and television networks, Musharraf promised that the present legislature would have the distinction of completing its five-year term. The promise is significant, especially as five assemblies had been dismissed from 1985 to 1996.																								Article 58(2) (b) of the constitution, restored with certain modifications, empowers the President to send a reference to the supreme court within 15 days of the dissolution of the lower house, which will then announce its verdict in 45 days.																								It will be my responsibility to ensure continuation of sustained democracy and I will not dissolve the assemblies, Musharraf said. Pakistan belongs to all of us and we have to make collective efforts to take the country forward on the path of progress and prosperity.																								He expressed the hope that the National Security Council Bill will be introduced and passed by Parliament.

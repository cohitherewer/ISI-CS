(AFP)																								Rio de Janeiro, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Rio de Janeiro, Brazils top travel destination, yesterday appealed a court order requiring US tourists to be fingerprinted and photographed.																								Rios deputy attorney general Alberto Guimaraes Junior, also said compensation was being sought from the federal government for losses in tourism earnings. He gave no estimate of the value being claimed.																								Earlier yesterday, Rios special secretary for tourism Rubem Medina said that the identification system, which began on January 1 in response to a similar US programme for travellers entering the US, could halve the number of American tourists to Rio,																								We make an enormous effort to attract and win over US tourists, and a decision like that one puts us at risk of losing everything, he said. Some 20 per cent of the 350,000 foreign visitors to Rio every year are US tourists, Medina said.																								Some US tourists arriving to Rio de Janeiro on Monday were kept waiting up to eight hours, causing many of them to miss connecting flights or a day of sightseeing.																								Ours is all electronic scanning and in and out in a heartbeat. Here its 15 minutes, 20 minutes per person, said Lorin Hall, a US tourist who arrived in Rio over the weekend.																								Donna Hrinak, US ambassador to Brazil, said in Brasilia that the US and Brazil were trying to find a way to speed up the identification process. The measure was ordered by a Brazilian judge last week in response to the US system that went into effect on Monday.																								It requires visitors from many countries, including Brazil, to be digitally photographed and fingerprinted on arrival at 115 US airports and 14 cruise ship ports.																								Critics argue the system is not only humiliating but also ineffective because it exempts tourists and business travellers on short visits from 27 mostly European nations as well as Canadians, who fall under special immigration rules.																								Brazilian authorities are mainly concerned that their system will hurt business as cities like Rio prepare for the peak tourist season and the famous Carnival bash next month.																								Its another issue that could curtail the increase in the flow of US tourists to the country at a moment when we are intensifying our marketing campaigns, said Ricardo Schaefer, a special advisor to tourism minister Walfrido dos Mares Guia.																								US travellers to Brazil have increased 58 per cent between 1997 and 2003, Schaefer said.																								Medina said attorneys for the city will argue that federal Judge Julier Sebastiao da Silva acted outside his constitutional power by ordering the system. UN target																								With the US tightening restrictions on foreigners entering the country, UN officials, even high-ranking ones, have been a target of searches and detention.																								I know that in the past my colleagues from West Asia with Islamic names have had problems, and theyve been detained sometimes at the airport, UN secretary-general Kofi Annan told reporters yesterday.																								But he said it was too early to judge whether thousands of UN staff. most of whom are not US citizens, were subject to fingerprinting and photographs, a new system initiated by the US at airports this week.																								UN officials have said Thoraya Obaid, a Saudi Arabian citizen and head of the UN Population Fund, has had difficulty entering the US and reported incidents at UN cabinet meetings.																								She holds the rank of undersecretary-general and carries a special UN passport as well as her national one.

 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Taiwans Chen wins razor-thin poll race

(AFP)Taipei, March 20 (Reuters): Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian won re-election today, a day after he was hit by gunfire from a would-be assassin, in the closest such election in the islands history and in a result almost certain to anger China.																								Quivering with rage, Nationalist Party opponent Lien Chan swiftly challenged the razor-thin result, demanding the election be declared invalid and saying he would ask for a recount.																								The political drama of Chens victory was underscored by his victory by just 29,158 votes out of 12.9 million votes cast and by the failure of his referendum on boosting defences against China that had been his brainchild and the heart of his campaign.																								The election is over, Chen said, trying to draw a line under the potentially destabilising quarrel over the result.																								Even those of us with different beliefs and ideals should use love and forgiveness to create a new Taiwan, he said.																								Ten thousand supporters gathered outside Chens Taipei campaign headquarters, screaming with delight, waving the green banners of his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and setting off a storm of firecrackers into the Taipei night sky.																								Analysts said this narrowest of wins could be due to an 11th-hour sympathy vote after the unidentified gunman fired twice at Chen. Most analysts had expected Chen to lose based on underground gambling and secret opinion polls by newspapers.																								Lien chose not to concede defeat and instead challenged Chens re-election by calling the vote unfair and saying many question marks still hung over Fridays bizarre shooting in which a bullet gashed the Presidents abdomen. We want to raise a motion to declare the election invalid, Lien, head of the Nationalist Party or Kuomintang, told cheering supporters.																								We ask the central election commission to seize and seal all ballot boxes, he said, demanding a recount. At the heart of the controversy was the high number of invalid ballots. Invalid votes totalled 337,297, almost triple the 122,278 invalid votes in 2000 and up from 117,160 in the 1996 presidential election.China factor																								China was paying close attention to developments in Taiwan after Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a thin margin, a source close to Taiwan policy making said today. After Taiwans first referendum failed, the source quoted a Chinese government statement as saying the result showed the vote was unpopular and added that efforts to split China were doomed to failure.

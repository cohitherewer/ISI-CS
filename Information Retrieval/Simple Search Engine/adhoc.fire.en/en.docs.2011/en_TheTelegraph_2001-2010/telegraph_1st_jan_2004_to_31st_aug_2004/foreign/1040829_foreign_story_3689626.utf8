				 	 An Awami League activist during the protests in Dhaka. (AFP)																								Dhaka, Aug. 28 (Reuters): More than 100 people were injured in clashes in Bangladesh today during a second strike in less than a week called by the countrys main Opposition party to protest at a grenade attack that nearly killed its leader.																								The dawn-to-dusk strike called by the Awami League shut shops, schools and businesses across the turbulent Muslim-majority democracy.																								A week ago, at least seven grenades were thrown at a crowded rally that Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was addressing in Dhaka. Nineteen people were killed and more than 150 wounded in blasts.																								Hasinas Awami League launched a wave of strikes and marches to protest against the blasts and the coalition government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. Khaleda and Hasina are bitter rivals who have not spoken for 14 years. 																								The worst violence erupted today in Dhunat, a small town northwest of Dhaka, where police fired blanks to disperse clashing groups of Awami League and ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) activists. 																								At least 30 people were hurt, including a policeman. Another 30 people were injured in clashes in Birganj, some 420 km northwest of Dhaka. 																								We will call for more protests after todays strike despite the governments efforts to obstruct us from holding peaceful protests, Abdus Shaheed, a senior Awami League, lawmaker, said. 																								Officials say the police did not obstruct peaceful protests and acted only when they turned violent.																								More than 330 people have been injured in the Opposition protests over the past week, which also included strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday.																								After todays strike ended, traffic started trickling back onto Dhakas streets which were almost deserted earlier.																								The capital, which witnessed several small protests, was mostly peaceful with just three people being slightly injured when small explosives were thrown into a bus.																								Analysts say while the campaign poses no immediate threat to the government, political tension will stay high.																								And business leaders say strikes cost the impoverished country more than $60 million a day in lost production. 																								Cargo handling was suspended in the countrys main port in Chittagong in the south. The Awami League and Hasina say militants close to Islamic parties in Khaledas ruling coalition were behind the attack on last Saturdays rally.

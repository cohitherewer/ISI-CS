 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Bush sends Karzai back to work
				 	 George W. Bush and Hamid Karzai (left) in the Rose Garden of the White House. (AFP)Washington, June 16 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai mused lightheartedly today that it might be nice to stay in the US, but President George W. Bush suggested he get home and go to work.																								Its been nice visiting the US again. One likes to stay here and not go, its such a good country, Karzai said in the White House Rose Garden.																								Bush was cool to the suggestion, jokingly telling the Afghan leader: Get home and get to work, will you? 																								Thank you, yes, Karzai said in response. At home in Afghanistan, Karzai faces an insurgency and constant threat of assassination.																								In contrast, in Washington he receives royal treatment typically reserved for only the closest of allies.																								Karzai met Bushs top advisers, addressed a joint meeting of Congress, and sat down for a private lunch with the American President and First Lady.

 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Benazir indicted on fresh charges
				 	 Benazir Bhutto at the Geneva court house. (AP)																								Geneva, July 1 (Reuters): Pakistans former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who successfully appealed a Swiss money laundering conviction last year, has been indicted again on fresh and more serious charges, lawyers said today.																								Bhutto, who denies the charges as well as any links to $13.8 million frozen in Swiss accounts, was indicted by investigating magistrate Christine Junod at a closed-door hearing in Geneva where she appeared yesterday, her lawyer Alec Reymond said.																								Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari were convicted of money-laundering a year ago in Geneva under a law allowing a senior investigating judge to hand down a ruling without a full trial. But it was thrown out automatically upon appeal, sparking a new hearing which has led to the indictment on charges of money-laundering by profession, an aggravated charge of repeatedly profiting from large sums of dirty money.																								The politically charged case, tied to alleged kickbacks, began seven years ago. The new charges were laid as the initial charge was nearing a seven-year statute of limitations.																								The object of the hearing was to inform her of the aggravated charge of money-laundering by profession, Reymond said. Conviction on the simple money-laundering charge carried a sentence of up to three years in prison, but the aggravated charge can lead to up to five years in prison.																								The Pakistan government accuses Bhutto, who lives in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai but still leads the Pakistan Peoples Party in opposition to military President Pervez Musharraf, of stashing millions of dollars in kickbacks linked to contracts awarded to two Swiss-based inspection companies.																								Swiss judicial authorities have blocked some $13 million in Swiss bank accounts held by offshore companies allegedly linked to the couples aides. There is nothing ... linking her to these accounts, Reymond said.																								After the magistrate completes her investigation, the case is returned to the Geneva prosecutor who must decide whether it should go before a criminal tribunal or be thrown out.

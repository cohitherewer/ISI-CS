 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Wardrobe malfunction angers US watchdogs 
																								Washington, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The US media watchdog yesterday promised to investigate whether indecency rules were broken during the broadcast of the Super Bowl half-time entertainment show when pop singer Janet Jacksons bodice was ripped by partner Justin Timberlake.																								During the break in the National Football Leagues championship game, Timberlake reached for Jackson as they sang a duet and tore off part of her black leather bustier, prompting widespread outrage.																								US Federal Communications Commission chairman Michael Powell promised a quick and thorough investigation of the stunt aired during one of the most popular American television broadcasts, which also attracts a major worldwide audience. That celebration was tainted by a classless, crass and deplorable stunt, Powell said in a statement that was echoed by others on the panel. Our nations children, parents and citizens deserve better.																								Television networks are already on the defensive, with the FCC taking a more aggressive stand against indecency and Congress threatening to sharply raise fines for such incidents.																								Viacom Incs CBS, which aired the show, has been under fire in recent months for refusing to air political advertisements during the game and for shunting a controversial movie about former President Ronald Reagan to cable from the broadcast network. 																								CBS and its other unit MTV, which produced the half-time bonanza, apologised for what they described as an unscripted moment. Timberlake said it was a wardrobe malfunction.																								We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen, CBS said. 																								The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologise to anyone who was offended.																								A spokesman for CBS had no immediate comment on the probe and a Viacom spokesman was not immediately available for comment. 																								The NFL said it would not likely allow MTV to produce another half-time show.

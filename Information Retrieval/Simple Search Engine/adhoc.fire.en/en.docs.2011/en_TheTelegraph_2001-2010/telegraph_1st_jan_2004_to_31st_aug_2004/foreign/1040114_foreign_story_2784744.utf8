 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 China battles Sars report
																								Beijing, Jan. 13 (Reuters): China debunked rumours today that a sick man in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen was a possible Sars case, but a Hong Kong television report said one of two earlier suspected cases had been confirmed as having the deadly virus.																								Shenzhen garment trader Chen Xiaohe, 38, had Sars-like symptoms a month ago, but doctors determined he was suffering from a form of bacterial pneumonia, Xinhua news agency said. 																								The Xinhua comment came as Asia faced a new health scare in bird flu, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) confirming that the disease had killed three people in Vietnam. Chen was put into intensive care on January 10 for respiratory distress, coupled with other symptoms such as pneumonia, respiratory failure and failure of other organs in the chest, the agency said. His condition was now under control.																								Shenzhen City has strictly followed the requirements for reporting set by the World Health Organisation, Zhou Junan, head of the health bureau of Shenzhen City, was quoted as saying. There has been no confirmed or suspected Sars case in Shenzhen since winter.																								Shenzhen is a special economic zone surrounded by Guangdong and the former British colony of Hong Kong.																								In Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong about 90 km northwest of Shenzhen, a 20-year-old waitress had been confirmed as having Sars, Hong Kong Cable Television said, the countrys second confirmed case of the deadly disease in just over a week. The television station quoted sources from Chinas health ministry as saying a formal announcement would be made later.																								Last week China confirmed its first Sars case since the WHO declared an end to the last outbreak in July. That victim has now recovered and left hospital.																								Yesterday, China reported a third suspected case of Sars in a 35-year-old investor in Guangzhou.																								WHO researchers in Guangdong, working with the health ministry, are examining all possible sources of Sars infection  animals, humans and the environment. The government has ordered a cull of civets  weasel-like animals that are a local delicacy and the prime suspect  in hopes of averting an outbreak. 																								The virus first emerged in Guangdong late in 2002 and went on to infect more than 8,000 people in nearly 30 countries, killing nearly 800.																								Singapore will start taking the temperature of school students this week to guard against a fresh outbreak of the deadly respiratory illness, the government said yesterday.

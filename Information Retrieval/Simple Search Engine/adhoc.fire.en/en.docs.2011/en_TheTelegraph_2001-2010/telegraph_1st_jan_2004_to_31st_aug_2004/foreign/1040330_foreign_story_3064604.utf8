 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Gasping Ireland stops smoking
																								Dublin, March 29 (Reuters): Ireland became the first country in the world to outlaw cigarettes in all its restaurants and pubs today, to the delight of non-smokers but the dismay of some publicans worried about having to police the ban.																								From midnight yesterday it became illegal to smoke in virtually all workplaces, closed public spaces and on public transport, with fines of up to 3,000 euros ($3,825) for transgressors.																								While similar bans have been imposed in cities and states elsewhere in the world, including in California and New York, Ireland is the first country to impose such a ban nationally.																								Sheila Montgomery, a non-smoking office worker welcomed the new law: I gave up going to the pub because I just hated the stink on my clothes ... but this changes everything.																								The bold move in a country not traditionally known for its healthy lifestyle will be closely monitored by other European governments considering similar legislation.																								Health minister Micheal Martin marked the historic day by savouring a smoke-free breakfast in Bewleys Oriental Cafe on Grafton Street  a hub of Dublin social life since the 19th century. With the rate of heart disease in Ireland the highest in Europe, Martin described the ban as a no-brainer.																								We have to do something extra, go the extra mile, to get that rate down. Anti-smoking group ASH said smoking killed six times as many people in Ireland each year than road accidents, work accidents, drugs, murder, suicide and AIDS combined.																								Earlier this year I referred to this legislation as the health initiative of the century, said Prof. Luke Clancy, chairman of ASH Ireland. I have no doubt that research will in time justify this statement.																								Others were not so enthusiastic. For me personally, its a bridge too far, said electrician Shay Mahoney.																								I mean, whats next, compulsory haircuts? asked Mahoney, who said he has smoked 20 cigarettes a day for the past 20 years but did not think the landlord at his local pub in north Dublin would enforce the legislation.																								At Neds Bar in Dublin, a so-called early house which for the past 50 years has been opening at 7 am for workers coming off nightshift, manager David Coulahan said he feared for his job if the first morning of the ban was anything to go by.																								Were normally spinning at this hour of the morning, even on a Monday, but most of our smokers are missing, he said.																								For thousands of office workers arriving at their desks on Monday morning, the new law will make little difference as their employers have already imposed their own smoking bans.																								The real test will come later in the day when the countrys famously hospitable pubs get into full swing.																								The Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI), which represents some 6,000 Irish publicans, has instructed its members to comply with the law, but says it is unfair to expect them to police it.																								I think its unenforceable and unnecessary. I support the idea of encouraging people to give up smoking but this is not going to encourage them, this is, if anything, going to antagonise people, said VFI chief executive Tadg Sullivan.																								The impact of the ban will be closely watched across Europe. Norway is set to impose a similar ban in June and European Union health commissioner David Byrne, who is Irish, has said he would like to see the experiment mirrored throughout the bloc.Herbal solution																								Cigarette vending-machine companies in Ireland are pinning their hopes on a herbal remedy to the countrys smoking ban.																								Fearing a huge dent in profits, restaurants and workplaces, operators plan to stock their machines with tobacco-free herbal cigarettes.																								Its not going to be a problem  theyre not covered by the legislation, which only relates to tobacco products, Gerry Lawler, vice-chairman of the Irish Cigarette Machine Operators Association (ICMOA), said on Friday.																								He said ICMOA, which has around 150 members, had imported one million aromatic cigarettes ahead of the ban and would place further orders depending on customer demand.																								Under Irelands pioneering legislation, it will still be legal to sell conventional cigarettes in pubs and restaurants as long as they are not smoked on the premises.

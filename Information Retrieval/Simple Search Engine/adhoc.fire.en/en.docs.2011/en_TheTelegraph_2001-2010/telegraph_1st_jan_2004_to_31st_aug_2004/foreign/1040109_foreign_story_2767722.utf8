 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Silvio CD too syrupy to swallow
				 	 Silvio Berlusconi																								Rome, Jan. 8 (Reuters): What does a man who has everything  including a wife  give some 2,000 other women for the New Year?																								If youre a billionaire Prime Minister who was once a cruise ship crooner, the choice is obvious  a CD of your songs.																								Silvio Berlusconi has given the women who work at the various departments of the Prime ministers office a CD of 14 songs he has written, according to a senator and a union leader.																								The album of ballads called Meglio Una Canzone (Better a Song) features Berlusconis lyrics sung by Mariano Apicella, a guitar-playing musician he met in a hotel bar in Naples in 2001. The songs include such syrupy lyrics as: Without you my day is empty and my night is sad, or Never leave me alone, stay here with me. Dont leave me alone, I need you.																								The CD was on the desks of some 2,000 women employees when they returned to work after the New Year holidays.																								But not everyone was amused.																								The gifts prompted questions about who footed the bill and why no male employees had apparently received the CDs. 																								Senator Sandro Battisti of the Opposition Margherita party said he sent a formal question to Berlusconis office asking who paid for the CDs and their delivery costs.																								Political sources said they believed that Berlusconi, Italys richest man, paid for them personally.																								Battisti said he thought Berlusconi was arrogant to sending the CD, which went on sale last October, saying it was a form of promotion for a commercial project.																								Alba Agostini, a union leader representing civil servants in the Prime Ministers department, said she hoped the women who received the CD had the intelligence and dignity to see the gift for what it was worth.																								Such zeal should have been destined to a greater cause, she added in a statement.

				 Pak doesnt need help to hunt Osama

																								Davos (Switzerland), Jan. 23 (Reuters): President Pervez Musharraf said today that Pakistans army was hounding al Qaida and needed no US help in hunting Osama bin Laden on its own soil.
																								Musharraf was asked at a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, if he would consider allowing US troops to join the search for the al Qaida leader on Pakistans side of the border with Afghanistan.
																								No sir, that is not a possibility at all. Its a very sensitive issue, Musharraf said. 
																								There is no room for any foreign elements coming and assisting us, we dont need any assistance.
																								Musharrafs backing for the US in its war on terror is violently opposed by militant groups inside Pakistan. 
																								He survived two assassination attempts last month, which he blamed on collusion between al Qaida and sectarian extremists. The President said he conjectured that bin Laden was most likely moving around somewhere in the mountainous border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
																								No country in the world has done as much against al Qaida as Pakistan, he said. We are the ones who got about 600 of them... We are hounding them in our tribal areas, not allowing them to stay there and operate from there.

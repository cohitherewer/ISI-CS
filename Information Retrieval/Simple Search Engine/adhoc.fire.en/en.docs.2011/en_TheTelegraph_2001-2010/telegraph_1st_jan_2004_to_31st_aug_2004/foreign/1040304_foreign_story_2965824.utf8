 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 A dash of colour on a catwalk by grey Israel wall
				 	 A model for an Israeli fashion house poses near the wall in east Jerusalem. (Reuters)Jerusalem, March 3 (Reuters): Fashion models sashayed beside the controversial barrier Israel is building inside the West Bank today to encourage Israeli and Palestinian women to work together for peace.																								As women, we are trying to cross boundaries many times a day, said Sybil Goldfiner, CEO of the feminist Israeli fashion house Comme-il-faut, which turned the construction site for the wall on Jerusalems fringes into a catwalk. 																								We offer a suggestion, or the hope, that women from both sides who bring life into this world will unify to stop this killing that has gone on for too long. 																								The models, garbed in vivid summer outfits, were from Slovenia, Russia, Poland, France and Israel. Goldfiner said she tried in vain to recruit Palestinian models. Israel restricts entry of Palestinians, citing security. Goldfiner said the stark juxtaposition of the grey eight-metre-barrier and the orange, blue and pink frocks worn by the models aimed to shock 15,000 catalogue customers into reflecting on the current reality. 																								We wanted to bring the picture of normality  fashion, colour, optimism  and put it next to the abnormality of the wall with its despair and greyness.																								 This combination of normal and abnormal is the picture of reality in Israel. Israel says that the wire-and-concrete network of barriers that loops into the West Bank is necessary to keep out suicide bombers, who have killed scores of Israelis in its cities and towns in the past three years of violence.																								Palestinians call the barrier a grab of occupied land to deny them a viable state because it often diverges well into the West Bank to take in Jewish settlements. The legality of the barrier is currently under the scrutiny of the World Court in The Hague.																								As make-up artists sprayed and primped models and photographers snapped away, Palestinian carpenter Ibrahim Kareshs wife was preparing lunch for them on the other side of the barrier, in the West Bank village of al-Ayzariah.																								This is very important so that the whole world sees how Israelis and Palestinians can live together and it is governments that put up fences, said Karesh of the project.																								He said the barrier, under construction 50 metres from his yard, posed difficulties for his house-run carpentry business, which depends on Jerusalem clientele.																								I see the fence and I get angry. Why, why on earth did they put this here? It isnt going to help anyway.

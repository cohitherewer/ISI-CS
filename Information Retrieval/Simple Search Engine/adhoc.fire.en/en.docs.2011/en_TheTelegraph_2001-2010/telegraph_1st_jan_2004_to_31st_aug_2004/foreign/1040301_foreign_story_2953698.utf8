The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Haiti in turmoil, President flees
				 	 Aristide: Out																								Port-au-Prince (Haiti), Feb. 29 (Reuters): Haitis President Jean-Bertrand Aristide left his chaotic Caribbean country today, driven out by a bloody revolt that put rebels near the capital and by pressure from the US and France.																								Aristide said he departed to avert bloodshed but turmoil persisted in the capital Port-au-Prince, where shooting rang out as armed Aristide supporters roamed the streets and looters ransacked a police station.																								The US ambassador to Haiti said international military forces would soon come to Haiti and urged the rebels to lay down their arms.																								Aristide, 50, whose role in a popular uprising that ended decades of dictatorship in the 1980s once made him a hero of Haitian democracy, left early this morning, 24 days after the uprising began in the poorest country in the Americas.																								His departure was arranged by US officials. At his request, we facilitated his safe departure, a state department official, who asked not to be named, said in Washington.																								Within hours, Haitian Chief Justice Boniface Alexandre was named as Aristides replacement as laid out in the constitution.																								Aristides destination was unclear but first reports said he flew initially to the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.																								Prime Minister Yvon Neptune read a statement by Aristide in which he said: Today is a very difficult day...I am determined to respect the constitution...Today, my resignation is to avoid bloodshed.																								With the rebels closing in on Port-au-Prince, many had feared a bloody battle for control between them and Aristides militant supporters. The revolt has already killed nearly 70 people.																								Speaking at a ceremony at Neptunes home, US ambassador James Foley said Aristide departed at 6.15 am (1015 GMT). The Haitian consul in neighbouring Dominican Republic said Aristide was probably travelling to Morocco, but Morocco said it would not grant him political asylum.																								Reaction to news of Aristides departure in the streets of Port-au-Prince was swift and angry. Armed bands of chimeres, the most militant and ruthless of Aristides supporters from the slums roamed the city in pickup trucks, armed with shotguns and other weapons.																								A US official in Washington said Aristides departure had averted a bloodbath. We managed to stave that off. But we are heading into another dangerous period because any vacuum in Haiti could also be dangerous.																								Police guarding Haitis main prison near the National Palace ran away, some changing out of their uniforms to avoid detection, witnesses said. The jail emptied. An estimated 2,000 inmates including murderers and other hard-core criminals melted into the streets.

 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Truce holds, Apache falls in scarred Iraq
				 	 A US Marine picks up grenade launchers and ammunition confiscated during raids in Falluja on Sunday. (AFP)																								Falluja, April 11 (Reuters): Civilians fled Falluja today after an informal truce halted a week of fighting between US forces and rebels in which hundreds of Iraqis died.																								Only sporadic gunfire crackled in the town, but guerrillas shot down a US Apache attack helicopter just west of Baghdad airport and the US military said its two-man crew was killed.																								Iraqs US administrator Paul Bremer said no terms had been imposed on rebels in Falluja, where Iraqi mediators have been talking with town leaders and insurgents for the past two days.																								Grabbing their chance, desperate families fled combat zones in the town of 300,000. Sunni Muslim fighters, who have been battling US Marines from street to street, remained inside.																								Fifteen food trucks reached Falluja with banners proclaiming they were a gift from the Baghdad stronghold of radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who launched an anti-US revolt across Iraq a week ago.																								It was the latest of several striking shows of Sunni-Shia solidarity against the US-led occupation elicited by Iraqs bloodiest week of violence since the fall of Saddam Hussein.																								In Baghdad, witnesses said US troops used tanks to smash into the compound of a Sunni mosque in a night raid on the Adhamiya area, where gunmen fought the Americans yesterday.																								The US military had no immediate comment. Goods collected for Falluja victims were destroyed in the raid, witnesses said. They used knives to rip open the bags full of beans and flour, and kicked over oil cans, resident Falah Mahmud said.																								US forces have stirred a hornets nest in Iraq by sparking a confrontation with Sadrs Mehdi Army militia while simultaneously cracking down on Sunni insurgents.																								The wave of hostage-taking is a symptom of rising hostility in both communities to a US-led administration that plans to hand power to an interim Iraqi government on June 30. 																								The plan may involve expanding Iraqs governing council, but the current crisis has further strained its credibility.																								A lot of us here in Baghdad and elsewhere were appalled by the loss of life and destruction because there was too much force used, council member Adnan Pachachi said of the assault on Falluja, saying negotiation or pressure could have been used. 																								The disproportionate response seems to a lot of people unjustified, he told the BBC.																								In Falluja, overnight clashes gave way to calm by dawn after intense efforts to arrange a ceasefire. International relief groups say 470 Iraqis have been killed there and 1,200 wounded, including 243 women and 200 children, in the past week.																								Over 50 US and allied troops have been killed across Iraq in the same period.																								Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt told a news conference a US soldier had died of wounds after fighting in Baquba, north of Baghdad, on Friday. He said about 20 insurgents had been killed.																								The Marines attacked Falluja, a bastion of insurgency west of Baghdad, last week in response to the murder and mutilation of four American private security guards ambushed in the town.																								The rebels want US forces to lift their siege and leave the town.

 Sunday, February 22, 2004 				 China plans to send more astronauts into space
																								Beijing, Feb. 21 (Reuters): China, which last year became the third nation to blast a man into space, plans to send two astronauts up on a five-to-seven-day mission in 2005 and later build a space station, state television reported today.																								Wang Yongzhi, chief designer of the nations secretive manned space programme, told CCTV preparations for the launch of the two-person Shenzhou VI craft were proceeding smoothly. Last October, solo astronaut Yang Liwei circled Earth 14 times during a 21-hour trip aboard the Shenzhou V, a name meaning Divine Ship.																								A previous report by the semi-official China New Service had said China wanted to put three people into space aboard the next Shenzhou mission.																								We will continue by launching Shenzhou VII, Shenzhou VIII and so on, carry out spacewalks, make space dockings and set up a space laboratory, Wang told CCTV. He said astronauts would stay aboard the orbiting lab for short periods, with spacecraft ferrying them back and forth. Eventually, China would launch a larger space station capable of carrying out more extensive experiments, he said. Chinas team of 14 trained astronauts, including Yang, have been placed in seven pairs to train for the next mission and three of the pairs will be finalists to fly it.																								China is also preparing to select and train new astronauts as the current ones are all over the age of 30, Xinhua said. 																								Wangs remarks were broadcast just a day after he and another scientist received Chinas annual State Science and Technology award from President Hu Jintao.

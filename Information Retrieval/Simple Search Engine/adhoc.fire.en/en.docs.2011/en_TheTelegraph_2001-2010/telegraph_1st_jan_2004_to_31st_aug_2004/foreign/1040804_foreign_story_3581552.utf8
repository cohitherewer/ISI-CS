																								Singapore, August 3 (Reuters): A senior Citibank executive in Singapore has been charged with embezzling S$4.8 million ($2.8 million) from the US-based bank over 7 years using its computer system, a newspaper reported today.																								The 38-year-old man, accused of using Citibanks computers to transfer the money into his own account and those of several others between May 1996 and August 2003, was charged with 104 counts under the Computer Misuse Act, the Straits Times said.																								The case, Singapores biggest reported fraud under the Computer Misuse Act, was heard in a district court on Friday and reported today.

The man is in custody in Singapore and will appear again in court on August 13, a court official said.

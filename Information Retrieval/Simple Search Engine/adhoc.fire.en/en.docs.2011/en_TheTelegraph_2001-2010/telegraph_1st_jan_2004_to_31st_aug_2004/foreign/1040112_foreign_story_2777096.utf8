 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Anger over prisoner of war status for Saddam
																								Baghdad, Jan. 11 (AP): Iraqi officials expressed fears that a Pentagon decision to confer prisoner of war status on Saddam Hussein will prevent them from putting the ousted leader on trial. 																								However, the International Red Cross said PoW status does not preclude prosecution.																								US officials in Baghdad sought to assure Iraqis that no deal was made to keep them from trying the ousted dictator and that Iraq will have a substantial leadership role when the former Iraqi President finally faces justice. 																								There is no need for concern by anybody because the ultimate designation (of Saddams status) will be determined down the road, Dan Senor, a spokesperson for the US-led occupation authority, said yesterday.																								On Friday, a Pentagon spokesperson, Major Michael Shavers, said the defence departments top civilian lawyers have determined that Saddam is a prisoner of war because of his status as former commander in chief of Iraqs military.																								PoW status under the Geneva conventions grants Saddam certain rights, including access to visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross and freedom from coercion of any kind during interrogations.																								The Geneva agreements say PoWs can be tried for crimes against humanity only by an international tribunal or the occupying power, which in Iraq is the US. 																								I am surprised by this decision, said Dara Nor al-Din, a former appeals court judge and member of Iraqs US-backed governing council. 																								We still consider Saddam a criminal and he will be tried on this basis. This new move will be discussed thoroughly in the governing council.  Demand for damages																								Scores of angry protesters gathered today in Amara in southern Iraq, demanding compensation for five Iraqis killed when police and British troops opened fire to quell a violent demonstration.

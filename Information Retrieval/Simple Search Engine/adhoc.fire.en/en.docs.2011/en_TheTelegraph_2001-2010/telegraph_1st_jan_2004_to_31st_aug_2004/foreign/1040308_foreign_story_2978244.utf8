 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Iran hawks amp; doves in scuffle
																								Tehran, March 7 (Reuters): Conservative and reformist legislators scuffled in Irans parliament today after a reformist lawmaker called on a panel of clerics to examine the performance of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.																								The brief bout of pushing and shouting involving around a dozen deputies reflected simmering political tension following parliamentary elections last month which reformists allege were rigged in advance to ensure a conservative victory.																								Outspoken reformist deputy Ali Akbar Mousavi-Khoeini, one of several dozen reformist legislators barred from standing for re-election, called on Irans Assembly of Experts to decide whether Khamenei had acted properly over the election dispute.																								Reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami have questioned whether Khamenei, who has the last word on all state matters, tacitly supported the hardline Guardian Councils decision to ban hundreds of reformists from the election race.

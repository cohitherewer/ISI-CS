 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Shaken expats leaving Riyadh
				 	 US expatriate Paul Johnson who was beheaded by al Qaida militants on June 18 in Riyadh. (Reuters)																								Riyadh, June 23 (Reuters): Westerners in Saudi Arabia, shaken by a spate of militant attacks, are sending their families home, moving to neighbouring countries and thinking of leaving the kingdom for good, expatriates said today.																								Already unsettled by a surge in violence, many fear that the attacks could escalate further in revenge for the slaying of al Qaidas leader in Saudi Arabia, Abdulaziz al-Muqrin. None of those I contacted see this as the end of the story. I personally see this is the first battle in a long struggle, one western businessman said.																								Many people I know have sent their families and children on extended vacations, he said, declining to be identified for security reasons.																								Saudi security forces killed al Qaida leaders in the kingdom and three other militants on Friday, hours after they beheaded US hostage Paul Johnson. Al Qaida has vowed to continue its jihad to expel westerners and topple Saudi Arabias royal rulers.																								Fearing more bloodshed, many westerners have sent their families on early vacations and some firms have relocated their western staff to neighbouring Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Everyone is now waiting to see if al Qaida will avenge the latest blow delivered to them, one economist said.																								Foreign minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said today he was unaware of a mass exodus of westerners and pledged the kingdom would do all it could to protect them.																								But analysts said the year-long bloody battle between Saudi forces and al Qaida militants, which has killed at least 85 civilians and police, has cast a cloud over the business and investment climate in the worlds biggest oil exporter. There is a state of uncertainty. Nobody knows whether this is the end or the start of it, a German embassy spokesman said.																								Economists say the uncertainty is hurting business.																								Many large companies, banks, oil firms and refineries are suffering from the increasing cost of relocating their foreign staff elsewhere in the Gulf, a Jeddah-based economist said.																								Foreign and local investors are also holding off any decisions on long-term projects, until they see where the security situation is heading. A spokesman for the British firm BAE Systems , the lead contractor on a Saudi defence deal, said it had not yet implemented relocation plans for staff but was advising employees to send dependents home. Its business as usual for us, he said. 																								The US embassy in Riyadh has advised all 35,000 Americans in the kingdom to leave, warning that militants may be monitoring the movements of westerners ahead of more attacks.

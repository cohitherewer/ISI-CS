 CHRIS HASTINGS AND COLIN BROWN				 	 Carole: Eye of a storm																								London, March 7: Peter Foster, the convicted conman who helped Cherie Blair buy two flats, has made lurid claims of an intimate relationship between her lifestyle guru Carole Caplin and husband Tony Blair.																								Downing Street last night declined to comment on specific details of Fosters sordid claims, which emerged in a newspaper interview in his native Australia and circulated around the world yesterday.																								A No. 10 spokesman accused the conman of trying to draw attention to his memoirs which are due to be published within a few days. This is the latest attempt by Peter Foster to get publicity for his supposed book. We have absolutely no intention of taking these claims seriously and neither should anyone else.																								In an article headlined Tony Blair was intimate with my girlfriend, Foster, who has been jailed in Britain, Australia and America, told the Sun Herald in Sydney that the memoirs would contain a weapon of mass destruction. Caplin said: This is just a new way for Peter to get attention. He is just a fantasist and these absurd stories shouldnt be given any credibility.																								Foster has been working on his autobiography, which is being ghost-written by Richard Shears of the Daily Mail, since being deported to Australia from Dublin last year. He has boasted that the book, entitled A Question of Deceit, would contain information that could bring down Blair.																								In his Sun Herald interview he added: People think that Cherie is the ugly duckling who Carole advised with clothes and make-up and styling. The truth is that Tony relied on Carole, too... She picked his clothes, right down to his underpants.																								The intensity and the closeness of their relationship was something I saw and I was amazed by and annoyed by.																								He has also made the extraordinary claim that Caplin, his former lover who was employed by Blair as her stylist, was in love with Tony Blair. The heart of my book is the extraordinary influence that Carole has over Tony. The British publics greatest misconception is that Carole and Cherie Blair are the star relationship. The true relationship is between Carole and Tony. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

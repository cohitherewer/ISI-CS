 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Berlusconi sets record at the helm in Italy
																								Rome, May 4 (Reuters): Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis government enters the record books tomorrow, having survived 1,060 days to become Italys longest-serving administration since World War Two.																								The modesty of that record says much about Italys fragile post-World War Two political system, which has spawned 59 governments in as many years against a backdrop of constantly shifting loyalties and Machiavellian intrigues.																								The fact it has been achieved at all says something for the drive of the charismatic Berlusconi, who created his Forza Italia party in the ruins of an entrenched party system that collapsed amid corruption scandals in the early 1990s.																								The media mogul-turned-politician presented himself as a new force to clean up the discredited image of Italian politics.																								Elected in May 2001 with the biggest majority in the history of the Italian republic, he has worked hard to keep fractious, Centre-Right partners together, arguing that Italy can progress only if it embraces political stability. Leftist Opposition parties, without clear leadership, remain divided.																								Opponents have used the milestone to belittle the governments achievements, but Berlusconi says he will need many years in office to complete his reform programme. I see myself as leader of the government in the next legislature and in the one after that, he said recently.																								The previous record was set by the now-disgraced Bettino Craxi, implicated in corruption scandals.

(AFP)																								Colombo, April 4 (Reuters): Sri Lanka was left with a hung parliament today that may delay resumption of peace talks with Tamil rebels after President Chandrika Kumaratungas party won an election but fell short of an absolute majority.																								Voters also sent a mixed message by returning two strong and diametrically opposed ethnic parties  one backed by the Tamil Tiger rebels and the other a party of Buddhist monks.																								The result amounted to a rejection of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes United National Party (UNP), which signed a ceasefire two years ago. 																								It left unresolved how to resume talks with the rebels who are fighting for a Tamil state in the north. Final results gave Kumaratungas Freedom Alliance 105 seats out of 225, eight short of a majority. The UNP won 82 seats.																								Kumaratungas spokesperson Harim Peiris was buoyant: It is quite a drubbing and very clear who got the mandate. The head of state is likely to name a new Prime Minister tomorrow, ending two and a half years of uncomfortable cohabitation with the UNP.																								The Freedom Alliance took 45.8 per cent of the vote, compared with 37.9 per cent for Wickremesinghes party.																								It was, if not 100 per cent, it was near 100 per cent, a free and fair election, elections commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said of the islands least violent ballot in decades.																								The rebel-backed Tamil National Alliance took 22 seats in the north and east. The National Heritage Party of Buddhist monks won nine seats, all in or near Colombo or central Kandy.																								Kumaratungas supporters in parliament are likely to work for support from minor parties. 																								They must also deal with the Peoples Liberation Front (JVP), a nationalist party from the Sinhalese majority which joined the Freedom Alliance this year.																								Although now in the political mainstream, the JVP led two rebellions in which more than 80,000 people died and has been extremely critical of Wickremesinghes peace process. 																								It has also said negotiations are the only way to end the war, however.																								The JVP could be a concern for investors because of its stance against economic reforms and privatisation.																								Kumaratunga had been forced into an awkward cohabitation with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe after a 2001 parliamentary election. 																								But the President, who has wide powers, called the weekend snap election after accusing the Premier of endangering national security by making too many concessions to the rebels.																								The truce has held even though direct talks to end the war that has killed 64,000 broke down a year ago. Efforts to restart them have been snarled up the political disputes in Colombo.																								Sri Lankas economy grew about 5.5 per cent last year and the stock market has surged nearly 80 per cent since the ceasefire was signed in February 2002 as prospects of a peace dividend have lured investors back and aid donors pledged $4.5 billion.																								The Tigers say they will resume negotiations with anyone who has a mandate and the power, but a recent split in the group may also complicate that for the rebels. 																								The Tigers hold a swathe of territory in the north and east but have dropped a long-standing demand for a separate Tamil state in favour of autonomy.

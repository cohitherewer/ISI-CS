 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Joke on Harrods, last laugh for Journal
				 	 The royal coat of arms on the Harrods building in London. (AP)																								London, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Luxury British department store Harrods was left with legal bills estimated at 500,000 ($960,000) today after losing a libel battle with the Wall Street Journal over a story triggered by an April Fools hoax.																								Harrods had sued Dow Jones and Company, the Wall Street Journals publisher, over an article entitled: The Enron of Britain? which appeared in 2002 in one of the Journals regular columns four days after the paper was taken in by an April Fools announcement that Harrods was to be floated.																								While the story acknowledged the newspaper had fallen for the hoax it posed the question whether Harrods was Britains Enron  the US energy giant which went spectacularly bust in 2001 amid revelations it had hidden billions of dollars in debt and had inflated profits to boost its stock price.																								A jury at Londons High Court today threw out the libel claim by Harrods and judge Justice Eady ruled it should pay all legal costs, estimated by one lawyer at the court at 500,000. The court also ordered that Harrods should stump up 40,000 towards Dow Jones bills within 14 days.																								The article at the centre of the libel action appeared in US editions of the Journal on April 5 and in online editions. 																								The court heard it said that should Harrods ever go public, investors would be wise to question its every disclosure. The April Fool announcement had appeared on Harrods owner Mohammed Al Fayeds website, saying that anyone interested in shares could contact Loof Lirpa, or April Fool spelt backwards. 																								Harrods lawyer James Price said that the Wall Street Journal fell for the joke hook line and sinker but added the store was worried about the The Enron of Britain? article being archived on the papers website.																								The Wall Street Journal, which has a US circulation of two million, told the court the piece had been meant to be tongue-in-cheek. The newspapers lawyer Gavin Millar said there had been no attempt to make a real comparison between Harrods and Enron.

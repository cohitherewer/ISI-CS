																								Cambridge, March 18 (AP): Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking has been questioned by detectives about alleged abuses that reportedly left him with a series of unexplained injuries, police said today.																								Hawking, 62, who is paralyzed by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was interviewed yesterday by cambridgeshire police at papworth hospital, said force spokesman tony taylorson.																								It was the first time police have spoken to hawking since opening an investigation late last year into reports that he suffered mysterious injuries, including a broken wrist, gashes to the face and a cut lip.																								For more than 40 years, sclerosis has deprived the scientist of the ability to speak or to move, except for a few fingers he uses to operate a computerized voice box.																								Despite his severe disabilities, hawking is one of the worlds best-known scientists. He serves as lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge university, a post once held by sir isaac newton, and is author of the best-selling book a brief history of time.In january, hawking suffered from pneumonia and was admitted to addenbrookes hospital in cambridge. He has since been moved to papworth hospital in the town of papworth everad.

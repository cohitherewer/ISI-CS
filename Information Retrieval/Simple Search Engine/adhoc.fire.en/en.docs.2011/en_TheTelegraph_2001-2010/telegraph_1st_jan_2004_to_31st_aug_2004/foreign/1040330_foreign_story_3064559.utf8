 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 William prince of slopes, says Charles
 GRAHAM TIBBETTS 				 	 Princes Charles and William take a break from skiing at Klosters, Switzerland. (Reuters)																								London, March 29: Father and son took a break from racing down the slopes at Klosters yesterday, and treated the media to a playful discussion of their sporting talents. 																								Prince William admitted that he came off second best in the skiing stakes. Asked who was the better skier, he pointed to the Prince of Wales and replied: No competition. Hes much better than me, but I give him a run for his money. William confessed that his brother Prince Harry, who is currently spending part of his gap year in Lesotho, was also more accomplished. 																								He said: He wishes he was here. Im quite glad hes not because he makes me look better. quot; 																								A relaxed Prince of Wales leads William down the piste 																								At one point Prince William placed his arm over his fathers shoulder, prompting the Prince of Wales to punch him playfully in the stomach. The pair were evidently enjoying their traditional winter break after a lengthy absence from Klosters, Switzerland. Last year the holiday was ruled out by a hernia operation for Charles and the war in Iraq, two years earlier by the foot and mouth crisis and in 2002 the trip was cut short by the death of the Queen Mother. 																								Looking relaxed and taking the lead in answering questions, William said it was awesome to be back, adding: Its been too long. Prince William at 21 is a vastly different creation from his father at the same age. And that is largely owing to Charles insistence that, in so far as is possible, his elder son be allowed to grow up away from scrutiny. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

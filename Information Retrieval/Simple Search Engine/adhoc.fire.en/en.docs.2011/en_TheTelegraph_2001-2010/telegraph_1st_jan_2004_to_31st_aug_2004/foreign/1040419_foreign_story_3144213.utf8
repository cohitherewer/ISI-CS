 															- Deneuve diaries a disaster 				 	 Catherine Deneuve																								The diaries of Catherine Deneuve, to be published this week for the first time in the film actress 40-year career, make Marilyn Monroe look like an intellectual, according to a scathing review. 																								The legend is shattered, says a critic in Le Figaro, the syrupy, banal diaries being the first faux pas in the actress otherwise faultless career. Lombre de moi-meme  In the shadow of myself  is a collection of personal thoughts from the sets of six films in which Deneuve has starred.																								The actress is famed for her roles as an icy femme fatale and at 60 is considered one of the grandest dames of French cinema. 																								But until now she has consistently refused to put any of her private life and views on paper. From the very first lines, the legend is shattered, laments the unsigned review.																								She who we had every right to consider intelligent, cultured, with a forceful character, good judgment, lofty views and finesse, comes across as a 16-year-old schoolgirl, with a syrupy style and the same view of the world and the film set as any top model from the Elite agency.																								The reviewer mauls the work as a shopping list of banalities: she misses a flight; steals a rubbish bin; she orders real champagne that doesnt resemble pee and has bubbles; she buys nylon stockings with a seam; she finds New Yorkers on Broadway bizarre people, indecent and obese.																								An archetype for Gallic beauty, Deneuve succeeded Brigitte Bardot as the model for Marianne, the symbol of the French Republic seen on French coins and stamps. The couturier Yves Saint Laurent chose her as his muse. But according to Le Figaro, the book Lombre de moi-meme is the latest in a worrying trend of non-books  packaged interviews of famous people that are guaranteed popular success but have no literary merit and discourage true authors.																								Not all the critics are as harsh. Le Nouvel Observateur, which includes an interview with Deneuve, warns readers not to look for juicy backstage gossip  although there is a section on working with Bjork, whom she describes as irrational and unmanageable. The emotion is between the lines, in the silences, writes Le Nouvel Observateur. The actress says as much in the books preface: Get ready for very little.																								Laure Adler, head of the high-brow radio station France Culture, which will broadcast interviews with Deneuve this week, praised her instinct for freedom and hunger for existence. 																								Ok, so its not Shakespeare. But she never intended it to be a polished work. It is a document of fragmentary, uncensored thoughts of a fragile actress constantly questioning herself and searching for the truth.THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Some questions that Hutton left unanswered
 SANDRA LAVILLE AND MICHAEL SMITH London, Jan. 29: Huge areas  of controversy that went to the heart of the governments  motivation in its dealings with David Kelly and the reliability  of the intelligence used to justify war against Iraq were  left unexamined by Lord Hutton.																								The law lord declined to consider whether the intelligence in the governments dossier was of sufficient strength to justify the statement that Saddam Husseins regime posed such a threat to British interests that military action should be taken.																								He also refused to pass judgment on the reliability of the intelligence in the dossier. Even within his narrow role as a quasi coroner examining the circumstances surrounding Kellys death, Hutton appears to have avoided many areas raised as controversial in the inquiry. 																								Kellys family, in their written submissions which were published yesterday, claim there was on the governments part a conscious decision to cause Kellys identity to be revealed.																								Hutton dismisses this. But he appears in his report not to have considered what the family claims is compelling evidence of this in the diaries of Alastair Campbell. They cite as an example not considered in Huttons report this excerpt: We kept pressing on as best we could at the briefings, but the biggest thing needed was the source out. 																								Another area that seems to have escaped comment by Hutton is evidence, the family says, which suggests Kelly was coached before his appearance before the foreign affairs select committee. This was, they said: To ensure that Kelly did not say anything that might embarrass the government and is more evidence of a deliberate strategy to use Kelly in the battle with the BBC.																								Although Hutton accepted the findings of Prof Keith Hawton, an expert in suicide research, that Kelly killed himself as a result of a severe loss of self-esteem and a feeling that people had lost trust in him, he paid no heed to evidence that the MoD had belittled him. 																								They cite Sir Kevin Tebbit, the permanent secretary in the MoD, who admitted that he slightly overdid the relatively junior point. Janice Kelly says this was deeply hurtful to her husband. 																								Much blame is placed by Hutton upon Kelly himself for breaching civil service guidelines when he talked to Gilligan. But the family say he has not considered the hopelessly confused arrangements within the foreign office and MoD defining these rules.																								Key issues about the amendments to the dossier do not merit deep analysis by Hutton because he refused to be drawn on the wider issues of the strength and reliability of the intelligence and whether it justified military action.																								He dismisses one key area in which Jonathan Powell, Blairs chief of staff, appears fundamentally to change the nature of the threat Saddam Hussein poses, making it active rather than defensive.																								Powell referred in a late e-mail to John Scarlett to a part of the dossier which said: Saddam is prepared to use chemical and biological weapons (CBW), if he believes his regime is under threat.																								This was a bit of a problem, Powell said. It backs up the argument that there is no CBW threat and we will only create one if we attack him. I think you should redraft the para[graph].																								Scarlett agreed to redraft it to make the threat active  without consulting the joint intelligence committee. When asked why, he told Hutton that he had the authority to do so and there was intelligence to back it up. Hutton unquestioningly accepted his evidence. The new intelligence was never made public to the inquiry. 																								The law lord also never considered other areas of change in the dossier. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

				 	 Le Pen being pushed into his car as protesters rain rubbish on him. (Reuters)Manchester, April 25 (Reuters): Demonstrators protesting against a visit to Britain by French anti-immigration campaigner Jean-Marie Le Pen chanted fascists out and pelted his car with eggs and rubbish today. 																								Scuffles broke out in Manchester, northern England, as police and bodyguards escorted the National Front leaders car past protesters as he left a press conference by the far-right British National Party. 																								Le Pen was in Britain at the invitation of BNP leader Nick Griffin to help launch the British partys campaign for the June European elections. 																								Le Pen, who was last month fined for inciting racing hatred in Paris, told reporters that France risked being submerged by immigrants.																								France, we had 10 million immigrants in the past 30 years. If this is not stopped the population risks being submerged by these great invasions, he said, speaking in French. 																								Local politicians had condemned Le Pens visit to Manchester, a few kilometres from the scene of violent race riots in the town of Oldham in 2001. 																								Home secretary David Blunkett had warned Le Pen he faced arrest if he provoked racial tension during his visit.																								Id rather Mr Le Pen wasnt here and Id rather the British National Party didnt exist in our country, he told BBC television. 																								Later today, Le Pen will attend a dinner with BNP supporters.

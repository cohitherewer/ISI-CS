 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 To set record straight, Bush releases war files
				 	 Correspondents read copies of President George W. Bushs National Guard files at the White House. (Reuters)																								Washington, Feb 14 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush, trying to stamp out a political firestorm, released all his National Guard files during the Vietnam War today to answer election-year charges from Democrats that he shirked his duty.																								The documents offered no new evidence to place Bush in Alabama during the latter part of 1972, the period when Democrats claim he was basically absent without leave.																								The White House had earlier this week said it would only hand out relevant documents after Bush said all papers would be released. But the clamour for the documents only increased.																								White House officials handed out thick packets containing hundreds of pages of documents retrieved from a National Guard records centre in Denver. A group of reporters was given 20 minutes to review dozens of pages detailing Bushs medical exams during his service.																								We received the entire file this afternoon and the President felt everything should be made public, spokesman Scott McClellan said. There were some who sought to leave a wrong impression that there was something to hide when there is not.																								The White House hoped to put an end for good to accusations from Democrats that the Republican President shirked Vietnam War-era military duties. Republicans are worried about Bushs recently falling job approval ratings.																								There was no new evidence, however, to show that Bush spent a lot of time on duty for the National Guard in Alabama during the latter part of 1972, the murky period Democrats have seized on to describe him as AWOL (Absence Without Leave).																								Bush had transferred to the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, in Montgomery, Alabama, in order to be in the state to help the Senate campaign of Republican Red Blount.																								Records released by the White House earlier in the week showed Bush had a dental exam there and was paid for some stints of duty but also had long absences from service.																								The new stack included an evaluation form from his Texas unit that said he could not be evaluated because Lt. Bush has not been observed at this unit during the period of report. 																								It said Bush has been performing equivalent training in a non-flying status in Alabama.																								The New York Times said it interviewed 16 retired officers and service personnel who served during that time in the 187th, and none could remember Bush. The Washington Post, however, quoted John Calhoun, who was an officer with the Alabama Air National Guard at the time, as saying Bush used to sit in his office and read magazines and flight manuals as he performed weekend duty at Dannelly Field in Montgomery in 1972.																								Democrats were sceptical.																								If these are all the documents, it has taken the President more than four years and one week after he told the American people he would release them. Hopefully these are all the documents, said Democratic National Committee communications director Debra DeShong.																								Each revelation of material from the Bush White House has raised more questions than it has answered, she added.

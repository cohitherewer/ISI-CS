 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Brain reacts same way to all mistakes
																								Washington, April 26 (Reuters): Why is it so annoying to watch someone else make a mistake? Maybe because it affects the same areas of the brain as when a person makes his or her own mistake, Dutch researchers said today.																								Experiments in which volunteers tried a computer task and then watched each other do the same thing showed the brain reacted in a similar way whether the observer made the mistake, or watched someone else make it. Writing in the May issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience, the team at the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands said their findings help shed light on how human beings learn by watching one another.																								For their experiment Hein van Schie and colleagues hooked up 16 men and women to electrodes to measure brain activity and then sat them in front of a display screen with a joystick. The task was simple  to move the joystick in the same direction as certain arrows appearing on the screen. Participants were instructed to respond both quickly and accurately in the direction of the centre arrowhead, Van Schie said.

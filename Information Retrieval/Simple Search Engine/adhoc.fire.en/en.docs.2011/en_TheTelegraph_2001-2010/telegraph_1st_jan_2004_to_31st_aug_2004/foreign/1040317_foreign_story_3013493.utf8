 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Search for car bomb suspects
																								Karachi, March 16 (Reuters): Pakistani investigators today hunted two men, believed to be Islamic militants, after police thwarted an attempt to set off a huge car bomb positioned to wreak destruction on the US consulate in Karachi.																								Yesterdays attempt to blow up the consulate, target of a deadly car-bomb blast in 2002, came two days before US secretary of state Colin Powell was due to visit Pakistan. Militant Muslims opposed to Pakistans backing for the US-led war on terror were prime suspects.																								The same type of people are involved in the latest bombing bid as those who carried such attacks in the past, interior ministry official Brigadier Javed Iqbal Cheema said. Another investigator said police suspected the bombers were members of one of two Muslim militant groups  the Harkat-ul Mujahideen Al-alami or the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Militants have carried out a string of attacks on western interests, Christians, fellow Muslims and top government officials since Pakistan joined the US war on terror in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States.																								Musharraf narrowly survived two bids on his life in December in attacks he blamed on Islamic radicals, including a Libyan national probably from the the al Qaida network. We continue to hunt these people. They have been marginalised, but not eliminated completely. Until they are eliminated the fear of fresh attacks remains, Cheema said. A van carrying a big drum full of explosive chemicals was abandoned outside the consulate in the southern port city early yesterday. It would have caused a huge blast if it had gone off, police said. Our experts risked their lives to defuse it on the spot and then the vehicle was towed to a ground, said a police official.

 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Police head back to class to hunt cyber criminals

Police in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden conducted a series of coordinated raids on suspected paedophiles, arresting as many as 350 people suspected of purchasing child pornography on the Internet. (AFP)																								London, May 26 (Reuters): Police are heading back to the classroom as a new breed of criminals turns to the Internet to prey on unsuspecting victims.																								Across Europe and beyond, cyber investigators are being trained in computer forensics  a crimefighting technique that is part science, part sleuthing.																								Investigators comb through seized computer hard drives, looking amid countless disguised files for evidence the machine was used in a crime.																								The clues could be elaborate computer programmes designed to hijack a victims PC, or e-mail and web browsing logs revealing the identity of conspirators. Its akin to auto mechanics, said Dan Haagman, head of training for 7Safe Ltd, a Cambridge-based firm that instructs police and civilians in computer forensics. The same techniques can be used to trace or at least build a profile of a criminal suspect from a hacked PC.																								As criminals turn to high-tech gadgets and the Internet to commit crimes ranging from extortion to drug dealing, computer forensics is rapidly becoming as crucial to an investigation as DNA evidence, police say.																								I expect new staff to have an absolute minimum of computer and software forensics before they even walk in the door, said Marc Kirby, detective inspector for the computer forensics section at Britains National Hi-Tech Crime Unit. 																								In addition to training local police in cyber-sleuthing techniques, Kirbys 55 investigators also hunt criminals. Earlier this month, the NHTCU arrested 12 people in a case in which a Russian crime gang is accused of using an e-mail scam known as phishing to defraud UK bank customers out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.																								In another success, a string of globe-spanning paedophilia stings has determined the identities of thousands of suspects who use the Internet to trade and collect pornographic images. But police forces around the world remain a step behind. In the UK, home to some of Europes most advanced cybercrime fighting forces, just 1,000 of the countrys 140,000 police officers are trained to handle digital evidence. Fewer than 250 have high-level computer forensics skills, says European information security lobby group EURIM. 																								Earlier this month, British police toiled in the reflection of their computer screens. They were hunting the deep recesses of a computer for traces of an increasingly popular cybercrime weapon known as malware in a 7Safe training session. Malware is malicious computer code programmed by an underworld of hackers, virus writers and sometimes spammers to commit all manners of crime.																								In the training exercise, investigators discovered in a deep corner of the hard drive a nasty piece of malware known as a trojan installed on the machine without the users knowledge.																								Criminals use trojans and backdoors to infect PCs. An army of vulnerable machines can then be programmed to execute a digital denial-of-service attack on a web retailer or flood the Internet with dubious e-mail messages aiming to defraud users out of their bank details in a typical phishing expedition.

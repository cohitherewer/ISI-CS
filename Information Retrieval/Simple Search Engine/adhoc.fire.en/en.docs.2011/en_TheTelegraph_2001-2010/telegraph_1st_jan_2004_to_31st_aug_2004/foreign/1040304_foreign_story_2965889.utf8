 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Malay PM calls snap polls
																								Kuala Lumpur, March 3 (Reuters): Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called a snap election today that would pit his four-month-old government against a conservative Islamic opposition.																								Abdullah, who took over from Mahathir Mohamad on November 1 when the veteran leader stepped down after 22 years in power, said parliament will be dissolved tomorrow.																								The ruling multi-ethnic coalition is sure to win the election, but the 64-year-old son of a respected Muslim scholar needs to strengthen his grip on power by solidly defeating the Islamists.																								Abdullah met the king today amid heated speculation he would take advantage of an accelerating economy and booming stock market to call for an election that was not due until November. 																								His Majesty the King has given his consent for the dissolution of 10th parliament effective March 4 to pave the way for the 11th general election, Abdullah said in a statement.The Election Commission will meet within four days to set the date, with speculation focused on March 20.

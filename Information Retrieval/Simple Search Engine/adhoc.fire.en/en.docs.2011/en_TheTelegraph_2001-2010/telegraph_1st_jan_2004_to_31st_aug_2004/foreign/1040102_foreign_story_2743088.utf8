				 	 Willie Nelson 																								Dallas, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Country music icon Willie Nelson has written a Christmas song with an edge  a protest against the war in Iraq that he hopes will stir passions in those who hear it.																								Nelson, 70, said yesterday he wrote Whatever Happened to Peace on Earth after watching the news on Christmas Day and will play it in Austin, Texas on Saturday at a concert to benefit Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich.																								His rare foray into protest music  he said it was only the second such song he had written, after the Vietnam-era Jimmys Road  follows recent political controversies stirred by the Dixie Chicks and Steve Earle. The Dixie Chicks, one of the biggest acts in country music, had their music boycotted by some country stations after lead singer Natalie Mains said at a concert in London just before the invasion of Iraq that she was embarrassed to be from the same state as President George W. Bush. Last year Steve Earle sparked the ire of conservatives with his song John Walkers Blues about the young American who converted to Islam and was captured while fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan.																								Nelson said his new song criticized the Bush administrations decision to invade Iraq and those who thought it unpatriotic to speak out against the war.

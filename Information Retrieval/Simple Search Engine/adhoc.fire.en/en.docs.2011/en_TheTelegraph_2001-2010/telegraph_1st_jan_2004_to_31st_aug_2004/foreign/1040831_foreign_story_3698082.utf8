 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Putin ally wins polls
																								Grozny, Aug. 30 (Reuters): The Kremlin candidate won Chechnyas presidential election but faces a struggle controlling the warring region and subduing a resurgent separatist rebellion that has frustrated Russia for a decade.																								Alu Alkhanov, the former local interior minister, won 73.48 per cent of yesterdays vote, the election commission said today, based on preliminary results. 																								Alkhanov, 47, a policeman handpicked by Russia President Vladimir Putin, faces a battle to garner some of the standing enjoyed by his hard-nosed predecessor Akhmad Kadyrov, assassinated in May.

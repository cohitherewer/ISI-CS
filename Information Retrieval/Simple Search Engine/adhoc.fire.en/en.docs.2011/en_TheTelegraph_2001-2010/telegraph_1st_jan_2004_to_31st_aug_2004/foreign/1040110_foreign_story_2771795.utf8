 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Iran blames Bush refrain
				 	 Former Iran President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during prayers in Tehran. (AFP)																								Tehran, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Irans influential former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said today US President George W. Bushs repeated accusations against Iran had undermined a possible thaw in the decades-old enmity between the two nations.																								Speaking at Friday prayers in Tehran, Rafsanjani said Tehran was encouraged by US humanitarian relief to victims of the devastating earthquake in Bam on December 26 and a US proposal for a first public official visit to Iran in over two decades.																								Our initial analysis was that they wanted to pave the way for negotiations and resolving the problems, Rafsanjani said in a sermon broadcast live on state radio. Their main mistake was that Bush started to repeat the old allegations about Iran and weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, human rights and the West Asia conflict...																								If you want to extend a hand of friendship and a new approach, you shouldnt repeat the old words, said Rafsanjani, who analysts say remains a key player in Irans foreign policy.																								He was referring to comments on January 1 by Bush, who, while praising Tehran for allowing US humanitarian aid to be sent to the people of Bam, reiterated long-standing accusations that led him to label Iran an axis of evil member in 2002.																								The Iranian government must listen to the voices of those who long for freedom, must turn over al Qaida (members) that are in their custody and must abandon their nuclear weapons programme, Bush said. Scarf insult																								Rafsanjani today said a French government plan to ban Islamic headscarves from public schools was an insult to all Muslims and hinted the move may harm Frances ties with Iran.																								I hope the French government and (President Jacques) Chirac himself, as well as the French parliament understand they have insulted one and half billion Muslims, Rafsanjani said during prayers in Tehran.

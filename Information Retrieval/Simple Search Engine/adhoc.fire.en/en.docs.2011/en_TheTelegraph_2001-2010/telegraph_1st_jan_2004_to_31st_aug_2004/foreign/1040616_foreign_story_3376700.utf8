 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Breather for Sharon
																								Jerusalem, June 15 (Reuters): Israels attorney-general dropped a bribery case against Prime Minister Ariel Sharon today in what could be a potent boost for his plan to withdraw settlers from occupied Gaza.																								Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz said he had found a deafening lack of evidence, not even close to that needed for a reasonable chance of conviction despite the chief prosecutors recommendation that Sharon be charged.																								The ruling was likely to help Sharon overcome stiff resistance within his Right-wing camp to his blueprint for disengagement from conflict with the Palestinians and forge a unity coalition with the Left if needed to carry it out. An indictment could have toppled the 76-year-old former general, nicknamed The Bulldozer, who has known controversy throughout his career. It could also have sunk his Gaza plan.																								Mazuz informed Sharon of his ruling shortly before his televised announcement and Channel 10 television quoted the Premier as replying: Thank you. He gave no public comment.																								The attorney-general told a televised news conference he had treated Sharon no differently from any other subject of a criminal inquiry. Sharon had denied misconduct.																								Prosecutors looked into the alleged payment of hundreds of thousands of dollars to Sharons son Gilad by a land developer who hired him in the late 1990s for work in securing Greek government approval for a new Aegean island resort.																								They investigated whether Sharon, foreign minister at the time, used his position to help property magnate David Appel get the enterprise off the ground, which never happened.																								Mazuz said payments to Gilad Sharon did not start until late 1999, when his father was no longer foreign minister and was back in the Opposition.																								For over two years, police listened to Appels two phone lines, recording thousands of conversations. These wiretaps yielded no evidence, direct or indirect, for substantiating the suspicion that Sharon was bribed by Appel, Mazuz said.																								This absence of proof is...a deafening silence.																								Mazuz also closed the inquiry against Gilad Sharon. Appel has been charged with bribery in the Greek island affair and said previously he would seek to have the indictment dismissed if Sharon were let off the hook.																								Mazuzs word lifted a cloud of uncertainty enveloping Sharons political future, at least for now. Leftist opposition figures vowed to challenge the ruling in petitions to the High Court. Sharon could also face charges in two other corruption probes in which he denies wrongdoing.																								The Prime Minister pushed his plan for dismantling all 21 settlements in Gaza and four of 120 in the West Bank by late 2005 through his cabinet by a 14-7 vote on June 6, but at the cost of his coalitions stability.

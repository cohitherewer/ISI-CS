 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Intels new chip to boost PC power
																								San Francisco, June 18 (Reuters): Intel Corporation, the worlds largest chip maker, yesterday launched a much-anticipated new chip designed to sharply improve and expand the power of personal computers.																								The chip, called Grantsdale, will work in tandem with Intels Pentium 4 processors to give PCs more powerful sound and graphics, a speedier link for peripherals and memory, and an ability to run a wireless data network.																								Having those features built into the core components of a computer could be essential to Intels strategy as it tries to turn the PC into the heart of home entertainment without the need for expensive add-on cards.																								This is the most ambitious make-over of the PC platform in the last 12 years, said William Siu, Intels general manager for desktop computer chips. The chips will begin to appear in PCs starting next week. In concert with software maker Microsoft and PC makers, Intel has pushed the development of entertainment or media centre computers that cost as little as $700 and that can record television shows and store music.

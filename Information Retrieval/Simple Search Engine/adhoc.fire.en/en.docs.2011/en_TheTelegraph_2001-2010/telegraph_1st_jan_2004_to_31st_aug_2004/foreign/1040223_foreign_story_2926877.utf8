 CATHERINE MILNER																								London, Feb. 22: The missing chapter of Rudyard Kiplings celebrated book Stalky and Co has been found in a school library. 																								The manuscript, believed to have been written in 1897  two years before the books publication  was found in the archives of Haileybury, a private school in Hertfordshire, by Jeremy Lewins, a former Kipling Fellow at Magdalene College, Cambridge. 																								The work tells the entirely new story of three schoolboys who taunt an elderly major who cheats at golf near Appledore in North Devon, Lewins said. Kipling intended it to be the first chapter of Stalky and Co, one of his most popular childrens books, published in 1899, he said. 																								Lewins, who has transcribed the work for publication in April, believes that the find is very significant and said it is attracting worldwide interest. 																								The new chapter describes Stalky, the cunning ringleader, as having dancing eyes and an elastic step. His friends are McTurk, an Irish boy with dark hair and long lashes, and Beetle, a large, hairy ,bespectacled boy who acted as caddy for the other two boys. Beetle is widely thought to be based on Kipling, who felt himself to be unattractive and easily squashed. 																								The chapter is called Scylla and Charybdis  the names of two bunkers on the golf course where the school boys spy on an old man in a red jacket. The boys observe the man replacing golf balls that he has knocked into the rough with new ones from his pockets. They collect the balls, but are reprimanded by the club secretary for stealing them  until they reveal that the major has been cheating.																								Kipling liked the golf course but not the players on it. In the new chapter, he writes about cads who played golf dressed in a fearful combination of heather-mixture stockings, white spats, orange boots and elephants-end knicker-bockers.

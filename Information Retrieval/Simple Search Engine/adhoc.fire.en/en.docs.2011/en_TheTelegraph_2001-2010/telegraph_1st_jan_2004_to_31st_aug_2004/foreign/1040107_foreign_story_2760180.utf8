Boar bother Berlin (Reuters): A wild boar searching  for food broke into a Berlin apartment, hospitalising a  man by biting him in the leg before fleeing back into the  woods, police said on Tuesday.

When the 54-year old resident  tried to shoo the boar back out the door, it went wild,  he said. The injured man was treated in hospital for his  leg wound and released on the same day.

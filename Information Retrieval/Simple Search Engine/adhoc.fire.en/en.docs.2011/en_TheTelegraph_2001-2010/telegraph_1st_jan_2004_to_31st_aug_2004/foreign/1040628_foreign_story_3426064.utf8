 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Daughters turn Pet Terminator around
 JULIAN COMAN				 	 Arnold Schwarzeneggers wife Maria Shriver (left) and daughter Christina in Los Angeles on Saturday. (Reuters) 																								San Francisco, June 27: So, the Terminator has a heart after all. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, has reversed his decision to let stray cats and dogs be put down almost immediately in state animal shelters.																								An international outcry had greeted the proposal, intended to save the California taxpayer $14 million a year, that would have ended a six-day period of grace for dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, turtles and pot-bellied pigs. Protests by the United Animal Nations group, which labelled Schwarzenegger the Pet Terminator, and the advice of his daughters, Katherine and Christina, forced a U-turn, announced on Friday.																								Schwarzenegger, who inherited a huge budget deficit, is known for his assured populist touch. It quickly became apparent, though, that the pet terminator bill was a public relations disaster, especially for a governor who owns three dogs: Sarge, the cockapoo, and two yellow labradors, Sammy and Spunky. Barked protests were led from the state capitol lawn by a King Charles spaniel wearing a Dont kill me Arnold sign around its neck. Extra phone lines in the governors offices were swamped by calls.																								Thats not me, Schwarzenegger eventually concluded of the proposal. I have three dogs. And of course I grew up with every animal you can think of. Im an animal lover. Animals will be kept in the shelters for six days and everything will stay exactly the same.																								Every year, 600,000 pets are put down in California animal shelters. However, the six-day grace period allows new homes to be found for some animals, and owners to be reunited with pets who have gone missing.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

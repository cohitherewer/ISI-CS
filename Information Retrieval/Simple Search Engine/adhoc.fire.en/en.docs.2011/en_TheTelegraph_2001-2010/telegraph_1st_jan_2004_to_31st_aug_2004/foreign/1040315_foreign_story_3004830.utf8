 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 China toys with political reform
																								Beijing, March 14 (Reuters): Likening socialism to soaring mountains and swelling seas, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao laid out today a lofty but blurred vision of how the country would reform a political system monopolised by the Communist Party.																								Wen sidestepped a question on whether the party would reverse its verdict on the decision to crush the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in a bloody military crackdown. 																								He said the party moved successfully to stabilise the situation and social stability and party unity were paramount to all.																								But Wen, who made a rare promise of checks on Communist power in his first work report to parliament, told a news conference at the close of the annual session that Chinas system of governance had to keep in step with the transformation to a capitalistic economy.																								Without success in political restructuring, economic reforms in China cannot eventually succeed, Wen said. He did not spell out specific reforms.																								Instead, he reeled off a series of concepts the new generation of leaders has advocated to shore up the partys legitimacy in the opening year of its reign, by bolstering official accountability, transparency and adherence to law.																								Power must be combined with responsibility.																								Wen also sidestepped questions on how the government would resolve claims of injustice by legions of petitioners who throng the capital, and how it would enforce new constitutional amendments to shield human rights and private property.																								While the new elites personal touch and squeaky-clean image have been a boon to liberals and the media, analysts say major political reforms remain mired in ideological gridlock.																								Still, the rhapsodic Wen evoked the adage he used a year ago to acknowledge the need for socialist bureaucracy to soak up outside influences.																								The ocean never turns away the stream, so it becomes wide and deep, he repeated, then built on the imagery.																								Today I would like to make the further comparison of socialism to a high mountain. The mountain never turns away stones, so it becomes towering and strong.																								That means that socialism can only make progress by constant self-improvement and self-readjustment.

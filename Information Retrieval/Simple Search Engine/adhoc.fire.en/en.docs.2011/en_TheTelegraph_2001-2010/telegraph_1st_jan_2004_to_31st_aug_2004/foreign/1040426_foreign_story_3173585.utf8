 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Blast victims suffer in silence
 															- Inside North Korea: What was hidden from the world 				 	 A building destroyed by the April 22 explosion at a railway station in Ryongchon. (AFP)Beijing, April 25 (Reuters): Injured children moaning in pain and burn victims with blackened faces were among those being treated in a poorly equipped North Korean hospital after a deadly train blast in which at least 161 people have died.																								The horror of Thursdays explosion at North Koreas Ryongchon station met aid workers as they visited the Sinuiju Provincial Hospital, where many victims were taken, a World Food Programme (WFP) official said today.																								We saw children rolling and moaning in pain, many with a lot of cuts to the face and rudimentary twine stitching, WFP regional director for Asia Tony Banbury said by telephone from Pyongyang.																								Some of the kids had lost sight in both eyes. Two were laid out on cabinets. Several mothers had climbed into the beds of their wounded children, he said. 																								The lack of high-tech, modern medical equipment in the hospital, which has electricity and scores of dedicated medical staff in uniform, was heart-wrenching, Banbury said. Intravenous drips, a key way of feeding antibiotics and painkillers into seriously injured patients, were in scant supply.																								We have to get antibiotics to these people now, he said.																								Many victims appeared to suffer in relative silence as sombre family members kept vigil by their bedsides.

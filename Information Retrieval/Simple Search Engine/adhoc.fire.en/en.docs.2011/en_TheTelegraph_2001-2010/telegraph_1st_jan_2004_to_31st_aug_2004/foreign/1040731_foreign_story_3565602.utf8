 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Italy wakes up to honour Columbus
																								Rome, July 30 (Reuters): For the first time Italy is to honour one of its most famous sons, the Genoa-born explorer Christopher Columbus, like the US has for centuries.																								Born in the Italian port in 1451, the navigator who lived in both Portugal and Spain, will be honoured on October 12 with National Cristofero Colombo Day, his Italian name.																								The first recorded celebration of Columbus Day in the US was on October 12, 1792, commemorating the 300th anniversary of Columbus landing in the Bahamas, which began a new era of European exploration and expansion.																								But it was the 400th anniversary of the event which inspired the first official Columbus Day holiday in the US.																								Claudio Scajola, minister for implementation of government programmes, said yesterday Italy had decided to make the most of the name of the great genius of the sea Colombus and the discovery of America which marked the birth of the modern era. A ministry spokesperson said it had been Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis idea to celebrate Columbus.																								There are 60 million Italians around the world, most of them in the Americas, and the main guiding thread is indeed Christopher Columbus, Scajola said.

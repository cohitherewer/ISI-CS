The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Pak build-up for al Qaida offensive
																								Wana (Pakistan), Feb. 22 (Reuters): Pakistan is gearing up for a drive against al Qaida and Taliban militants in remote western tribal areas and have sought the deployment of more paramilitary troops, officials said today.																								PTI, quoting information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, reported that the Pakistan army has already launched an offensive in the tribal-dominated south Waziristan.																								Ahmed was also quoted by the official APP news agency as saying the operation in Waziristan was to uproot terrorism.																								This exercise is not against a person or an individual but against terrorism, he told reporters in remarks broadcast on private television.																								A large number of militants, including the worlds most wanted man Osama bin Laden, are thought to be hiding in the rugged border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.																								We have built up enough pressure on these people and we should not let this pressure ease. These people are on the run and we are also determined to end this menace once and for all, said Muhammad Azam Khan, a top official in South Waziristan.																								The US military has also said it will launch a spring offensive against Islamic rebels in Afghanistan in what could be part of a concerted effort to find bin Laden.																								Authorities have been pressuring tribesmen in Waziristan for weeks to stop sheltering al Qaida suspects and Taliban fighters.																								Yesterday, political authorities governing the semi-autonomous tribal regions asked for 8,000 paramilitary soldiers to add to the 4,000 already deployed.																								We have asked for additional paramilitary troops, Khan said. We have one full brigade from the regular Pakistan army, but we would like to use them only as a back-up force.																								Last week President Pervez Musharraf urged tribal leaders to turn over al Qaida and Taliban suspects they were sheltering. Pakistan has stepped up efforts to track down al Qaida and Taliban militants in recent months in response to American concerns that Islamic militants have been using Pakistani territory to launch attacks inside Afghanistan. 																								Ahmed denied media reports that Pakistan had received satellite pictures of bin Laden or his deputy, Egyptian national Ayman al-Zawahri.

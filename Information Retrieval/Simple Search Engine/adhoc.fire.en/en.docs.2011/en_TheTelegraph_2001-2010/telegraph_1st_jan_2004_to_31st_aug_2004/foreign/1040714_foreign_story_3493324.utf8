 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Confusion over Manila pullout

(AFP)																								Manila, July 13 (Reuters): The Philippine army awaited word today on whether it would withdraw from Iraq earlier than scheduled amid deepening confusion over Manilas response to militants threatening to behead a hostage if its troops stay.																								The Bush administration warned the Philippines today against bowing to pressure from kidnappers and withdrawing the countrys troops from Iraq ahead of schedule. While this is a decision for the Philippine government, we believe such a decision would send the wrong signal to terrorists around the globe, a senior Bush administration official said.																								Foreign secretary Delia Albert repeated a statement by her deputy that the Philippines would withdraw as soon as possible but did not clarify whether Manila plans to pull out its troops by July 20 in line with demands by militants holding Angelo de la Cruz.																								When deputy foreign minister Rafael Seguis spoke this morning during his interview with al Jazeera, he spoke with foreknowledge and full authority of the Philippine government, Albert said after an emergency foreign office meeting in Manila.																								Seguis told the Arabic al Jazeera television station that Manila was offering to withdraw its forces as soon as possible, but gave no date. Officials in Manila declined to clarify or to say if they would leave much earlier than their scheduled August 20 departure.																								An army spokesman said no official order to withdraw had been received and the family of De la Cruz was sceptical after a series of misleading government statements since the crisis began with the abduction of the 46-year-old truck driver last week. We have not had an order from any office regarding the pull-out, army spokesman Daniel Lucero said. We are prepared to implement our withdrawal plan.																								A senior army officer said it was possible to pull out the small Philippine contingent within three days, in line with the militants demands for a withdrawal by July 20, but that it would require logistical assistance from the US. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyos government had previously said it would not change plans to withdraw its 51 soldiers, all working on humanitarian projects, as scheduled on August 20.																								She faces a dilemma between trying to save De la Cruz, who comes from her home province, and maintaining her staunch alliance with the US.

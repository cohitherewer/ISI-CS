 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Jazeera urged to remove banner
				 	 Glenn Close speaks at the convention in Boston. (AP)																								Boston, July 27: Americans tuning into television coverage of this weeks Democratic convention will see signs for media outlets like CNN, ABC, NBC and CBS, but not Al Jazeera after the Arab satellite channel was asked to remove its banner near the podium.																								The 24-hour Qatar-based news outlet won over millions of Arab viewers before and during the US-led war on Afghanistan in 2001 after showing exclusive footage of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.																								During this weeks convention in Boston, where Senator John Kerry will be officially nominated to run for the White House, the TV channel had erected a colourful $30,000 banner that would have been seen by millions of television viewers as part of the convention backdrop.																								But it was ordered to remove the sign by convention organisers, who said the decision was made for aesthetic reasons. In its place is now a 20-foot long JohnKerry.com banner.																								Weve taken down other signs, like Comcasts, convention spokeswoman Peggy Wilhide said, noting that of 33 organisations that have skyboxes, only 40 per cent have signs displayed.																								Al Jazeera, which has 16 staff covering the event, has been accused of peddling propaganda by the Bush administration.																								The stations offices in Baghdad were bombed by the US military during the war in Iraq, killing one journalist. 																								Al Jazeera has also found it hard at times to work in the US. 																								The New York Stock Exchange banned its reporters from the stock exchange floor.																								Heinz Kerry fan club																								The Teresa Heinz Kerry Fan Club  the cross-section of Democratic women gathered here from across the country  had found another reason to cheer their hero, and they were loving it. 																								Im going to vote for her  twice! said delegate Thelma Goldstein from Falmouth, Massachusetts. The women were all impressed that Heinz Kerry had told a Pittsburgh newspaper reporter on Sunday to shove it when he kept asking her to explain remarks she made during a speech.

 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 New Yorkers brave rain, night for My Life
 Bill Clinton signs a copy of his book at a bookstore in New York. (Reuters) New York, June 23 (Reuters): Bill Clinton kicked off a month-long book tour with a book-signing party yesterday where he was greeted with cheers befitting a rock star from fans who slept overnight on sidewalks to meet him.																								The line of about 1,000 people, who spent hours camping out on blankets and getting drenched by rain, snaked several blocks around the midtown Manhattan bookstore where the former President stopped to promote his memoirs.																								His 957-page My Life went on sale just after midnight. Im smitten with him, said Lisa Borinsky, a furniture maker from New Jersey who arrived on Monday evening to sleep in line. The only true aphrodisiac in this world is power and the man exudes power, which makes him unbelievably attractive.																								Inside the Barnes amp; Noble bookstore, a widely smiling Clinton sat, pen in hand, and signed the first of what will be thousands of books on a nationwide tour. I feel good. Im glad its finally happening, Clinton said, looking more svelte than he did leaving office in 2000. Ive been living with this for two-and-a-half years.																								Describing his book, he said: I tried to elevate the importance of politics... I hope when people read this, theyll have more of an appreciation for it.																								One of the first people getting a book signed was Lorraine Ghazarian, who said she joined the line on a whim on Monday afternoon as she left her job at a Manhattan law firm.																								This is probably my last overnighter. Im 57-years-old, she said. It totally was worth it. He shook my hand twice. 																								Publisher Alfred A. Knopf received a massive 2 million advance orders for the book, which had a first run printing of 1.5 million copies.																								The book spans Clintons life from an abuse-scarred childhood in Arkansas to the tumultuous White House years tainted by his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. Outside Harlems Hue-Man bookstore, waiting for Clintons evening book signing, several people wore buttons reading: I Miss Peace, Prosperity amp; Bill Clinton. Theres something about Clinton, I just like him, said schoolteacher Olivia Hector. We are both Leos. We are both people persons.																								Clinton filled out the days publicity stops with a televised appearance with Oprah Winfrey.																								He told the talk show host he has not spoken to Lewinsky since their affair ended nearly tenyears ago. She is a really intelligent person who has her own life story, Clinton said. I hope that she will not allow her whole life to be defined by her Andy Warhol 15 minutes of fame.																								Clinton also said he slept on an actual couch in a small living room, and not in a separate bedroom, after telling his wife Hillary Clinton about the affair.																								He had revealed his months banished to a couch in earlier interviews without elaborating, leading many to ask why he did not move to the Lincoln Bedroom or another White House bedroom. I think I thought maybe I ought to be on it, he said. I stayed on it for over two months.

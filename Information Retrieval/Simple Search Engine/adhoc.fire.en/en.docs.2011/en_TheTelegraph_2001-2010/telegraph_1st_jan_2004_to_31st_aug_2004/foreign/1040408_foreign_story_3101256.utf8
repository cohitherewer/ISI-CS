 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Flashpoints flare across minefield Iraq
Falluja, April 7 (Reuters): US-led forces battled Sunni guerrillas and a spreading Shia uprising today, as Iraqi anger was inflamed by a blast in the grounds of a mosque that witnesses said killed 25 people.																								In the last three days 35 American and allied soldiers and at least 200 Iraqis have been killed in some of the heaviest fighting since the fall of Saddam Hussein nearly a year ago.																								The spiralling two-front war, with new flashpoints flaring across the country as backers of radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr take up arms, is calling into question US plans to transfer sovereignty to Iraqis on June 30.																								President George W. Bush  campaigning for re-election in November with opinion polls showing plunging support over Iraq  held phone talks with close ally British Prime Minister Tony Blair, but officials dismissed any suggestion of a crisis.																								But some countries with troops in Iraq signalled the situation was growing serious. Ukrainian troops pulled out of the eastern city of Kut after clashes and regrouped at a base camp. Japan said its troops would suspend reconstruction work in Samawa, in the south, because of security concerns.																								Bulgaria summoned ambassadors of the US, Britain, Spain and Poland to the foreign ministry today asking for back-up for 450 Bulgarian soldiers stationed in Karbala.																								Battles raged between US Marines and guerrillas in the Sunni towns of Falluja and Ramadi west of Baghdad. A US military spokesman said there were five Marine casualties in Falluja today, but it was not clear if any had been killed.																								In Falluja, witnesses said the office of a Muslim organisation in the grounds of a mosque was hit by a rocket. Locals said at least 25 people were killed.																								A US official at the Pentagon said a bomb had been dropped but did not hit the mosque  that was made very clear to us.																								Twelve Marines were killed yesterday in a seven-hour battle in Ramadi  one of the costliest single losses for US forces since the war that toppled Saddam began last March. A US soldier was killed in a rocket-propelled grenade attack in Baghdad today, bringing to 443 the number of US troops killed in action in Iraq since last years invasion.																								An aide to Sadr told a news conference some US soldiers had been captured in the fighting. Iraqs top Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani today condemned the way US-led forces were tackling the uprising and called for calm on all sides.

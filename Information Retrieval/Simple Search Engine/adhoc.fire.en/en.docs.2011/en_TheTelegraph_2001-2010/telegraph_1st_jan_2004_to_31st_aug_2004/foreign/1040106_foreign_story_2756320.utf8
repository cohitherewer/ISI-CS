 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Any name but Saddam
																								Riyadh, Jan. 5 (Reuters): A Saudi Arabian man who called his son Saddam Hussein 14 years ago is now desperately trying to have the name changed.																								Mohsen al-Harithy first asked the relevant authorities to change his sons name in 1990, when the forces of the now-desposed Iraqi President invaded neighbouring Kuwait, the Saudi English-language Arab News newspaper reported today.																								But the boys file was destroyed by an Iraqi missile attack on the civil status department in the Saudi capital Riyadh in the 1991 war to liberate Kuwait. After I found the paper was gone, I forgot about the whole thing but recent events and the capture of Saddam force me to change the name, he said. The Saddam name now symbolises pessimism, evil, mockery and disappointment all at once.

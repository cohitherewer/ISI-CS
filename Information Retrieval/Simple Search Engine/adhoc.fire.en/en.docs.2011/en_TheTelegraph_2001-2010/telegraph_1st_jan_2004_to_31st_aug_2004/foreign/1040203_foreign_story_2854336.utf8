The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 A flawed hero or proliferator
 Islamabad, Feb. 2 (AFP):  Its not just the row of vintage cars that distinguishes  Abdul Qadeer Khans ochre villa on one of Islamabads most  affluent streets, its the glass box opposite where government  spies sit round-the-clock watching anyone who ventures near.																								They are but a small detail of the security and surveillance entourage that for years has surrounded Bhopal-born Qadeer Khan and his every movement, and the house is one of several palatial villas he owns in the capital.																								Credited with fathering Pakistans nuclear bomb, Khan has for decades been publicly hailed as a national hero.																								Now the father of the Islamic worlds first nuclear bomb has confessed to clandestinely selling Pakistans nuclear expertise via black marketeers to a rogues gallery of states: Iran, Libya and North Korea.																								This is a very painful experience for us, because hes been seen as a national hero, a senior government official said today, after Khans confession was made public. But national heroes have their tragic flaws.																								Khan was 10-years-old when his family migrated by train from India to Pakistan during the bloody 1947 partition of the subcontinent. 																								Khan contribution to Pakistans nuclear programme was the procurement of a blueprint for uranium centrifuges, which transform uranium into weapons-grade fuel for nuclear fissile material.																								He was charged with stealing it from the Netherlands while working for Anglo-Dutch-German nuclear engineering consortium Urenco and bringing it back to pakistan in 1976.																								Khans enemies deride him as little more than a metallurgist who stole. 																								Hes a metallurgist, not a nuclear scientist as widely advertised ... He has certainly not made any outstanding inventions, said Pervez Hoodbhoy, professor of physics at Islamabads Quaid-e-Azam University. On his return to Pakistan, Khan was put in charge of Pakistans uranium enrichment project.																								By 1978, his team had enriched uranium, and by 1984 they were ready to explode a nuclear device, he told pakistans The News daily in a 1998 interview. The project is credited with ultimately leading to Pakistans first nuclear test explosion in May 1998.																								Khans aura began to dim in March 2001 when President Pervez Musharraf, reportedly under US pressure, removed him from the chairmanship of the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) and made him special adviser on strategic and KRL affairs.																								But Pakistans nuclear establishment had never expected to see its most revered hero in the dock. 																								The move was prompted after Islamabad received a letter in November from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) raising claims that Pakistani scientists were the source of sold-off nuclear knowledge to Iran.																								Hoodbhoy said the accusations against Khan were plausible. Hes a man who does things for profit. He operates in a milieu where the sharing of such things is not regarded badly, Hoodbhoy said.																								Khan and his KRL associates appear to have traded nuclear information with Sri Lankan and German brokers based in Dubai, officials familiar with KRL have said.																								Khan and the group was mostly responsible for bringing resources for Pakistans nuclear programme from outside, particularly through a Dubai-based group of international brokers, the official said requesting anonymity.																								While they were dealing with these brokers, the suspicion is that they may have passed on nuclear knowhow to these brokers, who then passed it on to Iran and Libya.																								Khan himself said in a speech to the Pakistan Institute of National Affairs in 1990 that he had shopped around on world markets while developing Pakistans nuclear programme.

 Sunday, January 04, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Margaret letters London, Jan. 3 (Reuters): The British  government drew up crisis plans in case Queen Elizabeths  sister Princess Margaret decided to renounce her claim to  the throne to pursue a love marriage with a divorced war  hero, archived documents show.
 The documents unsealed yesterday at Britains  National Archive after nearly 50 years include several  versions of a letter drafted by officials on behalf of Princess  Margaret to her sister, the queen. Margaret died in 2002. In her letter nearly half a century ago, Margaret  would have asked permission to marry the dashing Air Group  Captain Peter Townsend, renouncing any claim to the throne.
 Prime Minister Anthony Eden sent a top secret cable to the  Prime Ministers of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South  Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) warning them that  the princess was deciding whether to marry, and that they  could be asked to agree. In the end, Margaret decided not  to marry Townsend, and her letter to her sister 
 remained unsent.

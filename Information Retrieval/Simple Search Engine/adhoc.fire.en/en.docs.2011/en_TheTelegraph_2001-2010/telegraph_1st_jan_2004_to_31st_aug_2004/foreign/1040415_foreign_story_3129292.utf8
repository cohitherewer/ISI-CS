 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Historic US shift on West Bank
				 	 President George W. Bush (right) and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in the White House on Wednesday. (AFP)																								Washington, April 14 (Reuters): President George W. Bush implicitly recognised Israels claim to some West Bank settlements today and backed a Gaza Strip pullout plan in a historic US policy shift that drew immediate condemnation from the Palestinians.																								Bushs support for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will go down well with conservative and Jewish voters in the US presidential election but was likely to inflame the Arab world and further complicate efforts to stabilise Iraq.																								In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centres, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, Bush said during a news conference with Sharon.																								The announcement marked a shift from the decades-old US policy of viewing the Jewish settlements as an obstacle to peace and was greeted with anger by Palestinian officials.																								Bush is the first US President to give legitimacy to Jewish settlements on Palestinian land. We reject this. We will not accept it, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurie said at his West Bank home.																								The statement and letters Bush and Sharon exchanged could go a long way toward helping the Israeli leader push his plan to scrap 21 Jewish settlements in Gaza and four in the West Bank through a binding vote in his right-wing Likud party on May 2.																								The President also appeared to negate any right of return of Palestinian refugees to what is now Israel, saying they should be resettled in a future Palestinian state instead.																								Any US endorsement of a cementing of Israels hold on land Palestinians want for a state was likely to tap Arab anger and complicate peacemaking efforts in the region, including Iraq, where US forces are under daily attack

 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 6 soldiers killed in Gaza ambush
																								Gaza, May 11 (Reuters): Palestinian militants blew up six Israeli soldiers riding in an explosives-packed troop carrier during a raid in the Gaza Strip today in the deadliest ambush against Israeli forces in 18 months.																								The armoured vehicle was torn apart after troops and tanks backed by helicopter gunships stormed a densely populated neighbourhood of Gaza City, killing seven Palestinians, including at least three gunmen, and wounding 122.																								Senior Islamic Jihad political leader Khader Habib said militants were holding the soldiers mangled body parts and would not release them until there was a total halt to Israeli raids and Israel opened talks on release of jailed fighters.																								Soldiers searched house-to-house, and the army vowed to stay until all of the remains had been recovered.																								Gunfire and explosions continued into the evening hours.

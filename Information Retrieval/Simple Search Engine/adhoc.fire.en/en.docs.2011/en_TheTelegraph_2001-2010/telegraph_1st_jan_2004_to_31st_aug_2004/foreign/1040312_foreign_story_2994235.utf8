																								Tel Aviv, March 11 (Reuters): Israels Mossad spy agency may be the scourge of Arab militants and former Nazis, but it has failed to find thieves who stole the boss mobile phone.																								Meir Dagan, the retired general who heads Israels shadowy foreign intelligence agency, lost the phone when his car was broken into in Tel Aviv last month, security sources said yesterday.																								Court orders barred publication of the theft during the police hunt for the culprits. 																								The sources said they did not want the thieves to realise the value of what they had stolen.To be extra safe, Mossad ordered the phone company to remotely erase the memory on Dagans handset.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Protesters penetrate into heart of UK House
																								London, May 19 (Reuters): Protesters penetrated Britains parliament today and threw flour-filled condoms at Prime Minister Tony Blair, sparking fears that lax security could have let terrorists launch a biological or chemical attack.																								The attackers turned out to be neither terrorists nor even opponents of Blairs widely contested Iraq policy. A fathers right campaign group said it carried out the stunt in a packed House of Commons, where most of the government was gathered. Two men were arrested.																								Alarmed lawmakers brushed the purple flour off Blairs left shoulder and hurried him out of the historic chamber, debate was suspended and an anti-terror squad was called in to test if the dust thrown from the upper gallery was noxious.																								It was Britains second security lapse this week after a man tricked his way into Queen Elizabeths country residence of Windsor Castle on Monday by pretending to be a police officer.																								The protest renewed concerns about security in parliament, just weeks after a screen was erected in the public gallery after an intelligence warning that attackers could release anthrax or ricin into the chamber.																								This was a serious incident. I have asked for an immediate report on the circumstances and what additional security provisions may be necessary, said government minister Peter Hain. The Opposition Conservatives called the protest profoundly disturbing.																								Some parliamentarians said Blairs life could have been at risk but he was unruffled by the protest, a senior aide said. Parliament resumed after a break of about 70 minutes.																								The flour bomb hit Blair as he was on his feet for the Prime Ministers weekly questions session. Purple powder rained down on lawmakers as a number of condoms burst in mid-air. 																								Fathers-4-Justice, which fights for equal rights of access to children for divorced fathers, said the stunt was one of a number of protests planned ahead of Fathers Day on June 20.

 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Pak looks for Swedish reply
																								Islamabad, July 14 (Reuters): Pakistan, concerned over Indias plans to acquire a strategic radar system from Israel, is seeking a similar system from Sweden.																								Air Commodore Sarfraz Ahmed Khan, spokesman for the Pakistan Air Force, said talks were underway with Sweden over the purchase of an Airborne Early Warning System, but no final decision had been taken. A Swedish embassy spokesman confirmed that the matter came up for discussion when Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf visited Stockholm last week.																								He said a Swedish parliamentary commission, which handles defence-related deals, had approved the sale of the radar system and it was now up to Pakistani authorities to decide. I cant say at what stage its at, but the negotiations have been going on for quite some time, he said. 																								Nuclear-armed Pakistan and India have continued to focus on building their military capabilities despite a warming of ties since they went to the the brink of a fourth war in 2002.																								News of Pakistans negotiations with Sweden comes after India announced one of its highest peacetime hikes in annual defence expenditure last week, saying it was needed to honour a slew of arms contracts.																								These included a deal signed with Israel  which has emerged as Indias second biggest arms supplier after Russia  to mount Phalcon radar systems on a Russian-made aircraft to enable the Indian Air Force to pry deep into Pakistani airspace. 																								Pakistan, which itself raised its spending on defence by seven per cent for the financial year from July 1, said the sharp increase in Indias defence spending could trigger an arms race.																								Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said on Monday the scale of the increase by India was not justified. Pakistan has long relied on China for defence purchase. Now a key ally in the US-led war on terror, Pakistan argues that Washington should assist it in correcting its conventional imbalance of forces.

 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Blair treats Simpsons to tea at No 10
 TOM COX				 	 Homer Simpson of the animated series The Simpsons. (Reuters) London, Jan. 10: No other  American television programme, let alone a cartoon, takes  as much good-natured pleasure in offending other nationalities  as The Simpsons.																								For most followers of the show, casual xenophobia has become an essential part of the nihilistic, irreverent formula.																								It is now taken as read that, should the most famous dysfunctional family in the world embark on a vacation, a lot of people are going to be belittled and stereotyped.																								Previous victims of the Simpsons jibes have included the French (portrayed as cruel, sneaky onion-eaters), the Australians (dumb and fiercely nationalistic) and the Brazilians (dancing fools). 																								Last night, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and Grandpa Simpson finally arrived in England for an episode featuring the voices of Tony Blair, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen and J.K. Rowling, all playing themselves.																								Like all Simpsons episodes it began with an entirely unrelated sub-story, this time involving a lost $1,000 bill.																								This led the family to Heathrow, where they were greeted by Blair. 																								How, you wondered excitedly, would an exchange unfold between Blair and the family that had previously insulted both Bush Sr and Bush Jr and once caused a cartoon Bill Clinton (voiced by an actor) to admit he did it with pigs? Uneventfully, was the answer. 																								Welcome to England, announced the Prime Minister, looking distinctly less rumpled than his three-dimensional incarnation.																								 I want to encourage all the world to come and see the beauty of 21st century Britain.																								After a brief exchange about Edinburgh and an exclamation of Smashing!, he invited them to join him at No 10 for tea. Homer managed to spill his tea from a Union flag cup on to the Downing Street carpet.																								Blairs appearance  the subject of eight months of negotiations between Alastair Campbell and the shows producers, which involved the veto of Homer offering Blair a corgi as a present for fear that it would represent Britain as Americas poodle  lasted well under a minute.																								Were it not for Homers comment of I cant believe we met Mr Bean! as Blair departed, it could almost have been scripted by Campbell. Fortunately, the usual riotous self-deprecation and boorishness ensued elsewhere. 																								Judi Dench, it transpired, was a tyrant who ran her own chip shop. Ian McKellen electrocuted himself every time the Simpsons said Macbeth. J K Rowling revealed the end of her Harry Potter series (Potter marries Lisa, Homer and Marges eldest daughter).																								Homer crashed into the Queens carriage and ended up imprisoned in the Tower of London. 																								Beforehand, he had announced to a hotel clerk that his country had saved Britains ass in Vietnam and shared their prostitutes with Hugh Grant.																								None of it did anything to dissuade you from the impression that America thinks of Britain as a nation of top-hat wearing, mini-driving, well-spoken wimps who make films about running to pop music and cling to a defunct monarchy; nor, if you had any kind of sense of humour, would you have wanted it to.

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Costner a loner on the range 
London, March 1 (Reuters): Kevin Costner has always loved westerns. The trouble is, Hollywood doesnt share his enthusiasm.																								But that has never stopped this stubborn loner from believing in the genre  and he was triumphantly proved right when Dances With Wolves was garlanded with Oscars.																								God knows I am not one to predict what is commercial, admitted the 50-year-old star who may no longer rank in the Hollywood A-list but can still pull in almost $60 million at the US box office for his latest western Open Range.																								I think I am a loner and stubborn might be one word that is attached to me, Costner said in London on a publicity blitz to promote the movie. But I am not doing anything for effect. Its just that I am not so fearful about trying to stay popular, said the once highly bankable star.																								Dances with Wolves captured seven Oscars and took almost $185 million at the US box office. But selling that and the baseball hit Bull Durham to the movie moguls was a tough job.																								Westerns have not been fashionable for a long time in Hollywood but Costner ploughed an obstinate furrow with Wyatt Earp and Silverado. There are plenty of bad westerns and I hated all of them but it was the great ones that fired my imagination, Costner said. I wonder how I would have behaved given the situation these movies created  the dilemma people find themselves in when they are being oppressed or pushed around, when they have to decide on who they are as people, their moral stance.																								So why has Hollywood turned its back on westerns?																								Number one, it has got lazy with itself and bad ones were being made. Eventually its like someone who abuses the land  it wont grow anything anymore.																								The overview of the western is that they are very simple when in fact it is just the opposite  they are very complicated: how you create characters that lived in that time and show the relevance in your own life in 2004.																								Open Range is an old-fashioned tale about two freewheeling cowboys, played by Robert Duvall and Costner who also directs the movie. They are out to settle scores with an evil cattleman played larger than life by Michael Gambon.

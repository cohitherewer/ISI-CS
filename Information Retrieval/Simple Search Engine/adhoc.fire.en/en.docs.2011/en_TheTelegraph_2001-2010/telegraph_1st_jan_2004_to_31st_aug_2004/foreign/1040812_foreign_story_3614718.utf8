 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Upgraded anti-Israel Iran missile tested
																								Tehran, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Iran said today it carried out a successful field test of the latest version of its Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, which defence experts say can reach Israel or US bases in the Gulf.																								Defence minister Ali Shamkhani said last week Iran was working to improve the range and accuracy of the Shahab-3 in response to Israels moves to boost its anti-missile capability.																								The defence ministry, in a brief statement carried on the official news agency Irna, said the test of the new Shahab-3 was carried out successfully ... The pre-determined targets were hit in the testing, it said.																								Iran says its missile programme is purely for deterrent purposes. Tehran also denies US and Israeli accusations that it is seeking to develop nuclear warheads which could be delivered by the Shahab-3.																								Based on the North Korean Nodong-1 and modified with Russian technology, the Shahab-3 is thought to have a range of 1,300 km which would allow it to strike anywhere in Israel. Shahab means meteor in Persian.																								Amid media speculation that Israel may try to halt Irans nuclear programme by carrying out air strikes on some atomic facilities in Iran, Iranian officials have said Tehran would retaliate promptly and strongly to any such attack.																								If Israel behaves like a lunatic and attacks the Iranian nations interests, we will come down on their heads like a mallet and break their bones, the ISNA students news agency quoted Revolutionary Guards Commander Yahya Rahim Safavi as saying today. Israel successfully tested its Arrow II anti-missile project in the US last month. It was the seventh time the Arrow II had worked but the first time it had destroyed a Scud missile  similar to the Shahab-3  in flight.

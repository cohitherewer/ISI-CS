 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Japan nerve gas guru sentenced to hang
				 	 Shoko AsaharaTokyo, Feb. 27 (Reuters): A former Japanese cult guru was sentenced to hang today for masterminding a sarin nerve gas attack on Tokyo subway trains in 1995 that killed 12, sickened thousands and shattered Japans myth of public safety.																								Shoko Asahara, 48, who led the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect), was found guilty at Tokyo District Court of 13 charges including responsibility for the subway attack and a series of other crimes that killed another 15 people.																								His crimes did not stop at the murder of specific individuals but expanded into indiscriminate acts of terrorism, said Judge Shoji Ogawa. I sentence the defendant to death, Ogawa said after Asahara stood to hear the verdict that concluded the eight-year trial. Eight guards had to help him rise at the judges order to stand. The gassing, with its images of bodies lying across platforms and soldiers in gas masks sealing off Tokyo subway stations, stunned the Japanese public, accustomed to crime-free streets.																								Aums arsenal including sarin, first developed by the Nazis, raised concern worldwide about the ease with which biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction could be made. These actions plunged Japan and the world into deep fear, the judge said, calling the crimes merciless, vicious and brutal. 																								About 5,500 people were injured, some permanently, when members of the doomsday cult released sarin in Tokyo rush-hour trains on March 20, 1995.																								Asahara, handcuffed and clad in a black sweatsuit, his once-flowing black locks and beard now cut short and flecked with grey, muttered and smiled as he was led into the court. He had pleaded not guilty but never testified.In a long statement, the judge said Asahara ordered the 1989 murder of anti-Aum lawyer Tsutsumi Sakamoto and his wife and child, and conspired in a 1994 sarin attack in central Japan that killed seven, as well as in the 1995 subway assault.

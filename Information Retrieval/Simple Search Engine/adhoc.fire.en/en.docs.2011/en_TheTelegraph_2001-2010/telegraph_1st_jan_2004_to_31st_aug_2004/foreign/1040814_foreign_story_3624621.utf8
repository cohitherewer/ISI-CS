 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 China shifts villagers after quake hits dams 
																								Beijing, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Nearly 50,000 people are in danger after a deadly earthquake struck southwestern China this week and opened cracks in walls of several reservoir dams that could collapse, officials said today.																								Four people were killed, nearly 600 people injured and more than 125,000 left homeless in Ludian county in Yunnan province by Tuesdays earthquake, which measured 5.6 on the Richter scale.																								The tremor damaged 22 rammed-earth reservoirs about 400 km north of the provincial capital, Kunming. Leaks have already opened in some of the dams, officials said. About 47,000 residents living downstream of the reservoirs are endangered, the Xinhua news agency said.																								We have found two cracks on the walls of the reservoir, each two metres wide, said an official from the Yongfeng reservoir, the largest of the 22.																								The cracks had appeared in the upper part of the 13.5-metre high reservoir wall and no flooding had yet occurred, he said. But there is still a threat that the wall could collapse. An official with the provincial government said one or two of the reservoirs were affected. All the others are safe, he said, adding that workers had begun to evacuate around 2,000 villagers.																								The state relief agency issued a notice requiring check-ups to all reservoirs within the affected areas and around-the-clock safety patrols, Xinhua said.

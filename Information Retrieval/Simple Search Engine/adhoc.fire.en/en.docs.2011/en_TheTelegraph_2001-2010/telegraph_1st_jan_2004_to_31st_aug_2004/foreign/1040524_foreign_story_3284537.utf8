 TOM PARFITT																								Moscow, May 23: The Amber Room, the fabulous tsarist chamber looted from Russia by the Nazis during the Second World War and which subsequently disappeared, was destroyed by the Red Army, a book has revealed.																								Previously unseen documents, suppressed for decades by Moscow, show that in 1945 Russian soldiers burned down the hall where the treasure was stored in a castle in Germany founded by the Teutonic knights.																								Historians have always hoped that the eighth wonder of the world  an entire room panelled and decorated in amber  had escaped damage and was safely hidden, waiting to be found. The jewel encrusted room was created for Peter the Great in 1717 and was considered one of the worlds greatest art treasures.																								In The Amber Room: The Untold Story of the Greatest Hoax of the Twentieth Century, however, authors Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark reveal that Moscow deliberately covered up a report on its fate. 																								Stalins henchmen were apparently anxious to avoid the ignominy of admitting that Soviet soldiers had destroyed one of Russias finest treasures.																								To this day, the authors claim, Moscow has maintained the pretence that the Amber Room might still be discovered, knowing that it was turned to ashes by its own troops. 																								In recent years the missing room has been used as a pawn in negotiations with Berlin on the return of valuable works of art looted from Germany by the Red Army.																								Yet, documents found at the Central State Archive of Literature and Arts reveal that Anatoly Kuchomov, a curator at the Pushkin summer palace in St Petersburg, from which the Nazis stripped the Amber Room in 1941, was sent to Konigsberg Castle five years later to investigate its fate.																								He found that Soviet troops, either in a frenzy of revenge or through ill discipline, had destroyed the Knights Hall at the castle in April 1945, as they swept through Germany at the end of the war.																								Notes made by Kucho- mov record an interview with Paul Feyerabend, the manager of a bar that was located in the castles former torture chamber. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 General says she resisted bid to use force in prison 
 R.JEFFREY SMITH AND JOSH WHITE Brigadier General Janis Karpinski Michael Berg (left), father of Nicholas, is comforted by his son David at their Pennsylvania home. (AP) 																								Washington, May 12: The American general who was in charge of running prisons in Iraq told army investigators earlier this year that she had resisted decisions by superior officers to hand over control of the prisons to military intelligence officials and to authorise the use of lethal force as a first step in keeping order, command decisions that have come in for heavy criticism in the Iraqi prison abuse scandal. 																								Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, head of the 800th Military Police Brigade, spoke of her resistance to the decisions in a detailed account of her tenure furnished to army investigators. It places two of the highest-ranking army officers now in Iraq, Major General Geoffrey Miller and Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, at the heart of decision-making on both matters. 																								Karpinski, who has been formally admonished by the army for her actions in Iraq, said both men overruled her concerns about the military intelligence takeover and the use of deadly force. 																								Each man contests portions of her account, which appears in the classified annex to the armys internal probe into the abuse and torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. Her account was described by a US government official to The Washington Post and confirmed by her attorney. 																								Karpinskis account surfaced on the same day another officer accused by the army of wrongdoing in the scandal, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry . Phillabaum, released an official rebuttal stating that Abu Ghraib perpetually lacked key resources and personnel, and that the leadership above him was almost entirely unresponsive to his requests for help. 																								Phillabaum wrote that military police assigned to the prison were not properly trained in the Geneva Conventions or detention operations, but that training alone would not have prevented the abuses, which he said came at the hands of a few soldiers. 																								He also said that in one instance, a female guard under his command took vigilante justice, using physical force against a male prisoner who she believed had assaulted Jessica Lynch, an army private captured by Iraqi soldiers and later rescued by American troops during the war. 																								Karpinski said the decision about transferring control of the prison to military intelligence officials was broached at a September 2003 meeting with Miller, who was then in charge of the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, known colloquially as Gitmo. 																								 Karpinski, the first female general officer to lead US soldiers in combat, was a beleaguered field commander trying to cope with what she and others have described as constantly shifting assignments, poor living conditions and near-daily mortar attacks on Abu Ghraib prison. 																								Two US sergeants will face court martial on a string of charges relating to the assault and sexual humiliation of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison, officials said today. No dates were fixed for the trials of Staff Sergeant Ivan Chip Frederick and Sergeant Javal Davis. 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Suhartos ex-party casts cloud on Megawati fate
				 	 An Indonesian woman looks at a list of candidates at a Jakarta polling station on Sunday. (Reuters) 																								Jakarta, April 4 (Reuters): The former party of ousted autocrat Suharto is set to win the most votes in Indonesias parliamentary elections tomorrow as it taps a yearning for the stability and rapid economic growth of his long rule.																								Although opinion polls show Golkar, once Suhartos political vehicle, getting nowhere near a majority, the result is likely to be a big blow to incumbent President Megawati Sukarnoputri and could dent her hopes of winning a second term later this year.																								More than 147 million voters in the worlds most populous Muslim nation are eligible to take part in elections for the 550-seat parliament and local legislatures, billed as the biggest and most complex one-day vote the world has ever seen.																								Tens of thousands of police and soldiers will guard polling stations amid fears that Muslim militants could launch attacks.																								Given the size of Indonesia, it may take one or two days before a significant number of votes have been counted.																								Besides putting Golkar ahead of Megawatis Indonesia Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), opinion polls also show the President trailing for the first time in the presidential election race set for July to her former chief security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.																								The respected retired general, the candidate of a smaller party, quit the cabinet last month after a row with Megawati.																								This may be the watershed point, said William Liddle, an Indonesian expert at Ohio State University visiting for the election. Support for Megawatis party has been going down for some time. Now her personal popularity is also dropping.																								The latest Indonesia Survey Institute poll showed Golkar winning 23.2 per cent of tomorrows vote, with Megawatis party, currently the strongest in parliament, taking 17.5 per cent.																								A separate poll by a U.-based group had Golkar with 22.2 per cent and PDI-P 11.5 per cent in a field of two dozen parties. Both Golkar and PDI-P are secular-nationalist.																								In northwestern Aceh, which is under martial law as Indonesian troops try to quell separatist rebels, the provinces governor warned of possible unrest but urged people to vote.																								I ask people not to get contaminated with calls to forego their voting rights. There will be people who probably dont want others to participate, or who will stir up trouble, governor Abdullah Puteh said.

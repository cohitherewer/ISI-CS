 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Swarovski blazes new trail in chandeliers
				 	 A Swarovski crystal chandelier called  Lolita on show in Milan. (Reuters)Milan, April 21 (Reuters): Youre swirling around the ballroom, colourful skirts shimmering under the chandeliers when all of a sudden one of the crystal cascades above your head asks you for the next dance.																								A surrealist dream? No, a design from the house of Swarovski crystals as it blazes a new trail in the often stuffy world of chandeliers.																								The Austrian crystal group teamed up with 10 designers to re-invent luxurious lighting at Milan Design Week, mixing 21st century technology with the clean cuts D. Swarovski amp; Co has been perfecting for the last 109 years.																								Glimmering in a black warehouse, an Art Deco falling spiral chandelier had crowds of party-goers mesmerised as they sent text messages to the light and watched their SMS trickle through the crystal strands like a luxurious ticker tape.																								Its time to shake up the industry. There are too many chandeliers around with no life and soul  just expensive cookie-cutter designs, said Nadja Swarovski, grand-daughter of the companys founder and vice-president of communications. 																								Were challenging designers to rework the chandelier any way they want. The results are so modern in both terms of beauty and interactivity, she said, as the Lolita light behind her sparkled with the news that Davide loves Carina.																								The technology behind Lolita is more likely to be found in a physics lab than a design studio. Electronic processors strip data out of a mobile phone and send it to strings of LED lights hanging inside crystal cylinders. Electrical impulses then switch the tiny white lights on and off in sequence so the words of the SMS seem to slide along the sparkling strings.																								The glistening chandeliers are not for the faint hearted with Nest  a giant swirl of 7,800 coin-sized crystals draped around a luminous white oval  worth more than 15,000 euros ($18,480) in crystal alone.																								But Swarovski believes the Crystal Palace chandelier project is worth every penny.																								As well as breathing new life into luxury lighting, Swarovski loves the fact that designers, manufacturers and crystal cutters are fostering new ideas and urging each other to push beyond known boundaries.																								Its just like my grandfather who worked with designers like Christian Dior and Coco Chanel. They would ask for a coating that would make material shine like the Northern Lights and back he went to Austria and created it, beamed Swarovski.																								The bubbly 33-year-old has been the force behind Swarovskis return to fashion, branding the crystals with their own label and publicising their quality to set them and their price apart from run-of-the-mill diamante or rhinestones.

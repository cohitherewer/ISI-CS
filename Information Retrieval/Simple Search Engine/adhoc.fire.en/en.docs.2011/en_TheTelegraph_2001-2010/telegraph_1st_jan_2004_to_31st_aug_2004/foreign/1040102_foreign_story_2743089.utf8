 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Koizumi in shrine strife
				 	 Koizumi at the shrine. (Reuters)																								Tokyo, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited a controversial shrine honouring the countrys war dead today, triggering instant condemnation from South Korea and China, both victims of Japans wartime aggression.																								Since taking office in 2001, the nationalistic Koizumi has outraged Japans Asian neighbours three times with previous visits to the Yasukuni Shrine seen by many as a symbol of the militarist regime that led Japan into war.																								The shrine is dedicated to Japans 2.5 million military war dead since 1853, including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and 13 other convicted Class A war criminals.																								The visit comes shortly before Japan is expected to dispatch a large force of non-combat troops to Iraq in what may become its biggest, most dangerous military mission since World War Two.																								A solemn Koizumi, dressed in a formal kimono and a black haori coat, bowed briefly as he entered the shrine.																								Chinese vice-foreign minister Wang Yi summoned Japans charge daffaires in Beijing to express strong indignation, China Central Television said.																								China strongly condemns the act, which hurts the feelings of war victims, Wang was quoted as saying.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Fahrenheit too hot for Kuwait
				 	 Michael Moore																								Kuwait City, Aug. 1 (AP): Kuwait, a major US ally in the Gulf, has banned Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11 because it deems the movie insulting to the Saudi Arabian royal family and critical of the US invasion of Iraq, an official said today. 																								We have a law that prohibits insulting friendly nations, and ties between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are special, Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour, cinema and production supervisor at the information ministry, said.																								He said the film insulted the Saudi royal family by saying they had common interests with the Bush family and that those interests contradicted with the interests of the American people.																								Fahrenheit 9/11, which won the top honour at Mays Cannes film festival, depicts the White House as asleep at the wheel before the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington.

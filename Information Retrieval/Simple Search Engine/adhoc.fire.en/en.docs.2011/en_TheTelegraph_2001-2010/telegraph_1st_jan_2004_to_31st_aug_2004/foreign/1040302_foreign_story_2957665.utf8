 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Putin chooses seasoned trade official as PM
				 	 Mikhail Fradkov																								Moscow, March 1 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin made a surprise choice for Prime Minister today, picking a bureaucrat with credentials to appeal to the powerful law and order lobby while reassuring western investors.																								Putin, catching Kremlin-watchers on the hop, picked Mikhail Fradkov, a former chief tax policeman and seasoned trade official, to succeed Mikhail Kasyanov, whom he sacked last week.																								Putin said Fradkov, 53, Russias envoy to the EU and a former trade minister, had strong experience in fighting corruption, adding that the job required a top professional with wide-ranging government experience.																								Fradkovs mixed background makes him an acceptable figure for both Kremlin hardliners, many of whom have strong security backgrounds and prefer greater state control, and economic reformers, who want to lure foreign investment, analysts said. Fradkov has something of an image of belonging to the security lobby because he directed the tax police, said political analyst Igor Bunin.																								At the same time, he is a man who will not spook western investors, because he is a good negotiator who has good external relations.																								By plumping for someone who belongs to neither Kremlin power bloc, Putin will be able to count on a Prime Minister who is loyal  leaving him in an even stronger position when he is re-elected for a second term on March 14.																								Putins parliamentary allies, with their huge majority in the State Duma (lower house), made his appointment a certainty by saying they would support Fradkovs nomination on March 5.																								News of the surprise nomination triggered brief selling on the Russian stock exchange, but prices recovered. The rouble slipped about a kopeck to 28.53 to the dollar  mirroring market uncertainty about what Fradkovs appointment meant.																								Analysts expected Fradkov to announce his government within days of the Dumas endorsement. By the time election day comes round, Putin will have in place a government ready to announce its economic programme. Many commentators expected Fradkov to keep key figures from the Kasyanov team.

 GODFREY BARKER AND GERHARD CHARLES RUMP				 	 Picassos Boy with a Pipe 																								London, June 13: A descendant of the original owners of the $104-million Picasso that became the worlds most expensive painting last month is consulting lawyers to establish how his family lost ownership of the masterpiece.																								Prof Julius H Schoeps, a historian at the University of Potsdam, claims that the Picasso, Boy with a Pipe, was sold in 1949 despite his great-uncles will stating that he wished the painting to remain in the Berlin family. He is arguing that the provisions of his great-uncles will, which was made in 1935 with the aim of keeping the painting, and others, out of Nazi hands, were morally breached by the subsequent sale of the Picasso, which he describes as a betrayal of his family.																								Prof Schoeps has now called in lawyers to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. I have known about the will only since 1993 and I have known about the Picasso only since Sothebys contacted me earlier this year to help with its cataloguing, said Prof Schoeps.																								It has seemed to us too late to act. But my family has, in a certain way, been betrayed. he said. What happened in 1949 may have been correct in law, but in morals it was highly problematic.																								Prof Schoeps said that the will made in 1935 by one of the greatest pre-war Jewish art collectors, Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, intended that all his property  including the Picasso and nine paintings by Vincent van Gogh  should descend in the family of his sisters after the death of his wife.																								Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, who was childless, inserted a device in the will that pre-bequeathed the art to his Christian wife to save it from being seized by the Nazis, but this backfired when she defied his wishes and sold off his most valuable pictures in the 1940s.																								Asked if he would seek to use the law to retrieve the Picasso, Prof Schoeps replied: Thats not my wish. I cannot say what to do. Others know better than me.																								Sothebys, asked if it thought a case to challenge last months sale might succeed against the Picassos anonymous new owner replied: Absolutely not. We are very clear from conversations before and after the sale that there is no legal issue here and that he is not planning to pursue any legal case against the sale of the Picasso.

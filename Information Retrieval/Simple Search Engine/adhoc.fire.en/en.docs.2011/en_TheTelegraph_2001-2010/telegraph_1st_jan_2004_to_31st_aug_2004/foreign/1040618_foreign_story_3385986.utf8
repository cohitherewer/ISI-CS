Thomas and his team of experts at Londons Creechurch Underwriting got down to work, compiling a four-page document which details every possible eventuality. 																																	A payout would be triggered if, in the opinion of two independent medical referees, the insured person has suffered loss of more than 85 per cent of his hair covering the front of his torso, it says. 																																	If the star was to be left with a bald torso through war, revolution, radioactive contamination or terrorism  sorry, no payout.

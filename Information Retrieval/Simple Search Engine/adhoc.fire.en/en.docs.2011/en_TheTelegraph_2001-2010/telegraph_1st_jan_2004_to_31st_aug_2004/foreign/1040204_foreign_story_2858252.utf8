The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, February 04, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Holy heist																																	 Rio De Janeiro, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The Bible is mightier than the gun, at least for a group of Brazilian robbers.																																	Unsure if their weapons had caused enough fear, robbers who broke into a monastery made a priest swear on the Bible that he had handed over all the money, police said on Friday.																																	The 15 hooded men who stole some $6,200 from a secluded Catholic monastery near the town of Guaratingueta in Sao Paulo state were apologetic. They were asking the priests to forgive them during the robbery, saying they were only doing it as they needed the money, said police investigator Flavio Andre Averaldo.																																	And before leaving they made one priest swear on the Holy Bible that there was nothing left.																													 																Duce facelift																																	Rome (Reuters): Former fascist dictator Benito Mussolini could soon get a facelift if efforts by local politicians and businessmen to restore his profile carved into a natural rock face succeed. Mussolinis features, blasted by forest rangers into the top of a mountain overlooking the Furlo Gorge in central Italy in 1936, were mangled when World War II resistance fighters blew up the nose and trees were encouraged to grow over it. But a handful of local politicians  from both the Left and the Right  are discussing a proposal by a local inn-keeper who says restoring Il Duces stern profile, with its puckered lips and furrowed eyebrows, could boost tourism. The monument is part of our history and were not doing ourselves any favours by ignoring it, said Bruno Capanna, Centre-left mayor of nearby Acqualagna. The monument straddles the territories of two towns, and the mayor of nearby Fermignano is not enthusiastic. He says the only tourists it would attract would be skinheads nostalgic for Mussolini.																													 																Cute cat																																	 Tokyo (Reuters): Fans of Japans ubiquitous Hello Kitty character can already buy anything from pop-up toasters to bicycles adorned with the winsome cats face. Now 30 of the wealthier admirers of the popular puss have an opportunity to get their paws on something a little more exclusive. For just 3 million yen ($28,400), they can buy a 3 cm high platinum Kitty, her dress and hair ribbon studded with 131 diamonds. Tokyo jeweller Tanaka Kikinzoku Jewelry is offering a limited edition of 30 of the platinum figurines from Monday to celebrate this years 30th anniversary of the countrys most famous cat. Kitty is known to have undergone at least one facelift during her career, which brought her eyes and nose closer together for a cuter look.

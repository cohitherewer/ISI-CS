 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Greece gears up for D-Day
 															- biggest deployment since World war ii for games				 	 Athenians drive along the Olympic line after its inauguration in central Athens on Sunday. The left lane of the citys key arteries will be exclusively reserved for vehicles bearing Olympic accreditations during the August 13-29 Games. (AFP) 																								Athens, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Europes biggest and longest peacetime security operation went into force today when no go areas were imposed in Athens for the Olympic Games starting later this month.																								The measures, which dwarf any previous in Europe because of the need to sustain them for the entire month of August, were clamped on the Greek capital even though the US admiral overseeing Nato involvement said the Games threat so far was benign.																								With hundreds of athletes already arriving in Athens for the worlds largest sporting event, one newspaper warned Athens residents that the August 13-29 Olympics would turn their lives upside down. 																								The Nos of August, the Eleftherotypia newspaper called the security measures and traffic restrictions that will reach into every corner of the city of four million.																								Greek organisers have spent three times the amount for the last Olympics in Sydney, to guard the Games with the fallout of the September 11, 2001 attacks and Iraq hanging over them.																								Nato, Patriot missiles, anti-chemical warfare experts, submarines, frogmen and up-to-date surveillance equipment will be at the disposal of a 70,000-strong military and police force. 																								This is the biggest operation by the Greek armed forces since World War II, said army general Vassilis Giannopoulos. Weve planned for everything.																								As well as guarding venues, troops will be stationed at power stations, waterworks, tunnels and bridges. 																								We can have a plane in the sky in one second, Giannopoulos said of the air cover for the Games. Some 1,200 surveillance cameras have been deployed throughout the city.																								Frogmen will guard cruise ships, including the worlds largest, the Queen Mary II, where many VIPs will stay.																								In an interview with the Washington Post, Admiral Gregory Johnson said there was no specific intelligence information signalling a possible terrorist attack on Athens.

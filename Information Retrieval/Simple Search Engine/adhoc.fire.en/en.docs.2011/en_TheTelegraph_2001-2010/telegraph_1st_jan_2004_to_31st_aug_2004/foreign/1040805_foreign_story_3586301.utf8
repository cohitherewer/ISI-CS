 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Jordan hostages freed in Falluja raid
				 	 The four Jordanian hostages after their release in Falluja. (Reuters)																								Baghdad, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Four Jordanian hostages were freed by Iraqi gunmen who raided their captors hide-out, one of the released captives said today, while a video from kidnappers said two Turkish hostages had also been released.																								The news provided a moment of respite in the hostage crisis confronting Iraqs interim government, but fighting between police and insurgents in Mosul that killed at least 12 people underscored the scale of the security challenge they face.																								One of the Jordanian hostages said he had been released with three other Jordanian truck drivers after a group of Iraqis stormed a house in the city of Falluja late yesterday and freed them without firing a shot.																								When the brave people of Falluja knew that we were held hostage they raided the house and rescued us last night. We are all safe, one of the hostages, Ahmad Hassan Abu Jafaar, said in Baghdad by telephone. Were expecting to go back to Jordan today.																								A group calling itself the Death Squad of Iraqi Resistance said last Thursday it was holding the Jordanians to put pressure on their transport company to stop cooperation with US forces. Jafaar said the kidnappers had wanted money.																								The Iraqi rescuers were sent by a council of local elders formed last month to battle crime and kidnapping in Falluja, where the interim government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi in Baghdad exercises only minimal authority.																								Insurgents aiming to disrupt supplies delivered to US forces from neighbouring countries have seized foreign drivers in the past few months, threatening to kill them unless their employers stop operating in Iraq or pay ransoms.																								Relatives of the Jordanians, who were seized nine days ago, said they were staying with a local leader in Falluja. 																								They are now staying in the home of Haji Ibrahim Mohammad in the town of Falluja. They spent the night in his house after their release last night from their kidnappers, said Mohammad Hassan Abu Jafaar, Jafaars brother.																								Al Jazeera television reported that a group linked to Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi  who Washington accuses of being an al Qaida ally  had released two Turkish drivers because their firm agreed to stop working in Iraq.																								Due to the Turkish firms decision to stop sending supplies to US forces in Iraq, the Tawhid and Jihad Group has decided to free the two Turkish hostages, said a videotaped statement from the group broadcast on the Arabic satellite channel.																								Turkish foreign minister Abdullah Gul confirmed the release: This good news has made us happy, he told the Anatolian state news agency.																								On Sunday, two haulage firms said they were prepared to suspend operations in Iraq after the two Turkish drivers were seized. The militants had threatened to behead the pair within 48 hours unless their employees stopped working in Iraq.																								In the northern city of Mosul, Iraqi police and insurgents exchanged rifle and rocket-propelled grenade fire in the streets, killing at least 12 civilians and wounding at least 38, including several police and Iraqi national guard officers. There was fierce fighting in several areas of the city, a Reuters correspondent there said.																								The governor imposed a curfew starting at 1100 GMT, according to local television.

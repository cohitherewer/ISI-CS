 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 US team flies into Tripoli with hope
																								Tripoli, Jan. 25 (Reuters): A delegation of US lawmakers arrived in Tripoli to see Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi today and said they were confident the US would eventually restore relations and end economic sanctions.																								Were very excited and pleased about the direction your leader has taken. We want to be friends, the head of the delegation, Pennsylvania Republican Curt Weldon, told the Libyan officials who met the delegation at Tripoli airport. 																								The lawmakers arrived on a US navy plane and Weldon said it was the first US military aircraft to land in Tripoli since Gaddafi overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969.																								Another US lawmaker, California Democrat Tom Lantos, arrived in Tripoli yesterday on a separate mission.																								The Libyan government announced last month that it was abandoning programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction, opening the way for better relations with the West.																								Weldon said it was up to President George W. Bush and secretary of state Colin Powell to work up a timetable for relations and ending sanctions, imposed over the years because of bombings attributed to Libyan agents and Libyan support for Palestinian and other militants.

 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Lanka monks launch campaign
																								Colombo, March 2 (Reuters): Red-robed monks launched their campaign today for Sri Lankas approaching election with offerings to Buddha and a pledge to keep the country united in the face of demands to devolve powers to Tamil Tiger rebels.																								Although a monk held a seat in the previous parliament, this is the first time they have run a nationwide campaign and are fielding more than 200 candidates running on a platform to protect the ethnic-majority Sinhalese community.																								The monks are being criticised by certain people, saying this is not their duty. But in history, monks came forward to protect the country when the rulers did not perform their duties, Reverend Omalpe Sobitha said at Kelaniya temple, one of three places in Sri Lanka Gautama Buddha is said to have visited.																								The Buddhist clergy has long been a powerful political force and a vocal critic of the bid to end two decades of civil war with the Tamil Tigers, the vast majority of whom are Hindu.																								The monks have not formed a party to contest parliamentary polls on April 2. 																								Instead, the nationalist Sihala Urumaya party has nominated more than 200 Buddhists to run under the Jathika Hela Urumaya party banner.

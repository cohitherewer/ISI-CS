 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Scandal booms on Wall Street
New York, July 7 (Reuters): A historic sex discrimination trial of Wall Street brokerage Morgan Stanley was delayed today until later this week when the firm will face claims it denied women promotions and allowed sexual groping and office strip shows.																								Jury selection was scheduled to begin this morning but US district judge Richard Berman unexpectedly postponed the start of proceedings until Friday afternoon. The judge said he was taking the time to review objections to expert witnesses whom the parties wanted to testify at the trial. Deep-pocketed Wall Street firms have rarely been brought to trial for sexual discrimination, and the suit marks the first such case against a brokerage brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.																								The case is reminiscent of the notorious Boom-Boom Room allegations against Smith Barney, now a unit of Citigroup Inc. That case, settled in 1997, included accusations that women were harassed and intimidated by male workers at what was known as the Boom-Boom Room at the firms Garden City, New York, branch. 																								Following that case, New Yorks then attorney general held a public hearing on sexual discrimination on Wall Street at which women complained of groping and threats of violence.																								The suit against Morgan Stanley was filed on September 10, 2001. It focuses on salary and promotion issues and says women are still subjected to groping, slaps on the buttocks and a range of unacceptable office antics including striptease shows and breast-shaped birthday cakes. Discrimination lawyers say the suit shows the securities industry still lags in the area of gender equality.																								Wall Street still believes that women are inferior, that men are better, more competent... more interested in advancing their careers, said Linda Friedman, a Chicago lawyer specialising in discrimination. They have made strides, but there is still an enormous amount of work to be done. Morgan Stanley, one of the largest US securities firms, could face tens of millions of dollars in damages if found liable. The case, brought on behalf of more than 300 women who have worked in the companys institutional-equities division since 1995, will likely last about three weeks.																								Discrimination litigation is a growing concern in corporate America. Last month, a federal judge ruled that the largest workplace bias lawsuit in US history could proceed as a class-action against Wal-Mart Stores, the worlds largest retailer. That case covers as many as 1.6 million current and former female employees.

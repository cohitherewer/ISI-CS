 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Gunman kills Tamil nominee
																								Colombo, March 1 (Reuters): A gunman burst into a hospital in eastern Sri Lanka today and shot dead a Tamil candidate for next months parliamentary election.																								Sinnathamby Sunderapillai, 65, was in hospital receiving treatment for gunshot wounds after he was attacked by intruders in his home on Saturday night, police said.																								Sunderapillai, a Tamil running to represent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes party in Batticaloa, is the first person to be murdered in the campaign for elections on April 2. Sri Lankan elections are violent and about 70 people died in the last parliamentary vote late in 2001.																								No one has claimed responsibility for todays pre-dawn attack, which came two days after Amnesty International appealed to the Tamil Tiger rebels to let opposing ethnic Tamil politicians campaign freely.																								The rebels are backing candidates of the Tamil National Alliance  a possible kingmaker if predictions of a close result prove true  and the rights group said it was concerned other Tamil candidates could become targets for assassination.																								There have already been more than 100 reports of election-related violence, most involving the rival parties of Wickremesinghe and President Chandrika Kumaratunga.																								Despite a truce signed two years ago, the US said in a recent report the rebels had killed more than 36 members of Tamil political groups in the past year.																								The election will be fought mainly over how to pursue peace with the rebels, with Kumaratunga saying Wickremesinghe conceded too much to the Tigers in the six rounds of talks his government presided over. 																								But Wickremesinghes party fought back today, saying the internal differences of Kumaratungas coalition would make it impossible for it to talk peace with the Tigers.																								There is a substantial risk of the peace process breaking down in the event of the Alliance coming to power, spokesman G.L. Peiris told a news conference.																								Kumaratungas party allied with the hardline Marxist Peoples Liberation Front (JVP) in January, but the JVP takes a much harder line on the Tigers, and has called for a renegotiation of the Norwegian-brokered ceasefire.																								 With such divergences, they cant carry on talks with the LTTE, Peiris said.																								Kumaratungas party has said it would continue peace negotiations and accused Wickremesinghe of fear-mongering by saying the alliance would bring the island back to war.

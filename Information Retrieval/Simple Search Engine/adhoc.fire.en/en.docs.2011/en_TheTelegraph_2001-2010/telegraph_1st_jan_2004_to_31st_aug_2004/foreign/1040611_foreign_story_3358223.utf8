(Reuters)																								Washington, June 10 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld may move to extend the investigation of abuses of Iraqi prisoners to include top military ranks, defence officials said today.																								Rumsfeld is considering a request by the commander of US forces in West Asia to replace a two-star army general investigating the prisoner abuse scandal. The move, sought this week by army General John Abizaid, would replace Major General George Fay with a more senior general and open the way for questioning of top US officers to help determine who is responsible for the scandal.																								Under army regulations, Fay, whose report was expected this month, is prohibited from questioning officers above his rank. The defence officials, who asked not to be identified, said the report could be delayed for a month if Rumsfeld gives his approval as expected.																								In a major scandal that has sparked outrage in the Arab and Muslin world, US military police have been accused of hooding, stripping naked and sexually humiliating prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. Several investigations are under way and have extended to other jails in Iraq and Afghanistan.																								The requested change in investigation leadership was reported today by the New York Times and Washington Post.																								Fay has been investigating not only the abuse at Abu Ghraib by military police, but to what extent US military intelligence troops might have been involved in either ordering the abuse or taking part. 																								Military police, one of whom has already pleaded guilty and been sentenced to a year in prison, said they were obeying orders.																								The request by Abizaid comes amid growing criticism from some members of the US Congress and grumbling by military officers that the investigation of Abu Ghraib could end up punishing only a handful of enlisted soldiers and leaving senior officers unaccountable.

 Monday, May 17, 2004 Body blow for America in abuse row
Rumsfeld knew of methods, says report
 Donald RumsfeldWashington, May 16 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld authorised the use of unconventional interrogation methods in Iraq to gain intelligence about the growing insurgency, ultimately leading to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, the New Yorker magazine reported yesterday.																								Rumsfeld gave the green light to methods previously used in Afghanistan for gathering intelligence on members of al Qaida, which the US blames for the September 11, 2001, attacks, the magazine reported on its website.																								The Pentagon, however, called the assertions outlandish, conspiratorial, and filled with anonymous conjecture, and strongly denied that Rumsfeld, who has been under fire for the prisoner abuse scandal, or any Pentagon official had sanctioned the interrogation programme.																								Defence department spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said the abuses of Iraqis at the Abu Ghraib prison depicted in photos and videos had no basis in any sanctioned programme, training manual, instruction, or order of the department of defence.																								US interrogation techniques have come under scrutiny amid revelations that prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad were kept naked, stacked on top of one another, forced to engage in sex acts and photographed in humiliating poses.																								Rumsfeld, who has rejected calls by some Democrats and a number of major newspapers to resign, returned on Friday from a surprise trip to Iraq and Abu Ghraib prison, calling the scandal a body blow.																								The US military has now prohibited several interrogation methods from being used in Iraq, including sleep and sensory deprivation and body stress positions, defence officials said on Friday.																								The New Yorker said the interrogation plan was a highly classified special access programme, or SAP, that gave advance approval to kill, capture or interrogate so-called high-value targets in the battle against terror.																								Such secret methods were used extensively in Afghanistan but more sparingly in Iraq  only in the search for former President Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction. As the Iraqi insurgency grew and more US soldiers died, Rumsfeld and defense undersecretary for intelligence Stephen Cambone expanded the scope to bring the interrogation tactics to Abu Ghraib, the article said.																								The magazine, which based its article on interviews with several past and present American intelligence officials, reported the plan was approved and carried out last year after deadly bombings in August at the UN headquarters and Jordanian embassy in Baghdad.																								A former intelligence official quoted in the article said Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, approved the programme but may not have known about the abuse. The rules governing the secret operation were grab whom you must. Do what you want, the unidentified former intelligence official told the New Yorker.Powell apology																								Secretary of state Colin Powell apologised today to Iraqi prisoners abused by US soldiers, one day after he gave a speech in which he promised justice but left many Arabs angry and distrustful.																								The President has expressed an apology on behalf of the nation. (I will) reinforce that apology. We are devastated by what happened at Abu Ghraib. We apologise to those who were abused in such an awful manner, Powell said in Jordan .

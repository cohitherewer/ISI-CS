Rings, directed by New Zealands Peter Jackson, scored 11 Academy Award nominations, including a spot among the contestants for the years best film and Jacksons name in the race for best director. 																								The epic film based on the third in the trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien novels about a battle for control of Middle Earth was joined on the list of best picture nominees by seafaring adventure Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, crime thriller Mystic River, horse-racing tale Seabiscuit, and Lost in Translation, about two disenchanted Americans in Tokyo.

 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Iraq handover on track: Rice
				 	 A US soldier gestures as he inspects the site where the car bomb exploded in Baghdad. (AFP)Berlin, May 17 (Reuters): US national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said today the killing of the head of Iraqs governing council must not stop the transition of power to the Iraqis in six weeks time.																								Speaking in Berlin, Rice said the death of Izzedin Salim was really unfortunate and sad but such attacks were hard to prevent. We have known for a long time, particularly in the run-up to June 30, that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition, she said. You have to keep the political transition on track.																								But the solution to this is ultimately political and Iraqi, said Rice. It is clearly time for the occupation to end, it is clearly time for the Iraqis to be in control of their own political future.																								Salim, a Shia who edited several newspapers, was in a convoy waiting to enter the coalition headquarters when a bomb exploded at a checkpoint, killing six people. Rices comments echoed those of White House spokesman Scott McClellan, who said the enemies of freedom would not prevail. He said Salim died working to build a free, democratic and prosperous Iraq.																								The Iraqi people will continue his work and see to it that such a vision becomes a reality. The enemies of a free democratic and peaceful Iraq will not prevail. Democracy and freedom are taking root and these cowardly terrorist acts only make us more determined to finish our work, he said.																								In Berlin, Rice met officials from Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands to discuss Iraq, Afghanistan and the West Asia peace process.																								Rice said she hoped the UN would adopt a resolution on Iraq in the near future. We are not at the text stage yet, and obviously the devil is always in the details. But I think we are on a good course to get a good resolution.Russian hostages freed																								Two Russians abducted by guerrillas in Iraq earlier this month were freed today in the southern outskirts of Baghdad, a Reuters witness said.																								Cameraman Salem Ureibi said the men identified themselves as Andrei Meshcheryakov and Alexander Gordiyenko. They were kidnapped on May 10 in an ambush in which one of their colleagues was killed. They were handed over at the home of a local sheikh who apparently helped negotiate the release of the men, both employees of Russian energy services company Interenergoservis. The company had already pulled scores of its staff out of Iraq last month after several other employees were briefly seized.																								Dozens of hostages have been abducted by guerrillas in Iraq since the start of April. Most have been released, but an Italian hostage was killed last month and earlier this month American entrepreneur Nicholas Berg was beheaded by his captors, who posted video of the decapitation on the Internet.

 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Lanka alliance loses test of strength in House
																								Colombo, April 22 (Reuters): Sri Lankas new government narrowly lost its first test in parliament today, raising fresh questions about whether it has enough power to push ahead with stalled peace talks.																								After more than nine hours of acrimonious wrangling, the Oppositions candidate was elected as speaker of parliament but by a razor-thin margin of just one vote, highlighting the deep ethnic divisions in the Indian Ocean island and the House.																								The vote was an important test of strength for President Chandrika Kumaratungas United Peoples Freedom Alliance, which was left seven seats short of a majority after elections this month but still pledged aggressive constitutional reforms.																								Three rounds of voting were required. The first ended in deadlock and the second in pandemonium after government MPs sat on the ballot box while Opposition members tried to cast their votes. The final vote was 110-109 for the Opposition candidate, former attorney-general W.J.M. Lokubandara. 																								Such a close result shows it is a very, very unstable government, said Jayadeva Uyangoda, head of political science at Colombo University. I dont think the government will resign but it might have a hard time passing any substantial legislation like constitutional changes or perhaps the budget.																								The general election earlier this month was Sri Lankas third in four years. By law, Kumaratunga will not be able to call a fresh election for another year, Uyangoda said.																								Lawmakers argued over procedural details for nearly an hour before the voting began.																								Members of both the government and opposition parties, many dressed in traditional flowing long white tops, openly implored a new party of Buddhist monks for their last-minute support. The monks, in orange and red robes, briefly walked out of the chamber before the first ballot and most abstained from voting.																								Their National Heritage Party, which holds a decisive nine seats in parliament, had been expected to support the Presidents alliance on a limited basis in the longer term. It was not clear if their decision to abstain signalled a change in strategy.

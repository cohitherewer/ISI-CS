The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Hasina aide buried, strike ends
				 	 Women at the funeral of Ivy Rahman in Dhaka. (Reuters)																								Dhaka, Aug. 25 (Reuters): A two-day general strike called after the killing of a Bangladeshi woman Opposition politician in a grenade attack ended today without major violence as thousands of mourners attended her funeral.																								Ivy Rahman, chief of the womens wing of the main Opposition Awami League and a veteran grassroots leader, died yesterday, three days after she lost her legs in a grenade attack on a rally she was attending. Besides Rahman, at least 18 people were killed and more than 150 people wounded when grenades exploded as former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina finished addressing thousands of supporters of her Awami League party on Saturday.																								Party leaders and media said the attack by unknown assailants that killed Rahman and others was aimed at Hasina. The party called the strike to protest against the attack.																								The government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia is under pressure to catch the attackers as well as those responsible for bombs that have killed more than 100 since 2000.																								About 15,000 party supporters, reciting verses from the Quran, accompanied Rahmans wooden, flower-strewn coffin to a cemetery after prayers at Dhakas Baitul Mokarram mosque.																								Police in riot gear stood behind steel barricades as mourners poured out of the mosque but there was no violence. Earlier, police clashed with anti-government protesters near Hasinas house in Dhaka and five activists were injured.																								Protests were held in other parts of the volatile Muslim-majority democracy including the port city of Chittagong and Rajshahi in the northwest but there were no reports of serious violence with only a few minor clashes reported.																								Protesters, some carrying black flags, chanted, Khaleda, we want to know why Ivy is dead? and Revenge, Revenge! Four days of violence following the attack killed one person and injured more than 220 people as Awami League supporters took to the streets and attacked trains, railway stations, vehicles and government offices.

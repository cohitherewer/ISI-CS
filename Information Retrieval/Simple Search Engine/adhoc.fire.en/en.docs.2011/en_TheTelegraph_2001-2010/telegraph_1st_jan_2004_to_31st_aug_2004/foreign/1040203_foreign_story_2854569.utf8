 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Iran reform party to boycott elections
																								Tehran, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Irans largest reform party said today it would boycott a February 20 parliamentary election, turning up the heat on hardliners in the Islamic republics worst political crisis for years.																								Irans reformists are enraged by the decision of the Guardian Council  an un-elected constitutional oversight body run by religious hardliners  to declare more than 2,000 would-be lawmakers unfit to stand in the election. More than 120 reformist lawmakers resigned from parliament yesterday and President Mohammad Khatamis reformist government has called for the vote to be postponed.																								We have no hope that a fair, free and legitimate election can be held on February 20. So in the current circumstances we cannot participate, Mohammad Reza Khatami, head of the Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) party, said.																								He added the party, one of the main backers of his brother the President, would only put forward candidates for an election if the candidate bans were overturned and the vote was delayed to allow more time for campaigning. He said that while the IIPF was not calling on Iranians to abstain from voting, turnout would inevitably be very low.																								The Guardian Councils move has led to international concern about the votes legitimacy and overshadowed celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeinis return from exile to create an Islamic state.																								More than 80 deputies in the reformist-dominated 290-seat parliament are among those barred from the election.																								Should the Guardian Council  comprised of 12 clerics and Islamic jurists  reject the election delay request, Khatamis government could refuse to organise the vote. Khatami could also allow provincial governors, who play a key role in administering polls, to carry out their threat to resign over the issue. If the government holds the election on February 20 it would not be a reformist government anymore, the IIPFs Khatami said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Crackdown on Net song swappers
																								London, March 30 (Reuters): The music industry, fighting an intense battle to stop a worldwide slide in sales, unleashed its first wave of international lawsuits against Internet song-swappers today.																								Writs are being issued against 247 individuals in Italy, Germany, Denmark and Canada. The industry vowed more countries will be added to the dragnet in coming weeks.																								Music trade group, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) alleges those targeted put hundreds, even thousands of tracks on Internet file-sharing services such as Kazaa and WinMX for others to download.																								The industry blames the extensive trade of free music on the Internet for contributing to a five-year slide in music sales and believes that unless it threatens the biggest file traders  or uploaders  with lawsuits, music fans will never buy songs on the Internet in meaningful amounts.																								We have made it clear that file-sharing without the permission of the copyright holder is illegal, that it amounts to file-stealing, and that it affect jobs and livelihoods across the whole industry, said IFPI chairman Jay Berman.																								Ultimately, though, we have learned that education alone is not sufficient, he added.

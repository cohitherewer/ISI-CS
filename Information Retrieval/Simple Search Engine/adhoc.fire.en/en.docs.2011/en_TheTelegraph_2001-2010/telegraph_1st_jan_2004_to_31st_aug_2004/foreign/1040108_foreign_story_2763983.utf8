 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Web slur on Bush
																								Washington, Jan. 7: America received a foretaste yesterday of what is widely expected to be the most vitriolic election campaign in years as the Republicans whipped up a row over a prototype advertisment comparing President George W. Bush to Hitler.																								They were on the website of MoveOn.org, a liberal group backed by George Soros, the billionaire, as entries in a nationwide competition for anti-Bush attack ads. 																								One has Bush giving a speech set against a backdrop of archive footage of Hitler. The other compares the war in Iraq with Hitlers attempt to take over Europe, ending with: What were war crimes in 1945 is foreign policy in 2003.																								The advertisements were among 1,500 submissions, appeared on the website last month before being removed, and lost miserably, the competitions organisers said. 																								But they were a political gift for the Republicans who posted them on the partys website yesterday and trumpeted their outrage. They have been gunning for MoveOn.org since Soros, a sworn enemy of Bush, promised it millions of dollars last year. Attack ads are expected to feature prominently in this years race for the White House, as both sides are raising large sums of money and their core supporters are fired up with anger at their opponents.

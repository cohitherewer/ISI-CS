But she had the last laugh  the judge threw out the case, saying Germany could not ban laughter, newspapers reported today.																																	Unemployed Bernd F., 52, complained to magistrates that 47-year-old Barbara M. kept him awake with over four hours of loud laughter one evening as she enjoyed a meal with eight friends in her Berlin flat above his, the Bild daily said.																																	The judge dismissed the complaint of disturbing the peace, saying the woman had not broken any noise restrictions. Laughter is a general sound of life. It will not be banned, he said.																													 																Super shotDublin (Reuters): Friends of a champion Irish clay pigeon shooter have fulfilled his dying wish by packing his ashes into shotgun cartridges and blasting his remains over firing ranges around the world. Shooting enthusiast Tony Mullan made the request before he died at Easter aged 63 after a year-long illness. Tony said: I want to go out with a bang and its up to you guys to help me, said Willie Hughes, Mullans best friend and shooting partner of 20 years. So I took the lead out of 50 cartridges, put Tonys ashes into them and recrimped them, and now every ground I go to I fire one off, he added. Tony would have done the same for me, he said.

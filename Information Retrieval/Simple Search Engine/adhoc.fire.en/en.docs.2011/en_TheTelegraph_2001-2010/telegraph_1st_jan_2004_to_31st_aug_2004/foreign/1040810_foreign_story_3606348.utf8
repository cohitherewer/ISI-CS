 Tuesday, August 10, 2004  Pak spills NY chopper plot 
 DAVID JOHNSTON AND ERIC LICHTBLAU Washington, Aug. 9: Pakistan  has given American officials what they regard as credible  and specific information indicating that al Qaida has considered  using tourist helicopters in terror attacks in New York  City, domestic security officials said yesterday. As a result, the officials said,  security measures for helicopter operators in New York City  will be stepped up in a new directive as early as this week.  Among the new measures under review is a requirement for  operators to conduct airport-style screenings of passengers  for suspicious items, said an official with the department  of homeland security who had been briefed on the plan. So  far, no groundings of helicopter operators are planned. Personnel at several Manhattan  helicopter charter companies said yesterday that although  they had already conducted varying degrees of passenger  screening themselves, they had heard of no specific safety  concerns in recent days from the federal government. Separately, a senior American  intelligence official said that more than 1,000 computer  disks had been seized by British authorities during arrests  last week of 12 suspected operatives for al Qaida in England. The seized files are now being  subjected to intensive analysis by British and American  intelligence, but they appear to contain evidence of previously  unknown terrorist planning activities in the US, the official  said.  As a result, Bush administration  officials are preparing for the possibility of expanded  public and private threat alerts.  Officials said they considered  the information about al Qaidas possible interest in things  like helicopters and financial institutions to be critical  in understanding how or where terrorists might strike, if  not when.  Still, intelligence officials  have long pointed out that al Qaida has planned for possible  attacks over several years only to abandon many of them.  An article in the August 8 issue  of Time magazine said that after conducting surveillance  of the Prudential building in Newark, operatives of al Qaida  wrote a report suggesting that a limousine carrying enough  explosives to destroy the building might be able to enter  the parking lot more easily than trucks or vans. The computer information found  last month in Pakistan and last week in Britain continues  to yield new details about who carried out the reconnaissance  operations at the five financial institutions in 2000 and  2001, the official said. Authorities now believe that one  of the men who conducted the surveillance at the New York  Stock Exchange was Adnan G. el-Shukrijumah, who was born  in Saudi Arabia, has relatives in Florida and on May 26  was the subject of an FBI bulletin seeking information about  seven men with suspected ties to terrorists.

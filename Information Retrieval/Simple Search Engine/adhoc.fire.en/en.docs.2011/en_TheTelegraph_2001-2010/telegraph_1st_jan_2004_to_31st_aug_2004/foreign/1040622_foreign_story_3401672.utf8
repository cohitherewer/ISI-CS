 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 US court reins in patient rights
																								Washington, June 21 (Reuters): The US Supreme Court ruled today that patients cannot sue their health maintenance organisations (HMOs) under state law for refusing to pay for doctor-recommended care, a decision that could affect millions of patients.																								The justices unanimously ruled that a 1974 federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, completely pre-empted such lawsuits brought in state court by patients who seek damages over the denial of appropriate medical care.																								The decision was a victory for the US justice department and insurers, which warned that allowing the lawsuits would drive up health care costs. Millions of Americans have medical insurance through employer-provided HMO health plans governed by the 1974 federal law. The HMO is a group insurance scheme that entitles members to services of participating hospitals, clinics and physcians.																								At issue was a 1997 Texas law that allowed patients to sue HMOs over their medical treatment. Nine other states have similar laws. The state laws have become important as Congress has been unable in recent years to adopt national legislation that would allow patients to sue their HMO in federal court.

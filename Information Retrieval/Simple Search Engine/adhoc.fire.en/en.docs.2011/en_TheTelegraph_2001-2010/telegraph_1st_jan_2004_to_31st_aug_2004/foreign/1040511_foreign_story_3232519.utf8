 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Inmates protest
																								Abu Ghraib (Iraq), May 10 (Reuters): Inmates at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad staged an angry demonstration against their detention today, disrupting a US public relations exercise to repair damage done by a prisoner abuse scandal.																								Colonel David Quantock, commander of the 16th Military Police Brigade, struggled to keep the attention of reporters on a guided tour of the jail as more than 100 prisoners challenged his assertion that ties with US prison guards were good.																								We have a very good relationship with our detainees, we work that very hard, Quantock told reporters on a bus, as one of many dishevelled inmates behind a tall razor wire fence revealed a T-shirt reading: Prisoners cannot talk freely.																								What are you going to do about this scandal? read a banner unfurled by other detainees, standing at the edge of one of the prisons open-air pens where up to 500 prisoners sleep in dirty khaki-coloured tents on the floor.They are given blankets for warmth, Quantock said. They also have concrete bunkers where they can seek shelter when guerrillas attack the jail.

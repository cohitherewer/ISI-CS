 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Israel visit puzzle in Islamabad
 Jerusalem, Jan. 20 (PTI):  An Israeli cabinet minister today said he has been invited  to visit Pakistan, with which Tel Aviv does not have diplomatic  relations, in March as part of a UN delegation.																								I ascribe great importance to the coming visit, agriculture minister Yisrael Katz told Israel Radio. He said he has accepted an invitation to visit Pakistan in March with a group of officials from UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).																								However, AFP quoted Pakistan foreign ministry official Masood Khan as saying in Islamabad that his government has not invited the Israeli agriculture minister.																								Katz linked the invitation extended through FAOs director Jacques Alouf, to recent public statements moderating Pakistans long-standing hostility toward Israel.

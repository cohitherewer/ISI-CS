 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Booker prize goes global
London, June 2 (Reuters): The annual Man Booker Prize for fiction is going global with the addition of a prize every two years for any work of fiction available in English.																								Unlike the annual award, the new 60,000 international prize, announced today, is open to authors of any nationality writing either originally in English or widely available translated into English.																								The first winner will be announced in 2005. An author may only win once. 																								The Booker Prize, launched in 1969 and renamed the Man Booker Prize in 2002 after its new sponsor, is only available to writers from the Republic of Ireland or the 54-nation Commonwealth group of mostly former British colonies.																								Winners of the annual prize not only receive 50,000 but also mostly see sales of their works boosted into the bestseller lists internationally.																								Writer D.B.C Pierre won the 2003 Booker prize for his debut novel Vernon God Little and promptly gave the 50,000 prize to his creditors.

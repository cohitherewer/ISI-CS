 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 New PM puts peace talks ball in Chandrika court
				 	 Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse with his wife and three sons at the swearing-in ceremony in Colombo on Tuesday. (Reuters)																								Colombo, April 6 (Reuters): Sri Lankas new Prime Minister was sworn into office today and said hardline President Chandrika Kumaratunga was now in charge of reviving peace talks with Tamil rebels.																								They (talks) should start as soon as possible, new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse told reporters as he left his house for the swearing-in ceremony. We need peace.																								He said Kumaratunga would be in charge of the peace process once the new government takes over after proving its majority in parliament, which is due to convene on April 22.																								Direct talks with the Tamil Tigers, fighting for two decades for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the island, broke down last April, although a two-year-old truce has held.																								The President will handle the peace process, Rajapakse said after 10 Buddhist monks blessed him in an early-morning ceremony.																								But uncertainty surrounding the new government hit the markets, with the key Colombo all-share index plunging 9.5 per cent.																								Rajapakse also said India, which intervened in Sri Lankas rebellion in the 1980s before withdrawing after heavy troop losses, should take a larger role in trying to bring a permanent end to the war that has killed 64,000 people. India must come in as soon as possible, he said, adding that did not mean the role of Norway, which brokered the ceasefire, would be reduced.																								Rajapakse was greeted by warm applause from party leaders when he entered the colonial-era Presidential Secretariat building to be sworn in as the countrys 13th Prime Minister.																								There was a light moment when Rajapakses eyeglasses caught in the end of his trademark red scarf and it took him a minute to untangle them.																								He said his first job would be to secure a majority in parliament.																								The first priority is that. We are very confident of getting a majority. I do not want to give names right now, he said of possible coalition partners.																								Rajapakse, 58, will lead a government that is eight seats short of a majority in parliament, after his United Peoples Freedom Alliance won 105 seats in the 225-seat parliament in last Fridays general election.																								The Ceylon Workers Congress, which represents Indian-origin Tamils in the islands tea plantations, has the eight seats the Freedom Alliance needs and is widely expected to do a deal, but the party said on Tuesday it was for now remaining neutral.																								We have not knocked on anybodys door, nor have we been approached officially, party leader Arumugan Thondaman told a news conference. But he added: All options are open.																								Under Sri Lankas executive presidency system, Rajapakse is likely to play second fiddle to Kumaratunga, who is expected to name herself defence minister and possibly finance minister when the cabinet is announced in the next three or four days.																								Kumaratunga called the snap election nearly four years early after a political fight escalated with outgoing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, her arch-rival. Kumaratunga, who is elected separately, accused him of giving away too much to try to win peace with the rebels.

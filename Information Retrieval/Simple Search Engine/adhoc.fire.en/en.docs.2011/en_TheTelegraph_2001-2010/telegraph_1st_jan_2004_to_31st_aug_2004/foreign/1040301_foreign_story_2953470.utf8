 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Tanker with ethanol explodes off Virginia
Washington, Feb. 29 (Reuters): The US Coast Guard searched frigid waters off the Virginia coast today for 18 crew after a chemical tanker carrying 11,000 tonnes of industrial ethanol exploded, killing at least three persons.																								Coast Guard Lt Buddy Dye said three crew died and six others were saved after the tanker sank last evening 80 km from the Virginia shore. He said helicopters, a C-130 plane and lifeboats would continue the search for survivors.																								Were being hampered by the dark and of course the chemicals in the water, but the sea conditions are not too bad, he said.																								The crew of the Bow Mariner, a 170-metre, 39,000 tonne Singapore-flagged vessel sailing from New York to Houston. Dye said the explosion occurred around 2300 GMT, east from Chincoteague in eastern Virginia, which is roughly 125 km north of Norfolk, a major naval base. He said the blast had almost obliterated the tanker.																								The ships owner, Norways Odfjell Seachem, said today the 27-member crew included 24 Filipinos and three Greeks.																								Jan Hammer, Odfjell senior vice-president in Oslo, Norway, said today there was not much hope of finding more survivors after the accident because of the cold water.																								Hammer said it was too early to say what caused the accident but that there had been reports of a fire on the front deck of the ship just before the explosion. He said the crew sent a call for help to the US Coast Guard before the ship sank. We dont want to speculate about the reason for the explosion. We are not sure yet, he said. It was clearly a big explosion. It takes a lot to sink such a big ship.																								Industrial ethanol is a form of fuel and gasoline additive sometimes used as a solvent in the manufacture of varnishes and perfumes.

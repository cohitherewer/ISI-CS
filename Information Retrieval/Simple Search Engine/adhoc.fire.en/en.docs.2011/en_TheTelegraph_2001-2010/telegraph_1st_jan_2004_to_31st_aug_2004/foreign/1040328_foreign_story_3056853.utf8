The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 Ex-minister shot dead ahead of Lanka polls
Colombo, March 27 (Reuters): Two people, including a former cabinet minister, were shot today as violence flared ahead of Sri Lankas general election next week, police said.																								The election, fought over how to pursue peace with the islands separatist Tamil Tiger rebels, had been relatively peaceful until now but could turn more violent in the run-up to the April 2 vote.																								Thiyagarajah Maheswaran, the Hindu affairs minister in the outgoing government, was seriously wounded when he was shot while campaigning in downtown Colombo tonight, police said. The returning officer for Batticaloa on the east coast, Ratnam Monagurusamy, was shot about two hours earlier in a separate incident.																								He is in serious condition and was flown to Colombo for treatment. Hes still alive, said Gamini Nawaratne, deputy inspector of police. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks and it is not known if they are linked. This is awful. It was relatively peaceful until now. I fear that things may get out of hand, said Kingsley Rodrigo, executive director of Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections.

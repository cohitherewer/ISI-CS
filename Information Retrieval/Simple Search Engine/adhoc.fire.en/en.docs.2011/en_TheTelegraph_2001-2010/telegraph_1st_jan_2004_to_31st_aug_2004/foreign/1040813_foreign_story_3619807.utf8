 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 War slur begins to stick on Kerry
 DAVID RENNIE				 	 John Kerry: Unfit for dutyWashington, Aug. 12: For the first time, Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential challenger, has been left floundering by allegations that he invented a key episode of his decorated wartime service in Vietnam  a central plank of his election platform.																								Kerry has fought off charges for several years that he did not deserve all the medals he won in Vietnam, which included a Bronze Star and Silver Star for gallantry, and three Purple Hearts for combat wounds.																								Crewmates from the small patrol boats in which he served in the Mekong Delta have always rallied to his support, contradicting allegations from other, hostile veterans.																								Yesterday, however, the Kerry campaign was left in verbal knots after a new book accused the senator of inventing stories about being sent, illegally, over the border into neutral Cambodia.																								The Kerry campaign responded, initially, that Kerry had always said he was near Cambodia.																								Then a campaign aide said Kerry had been in the Mekong Delta between Vietnam and next-door Cambodia  a geographical zone not found on maps, which show the Mekong river running from Cambodia to Vietnam.																								The book, Unfit for Command, is based on recollections from dozens of veterans who served in the same naval unit as Kerry, including crewmen on small patrol craft under his direct command.																								In newspaper articles, interviews and at least one Senate speech, Kerry has claimed that he spent Christmas 1968 inside Cambodia, at a time when even the US President was publicly denying that American forces were inside that country.																								He has cited the missions as a psychological turning point, when he realised that American leaders were not telling the truth to the world about the war in southeast Asia.																								Michael Meehan, a Kerry campaign adviser, told ABC Television: The Mekong Delta consists of the border between Cambodia and Vietnam, so on Christmas Eve in 1968, he was in fact on patrol ... in the Mekong Delta between Cambodia and Vietnam. He was ambushed, they fired back, he was fired upon from both sides, from the Cambodian side of the border and the Vietnam side during that day in 1968.																								It remains to be seen how serious an impact the row has on the Kerry campaign.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Iraq minister escapes Zarqawi group attack
				 	 A car burns after the attack on the convoy of Iraq justice minister Malek Dohan al-Hassan in Baghdad. (AFP)																								Baghdad, July 17 (Reuters): A suicide car bomber drove into a convoy carrying Iraqs justice minister today, killing five bodyguards but leaving him unscathed, in an attack claimed by a group led by al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.																								A statement posted on an Islamist website said the attack was carried out by the military wing of Zarqawis Tawhid and Jihad group, blamed by Washington for a series of deadly suicide bombings in Iraq and for executing at least three hostages.																								Witnesses said the attacker drove towards the convoy close to the home of justice minister Malik al-Hassan and detonated his car bomb in a ball of flame.																								There was a blast alongside the convoy. A booby-trapped car came alongside and blew up, said traffic policeman Hussein Abed. The health ministry said five bodyguards were killed.																								Five gutted cars were littered across the road, and Iraqis collected human remains scattered among the wreckage. 																								What I want to highlight is that this is clearly a terrorist attack by people who do not want to see this country move forward, US Colonel Michael Formica of the 1st Cavalry Division said at the scene.																								Abdul Nasser Mohammed, one of the surviving bodyguards, pointed at one of the cars destroyed in the blast and said: Two people were killed in this car and all we found was body parts. Hospital officials said at least eight people were wounded.																								We were working as painters near the ministry house when suddenly there was an explosion, one of the injured, Khalid Waleed, said from his hospital bed. 																								The glass shattered everywhere, hitting us.																								In another suicide attack, a car bomber killed an Iraqi National Guard soldier and wounded several Iraqis in an attack on the Guard headquarters in Mahmudiya, just south of the capital. 																								The US army said the bomber was stopped at a checkpoint near the headquarters and then detonated his vehicle. North of Baghdad, a roadside bomb in the town of Baiji killed a US soldier and wounded another. The death brought to 655 the number of American troops killed in action in Iraq.																								Insurgents have repeatedly targeted top officials. Earlier this week a regional governor was killed when his convoy was ambushed. In May, a suicide car bomb attack killed Izzedin Salim. 																								Zarqawis group claimed responsibility for those attacks. The group has also beheaded an American and a South Korean hostage, and says it has killed one of two Bulgarians kidnapped earlier this month.

 BECKY BARROW London, Jan. 2: One in four bosses admits that a woman who wears make-up to an interview is more likely to get the job than one who does not, a survey claimed.																								It found that many employers take the view that a woman who does not wear make-up looks as if she cannot be bothered to make an effort and conveys a less professional approach.																								The survey, by the Aziz Corporation, a communications company which interviewed 100 senior directors, found that female bosses are more ruthless than males. 																								More than 60 per cent of female directors admitted being prejudiced against women in business who do not wear make-up, compared with 52 per cent of male directors. 																								The companys chairman Khalid Aziz says his female clients are usually hugely keen to get their personal appearance right. Most get their hair done at least twice a week, and many believe you can never be too thin.																								Make-up artist Bobbi Brown devotes a whole chapter in her book, Beauty, to The Getting Ahead Face which is full of forthright instruction for the aspiring job candidate. 																								Adopting a military tone, she says: The objective of the interview make-up is to look pleasant and in control.																								Lip pencil, good eye definition and even red nails are all permitted for those adopting the power suit approach. 																								A strong mouth is a mistake, and people should concentrate on their eye make-up as eye contact is such a vital part of an interview. 																								You cant go wrong with brown eyeliner and a couple of coats of black mascara, she says.																								The make-up chosen by some women is almost as famous as their successful careers. 																								In 2001, the battle between Unilever and Merrill Lynch Investment Management placed the spotlight on Carol Galley of Merrill Lynch, whose catwalk-style grooming outshone her high court rival, Wendy Mayall, chief investment officer at Unilevers pension fund. (However, it was the latter who finally walked away the winner in the battle) 																								Disbelief is regularly expressed about the few that do not subscribe to the made-up route to success. 																								Recently, the actress Helena Bonham Carter said of herself and boyfriend Tim Burton: We dont believe in combs.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

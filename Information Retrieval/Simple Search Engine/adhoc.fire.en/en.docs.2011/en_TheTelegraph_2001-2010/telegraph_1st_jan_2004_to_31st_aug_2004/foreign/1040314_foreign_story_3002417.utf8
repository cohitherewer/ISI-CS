 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Seoul vigil to protest impeachment
																								Seoul, March 13 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of South Koreans held a candle-lit rally in the capital today to protest against the impeachment of President Roh Moo-hyun, hours after the acting leader appealed for calm.																								Prime Minister Goh Kun urged military forces facing the communist North to be more vigilant after parliament sparked an unprecedented crisis by impeaching Roh yesterday. In a demonstration of the unpopularity of that vote, police said some 50,000 people gathered in a protest rally in the heart of Seoul.																								This should not be happening to our country. I am so embarrassed and outraged, said 55-year-old housewife Cho Hyun-ok at the rally, sobbing.																								Some in the crowd were members of Rohs Internet-based fan club Nosamo, or Roh lovers group. All wanted to show their dismay at yesterdays political upheaval, when the opposition-controlled parliament sent the country into uncharted territory by voting to impeach Roh for breaking election laws.																								A poll conducted by Yonhap News Agency yesterday showed nearly 75 per cent of 1,018 South Koreans surveyed believed impeaching the President was wrong.

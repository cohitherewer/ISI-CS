 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 If elected, Kerry will offer Iran nuke deal
																								Washington, Aug. 30 (Reuters): If elected US President, Senator John Kerry would offer Iran a deal allowing it to keep its nuclear power plants if it gave up the right to retain bomb-making nuclear fuel, said Kerrys vice-presidential running mate in an interview published today.																								Senator John Edwards told The Washington Post if Iran did not accept this great bargain, this would confirm the Islamic state was building nuclear weapons under cover of a nuclear power initiative.																								If Iran rejected this proposal, Kerry would ensure European allies were prepared to join the US in imposing strict sanctions against Iran, said Edwards. 																								If we are engaging with Iranians in an effort to reach this great bargain and if in fact this is a bluff that they are trying to develop nuclear weapons capability, then we know that our European friends will stand with us, said the North Carolina Democrat.																								At the end of the day, we have to have some serious negotiating leverage in this discussion with the Iranians, he added in the interview with the Post. 																								Such an offer to Iran would signal a shift in US diplomatic relations with Iran, which were severed after the 1979 revolution. 																								US President George W. Bush included Iran in his axis of evil along with Korea and Iraq.

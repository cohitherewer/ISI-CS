 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Washington sniper gets death
				 	 John Muhammad																								Manassas (Virginia), March 9 (Reuters): A judge sentenced John Muhammad to death today for one of 10 sniper-style murders that terrorised the Washington area in 2002.																								As expected, Judge LeRoy Millette confirmed last Novembers guilty verdict and death sentence by a jury and brushed aside Muhammads appeal, which had argued his conviction was based on guesswork and emotion, rather than facts and law. Millette set October 14 as Muhammads execution date.																								The former Gulf war veteran was sentenced by a Virginia Beach jury for killing Dean Meyers, a 53-year-old Maryland man who was shot as he refuelled his car in Manassas, Virginia. The trial had been moved to Virginia Beach, some 320 km away, to avoid a prejudiced jury.																								Muhammad accomplice Lee Malvo, who was 17 at the time of the killings, faces his hearing tomorrow, when a judge will have to decide whether to confirm his sentence of life in prison. Malvo had faced a possible death sentence but the jury recommended life in prison.

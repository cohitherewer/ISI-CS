 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Ebadi backs reformists, not to vote
				 	 Shirin Ebadi: Tough stand																								Tehran, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Nobel peace prize winner Shirin Ebadi said today she would not vote in Irans parliamentary election this week because of the mass disqualification of reformist candidates.																								I will not vote myself because I dont know those who have been qualified. Im not ready to vote for someone I dont know, the human rights lawyer said in an interview. Her comment was a blow to efforts by the countrys Islamic authorities to mobilise a big turnout on Friday despite widespread public apathy and anger among reformists at the virtually blanket ban on their contenders.																								The first principle of democracy is that people should have the right to vote for anyone they want, she said. The exclusion of some 2,500 contenders by an unelected Guardian Council of hardline Muslim clerics had damaged peoples freedom to vote, Ebadi said.																								Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for a massive turnout in a public sermon last Friday, saying it would give the enemies of the Islamic republic a slap in the face.																								President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate reformist, appealed to Iranians yesterday to cast their ballots despite some unfairness to prevent a hardline minority from seizing control of the countrys fate.																								His own brother, Mohammad Reza, is among some 80 sitting lawmakers who were barred from seeking re-election and heads the main reformist party, the Islamic Iran Participation Front, which has said it will boycott the poll.																								Ebadi said she would travel to Italy tomorrow and then to Brussels to meet European Union officials and human rights organisations, but she made clear her decision not to vote was a political gesture. 																								Asked if it was her personal protest, she said: Yes. I wish that anyone who wanted to run for office was approved to compete. Ebadi said the outgoing reformist-dominated parliament had made little progress on improving human rights because the 12-member Guardian Council, half of whose members are hand-picked by Khamenei, had vetoed key legislation.																								For example, parliament had voted to approve a global convention outlawing discrimination against women but the council had blocked it. Khatamis power to effect change was limited by the constitution, she said.																								Ebadi suggested the constitution, which enshrines the power of the clerical establishment over democratic institutions, would have to be amended before serious progress on human rights was possible.																								People want them to eliminate discrimination based on sex, people want more freedom of speech, people want more democracy, people want more respect for human rights, she said.

 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Luck rides with Red Briton
				 	 Ashley Revell (Reuters) 																								Las Vegas, April 12 (Reuters): A British man who sold all his possessions, including his clothes, stood in a rented tuxedo yesterday surrounded by family and friends and bet everything on a single spin of the roulette wheel.																								He wont go home empty handed.																								Ashley Revell, a 32-year-old Londoner, sold all his possessions in March, took $135,300 to the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, did some low stakes gambling and then placed everything he had left on Red. The wheel was spun, a crowd of supporters including his parents from London went wild, the ball bobbled over the slots and landed on Red 7  and Revell walked away with $270,600.																								It all happened so quickly, it was spinning before I knew it, Revell said, adding he did not intend to try to double it. 																								He plans to party  and buy some clothes.

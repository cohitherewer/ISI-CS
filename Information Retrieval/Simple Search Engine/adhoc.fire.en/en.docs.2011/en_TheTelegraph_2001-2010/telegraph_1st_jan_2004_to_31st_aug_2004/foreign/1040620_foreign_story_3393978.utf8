 RICHARD SAVILL				 	 Madonna																								London, June 19: Madonna has won a partial victory in her battle to prevent ramblers from walking across large areas of her 9 million estate in Wiltshire.																								Her land agent said he was very pleased with a planning inspectors ruling that the public should not be given access to a sizeable portion of land on the singers 1,132-acre Ashcombe Estate, near the village of Tollard Royal. Madonna and Guy Ritchie, her film director husband, objected at a public inquiry last month to the opening up of 350 acres of their estate under right to roam legislation.																								They argued not only that the land was unsuitable as open country but also that free access would violate private and family life and their home under the European Convention on Human Rights.																								In his report published yesterday, David Pinner, the inspector, agreed to the opening up of 130 acres. However, he said none of that land was within sight of Madonnas home, the Grade II-listed Georgian Ashcombe House, which is the former home of Cecil Beaton, the society photographer. He did not, therefore, have to consider the issue of human rights.																								Philip Eddell, Madonnas land agent, had argued at the inquiry that, if all the land was opened up, it would make it impossible for the shoot to operate safely.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

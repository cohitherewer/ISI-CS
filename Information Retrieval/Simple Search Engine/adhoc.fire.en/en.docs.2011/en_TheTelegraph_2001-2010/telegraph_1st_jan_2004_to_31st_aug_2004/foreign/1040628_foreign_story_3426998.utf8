The countrys national newspapers ran front-page stories on Friday speculating on the identity of the mystery dog. Police say a Canadian man, whose car was packed with 6,000 rounds of ammunition, planned to kill as many people as possible in a Toronto neighborhood on Wednesday. But he changed his mind at the last minute, and later gave himself up to police after a friendly dog came up to play with him in a park and melted his heart.																																	The betting is on Elvis Presley, a black border collie. Elvis and his owner were in the east-end park at the right time and reports that he was carrying a frisbee in his mouth fits his description.																																	Dante, a part husky, part Australian shepherd, was also seen in the park late Wednesday, playing with a man.																						Im not claiming its him, his owner, Kristina Kyser, told the Globe and Mail, but noted Dante did have the power to change a persons mind. Hes so sweet-natured, Kyser said. That kind of sweetness does have lasting effects.

The 12-month-old baby, who had been playing in the backyard, was rushed to a hospital only after his parents noticed fang marks on the diaper and swelling on his bottom while giving him a bath in the evening. He had been bitten by a venomous snake, Dr Kobi Assaf of Jerusalems Hadassah hospital told Israel Radio. Luckily, the snake injected its venom into the diaper on coming into contact with it and most of the poison did not penetrate the skin.

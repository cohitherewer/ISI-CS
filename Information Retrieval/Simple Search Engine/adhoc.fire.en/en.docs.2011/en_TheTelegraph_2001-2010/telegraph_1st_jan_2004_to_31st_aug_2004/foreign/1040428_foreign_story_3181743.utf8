 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 UN food plea for Korea survivors
																								Seoul/Beijing, April 27 (Reuters): The UN made an urgent appeal today for 1,000 tonnes of food to feed survivors of North Koreas deadly train explosion as Russia flew in emergency relief and South Korea prepared to send aid.																								World Food Programme (WFP) officials said they had had to dip into stocks used to feed millions of hungry North Koreans in order to help survivors of last Thursdays blast that killed at least 161 people and injured 1,300. We intend to launch a flash appeal today for emergency food aid for North Korea, for the victims of the blast. We will ask for a total of about 1,000 tonnes, Tony Banbury, WFPs regional director for Asia, said in Beijing.A second WFP official stressed that more than a quarter of the 23 million people of North Korea remained dependent on food aid years after the isolated communist state was hit by famine. While we are all focusing on this accident, we should not forget the larger context, said Masood Hyder, UN coordinator in North Korea.

				 	 Drew Barrymore plays cupid during MTVs Valentines Day show in New York. (Reuters)																								Washington, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Love may indeed be blind, whether it is love for a newborn or its father, British researchers reported yesterday.																								Scanners showed the brains of young mothers lit up in the same way when they looked at their babies as the brains of people who looked at images of their lovers. And the region activated told an important story, too. It was an area known as the reward system. 																								Parts of the brain also turned off when looking at a lover, spouse or child  and that was the system involved in making negative judgments, the team at University College London said.																								Writing in the journal NeuroImage, they said their finding suggests that to some degree, love really is blind to faults.																								Both romantic and maternal love are highly rewarding experiences that are linked to the perpetuation of the species, and consequently have a closely linked biological function of crucial evolutionary importance, said Andreas Bartels of UCLs Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience.																								His team scanned the brains of 20 young mothers using functional magnetic resonance imaging, which can show brain activity as it happens. 																								The young women were shown pictures of their own children, children they knew and adult friends, to make sure that feelings of familiarity and friendship were not interfering. There was a special pattern when the mothers saw their babies, and much of it overlapped with the pattern seen when people look at their lovers. Manila kiss fest																								The Philippines said today it sealed a world record with a kiss after 5,122 couples lined up in Manila to smooch for at least 10 seconds to celebrate Valentines Day.

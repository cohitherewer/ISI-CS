				 	 Tom Cruise Los Angeles, April 13 (AFP):  Tom Cruise helped raise $1.2 million to treat emergency  workers exposed to toxic materials following the September  11 terror strikes in New York, organisers have said.

The actor, who is a keen member of the Church of Scientology, backed the drive to provide a detox regimen designed by church founder Ron Hubbard and outlined in his book Clear Body Clear Mind.																								The regimen consists of exercise, sauna sweat-out, vitamins and minerals to help rescue workers cleanse their bodies of toxic residues and has helped about 200 emergency workers, according to Los Angeles-based Bridge Publications that releases Hubbards non-fiction works.

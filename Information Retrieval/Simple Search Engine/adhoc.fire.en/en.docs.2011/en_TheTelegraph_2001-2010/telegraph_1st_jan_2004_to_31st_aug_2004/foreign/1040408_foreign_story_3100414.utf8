 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 HK vows to raise voice for freedom
																								Hong Kong, April 7 (Reuters): Thousands of Hong Kong democracy activists are expected to protest this Sunday after Beijing said it alone will decide when, or if, elections will be held in the city.																								We expect some 10,000 people when we march to Beijings representative office. We want the government to begin public consultations on democratic reforms at once, said a spokeswoman of the Civil Human Rights Front.																								The group organised a huge anti-government protest last July which shocked the Chinese leadership and triggered a campaign by Beijing to discredit the citys pro-democracy figures. Chinas move wont silence calls for democracy. On the contrary, itll trigger more demand, said Sonny Lo, a politics professor at the University of Hong Kong.																								Those against the interpretation will likely have more violent confrontations with police, Lo said, referring to a string of anti-Beijing protests in the past week.

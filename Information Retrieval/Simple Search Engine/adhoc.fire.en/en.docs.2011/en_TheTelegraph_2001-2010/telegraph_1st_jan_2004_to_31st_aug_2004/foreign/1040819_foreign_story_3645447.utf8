 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Synthetic malaria drug offers hope
																								London, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Scientists have created a synthetic drug which could offer new hope in the fight against malaria.																								Scientists have long been interested in Artemisinin, a Chinese herbal fever remedy that comes from the bark of the sweet wormwood tree and has been shown to help kill malaria parasites.																								But the naturally occurring drug is expensive to make. An international team of scientists said in research published in Nature they had developed a synthetic drug, OZ277, designed to offer the benefits of Artemisinin that could be cheaper to produce and more potent.																								It will require tests before OZ277 can become a commercial drug.

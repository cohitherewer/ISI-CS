 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Japan, Pak to fight terror, nuke arms spread
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Aug. 11: Pakistan and Japan today vowed to continue cooperation in combating international terrorism and checking nuclear proliferation.																								We are satisfied with the present level of cooperation with Pakistan in the ongoing war against terror and the international efforts to check nuclear non-proliferation, Japanese foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi told a joint press conference with her Pakistani counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri.																								Kawaguchis itinerary in Islamabad included meetings with Pervez Musharraf and interim Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein, which focused on issues like war against terror, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Kawaguchi hoped the two countries will continue cooperation in checking nuclear proliferation. 																								Being the victim of a nuclear holocaust, Japan has been asking various countries including Pakistan and India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), she said.																								Acknowledging Pakistans efforts to curb nuclear proliferation, Kawaguchi said Japan would consider resumption of economic assistance to Pakistan by suspending a decision taken in 1998.																								Japan withheld a loan package for Pakistan under the Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) after the May 1998 nuclear detonations.																								Under the ODA charter, countries possessing or working on nuclear technology or engaged in testing missiles of a range of over 180 km are not entitled for any Japanese overseas assistance. Kawaguchi appreciated Pakistans role in combating international terrorism and called for a long term strategy to eradicate the menace posing serious threats to the entire world.																								After September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Japan sanctioned three hundred million dollars economic assistance to Pakistan besides																								rescheduling of loan of over four billion dollars recently in recognition of its role as a front-line state in the U.S.-led war on terror.																								Speaking on the occasion, Foreign Minister Kasuri said Pakistans nuclear programe was defence-oriented and ruled out any compromise in this vital field.He said Pakistan had genuine security concerns, which it had been sharing with Japan at forum of joint working group, which deals with nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and strategic issues.

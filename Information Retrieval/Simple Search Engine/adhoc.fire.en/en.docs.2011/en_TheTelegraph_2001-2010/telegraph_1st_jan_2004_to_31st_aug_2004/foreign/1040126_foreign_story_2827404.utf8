 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Thai troops battle chicken
																								Bangkok, Jan. 25 (Reuters): Thailand brought in troops and prisoners today to kill millions of chickens in the hope of stopping the spread of highly contagious bird flu, which has jumped to humans in Vietnam and Thailand.																								With ordinary people too scared to go anywhere near chickens, 400 soldiers were drafted into Suphan Buri province northwest of Bangkok, deputy agriculture minister Newin Chidchop said. A hundred prisoners were also brought in. We have had labour problems. It is difficult to find labourers as after the bird flu outbreak was confirmed, many of them are avoiding working on farms, Newin said.																								All chickens in the province, a major area of production in a Thai industry which raises one billion chickens a year and earns $1.5 billion in exports, will be killed. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra went to talk to worried farmers in the province today, promising them compensation, help with starting up again once the epidemic was defeated and a suspension of their debts.																								China became the latest country to ban imports of Thai chicken to try to stop the deadly disease spreading to the country where the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which scared the world, broke out last year. Beijing, widely accused of covering up that outbreak for weeks, ordered aircraft, ships or other vehicles carrying Thai chicken be sealed and cleaned.																								The Thai government, fighting off allegations it covered up an outbreak of bird flu which the WHO fears could generate an epidemic worse than Sars, is promising swift and ruthless action. 																								But experts are wondering where it will emerge next after springing up in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Cambodia and Vietnam.																								Indonesia also confirmed an outbreak of avian influenza among chickens but a senior agriculture ministry official today said there is no evidence so far that the disease has spread to humans. 																								Indonesia had previously insisted it was free of the flu and blamed the deaths of thousands of chickens on parts of East Java and the tourist centre of Bali in the past three months on Newcastle disease, a virus that is harmless to humans and does not affect the safety of poultry meat.

 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 General let the dogs out, says colonel
 R. JEFFREY SMITH				 	 A US soldier tries to restrain a dog from a frightened Iraqi detainee at Abu Ghraib prison. (AFP)Washington, May 26: A US army general dispatched by senior Pentagon officials to bolster the collection of intelligence from prisoners in Iraq last autumn inspired and promoted the use of guard dogs there to frighten the Iraqis, according to sworn testimony by the top US intelligence officer at the Abu Ghraib prison.																								According to the officer, Colonel Thomas Pappas, the idea came from Major General Geoffrey D. Miller, who at the time commanded the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and was implemented under a policy approved by Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez, the top US military official in Iraq.																								It was a technique I had personally discussed with General Miller, when he was here visiting the prison, testified Pappas, head of the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade and the officer placed in charge of the cellblocks at Abu Ghraib prison where abuses occurred in the wake of Millers visit to Baghdad between August 30 and September 9, 2003.																								He said that they used military working dogs at Gitmo [the nickname for Guantanamo Bay], and that they were effective in setting the atmosphere for which, you know, you could get information from the prisoners, Pappas told the army investigator, Major General Antonio M. Taguba, according to a transcript provided to The Washington Post.																								Pappas, who was under pressure from Taguba to justify the legality and appropriateness of using guard dogs to frighten detainees, said at two separate points in the February 9 interview that Miller gave him the idea. He also said Miller had indicated the use of the dogs with or without a muzzle was okay in booths where prisoners were taken for interrogation.																								But Miller, whom the Bush administration appointed as the new head of Abu Ghraib this month, denied through a spokesman that the conversation took place. 																								Miller never had a conversation with Colonel Pappas regarding the use of military dogs for interrogation purposes in Iraq. Further, military dogs were never used in interrogations at Guantanamo, said Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt.																								Pappas statements nonetheless provide the fullest public account to date of how he viewed the interrogation mission at Abu Ghraib and Millers impact on operations there.

 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Probe finally reaches Saturn after seven years
																								Pasadena (California), July 1 (Reuters): Hours after it completed a journey of nearly seven years to Saturn, the spacecraft Cassini sent its first pictures back to Earth today, showing sharp edges and ripples of energy in the planets enormous rings.																								The early photos, taken from the unilluminated side of the rings, were full of electronic noise and only in black and white, but were still clear enough to show fine ring structures and edges sharper than might be expected, given all the particles in the rings colliding with each other.																								Ring scientists love sharp edges. Theyre very mysterious  they have to be held sharp by some mechanism, said Carolyn Porco, leader of the Cassini imaging science team. Scientists were thrilled with the quantity and clarity of the images  the closest pictures of the rings that will be taken during the mission. These images are more or less serendipity, Porco said.																								The images also showed density waves, disruptions in the particles in the rings caused by the energy of moonlets passing outside them, that scientists said could best be compared to the pattern of bunching and thinning out seen in traffic jams.																								Scientists from Nasa and other international agencies cheered and called the photos beautiful and mind-blowing. Its so flawless it almost seems faked  but its not, Porco said in live commentary from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here.																								The truck-sized probe slipped through those rings and entered orbit around Saturn last night, after traveling 3.5 billion km since its October 1997 launch. Along the way, it used the gravity of Venus, Earth and Jupiter to slingshot it out to the sixth planet from the sun.																								Cassini is set to spend at least four years studying the planet, its rings and some of its 31 known moons. Much of that time will be dedicated to Titan, one of the solar systems largest and most intriguing moons, with an atmosphere and composition that have inspired science fiction dreams of an emerging home for life.																								It carries on its back a smaller craft, Huygens, which is designed to break away in December and plummet onto the surface of Titan for a brief study of that moons atmosphere.																								That portion of the mission was designed largely by the European and Italian space agencies.

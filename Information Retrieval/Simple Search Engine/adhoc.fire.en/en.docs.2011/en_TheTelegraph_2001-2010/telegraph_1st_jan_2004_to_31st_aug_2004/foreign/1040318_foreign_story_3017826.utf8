The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Spain PM-elect snubs Bush 
																								Madrid, March 17 (Reuters): Spains next Prime Minister spurned the US Presidents appeal for unity today and branded the Iraq occupation a fiasco as a probe into the Madrid bombings that killed 201 people entered a decisive phase.																								Socialist Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who ousted Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in a shock election victory at the weekend, stood his ground on withdrawing Spanish troops from Iraq despite a plea from US President George W. Bush.																								I will listen to Mr Bush but my position is very clear and very firm, Zapatero told Spains Onda Cero radio. The occupation is a fiasco.																								Bush urged Spain and other allies in Iraq yesterday not to cave in to pressure from the Muslim militant al Qaida group by withdrawing their troops.																								Spanish police focused on a Moroccan link in their investigation into last weeks bombings of four trains in Madrid  western Europes worst guerrilla attack  in which 201 people were killed and 1,750 injured.																								Interior minister Angel Acebes, a member of the outgoing government, gave few fresh details about the inquiry, citing a judges gagging order, but said: It is a decisive phase.																								International connections were one area police were working on, Acebes said. As Spain stepped up security at airports and strategic installations around the country, Zapatero pledged a sweeping security shakeup and to stamp on any violent group, including Basque separatist guerrillas ETA.																								I am planning... to finish off terrorism, he said.																								But Zapatero, who takes office next month, ignored Bushs plea, reiterating his election campaign pledge to withdraw Spains 1,300 troops from Iraq if the UN did not take charge there by mid-year. The comments have raised concern among some US allies who are unclear exactly what UN role he wants to see in Iraq. In Madrid, thousands of Aznar supporters protested, accusing the Socialists of exploiting the bombings to win votes.																								Aznars Popular party drew anger ahead of the ballot for hastily blaming ETA. Then as suspicions of al Qaida involvement grew, the party suffered from perceptions it bore responsibility for sending troops to Iraq despite huge public opposition.																								Spanish police arrested five people after the blasts on Thursday, including three Moroccans. Police are hunting for some 20 Moroccans, who may also be linked to last Mays Casablanca attack in which 45 people died.																								El Pais newspaper said police believed the Madrid attacks were carried out by people linked to the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group, which it said is financed by al Qaida. Police said Morocco has given Madrid a list of suspects believed linked to the Casablanca bombings.

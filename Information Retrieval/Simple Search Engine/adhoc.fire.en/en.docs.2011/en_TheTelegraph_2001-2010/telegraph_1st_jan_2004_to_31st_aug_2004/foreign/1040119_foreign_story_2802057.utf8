The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 UK media baron out, Barclays step in
				 	 Conrad Black 																								London/New York, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Billionaire tycoons David and Frederick Barclay said today they agreed to buy media mogul Conrad Blacks controlling stake in publisher Hollinger International Inc, just hours after the company sued him and removed him as chairman.																								The brothers said they would launch a $326.5-million offer to buy Toronto-based Hollinger Inc which controls about three-quarters of the voting stock of Hollinger International, owner of Londons Daily and Sunday Telegraph and the Chicago Sun-Times newspapers. 																								The bid would also take on about $140 million in debt. Hollinger International, which also owns the Jerusalem Post newspaper, said in a brief statement that the company and its board intend to review the offer for Hollinger Inc and its implications for Hollinger International.																								The deal faces steep legal hurdles for embattled press baron Black, who stepped down as Hollinger International chief executive last year after $32 million in unauthorised payments were discovered. He was fired as chairman yesterday.																								Black, who was due to submit $850,000 to Hollinger International today under an agreement over the unauthorised payments, was not available for comment. Black owns 78 per cent of Hollinger Inc. through his privately held company Ravelston, a stake he has agreed to sell to the secretive Barclays, who operate from the tiny island of Brechou, which they own, off the northwest coast of France.																								Their business empire spans a wide range of interests including Londons luxury Ritz Hotel and Littlewoods, Britains second-biggest mail-order business and high street store chain.																								The US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit Friday attempting to block Black from selling his stake.

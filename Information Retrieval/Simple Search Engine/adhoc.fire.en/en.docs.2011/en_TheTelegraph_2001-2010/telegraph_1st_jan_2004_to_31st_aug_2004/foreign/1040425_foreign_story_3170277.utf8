 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Arafat defiant after Sharon threat
																								Ramallah (West Bank), April 24 (Reuters): Palestinian President Yasser Arafat responded defiantly today to new threats against his life by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, telling a crowd of supporters he would embrace martyrdom.																								All of us are martyrs-in-the-waiting, Arafat said in the compound of his Muqata headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, where some 4,000 people chanted they would sacrifice their blood and souls for the veteran leader.																								But flashing a V-for-Victory sign, he vowed to continue to lead his people, declaring: I want to tell Sharon and his gang that the mountain cannot be shaken by the wind.																								In fresh violence, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, at least two of them militants, in the West Bank city of Jenin.																								Sharon, in comments that could rally support in his Right-wing Likud party before its May 2 vote on his Gaza pullout plan, said yesterday he no longer felt bound by a pledge he made three years ago to US President George W. Bush not to harm Arafat.

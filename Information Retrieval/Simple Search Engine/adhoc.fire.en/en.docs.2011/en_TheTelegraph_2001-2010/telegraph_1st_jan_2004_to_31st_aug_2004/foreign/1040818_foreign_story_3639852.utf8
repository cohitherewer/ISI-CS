 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 German loss
																								Berlin, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Germany said today US plans to pull out 30,000 troops were a sign Europes divisions had healed, but communities hit by the decision warned they were headed for economic disaster.																								German defence minister Peter Struck said he regretted the withdrawal, but Washington had no choice. Thats a big loss to a lot of regions, he said. But the decision of the US President is without alternative.																								Karsten Voigt, Berlins coordinator for German-American relations, said Germany would remain the largest base for US troops in Europe and security in Europe was not at risk.																								But nevertheless the withdrawal of troops is a loss of course. We regret it, the American soldiers were welcome here. But it is a sign of success at the same time  the success of having overcome the Cold War and European division, Voigt said.																								The news struck a sentimental chord in Berlin where politicians and commentators voiced regret at the departure of troops who brought the American way to post-war West Germany. Older Germans remember receiving their first piece of chocolate or bubble gum from a GI.

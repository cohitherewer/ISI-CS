				 Presence of ice confirmed

																								Darmstadt (Germany), Jan. 23 (Reuters): The first all-European mission to Mars has confirmed the presence of frozen water on the planet, the projects leader said today, as scientists seek to learn if life there ever existed.
																								It shows that we may be able to find water in other areas on Mars... and that is very important for future missions to Mars, said project leader Michael McKay. He said confirmation of the presence of frozen water came in high resolution pictures of the planets south pole beamed back from Mars Express, the mothership of the Beagle 2 probe which is feared to have crashed on landing on Mars a month ago.

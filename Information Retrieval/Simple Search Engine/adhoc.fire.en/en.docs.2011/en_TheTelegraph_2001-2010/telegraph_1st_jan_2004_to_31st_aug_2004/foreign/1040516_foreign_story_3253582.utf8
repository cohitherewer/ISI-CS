 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Troops try to win hearts with books, frisbees
				 	 Iraqi boys try to grab a frisbee from a US soldier outside a school in Falluja. (Reuters)																								Falluja, May 15 (Reuters): US Marines toting M-16s handed out frisbees and books to school children in Falluja today, stepping up a hearts-and-minds campaign after ending a siege of the rebellious city in which hundreds were killed.																								But in a sign of the uphill publicity battle they face, US commanders at the school were dogged by angry complaints of destroyed homes, a widening prisoner abuse scandal and news of US tanks firing cannons next to Shia shrines in the south.																								Outside one classroom, Marine commanders were confronted by angry teachers demanding an explanation for the abuse at Abu Ghraib or for the combat in the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf, where US forces are hunting down militias loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr.																								Why did you beat the prisoners? We saw it on the television. I have two relatives in Abu Ghraib. What is going to happen to them? one teacher asked as Marines unloaded books. 																								Why are you attacking Karbala? another teacher demanded. US forces, who fought pitched battles with Sunni insurgents in Falluja until a peace agreement was reached last month, say they plan to spend $500 million on projects in the central Anbar province, where anti-US sentiment runs deep.																								They say the projects  which include water-treatment facilities, roads, schools and hospitals  are meant to show that they are in Iraq to promote democracy and peace after ridding it of Saddam Hussein and not as an occupying force.																								Today, Marines in full combat gear and riding on Humvees topped with machine guns handed out books at a school next to an apartment complex outside Falluja, west of Baghdad. 																								The complex, which houses an elementary school, a middle school and a mosque, was taken over by US forces and turned into a Marine command post during the US offensive.																								Some 250 families, including many children, were forced to leave for three weeks as fighting went on. Now the Americans say they plan to spend $500,000 to repair windows, fix plumbing and plant new grass on the soccer field.																								The donated books  all of them in English  were mostly volumes on American history and culture, including a book on science fiction movies with titles such as The Invasion of the Saucermen and The Attack of the 50-foot woman. There were also some textbooks on biology and mathematics. The schools have students ranging in age from five to 11.																								What is this book about? arts teacher Ibrahim Mardan, asked Marine Captain Jeff Stevenson, as he leafed through pictures of Frankenstein, Godzilla and E.T. Athby Atai, 33, the schools assistant director and a biology teacher, thanked the Americans for the books but later confided they were difficult to understand.																								I dont think my students will be able to read these books. I cant understand them myself, he said.

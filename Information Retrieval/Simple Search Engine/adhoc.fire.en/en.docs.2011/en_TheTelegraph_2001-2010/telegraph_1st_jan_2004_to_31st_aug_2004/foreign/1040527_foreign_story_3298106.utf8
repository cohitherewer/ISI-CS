 Thursday, May 27, 2004 Blair quashes talk of split with Bush 
Troops to stay under US charge: Powell
				 	 Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street. (Reuters)																								London, May 26 (Reuters): Britains Tony Blair sought today to quash talk of a split with the US over Iraq, saying foreign troops operations should stay under American command once an interim local government takes over.																								But with another eye on Iraqi and world opinion  anxious for an end to the year-old US-led occupation  Blair stressed the Baghdad government due to assume power after June 30 would have full sovereignty including over military strategy.																								Yesterday, Blair surprised Washington by saying Iraqis would have a veto over operations like the recent attacks on Falluja, prompting US secretary of state Colin Powell to fire back that American forces would stay under US charge.																								As media and Opposition politicians pounced on the apparently first open signs of division between London and Washington since the Iraq war, Blair insisted today he was still in line with his ally President George W. Bush.																								We are both absolutely agreed there should be full sovereignty transferred to the Iraqi people and that the multinational force should remain under American command, he told parliament.																								The ultimate strategic and political decision-making passes to the Iraqi government after the 30th of June... Once strategic decisions have been made, the running of any operations is under the military forces and the commanders of those forces.																								There was no question of US or British troops being under anything other than their own national command, he added.																								Clearly stung by a media storm in Britain, Blair sent deputy Prime Minister John Prescott onto the airwaves earlier to label talk of an Anglo-American split complete rubbish. 																								Prescott said the British and US statements boiled down to two non-conflicting points: Iraqis having general political control over foreign troops, except when those troops were attacked.																								Under circumstances which can occur where a terrorist attack takes place and attacks a military force, whether its the Americans or the British, clearly they will be expected to defend themselves. Nobody doubts that, he said.																								The British line, however, still appeared to fall somewhat short of Washingtons broader interpretation. Powell said yesterday the US would take into account the Iraqis view at political and military level.																								Ultimately, however, if it comes down to the US armed forces protecting themselves or in some way accomplishing their mission in a way that might not be in total consonance with what the Iraqi interim government might want to do at a particular moment in time, US forces remain under US command and will do what is necessary to protect themselves, he said.																								The charged issue of control over troops is crucial to convincing Iraqis  and sceptical powers like France and Russia  that London and Washington are serious about handing back sovereignty to Iraq. It also touches an American taboo over foreign control of its troops.																								Najaf violence																								US tanks backed by helicopter gunships pounded Shia militiamen holed up in a cemetery in the Najaf today, leaving several dozen rebel fighters dead, the US military said.																								A senior military official in Baghdad said just under 50 militiamen were killed in the overnight and pre-dawn fighting, although he declined to give a specific number.																								US forces captured a key aide to al-Sadr during a series of overnight raids in Najaf, Sadrs spokesman said today. 																								Qais al-Khazali said Riyad al-Noury, a relative of Sadr, was captured in a raid on his house in Najaf.

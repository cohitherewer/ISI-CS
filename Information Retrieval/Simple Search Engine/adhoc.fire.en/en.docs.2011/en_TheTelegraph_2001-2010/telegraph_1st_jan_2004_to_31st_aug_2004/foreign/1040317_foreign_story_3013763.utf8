 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 France gets attack threats
																								Paris, March 16 (Reuters): France has received threats of a possible attack against French interests from an Islamist group, the justice ministry said in a statement today.																								The ministry said it had received a warning which spoke of possible attacks within France and against French interests abroad from a group called Servants of Allah the Powerful and Wise. These are threats articulated in such a way that they are being taken very seriously, a judicial source said.																								The ministry statement said the Paris prosecutors office had immediately launched an inquiry. It is obviously not yet possible to comment on the value of this document, the statement concluded.																								Security experts say France is a target because of its cooperation with authorities fighting Islamic militants in its former North African colonies Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.

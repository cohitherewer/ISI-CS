 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Aziz sworn in, vows more reforms
																								Islamabad, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Pakistans new Prime Minister, Shaukat Aziz, a technocrat and trusted ally of military leader President Pervez Musharraf, vowed more economic reforms today after he was sworn in.																								A former Citibank executive who is credited with turning around the economic fortunes of Pakistan, Aziz was elected to the post yesterday by a vote in the National Assembly, a formality given its pro-military majority.																								Speaking in the National Assembly today after a swearing-in ceremony and after winning a vote of confidence, Aziz vowed: The process of economic reforms will continue so that people get more (job) opportunities and poverty and unemployment is eradicated.																								Aziz is expected to announce his cabinet on Tuesday or Wednesday and is likely to keep the finance portfolio.																								Musharraf, dressed in a suit rather than military uniform, stood alongside Aziz at the Presidents House as the two men read the swearing-in oath. 																								Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Musharraf said the smooth transfer of power augured well for democracy. 																								The political culture is gradually maturing in Pakistan, he said.																								But Opposition groups boycotted both yesterdays and todays votes after the speaker of the National Assembly refused to allow their candidate, Javed Hashmi, who is serving a life term in jail for defaming the military, to attend.

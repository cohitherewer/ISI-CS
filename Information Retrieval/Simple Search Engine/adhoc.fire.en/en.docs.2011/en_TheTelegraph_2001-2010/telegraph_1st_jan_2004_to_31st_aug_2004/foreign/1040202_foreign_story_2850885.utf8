																								Islamabad, Feb. 1 (Reuters): Pakistans investigation into the sale of nuclear weapons technology to Iran and Libya has narrowed down to seven suspects, including top scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan who has been sacked as government adviser, officials said today.																								Revered as the father of the countrys and the Islamic worlds atomic bomb, Khans removal as adviser to the Prime Minister is a sensitive issue. Pakistan developed nuclear weapons from the 1970s in response to Indias programme.																								President Pervez Musharraf, who has promised to punish anyone who leaked nuclear weapons secrets abroad, has yet to decide whether Khan and others will be put on trial.																								That decision will be taken only when the investigation is complete, Major-General Shaukat Sultan, Pakistans military spokesman, said. 																								If during the the investigation anyone is found out, that person will be looked into. No one is above the law. He said the investigation would be wound up after the Muslim holiday of Id al-Adha, which ends in Pakistan on Wednesday. 																								Details of Khans large personal fortune and extravagant lifestyle have been reported in the local press, but many refuse to blame the 69-year-old, saying he was acting at the behest of the military which was desperate to develop an atomic bomb.																								Whether the net will widen to include senior military and intelligence officials, who western diplomats say must have known about Khans dealings abroad, remains to be seen.																								Sultan said there were two retired brigadiers among the seven suspects.																								A report in The News daily that suggested Khans business interests stretched to Africa also questioned the role of retired General Mirza Aslam Beg, head of the army from 1988 to 1991, who is not under investigation.																								It said Beg had denied two successive Prime Ministers  Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif  access to the Khan Research Laboratories uranium enrichment plant near Islamabad. Beg has denied any wrongdoing.  Pervez address																								Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf will address the nation after the Id holidays to explain the need to crack down against Khan and other scientists for allegedly proliferating nuclear technology to Iran and Libya, official media reported today. 																								The government was under pressure from the Opposition and Islamist parties not to take action against Khan.

 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Iraq pressure on apologetic Blair
																								London, May 10 (Reuters): An apologetic Tony Blair pledged today to crack down on any British mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners as humanitarian organisations said they had alerted his government to abuses months ago.																								We express our total condemnation and disgust at any abuses that have been carried out, the Prime Minister said in a second day of hand-wringing from London over increasing abuse claims against US and British troops in Iraq. 																								Amid calls for the resignation of US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld over shocking photos of American abuse, his British counterpart Geoff Hoon cast doubt today on photographs allegedly showing UK troops abusing an Iraqi prisoner but said two other cases of mistreatment could soon lead to prosecutions.																								I can confirm today that two cases have reached an advanced stage with decisions on prosecutions pending, Hoon told parliament. Britains Daily Mirror newspaper has printed photographs apparently showing troops urinating on a prisoner and beating him. The authenticity of the pictures has been questioned but the paper has since published evidence from a soldier who said he had witnessed savage beatings of Iraqis.																								Like US President George W. Bush a few days earlier, Blair apologised for any humiliating or violent handling of detainees.																								He said any charges had been investigated promptly and acted upon. If allegations are made against British soldiers, we investigate them, we take action, he told a news conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.																								Blair said he had not seen the Red Cross report but that if there were abuses, they were conducted by a small minority.																								(It) does not as I understand it say there is systematic abuse by British soldiers of Iraqi detainees, he said.																								Thirteen months after the fall of Saddam Hussein, Britain and the US have been rocked by a scandal that only hit the headlines when graphic images were splashed across their national media of prisoners being humiliated and mistreated.																								While the allegations against US troops appear more serious and widespread, the row has further hampered Blairs efforts to move Britains political agenda away from Iraq. His popularity has plummeted since the war, even prompting talk of his possible resignation from some of his allies.																								Although much of the abuse described in the Red Cross report appears to have taken place in jails run by U.S. forces, it also described the death of an Iraqi prisoner in custody in the British zone Basra last September. His name is blacked out.																								Britains Ministry of Defence said the allegation was not new, but appeared to be a reference to the death of an Iraqi detainee named Baha Musa, which Britain says it has been investigating since last year.																								An eyewitness description of the body given to the ICRC mentioned a broken nose, several broken ribs and skin lesions on the face consistent with beatings, the report said.																								Blair said there were two specific issues highlighted by the Red Cross, both of which Britain had dealt with.																								Officials said 33 cases against UK troops were or are under investigation, 12 of them ongoing. Of the 21 completed only six could lead to prosecutions, 15 others hadno case to answer.																								Last week, Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram told parliament he had received noadverse reports from any outside body on the treatment of prisoners by British soldiers.

 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Shias downplay civil war fears
				 	 Shia cleric Shaih Ali gestures after the explosion in Baghdad. (Reuters)																								Baghdad, March 2 (Reuters): Iraqi Shia Sajed Kazem knelt on the blood-splattered street near Baghdads holiest Shia mosque, patiently filling a cooking pot with human flesh.																								These are martyrs, said Kazem, wearing a green headband, one of the volunteers gathering torn and burned body parts left strewn around after three suicide bombers killed at least 58 people as crowds of Shias marked their holiest day at the gold-domed mosque.																								Iraqi police and Shia militiamen brandishing rifles pushed hundreds of dazed onlookers away. Thousands of shoes were scattered around, having being removed according to custom by worshippers and left at the mosques entrance before the blasts.																								Tens of thousands had gathered at the mosque, ritually beating their chests and heads to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammad killed in battle more than 13 centuries ago.																								I was watching the beating of the chests and the explosion took place. I saw mutilated bodies everywhere, said Haider Zubaidi, a farmer who suffered a broken arm and head injuries and was taken to hospital in a pickup truck.																								Tareq Salman, 25, a worker in the Bustan hotel close to the mosque, described the mayhem. It was a tragedy. There were shouts of Allah-u-Akbar (God is Greatest) and women and men rushed from the scene, he said.																								Leaders of Iraqs 60 per cent Shia majority said the attacks were an attempt to provoke civil war. Hundreds of furious youths from Shia militias carrying banners and mourning flags vowed revenge, some calling for random attacks on Sunni areas across the Tigris river.  Hussein we will take revenge, said the chanting crowds, hurling abuse at revered Sunni clerics.																								But despite the rising passions, many Shias said sectarian war between the rival Muslim sects could never erupt as it would not be sanctioned by their clerics. 																								Across the river in the Sunni Aadhimiya district, Sheikh Moayad, the imam of Abu Hanifa mosque housing the grave of the Sunni sects foremost theologian, prayed against sectarian strife. The attacks were designed to ignite civil war and must be the work of outsiders. Iraqis will not fall for it, he said.

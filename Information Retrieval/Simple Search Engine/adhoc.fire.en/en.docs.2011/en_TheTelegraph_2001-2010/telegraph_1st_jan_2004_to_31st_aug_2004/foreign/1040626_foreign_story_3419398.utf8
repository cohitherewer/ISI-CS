 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Syria under probe for Nuke Khan links
 DOUGLAS FRANTZ																								Istanbul, June 25: International investigators are examining whether Syria acquired nuclear technology and expertise through the black market network operated by Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, according to a US official and western diplomats. 																								Intelligence reports indicate that Khan and some associates visited Syria in the late 1990s and later held clandestine meetings with Syrian nuclear officials in Iran, the diplomats said. 																								Concerns were heightened after an experimental US electronic eavesdropping device recently picked up signals indicating that Syria was operating centrifuges, which enrich uranium for possible use in nuclear weapons. 																								Khan, who helped Pakistan develop its nuclear arsenal, has admitted selling advanced centrifuge technology and expertise to Iran, Libya and North Korea over nearly two decades. The extent of his illicit operations remains unknown, but diplomats said that if Syria did have centrifuges they would undoubtedly have come from Khans network. 																								Inspectors from the Vienna, Austria-based International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, are investigating whether sales were made to other countries as they try to build an accurate picture of the most serious nuclear proliferation network in history. 																								A senior European diplomat familiar with the IAEA inquiry said Syria was on the list of suspected customers, but he said the agency had not found evidence that Khan visited Syria or sold technology to it. 																								The Syrian representative to the IAEA in Vienna did not respond to written questions submitted on Tuesday. In the past, Syrian officials have dismissed accusations that the country is pursuing nuclear weapons. The IAEA declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the US state department said: We are unable to comment on any of these questions.																								Other western diplomats and some US officials cautioned that the information linking Syria to Khans network was not conclusive. Even if Khan had contact with Syria, they said, there was no evidence that Syria bought centrifuges from him. 																								Since admitting his dealings with some countries this year, Khan has been cooperating with Pakistani authorities, who are sharing some information with the IAEA and the US. Khan had not denied contacts with other governments, a senior US official said, but the Pakistani scientist also had said sales were made only to Iran, Libya and North Korea.

 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Presidents knew of hijack plan
 SUSAN SCHMIDT Former President Bill Clinton being interviewed for an edition of the BBCs Breakfast with Frost. (Reuters) 																								Washington, July 18: A secret intelligence report prepared for President Bill Clinton in December 1998 reported on a suspected plot by Osama bin Laden to hijack an American airliner in an effort to force the US to release imprisoned conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center attacks. 																								The one-page declassified version of the Presidents Daily Brief (PDB) dated December 4, 1998, contains chilling information the CIA had gleaned from several sources indicating that al Qaida was working with US-based operatives of its deadly ally, the Eqyptian group Gama at al-Islamiyya, in the purported hijack plot. 																								The PDB shows that the intelligence community and the White House were aware of al Qaidas interest in hijacking US airliners long before the attacks on September 11, 2001. The day the PDB was prepared, then-CIA director George Tenet said in a memo to the intelligence community that we are at war, and that no resources should be spared to defeat the terrorists. 																								A report by the presidential commission investigating the September 11 attacks will include the newly declassified document and a previously declassified PDB from August 6, 2001, when it is released this week.																								It also will contain details of what the commissions executive director, Philip Zelikow, described yesterday as an energetic response to the hijack threat information by the Clinton administration, including its efforts to determine if the reports were true. 																								The 1998 document is the most important PDB about hijacking published before 9/11, said Zelikow. The August 6, 2001, PDB prepared for President Bush mentioned 1998 intelligence concerning a plot by bin Laden to hijack a US aircraft to gain the release of Blind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and other US-held extremists.																								The 2001 PDB said intelligence officials have not been able to corroborate the plot reports from 1998. 																								The 1998 PDB is titled: Bin Laden preparing to hijack US aircraft and other attacks. It was declassified, with redactions, by the White House last Monday at the request of the September 11 commission. The text of the 1998 PDB was read to a reporter by an administration official who had access to the declassified document. It said intelligence reports suggest Bin Laden and his allies are preparing for attacks in the US, including an aircraft hijacking to obtain the release of Sheikh Umar Abd al-Rahman, Ramzi Yousef and Muhammad Sadiq Awda. 																								One source quoted a senior member of Gama at al-Islamiyya (I.G.) saying that as of late October the group had completed planning for an operation in the US on behalf of bin Laden but that the operation was on hold.

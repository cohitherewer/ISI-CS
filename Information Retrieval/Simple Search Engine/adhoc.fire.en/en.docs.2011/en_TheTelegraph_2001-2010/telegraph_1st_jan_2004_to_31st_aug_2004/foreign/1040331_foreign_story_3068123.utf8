 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Qaida spy becomes small fry
				 	 Government official Mathiullah Barki in Wana, South Waziristan. Barki was killed by militants and his body was found on Tuesday. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, March 30 (Reuters): From Osama bin Laden and his right-hand man to al Qaida spies of varying seniority, the top scalps in the hunt for terror suspects on Pakistans wild Afghan border are eluding thousands of troops sweeping the area.																								In the latest setback, after trumpeting the death of al Qaidas intelligence chief in a bloody siege, the government rowed back a day later today and clarified the slain man was a lower-ranking al Qaida operative.																								He is not the al Qaida intelligence chief but he was the local intelligence boss, said military spokesperson Major-General Shaukat Sultan, referring to a man authorities identified a day earlier as a leading al Qaida spy named Abdullah.																								In a separate incident, Islamic militants on the Afghan border shot dead two Pakistani hostages, a government official said today.																								The hostages, among 14 kidnapped government men, were found in a ditch near a well late yesterday, shot in the head and chest, close to Wana in rugged South Waziristan where they worked as district officials, the military said. They were unarmed, Mahmood Shah, the regions security chief, said. The other 12 hostages were released unharmed on Sunday.																								Thousands of Pakistani soldiers are scouring perilous mountain ranges along a porous 2,450-km frontier with eastern Afghanistan for hundreds of armed al Qaida and other fighters believed to include Arabs, Afghans, Uzbeks and Chechens.																								The top prize is bin Laden himself. But after a 12-day siege of a mud fort sheltering 400 to 500 al Qaida fighters and their tribal allies ended on Sunday, no major al Qaida leaders emerged among 63 militants killed and 167 captured.																								Pakistan maintains that bin Laden and other high-ranking al Qaida are not on Pakistani soil and that 50,000 troops deployed along its Afghan frontier are there to flush out militants regardless of their seniority.																								Local journalists say al Qaida fighters slipped through the net several times last year because local people warned them the army was coming. Heavy fighting at the start of the current raids suggested tribesmen were shielding a high-value target, maybe bin Ladens deputy Ayman al-Zawahri.																								But the army later dismissed the presence of Zawahri as conjecture and said an Uzbek militant leader might be among the fighters. That appeared correct. The army said a wounded Uzbek al Qaida leader, Tahir Yuldashev, was on the run, bit he too escaped.

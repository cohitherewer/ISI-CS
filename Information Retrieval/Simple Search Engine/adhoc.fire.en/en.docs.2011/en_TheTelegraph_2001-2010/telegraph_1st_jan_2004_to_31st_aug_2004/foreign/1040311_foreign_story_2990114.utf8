 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Interpreter reaches UN
				 	 Nicole Kidman United Nations, March 10  (Reuters): Using authentic ambassadors as a backdrop  and possibly journalists as well, director Sydney Pollack  began filming at the UN headquarters this week his new movie   The Interpreter, starring Nicole Kidman and Sean  Penn.																								I am enormously sympathetic to the UN, he told a news conference yesterday. But I know better than to try to spend $80 million to make a propaganda film. Its boring.																								Filming in New York is not unusual. But doing it at the UN headquarters is unique because no one could remember the world body ever giving Hollywood permission. It rejected Alfred Hitchcocks 1959 movie, North by Northwest, starring Cary Grant, which opened with the assassination of a diplomat in a UN lounge.																								Pollack, too, was first turned down by the UN legal department, diplomats said. But Shashi Tharoor, head of UN public information, who read the script, convinced secretary-general Kofi Annan and others the film would be seen by millions the organisation could never reach itself.																								Kidman plays a UN interpreter from a fictitious African nation, who overhears an assassination plot against her troubled countrys leader and becomes a target herself. Penn, like Kidman an Academy Award winner, plays a secret service agent suspicious of her claims.																								The interpreter... believes very much in the power and sanctity of words and believes if they are used properly they can be as powerful as bullets or weapons, Pollack said. 																								Pollack, denied the plot was a symbol for the US attack against Iraq after France and other UN Security Council members refused to support the invasion. It doesnt deal with any of the political problems that arose from that Iraqi war, he said, acknowledging however, that influence is a subtle thing, like smoke in the air.

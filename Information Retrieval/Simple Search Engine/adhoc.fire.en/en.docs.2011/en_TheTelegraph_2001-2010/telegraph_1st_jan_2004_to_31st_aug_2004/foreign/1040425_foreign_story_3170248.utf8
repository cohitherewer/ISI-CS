 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Carelessness to blame for blast: North Korea
				 	 Railway workers chat next to a mangled train carriage at Ryongchon station, North Korea, near the Chinese border. (AFP)Seoul/Dandong (China), April 24 (Reuters): The Red Cross described apocalyptic scenes around the site of a train explosion in North Korea but said today the death toll stood at 154  far lower than first feared.																								North Korea blamed carelessness for Thursdays blast in the town of Ryongchon near the Chinese border, which sent debris flying for miles and caused damage 4 km away.																								Chinas Xinhua news agency quoted Korean official Jang Song-gun, in charge of rescue efforts, as saying 154 people had been confirmed dead, including 76 primary schoolchildren.																								South Korean media, quoting witnesses and Chinese sources, had initially reported up to 3,000 people killed or injured. It looks as though a fireball has swept through, John Sparrow, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said today. 																								There was total destruction for several hundred metres around Ryongchons railway station, he added.																								The explosion gouged a massive crater 50 metres deep where the railway depot used to be and destroyed a school and hundreds of homes, foreign aid workers, who were led around the blast site by government officials, said on their return.																								Describing the crater, Rose Dew, country director for Dublin-based relief agency, Concern, said: Its about 50 metres deep, but was probably deeper... Bulldozers were filling it up. 																								Dew said rescue operations appeared to be over as she did not see any people searching for bodies.																								The blast occurred just hours after a train carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong-il home from Beijing passed through Ryongchon. 																								A brief North Korean state news agency report said the blast had occurred during the shunting of a train carrying chemical fertiliser and tank wagons. It gave no death toll but described the damage as very serious.

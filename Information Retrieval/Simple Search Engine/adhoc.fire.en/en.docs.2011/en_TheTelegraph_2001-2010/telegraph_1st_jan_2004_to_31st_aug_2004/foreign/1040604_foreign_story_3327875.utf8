 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Deuba woos parties after swearing in
																								Kathmandu, June 3 (Reuters): Nepals new Prime Minister was sworn in today and began wooing political parties to join a multi-party government in a bid to defuse a political crisis and end a Maoist revolt in the Himalayan kingdom.																								Sher Bahadur Deuba, fired by King Gyanendra nearly two years ago, was reappointed yesterday as Nepals 14th Prime Minister in as many years, replacing royalist Surya Bahadur Thapa who quit last month after weeks of pro-democracy street protests.																								Deuba was sworn in by King Gyanendra at the sprawling Narayanhity palace in Kathmandu. 																								I will make all efforts to include other political parties to the government. Let me first meet parties, then I will form the new cabinet, Deuba said.																								Speaking shortly after his appointment yesterday, Deuba said he would work for peace and would aim to hold a general election by April next year, as requested by the king.																								His sacking by the powerful king in 2002, and the subsequent appointment of pro-royalist governments, provoked a crisis and political parties have since been demanding the restoration of full democracy.

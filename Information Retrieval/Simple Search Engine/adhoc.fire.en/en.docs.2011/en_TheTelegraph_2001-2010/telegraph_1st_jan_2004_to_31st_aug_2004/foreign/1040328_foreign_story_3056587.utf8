 Sunday, March 28, 2004 				 6-year-old boy killed in West Bank firing
Nablus (West Bank), March 27 (Reuters): A six-year-old Palestinian boy was shot dead when a Palestinian gunman opened fire at an Israeli military jeep during a raid in a West Bank refugee camp today, the Israeli army said.																								Television footage taken of the incident by foreign television networks showed a gunshot ricocheting off an armoured Israeli jeep towards an upper floor of an adjacent building. Twenty seconds later womens screams could be heard. Moments later, a Palestinian holding the limp body of a boy with blood on his face and neck is seen outside the building. 																								A Palestinian gunman was filmed in an alley minutes before the incident.																								Palestinian residents said the dead boy, Khalil Walwil, was killed either when soldiers on a nearby hill opened fire at the building while he stood by a window or when troops shot at Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli forces in the camp.																								An Israeli commander, who was in the jeep that came under fire, said the boy was killed when a Palestinian gunman in an alley shot at his jeep as forces left Balata camp. The commander said none of his troops returned fire. I did not fire back at him (the gunman) because his fire was not accurate, said the commander.

 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Donor threat to Lanka
																								Brussels, June 1 (Reuters): Sri Lanka could lose $4.5 billion in aid pledged for it last year unless it resumes peace talks with Tamil rebels, western donors warned today.																								The blunt call on Colombo to end the 20-year civil war came at the end of a meeting in Brussels of Japan, Norway, the US and the EU, co-chairs of the Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka.																								In a world of competing crises, Sri Lanka donor co-chairs... urged in the strongest possible terms a rapid resumption of the peace negotiations so that Sri Lanka can benefit from the generosity of the international community, the donors said. They added that their attention and four-year funding package might go elsewhere unless the peace process makes progress.

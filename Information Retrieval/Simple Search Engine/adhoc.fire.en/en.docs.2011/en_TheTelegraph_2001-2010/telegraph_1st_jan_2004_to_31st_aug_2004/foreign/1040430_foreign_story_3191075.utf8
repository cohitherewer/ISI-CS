 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 9/11 hot seat keeps Bush busy for 3 hours
				 	 George W. Bush speaks to reporters after meeting the 9/11 commission on Thursday. (Reuters)																								Washington, April 29 (Reuters): President George W. Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney took questions today for more than three hours from the September 11 commission about whether they considered al Qaida an urgent priority before the catastrophic attacks.																								Bush and Cheney, in a historic session with potential election-year ramifications, sat down in the Oval Office with the panel of five Republicans and five Democrats. 																								The session ended after three hours and 10 minutes.																								Bush later said he and Cheney answered all questions from the commission, adding it was a cordial meeting that he hoped would help the panel come up with recommendations for how to prevent future attacks.																								If we had something to hide we wouldnt have met them in the first place. We answered all their questions. I came away good about the session because I wanted them to know how I set strategy, how we run the White House, how we deal with threats, Bush said.																								Asked if al Qaida operatives were in the US today, Bush said he could not rule it out but would not get into any details. We are still vulnerable to attack.																								Two Democrats on the panel, vice chairman Lee Hamilton and former US Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, left the White House before the meeting was over.																								Bush agreed under pressure from victims families and the commission to answer questions from all panel members, but only on condition he have Cheney at his side and they meet in private, with no recording of the session. They were not under oath.																								The meeting took place in the very heart of presidential power, the Oval Office, rather than in a room that would have provided a traditional table-and-chair setting.																								Bush and Cheney took up opposite seats in front of the fireplace, and commission members were clustered in the room on couches and chairs.																								Bush was joined by White House legal counsel Alberto Gonzales and two other, unidentified White House lawyers who were there to take notes. The commission was allowed to bring one staffer for note-taking.																								Past testimony has established that elements of the US intelligence apparatus were aware of threats to American targets from the militant al Qaida network, led by Osama bin Laden, before the September 11, 2001, hijacking attacks.																								Bush was braced for close questioning about his response to an August 6, 2001, presidential intelligence memo entitled Bin Laden Determined to Strike In US. It said al Qaida members were in the US and that the FBI had detected suspicious patterns of activity consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.																								Bush was likely to be asked why he did not launch the government into battle stations based on the memo, which he received while on vacation in Texas.																								Bush has already said the memos usefulness was limited because it did not point to a specific target and did not provide actionable intelligence. He was unlikely to give any ground on that position.																								This is a good opportunity for the President to sit down with members of the commission and talk to them about the seriousness with which we took the threat from al Qaida, the steps we were taking to confront it, and how we have been responding to the attacks of September 11, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan said after the meeting started.																								Bushs advisers were worried the commissions findings will be critical of the President, who is running for re-election in November, on his record of fighting terrorism.																								The panel is working to complete its final report by July 26, well into the campaign season.

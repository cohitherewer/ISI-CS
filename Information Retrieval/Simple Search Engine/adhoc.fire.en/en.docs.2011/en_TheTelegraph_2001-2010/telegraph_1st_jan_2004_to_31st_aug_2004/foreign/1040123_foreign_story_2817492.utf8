The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Concern rises over detained scribe
																								Karachi, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Colleagues and rights activists voiced concern today about a Pakistani reporter detained for assisting two French journalists arrested last month, after a state lawyer asked for more time to determine his whereabouts.																								Deputy attorney general Syed Zaki Mohammed was given until today to trace Khawar Mehdi Rizvi, 44, and inform the provincial High Court in Karachi. He said he had written to authorities to find Rizvis whereabouts. I am waiting for a reply, he said. At a hearing today, Mohammed asked for more time and the court extended the deadline until next Tuesday.																								Rizvi was arrested last month for arranging a visit by French journalists Jean-Paul Guilloteau and Marc Epstein to the southwestern province of Baluchistan, even though they did not have valid visas for the trip.																								The Frenchmen, both of whom work for the weekly LExpress, were freed on January 12 after a court waived a six-month prison sentence. 																								But Rizvi has remained in custody and worried relatives say they have no idea where he is. Epstein said his concern for Rizvis whereabouts increases with every passing day. He said the authorities appeared to be using the case in a deliberate attempt to discourage journalists from reporting about sensitive issues.																								The French journalists and Rizvi went to Baluchistan, which shares a border with war-ravaged Afghanistan, to do a story about Taliban guerrillas in the border area.																								Islamabad, which vehemently denies helping its former Taliban allies, accused the men of hiring local Pashtun tribesmen to act as Taliban in an attempt to tarnish Pakistans image.

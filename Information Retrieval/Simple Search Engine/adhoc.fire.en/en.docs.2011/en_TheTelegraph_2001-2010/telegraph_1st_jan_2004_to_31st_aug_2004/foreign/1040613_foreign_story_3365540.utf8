 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Islamabad hikes defence spending
Islamabad, June 12 (Reuters): Ending the three-year freeze on its defence spending, Pakistan today increased its defence allocation by seven per cent amid projections of 6.4 per cent growth rate in its overall economy this year.																								Finance minister Shaukat Aziz, while presenting the governments 2004/2005 budget, announced defence spending would be raised to 193.92 billion rupees ($3.37 billion) next year, from the 180.54 billion spent in 2003/3004.																								Officials say more funds are needed by the military due to an ongoing operation against foreign militants in the western tribal regions on the frontier with Afghanistan and also to maintain its defence forces on its border with India.																								The increase in defence spending comes despite Pakistans plans to cut the size of its army by 50,000 personnel as part of a restructuring plan to save money and make its forces leaner and more hard-hitting.

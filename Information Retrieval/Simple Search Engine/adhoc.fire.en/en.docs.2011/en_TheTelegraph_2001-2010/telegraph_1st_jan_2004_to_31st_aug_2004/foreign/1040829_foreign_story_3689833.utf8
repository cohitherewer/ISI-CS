 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Anti-Bush cyclist protest in New York
																								New York, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Thousands of cyclists snarled traffic in New York yesterday night and police said they arrested more than 250 people and confiscated their bicycles in the first significant protest against US President George W. Bush before the Republican convention.																								More demonstrations were expected, including a march across the Brooklyn Bridge organised by Planned Parenthood group to support womens constitutional right to choose an abortion and other reproductive health issues. There were also two events planned by peace groups opposed to the Bush administrations military and diplomatic responses to the September 11 attacks on America by Islamic militants.																								Last nights protest lasted several hours at a time when central Manhattan was crowded with theatregoers and people at restaurants and bars. Traffic was brought to a virtual standstill in the chaos.																								Many of the protesters chanted: No more Bush as the Republicans prepared to nominate the President at the August 30-September 2 convention in Madison Square Garden to run for a second White House term in the November election against Democratic candidate Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.																								Police said they arrested 264 people and seized their bicycles in the protest mounted by a group called Critical Mass, which wants to boost the rights of cyclists in traffic-clogged city streets. It stages rides in cities around the world on the last Friday of each month.																								The New York Police Department said in a statement that about 5,000 cyclists gathered at Union Square in Manhattan for the ride. But activists said police over-reacted and began cordoning off riders and arresting them when they broke naturally into groups after stopping at traffic lights or otherwise slowing down.

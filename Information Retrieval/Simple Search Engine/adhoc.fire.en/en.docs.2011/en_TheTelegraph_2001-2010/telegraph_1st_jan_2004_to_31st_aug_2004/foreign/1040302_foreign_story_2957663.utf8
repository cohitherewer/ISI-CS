The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 02, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Stinking switch																																	 Berlin, March 1 (Reuters): Rather than give up his prize, a German wine thief cornered in a bar gulped down the contents of a stolen bottle, only to vomit repeatedly as the landlady had switched the wine with vinegar, authorities said today.																																	He was caught in the act and fell over while running away, said a spokesman for police in the southern town of Schwabach. I guess he thought: Id better make the most of this and drank the stuff. Then he vomited up it and everything else hed drunk.																																	Police said several bottles of wine had recently been stolen from the bar, and the landlady had replaced the wine with vinegar before the inebriated 19-year-old struck. Her partner detained the retching thief until police arrived to arrest him. 																													 																Pop police Nicosia (Reuters): A wannabe pop star has been dumped by the Cyprus police force after appearing on a talent show and belting out a haunting ballad. Special constable Manolis Christodoulou appeared on the hugely popular Super Idol series last week, but instead of finding fame and fortune he got his marching orders. To appear (on TV) we must have permission from our superiors, which did not happen in this case, a police spokesman said. He was fired. The performance was also considered an affront to the force by his superior, the spokesman said, without elaborating. Viewers put forward their own theories. While other participants prefer to stick with renditions from Britney Spears or Justin Timberlake, Chistodoulou sang: My Country has been Divided into Two, a popular ballad on the long-running division of Cyprus written in Greek and Turkish. The only problem as far as I could see was that he wasnt very good, said one viewer.																													 																Frigid fright																																	 Muonio, Finland (Reuters): Some 300 racers took the plunge in this years world icepool swimming championship in the Arctic north of Finland. The feeling is difficult to describe. Its something between drunkenness and euphoria, said Kari Farlin, 45, dressed in a fur hat and swimsuit after racing in water of one degree Celsius. The races from Friday to Sunday in Muonio covered 25 metres in a pool cut into a frozen lake. Racers aged between 11 and 79 turned out from six countries. Tuula Koskivirta, 62, who took the 2004 world title in the over 60s series, said its the cold that drives you to victory. You really need to get out as quick as you can! Most competitors were Finnish but four French tourists clad in blue, white and red found their tour operator had signed them up the day before the race. For some, the frigid plunge held unique opportunities. This is... the only sport in which I can represent Lebanon at world championship level, said Ghadi Boustari, 34.

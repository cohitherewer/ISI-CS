 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 One killed in Pak Shia protest
Karachi, May 8 (Reuters): One person was killed when angry Shias went on the rampage in Pakistans southern city of Karachi today, a day after a suicide bomb killed 15 Shia worshippers and wounded more than 125.																								Police said clashes broke out after Shia youth tried to force shopkeepers in the central district of the sprawling city to close down their businesses. One person was killed and two others were wounded, a police official said. Earlier, police used batons and tear gas to disperse angry mourners outside the main Shia mosque in the volatile port city.																								Stop killing innocent Shias! shouted a crowd of about 200 mourners during a funeral procession for one of the victims killed when a powerful bomb was detonated during Friday prayers in a mosque in Karachis business district.																								Grieving relatives of at least a dozen victims buried their dead as authorities deployed paramilitary troops at Shia religious sites in the volatile port city of 14 million people. 																								Additional police were deployed in the city amid fears of further violence. Pakistan has seen a wave of sectarian attacks in the last year in which more than 125 people have been killed, most of them Shias.																								No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it bore the hallmarks of an attack carried out by militants from the Sunni sect, which makes up the overwhelming majority of Pakistans 150 million people.

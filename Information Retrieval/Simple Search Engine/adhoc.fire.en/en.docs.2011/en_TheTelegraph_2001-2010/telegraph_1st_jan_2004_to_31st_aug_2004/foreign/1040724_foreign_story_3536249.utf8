																								United Nations, July 23 (PTI): UN secretary-general Kofi Annan has denied that he had appointed Pakistans ambassador to the US Ashraf Jehangir Qazi as his top envoy in Iraq with the understanding that Islamabad would contribute troops for protection of UN staff in the war ravaged country.																								There is no quid pro quo or expectation that because I have appointed a Pakistani, they would give me troops, Annan said during a press conference.

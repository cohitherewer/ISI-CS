The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Israels atomic spy released
				 	 Mordechai Vanunu at Ashkelons Shikma prison, Israel. (AFP)																								Ashkelon (Israel), April 21 (Reuters): Israeli nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu emerged defiant after 18 years in prison today, saying he was proud of revealing secrets that exposed the Jewish state as an atomic power.																								Vanunu flashed victory signs and waved as he walked through the gates of Ashkelons Shikma Prison, where supporters cheered him as a peace hero and counter-demonstrators booed him with chants of Shut up, atomic spy. I am proud and happy to do what I did, the grey-haired, former nuclear technician said standing before a bank of television cameras.																								Vanunus 1986 revelations to a British newspaper about the top-secret Dimona reactor led analysts to conclude Israel had amassed an arsenal of 100 to 200 nuclear warheads, one of the worlds largest stockpiles.																								Vanunu, 49, complained bitterly of cruel and barbaric treatment at the hands of Israels security services but insisted he had no more state secrets to divulge after serving his full term on a conviction for treason and espionage.																								Fearing he could reveal more classified information, Israel put him under close police surveillance and slapped restrictions on his movements, including a one-year ban on travel abroad.																								Vanunu refused to answer questions in Hebrew during an impromptu news conference broadcast live on state television, saying he was protesting Israels prohibition on his contacts with foreigners. Most Israelis revile him as a traitor.																								Israel doesnt need nuclear arms, especially now that all West Asia is free of nuclear arms, he said. My message ...to all the world is open the Dimona reactor for inspections. 																								Israeli troops killed seven Palestinians, the youngest 13- years-old, in a raid into Gaza today to stop reprisal rocket attacks for the assassination of a top Hamas leader.

 KIM WILLSHER Paris, Jan. 18: In the  latest bout of Franco-American squabbling, hundreds of Air  France pilots and cabin crew who have French nationality  but were born in Muslim countries are furious at being singled  out for stringent security measures when they land in the  US.																								Some of the 324 affected employees complain that they were treated like terrorist suspects after being separated from fellow cabin crew and grilled for up to four hours by security agents on arrival at American airports. The treatment, they say, was discriminatory and insulting.																								The security measures are outlined in a directive from the Transportation Security Agency (TSA), one of a raft of institutions created by President George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks. 																								It targets crew born in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia and Egypt  countries which the American authorities regard as particularly dangerous sources of terrorists.																								The directive stated that the targeted crew would be required to undergo a one-to-one interview with an agent from the TSA. If necessary, it continued, they would be forced to return to France. The directive also advises Air France not to use the foreign-born crew members on flights to Cincinnati because airport staff there lack the facilities needed to conduct the security interviews.																								A Moroccan-born stewardess who flew into the city was prevented from leaving when officials could not conduct her interview. Instead, she was driven for eight hours to Atlanta and forced to fly back to France as an ordinary passenger.																								Guillaume Pollard, an Air France pilot, said even crew unaffected by the tightened security measures were considering boycotting flights to America in protest at the measures. We all condemn this action against our colleagues. I am outraged by the measure. All personnel concerned are French, even if they were born elsewhere. Some of them are from French parents but were born abroad. This is racial discrimination.																								Although the directive has been issued to all European airlines, including British Airways, it has caused particular fury among crew in France where it is seen as the latest blow to US-French relations since Paris opposed military action in Iraq. 																								A spokesman for Air France said that it had lodged an official complaint over the measures, but recognised that the American authorities have sovereignty over their own territory.

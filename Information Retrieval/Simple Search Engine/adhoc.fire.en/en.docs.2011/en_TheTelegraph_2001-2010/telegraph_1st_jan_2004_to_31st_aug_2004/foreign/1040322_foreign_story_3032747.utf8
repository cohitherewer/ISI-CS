 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Malaysia secular triumph
																								Kuala Lumpur, March 21 (Agencies): Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawis secular government won national elections today and 																								retained a two-thirds parliamentary majority, scoring sweeping victories in two key Muslim-dominated states in a nationwide rout of the fundamentalist Islamic opposition. 																								The surprise victories in northern Terengganu and Kelantan states indicate Abdullah has succeeded in rolling back the influence of the Islamic Opposition amid fears that religious fundamentalism was on the rise.																								Abdullah took over from long-time leader Mahathir Mohamad in a pre-arranged power transfer five months ago. The vote appeared to give him a strong mandate to pursue his anti-corruption, pro-development agenda.																								Abdullahs Barisan Nasional coalition won 30 of 32 seats in Terengganus state assembly and 26 of 45 seats in Kelantan, the privately owned TV3 network reported  huge swings against the fundamentalist Pan-Malaysian Islamic party (PAS) that ended its 14-year hold on Kelantan and saw its national president dumped from office in Terengganu. 																								Abdullahs own United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) heads the Barisan Nasional.																								The ruling coalition won 146 of the 219 seats in parliament, with 30 per cent of seats undeclared at 1746 GMT. At the same time, Opposition parties had won only 12 seats. 																								The ruling alliance has formed every government since independence from Britain in 1957, and Abdullahs real test was in winning back support from the Malay Muslim majority, the bulk of whom deserted Mahathir in 1999. 																								The conservative Muslim preachers who lead PAS dream of turning Malaysia into a strict Islamic state, governed by laws written centuries ago and including punishments like stoning and amputation.																								The non-Muslim 40 per cent of Malaysias 25 million people find such notions scary, almost guaranteeing the Barisan their support.

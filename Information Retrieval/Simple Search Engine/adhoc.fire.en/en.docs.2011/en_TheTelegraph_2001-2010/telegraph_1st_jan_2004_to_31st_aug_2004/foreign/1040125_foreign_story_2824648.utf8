 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Major coup for European space agency
 DAVID DERBYSHIRE London, Jan. 24: Jubilant  European scientists yesterday announced that their orbiting  spacecraft had discovered ice on the Mars south pole within  days of starting work.																								It has also captured the first three-dimensional colour images of the surface, revealing vast volcanoes, towering cliffs and giant canyons.																								The confirmation of surface water is a major coup for the European Space Agencys 200 million mission and will help compensate for the loss of the British Beagle 2 lander.																								Nasa spent close to 500 million on Spirit and Opportunity  its buggies which are also seeking water on Mars. Spirit is on the surface, while Opportunity is due to land tomorrow. 																								Mars was once awash with water. The planet is covered with flood plains and deep gorges carved out by rivers and glaciers. Although most of the water vanished billions of years ago, scientists have long believed that the polar caps still contain ice.																								In 2002 Nasas Mars Odyssey orbiter found evidence of underground ice reservoirs at the south pole. But its conclusions were based on indirect methods  the detection of hydrogen and analysis of temperature. The discovery of surface ice will boost American plans to send astronauts to Mars within the next few decades. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 India steers clear of Lanka role
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 29: India today sidestepped a request for playing a bigger role in Sri Lanka and stressed on the need for an early resumption of the peace process between Colombo and the Tamil separatists.																								An enduring solution to the decades-old ethnic problem has to emerge purely through internal peace processes in the island nation, the Indian foreign ministry said.																								The statement, made at the conclusion of Lankan foreign minister Lakshman Khadirgamars talks with Indian leaders in Delhi, coincided with fresh clashes in the Island nation.																								A curfew was imposed on Lankas central tea-growing region for a second night after police shot dead two men to quell an ethnic riot, adds Reuters.																								The police said they were compelled to open fire and call in troops to control mobs that set fire to shops and houses after an argument between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities blew up into a full-scale riot.																								Khadirgamar, who dropped in at Delhi on his way back from a meeting in China, told reporters earlier that there was a growing view among political parties in Lanka that India should play a bigger role in the peace process.																								Khadirgamar raised the issue when he met his Indian counterpart Yashwant Sinha and national security adviser Brajesh Mishra.																								However, when the Indians asked him what specifically Colombo had in mind, he did not elaborate.

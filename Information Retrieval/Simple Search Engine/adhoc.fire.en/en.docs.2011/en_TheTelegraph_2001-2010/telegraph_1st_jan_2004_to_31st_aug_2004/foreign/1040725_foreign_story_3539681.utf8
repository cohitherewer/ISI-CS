 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Three key Khan aides released
																								Islamabad, July 24 (PTI): Pakistan released three key aides to Abdul Qadeer Khan after keeping them in detention for over six months in connection with the probe into proliferation of nuclear technology.																								The three  Major (Retd) Islamul Haq, scientist Nazeer Ahmad and Brigadier (Retd) Sajawal Khan  were released last night, military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said. 																								All three aides were working for the countrys premier nuclear lab, Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL), near here. 																								They were not needed for further investigation, Sultan said, adding that investigations were still continuing and they could be summoned if needed.																								The three were part of a group of 10 scientists and officials of the KRL who were detained after Iran revealed to the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) that Khan and his associates had sold sensitive nuclear technology to Iran. 																								Subsequently, Khan was kept under house detention and later pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf after he admitted transferring nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. 																								The Pakistan government recently relaxed restrictions on Khan and allowing him to meet his family members. 																								The other detainees were released in different batches.

 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Ex-army boss faces Pak nuke needle
				 	 Aslam Beg 																								London, Jan. 20 (PTI): General Aslam Beg, former chief of army staff of Pakistan who allegedly tried to sell nuclear technology to Iran for $12 billion, is being questioned in Islamabad, the London-based Times newspaper reported today.																								The maverick general was held after Abdul Qadeer Khan, architect of the Pakistani nuclear programme, told investigators during a debriefing that nuclear cooperation with Iran had been authorised by the army officer, the Times claimed.																								General Beg, one of a number of senior officers with Islamist sympathies, was the chief of army staff from 1988-91  the period during which the countrys nuclear secrets were allegedly passed on to Iran.																								General Beg, who also served as head of the Inter Services Intelligence agency, is said to have tried to persuade the civilian governments in power during that period to transfer nuclear technology in return for the money that Iran was allegedly prepared to pay and which would have underwritten the Pakistani military budget for a considerable time. The offer was rejected.																								Eight other officials linked with Pakistans premier nuclear weapons laboratory have also been detained. Among them were two retired brigadiers who until recently had served as directors at the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), and a retired major. Major Islam-ul Haq, a close aide and principal staff officer to Khan, was detained by two intelligence officials while dining at Khans house. His wife said that she had heard nothing from him since then. Two more senior scientists are also being questioned in the latest sweep.																								Quoting Pakistan foreign ministry official Masood Khan, the paper said: There is no presumption of guilt. It is probable that some of these people would be cleared.

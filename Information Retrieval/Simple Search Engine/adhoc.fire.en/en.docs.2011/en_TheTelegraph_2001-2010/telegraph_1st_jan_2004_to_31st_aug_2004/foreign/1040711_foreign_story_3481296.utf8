 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Meet-eve condom cover on Bangkok
																								Bangkok, July 10 (Reuters): Waiters wearing condoms on their heads greet diners at the Cabbages and Condoms restaurant in Bangkok and volunteers dole out condoms of all shapes, colours and sizes at cash machines, metro stations and the airport.																								Visitors might be forgiven for thinking that Bangkok, infamous as the flesh-pot of southeast Asia, has gone condom crazy on the eve of the 15th International AIDS conference.																								For weeks, bright red banners hanging from walkways, flyovers and trees across Bangkok have been announcing the biennial event, due to open tomorrow and expected to draw 15,000 delegates from 160 countries.																								 This looks certain to be the largest AIDS conference in history, said Craig McClure, executive director of the International AIDS Society, the main organiser of an event designed to dramatise the need for all victims to get treatment.																								Besides armies of scientists, drug company bosses and AIDS victims, UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, former South African President Nelson Mandela, Sonia Gandhi and Richard Gere are due to attend.																								On the eve of the opening ceremony, health experts were confident a UN plan to get AIDS drugs to three million people in poor nations by the end of 2005 would work, despite being behind target over the first six months of the project.																								We have to be frank and admit there is a very long way to go, Dr Peter Piot, the executive director of UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, said.

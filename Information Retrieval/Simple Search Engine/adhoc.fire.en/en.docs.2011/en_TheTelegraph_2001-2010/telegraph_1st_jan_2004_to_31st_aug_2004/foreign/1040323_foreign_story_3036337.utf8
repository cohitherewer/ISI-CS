(AFP)																								Wana, March 22: Top al Qaida terrorists may have escaped a siege involving thousands of Pakistani soldiers through several secret tunnels leading from mud fortresses to a dry mountain stream near the border with Afghanistan, a security chief said today. 																								The longest tunnel found so far was more than 2 km long and led from the homes of two local men  Nek Mohammed and Sharif Khan  to a stream near the frontier, said Brigadier Mahmood Shah, head of security for Pakistans tribal regions. 																								There is a possibility that the tunnel may have been used at the start of the operation, Shah told journalists in Peshawar. He said the tunnels began at homes in the village of Kaloosha and led in the direction of a mountain range that straddles the border. 																								Three senior officials have said that they believe Ayman al-Zawahri may be at the site, though the government has repeatedly said it does not know who is inside. President Pervez Musharraf said on Thursday that a high-value target was probably involved. The militants may have used the tunnel to escape during the disastrous first day of the operation on March 16, when at least 15 soldiers were killed in fierce fighting. 																								Still, Lieutenant General Safdar Hussain, the commander of the operation, said over the weekend that authorities believe an important terrorist remains inside, based on the level of resistance of the holdouts. Pakistans military said it was conducting DNA tests to identify six suspected foreign terrorists killed in the fighting, but would not elaborate on whether they included any important terror figure. 																								Five bodies of what appeared to be 25- to 30-year-old men were displayed to journalists at a military mortuary in Rawalpindi late yesterday. Al-Zawahri, an Egyptian surgeon, is 52-years-old. The bodies were laid out on stretchers and in open coffins in bloodied clothes. 																								In a separate incident, attackers ambushed an army convoy today, killing 12 soldiers and wounding 22 more, as tribal elders tried to persuade encircled al Qaida fighters to surrender. The army held fire today to let a delegation of elders talk peace.																								However, a convoy heading for Wana to support the operation against the militants was ambushed by fighters with rockets.Abizaid arrives																								Days after US secretary of state Colin Powells visit to Pakistan, top US commander Lieutenant General John Abizaid arrived in Islamabad today for follow-up talks on the war on terror with reference to the military operation in South Waziristan.																								While Sultan downplayed the tour as a visit scheduled a couple of weeks ago and having no link with the ongoing operation in the rugged mountainous region, observers believe it is aimed at fostering coordination in the fight against terrorism.

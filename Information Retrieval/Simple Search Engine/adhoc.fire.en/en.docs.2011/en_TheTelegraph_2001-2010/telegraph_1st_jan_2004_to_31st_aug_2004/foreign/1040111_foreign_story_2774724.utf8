(Reuters)																								Amara (Iraq), Jan. 10 (Reuters): Iraqi police opened fire on stone-throwing protesters demanding jobs in the southeastern city of Amara today and at least six people were killed, hospital and police sources said.																								A doctor at a local hospital, who gave his name only as Assad, said six people were killed and seven were injured. Earlier, police officials said they opened fire after the protesters began throwing stones at the headquarters of the provincial government in the city.																								Almost every window in the building housing the provincial government was smashed, residents said. Protests in post-war Iraq have often turned violent. Many of the protests in Baghdad and in the south have been by the unemployed. On Tuesday, Iraqi police opened fire in the southern city of Basra on former soldiers demanding payment of a promised stipend, wounding at least four people.																								In Kirkuk, US soldiers shot and killed two Iraqi policemen embroiled in a family feud after mistaking them for assailants, the US military said today.																								A military spokeswoman said soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade were sent to respond to reports yesterday that two families were fighting. When they arrived, they saw two men carrying weapons and wearing long coats firing at a house.																								As the soldiers approached, the men attempted to flee, said Major Josslyn Aberle of the 4th Infantry Division. The soldiers pursued them, shouting warnings and firing warning shots but the men did not respond. They killed one outright and another died before reaching hospital, she said. A third man was unharmed. It later turned out all three were policemen, she said. It is not the first time US forces have mistakenly killed members of the Iraqi police or other local security forces.																								In December, three policemen were shot dead and two were wounded in Kirkuk when US troops fired on a checkpoint after apparently mistaking the men for bandits. And in September, American troops in the volatile town of Falluja accidentally killed 10 Iraqis belonging to the local police and another US-trained security force.

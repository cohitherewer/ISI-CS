The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 TV crew tastes Athens batons
																								Athens, August 3 (Reuters): Greeces Olympic Games organisers today apologised and launched an investigation into allegations that a Mexican television crew was beaten by guards after they attempted to film outside the Olympic Games port of Piraeus.																								The two Televisa Mexico crew and one translator say they were pushed into an unmarked car by three security officers as they tried to film outside the port that will host Olympic cruise ships for the August 13-29 Games. They said they were taken to a police gymnasium and beaten.																								We strongly regret what happened yesterday, Games spokesman Michael Zaharatos said, while not confirming any of the details given by the Mexicans.																								A formal investigation has been launched and should there be a need for disciplinary action against the officers it will be taken immediately. This incident will not be repeated, he said. 																								Four more Mexican journalists were arrested today afternoon while filming close to a military base housing Patriot missiles in northern Athens.																								The detainees were taken to a nearby police station where they had their credentials checked before being released without charge, a police source said.																								Piraeus, adjoining Athens and Europes biggest passenger port where seven luxury lines including the worlds biggest cruise ship  the Queen Mary II  will dock to act as floating hotels, is one of the most secure Olympic locations.																								It has been sealed off to anyone apart from ticket-holding travellers and accredited personnel since August 2 and filming even outside the port is prohibited without a special permit. The coastguard which is in charge of port security, whose men were allegedly involved in the incident, said chief Christos Delimihalis had ordered an immediate investigation after being informed of the case.

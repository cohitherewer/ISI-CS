 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Hamza refused bail
																								London, June 3 (Reuters): Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who faces charges in the US of supporting al Qaida, appeared in a London court today to face an American extradition request.																								Abu Hamza, 47, is accused of plotting to create an al Qaida training camp in the US and giving material support and resources to terrorists in Yemen.																								Magistrate Timothy Workman refused Hamza bail during a hearing at Belmarsh magistrates court. He was remanded in custody until July 1 when he will appear by videolink from the high-security Belmarsh prison at a hearing at Bow Street Magistrates court in London.																								Abu Hamza appeared in the dock flanked by three security guards. Wearing a burgundy T-shirt, he only spoke to confirm his name. An open admirer of Osama bin Laden, the one-eyed preacher attended the start of what could be a drawn-out bid to extradite him for trial in the US.																								Home secretary David Blunkett said last week he wanted the case to be speeded through. But Abu Hamzas lawyers could mount a series of appeals. If convicted in the US, the cleric could face the death penalty.

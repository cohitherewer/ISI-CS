The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Pak divided on cull of chickens
				 	 A chicken at a farm near Karachi. (Reuters)																								Karachi, Jan. 27 (Reuters): Millions of chickens should be killed in Pakistan as a precaution against bird flu, a health official said today, but a livestock official said the flu was not so dangerous and a cull was not advised.																								Industry officials said yesterday bird flu had been found in chickens in Karachi but it was a milder strain than the deadly avian flu that has appeared across parts of east Asia and no people had been infected.																								As a safety precaution, the government should destroy all layer chickens, said Qaiser Sajjad, general secretary of the Pakistan Medical Association, referring to the 12.5 million layer chickens in Karachi. 																								This is the only way to stop the deadly bird disease from spreading.																								The bird flu virus has crossed into humans in Vietnam and Thailand, killing at least eight people, but no person-to-person transmission has been detected.																								Pakistani industry officials said yesterday the flu had killed as many as two million egg-laying birds in Karachi and infected at least another 1.5 million. Broiler chickens have not been affected.																								But Mazhar Ali Sahto, livestock secretary in Sindh province of which Karachi is the capital, said that figure was highly exaggerated and the number of chicken killed was not more than a few thousand. 																								We have already distributed nine million vaccines and are getting positive results, he said. We do not advise their destruction. As the price of eggs and chickens tumbled in Karachi, Sahto said the flu was not dangerous to people.																								The flu raging here is of the H7 and H9 type which is not a threat for humans. It is not the deadly H5N1 influenza that has gripped poultry in other parts of Asia, he said. 																								Eggs and chickens are absolutely fit for human consumption. Not a single case of any ailment among the people has been reported in the province because of chicken consumption.

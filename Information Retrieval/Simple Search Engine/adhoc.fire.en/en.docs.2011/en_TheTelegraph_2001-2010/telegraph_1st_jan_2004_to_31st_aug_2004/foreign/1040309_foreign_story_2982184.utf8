 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Pak in US jet peep show
Washington, March 8 (PTI): Pakistan apparently helped China learn the secrets of a top US fighter jet at the height of the Vietnam war by allowing it to examine F-104s provided by Washington to Islamabad, according to secret us government documents made public here.																								Documents obtained by the National Security Archive, a private research agency, show the deep and long-standing strategic collaboration between China and Pakistan even when Washington and Islamabad were wooing each other. 																								George C. Denney, deputy director of intelligence and research, said in a note to secretary of state Dean Rusk on December 4, 1968, that the Johnson administration would continue to be troubled by signs of close and highly secretive cooperation between China and Pakistan.																								Apparently the Pakistani military had given the Chinese access to US F-104 supersonic fighter aircraft, Denny wrote quoting an intelligence source. Chinese technicians had been allowed to examine US-provided F-104 aircraft at Pakistans Sargodha air base and to collect F-104 spare parts and material samples which were taken back to China for analysis.																								Denny said that he believed the action comes in violation of the acceptance agreement with the Pentagon. This generosity made the Chinese just as obliging in providing substantial interest-free loans, Denny wrote. The revelation comes in the midst of a growing debate on a nuclear black market network run by top Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan and how much authorities in Islamabad knew about it. Denney also said China was willing to overlook ideological factors in dealing with Pakistan.																								The declassified papers reveal that the US ambassador to Pakistan Arthur Hummel, in a cable in December 1982, reported that Chinese officials were unresponsive to US pleas for adequate safeguard or other specific cooperation on nuclear exports.

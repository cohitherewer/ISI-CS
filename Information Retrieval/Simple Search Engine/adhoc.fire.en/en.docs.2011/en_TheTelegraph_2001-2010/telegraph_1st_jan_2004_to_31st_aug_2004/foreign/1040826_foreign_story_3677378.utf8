The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 26, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Pungent weapon Jerusalem, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Israels  army has developed a pungent new weapon for driving back  Palestinian protesters  the skunk bomb.																																	The stink bomb, containing a synthetic version of the odour skunks release to deter predators, has been developed for breaking up protests and stone-throwing confrontations without causing casualties, security officials said on Wednesday.																																	The foul-smelling weapon was invented as part of efforts to replace rubber bullets, which have killed scores of Palestinians. The new device, which is not yet operational, releases a cloud so pungent that according to initial tests it permeates clothes for five years, the officials said.																													 																Race roll Bangkok (Reuters): A wannabe Bangkok  governor has been kicked out of the city hall race because  her troupe of scantily-clad female supporters broke election  rules by being too raunchy. The Bangkok Post said  on Wednesday that Leena Jangjanya, a rank outsider who promised  voters cut-price bus fares, had caught the attention of  Thailands Election Commission over an August 18 parade  featuring women dressed in an extraordinary fashion. Such  displays of boisterousness with intent to woo voters were  in breach of both electoral and constitutional laws, the  English-language newspaper said. Leena, one of 15 candidates,  appealed against the red card and insisted the lissom beauties  strutting their stuff had only given the impression of dancing  because the pick-up truck on which they were riding was  wobbling.																													 																Ban bother																																	 London (Reuters): A British man who faced a driving ban after being caught speeding was allowed to keep his licence so he could keep his job -- impersonating heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles. Appearing in court wearing a dark double-breasted suit  a look often sported by the prince  and mimicking Charles habit of fiddling with his cufflinks, Charles Haslett, 48, persuaded magistrates not to give him an expected driving ban. Haslett, who has spent 10 years impersonating the prince and was an official double at his 50th birthday party in 1998, said he needed his vehicle to carry clothes and props to functions all over the country, British newspapers reported on Wednesday. It would have been a hell of a shame if the country wouldnt have been able to see me anymore, said Haslett, who also impersonates Inspector Clouseau and hapless waiter Manuel from the cult BBC TV show Fawlty Towers.

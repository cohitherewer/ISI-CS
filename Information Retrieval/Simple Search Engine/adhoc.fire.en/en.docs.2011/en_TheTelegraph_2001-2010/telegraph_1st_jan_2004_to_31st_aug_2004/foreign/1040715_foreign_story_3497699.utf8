The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Manila readies to pull out
 							 - Government keeps statements vague to buy time A family picture of Bulgarian Georgi Lazov who was executed by militants in Iraq. (AFP) 																								Manila, July 14 (Reuters): The Philippines was preparing today to withdraw troops from Iraq to save the life of a Filipino hostage, but kept its actual plans unclear as the military said it had yet to receive orders to leave.																								Militants threatened to behead truck driver Angelo de la Cruz unless Philippine troops leave by July 20, a month early, leaving President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo with a dilemma between saving his life and maintaining her close alliance with Washington. The air force said it had put two transport planes on standby in Manila to begin an evacuation of troops if ordered.																								A statement from foreign affairs secretary Delia Albert, following news a Bulgarian hostage in Iraq had been executed, said Filipino troops in Baghdad had fallen to 43 from 51.																								But she did not say when the cut was made and police and military officials could not account for the eight personnel. A military spokesman said no order to pull out had been received.																								The department of foreign affairs is coordinating with the defence ministry for the withdrawal of troops, Albert said in her statement. The headcount of the Philippine troops now in Baghdad from 51 is 43.																								A foreign ministry official said de la Cruz is safe and not in danger of beheading and may return home as early as tomorrow.																								Officials said none of Manilas personnel, consisting of 43 soldiers and eight police, had left Iraq. A police official from the department in charge of the Iraq deployment said the eight police officers had not moved from their base south of Baghdad. They are still there, Major Honario Aguila said. They are waiting for a decision from higher up.																								The US has been pressuring the Philippines not to bow to kidnappers by withdrawing ahead of schedule. US officials in Manila said ambassador Francis Ricciardone met with Arroyo yesterday, and that it was still not clear if Philippine troops were withdrawing from Iraq. 																								Statements by Philippine officials have been consistently vague since the deputy foreign secretary said on Monday that Manila would pull out as soon as possible, but gave no date.																								One analyst said it suggested a policy of playing for time by implying a withdrawal to keep the hostage alive, or to win his release, without making substantial changes in the deployment. They probably are trying to bide for time, said Rex Robles, a retired navy officer who runs a security agency. The deputy foreign minister did not clarify whether Manila planned to pull out its troops by July 20. The troops were already scheduled to depart on August 20.

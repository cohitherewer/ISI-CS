The British Airports Authority (BAA) said today it had launched a full investigation after the woman  reported by a newspaper to be a scantily clad stripper  scaled a fence and boarded a private jet. The young woman was found aboard an aircraft last Thursday and an investigation is under way, a BAA spokesman said.																																	The Sun newspaper said 22-year-old Soraya Wilson was discovered eight hours after she passed out in the planes cockpit. She was cautioned but not charged.																																	I dont know who was more embarrassed when they found me, the security men or me, because I was just wearing my knickers and a little top when I woke up, she told the paper.																													 																Name game Madrid (Reuters): The number of Spanish baby girls with the same name as former TV news presenter Letizia Ortiz has quadrupled since her engagement to Crown Prince Felipe was announced in November, a supermarket study showed on Monday. Photographs of the dashing heir to the throne and his glamorous fiance dominate the media and shop windows all over Madrid as royal wedding fever grips the nation ahead of Saturdays nuptials. In the last (five) months the use of the name had soared, Caprabos head of marketing Xavier Alomar said, adding that between December and April the number of Letizias and Leticias rose 300 per cent compared with the previous five months.																													 																Sleep pack																																	 Helsinki (Reuters): One in four Europeans has fallen asleep in the workplace, with the Irish leading the pack but the Dutch able to stifle their yawns best, according to a survey released on Monday. Long workdays, routine tasks, meetings that drag on, and staring into the monitor are prompting workers around Europe to fall asleep at their workplace, one of the surveys co-authors, Internet jobs site Jobline, said. The poll showed 24 per cent of respondents had fallen asleep either at their desk, in a meeting or in the toilet. Thirty-nine per cent said they had not fallen asleep at work, but had to make an effort to stay awake. Close to 40 per cent of Irish participants said they had fallen asleep at work while 80 per cent of Dutch respondents said they had never slept at the office.

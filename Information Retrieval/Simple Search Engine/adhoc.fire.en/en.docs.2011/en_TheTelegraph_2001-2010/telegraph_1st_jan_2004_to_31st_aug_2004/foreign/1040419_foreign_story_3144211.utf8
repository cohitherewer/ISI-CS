 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Millionaires wife tees off on disputed course
 DAVID SAPSTED																								London, April 18: Under a sparkling spring sky yesterday, a millionaires wife finally made it on to the fairways of a golf club that she claims has blackballed her because of her Indian origins.																								But Sheila Williams was still not allowed into Woodbridge Golf Club as a member  that lengthy, costly battle is still being fought away from the greens. Rather, she was there as a guest, representing another Suffolk club in a womens competition.																								Everyone at Woodbridge was very welcoming and treated us cordially, said one of the visiting golfers after the match. There was no hint of anything amiss. Not that things went too well for Williams over the 18 holes of matchplay: she lost her match and Fynn Valley, her club, was defeated by Woodbridge in the knockout competition.																								Away from the course, her year-long fight to join Woodbridge has now gone to independent arbitration, but only after the two sides ran up legal bills approaching 100,000. Williams accusations of racial discrimination  and the clubs vehement denials  are being played out against a backdrop of old business rivalries, lost millions and, most damning of all among the golfing fraternity, suggestions of cheating.																								Two of the central figures are Williams, who is in her 40s and whose Indian family fled Uganda during the reign of Idi Amin, and Linda Miller, who was born in Karachi and is a former ladies captain at Woodbridge. In the wings are their spouses: John Williams and Peter Miller, who used to run rival haulage firms.																								When Sheila Williams got a proposer and seconder for herapplication to join the 111-year-old Woodbridge club, close to the familys house in Debach, there seemed no obvious obstacle.																								But when the application was posted on the club notice board, Linda Miller suggested that, during an inter-club competition in 1997, Williams might have moved her ball out of the rough. Williams denied the allegation and, questioning why no formal complaint had been lodged at the time of the competition, got her partner in the match to write confirming that she had observed all golfing rules. 																								However, the controversy appears to have swayed many at the club, along with suggestions by members that Williams had an abrasive, pushy character.																								Williams addressed the issue head-on in an open letter she sent to Woodbridge members. It is fair to say that sometimes I come across rather blunter than I intend to, she wrote. I speak four languages, but English is not my first and, therefore, I am not totally aware of the unintentional effect I may have in certain situations. The letter repeated her view that there was an underlying racial element to the rejection.																								Woodbridge Golf Club has refused to comment, but the clubs management committee chairman, Geoff Henney, said the club could defend itself against claims of race discrimination. Nobody was willing to discuss the matter. On a glorious day like this, all we want to do is play golf, said member. And, for one day at least, Sheila Williams was allowed to join them.

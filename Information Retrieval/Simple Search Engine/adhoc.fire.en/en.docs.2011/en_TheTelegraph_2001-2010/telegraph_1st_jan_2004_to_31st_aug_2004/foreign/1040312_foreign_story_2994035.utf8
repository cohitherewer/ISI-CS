The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 If its ETA, then outfit not a spent force yet
Madrid, March 11 (Reuters): If todays bombings in Madrid are the work of ETA, they signal a drastic departure for separatist guerrillas many Spaniards had thought were close to spent.																								The commuter train attacks killed over 190 people and bore few of the hallmarks of the Basque guerrillas  except for the timing just three days before a general election  but Spain is convinced they are to blame.																								Since it began fighting in 1968 for a separate Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern France, ETA had killed nearly 850 people, but no single attack brought such carnage and they usually gave warnings to save civilians.																								In 1987 ETA apologised for killing 21 shoppers in a Barcelona supermarket, the groups bloodiest bombing.																								In recent years Spain had been arresting more and more ETA suspects and fatalities were easing  from 23 in 2000 to three last year. For many in Madrid, ETA was on the ropes.																								Then came todays killings, aimed right at civilians, with no warning given. 																								An act of desperation, perhaps, to prove they were still a force to be reckoned with?																								This is clearly an attempt to make a point just ahead of the elections. They had to do something to prove their vitality, their existence, said Jean Chalvidant, an expert on ETA at Frances Institute of Criminology.																								Another analyst suggested al Qaidas attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 had caused a kind of global terror inflation.																								Since September 11, there has been a qualitative leap. Small attacks are no longer adequate. They (ETA) have to aim higher to have influence, said Manuel Coma, a security expert at Spains Royal Elcano Institute, a think tank. 																								Experts said sustained pressure from Spanish and French police, who have arrested 650 ETA suspects or helpers since 2000, had reduced ETA to a hard-pressed core.

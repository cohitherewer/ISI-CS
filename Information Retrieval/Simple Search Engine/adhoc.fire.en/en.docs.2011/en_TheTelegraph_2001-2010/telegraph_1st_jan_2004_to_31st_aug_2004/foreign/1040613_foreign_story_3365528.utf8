The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Pak jets bomb Qaida hideouts
																								Wana (Pakistan), June 12 (Reuters): Pakistani warplanes, backed by helicopter gunships, bombed hideouts of al Qaida-linked militants today in a fourth day of fighting in the mountainous tribal region bordering Afghanistan.																								Pashtun tribesmen also heard artillery fire as the Pakistani forces intensified an assault in the Shakai area of South Waziristan, 400 km southwest of Islamabad. Casualty updates were scanty today, but officials have counted at least 54 people killed in the fighting since the offensive began.																								I woke up to the roar of jets. Then I saw three helicopters flying in the direction of Shakai, said one resident of Wana, the main town of South Waziristan.																								There was a lot of firing, like a guerrilla battle going on all night, said a local in Shakai.																								Residents saw air strikes on the slopes of the nearby Tangari hills, where brush and boulders provide fine cover for guerrillas.																								Afghan refugees in South Waziristan were given 72 hours to leave by authorities. Locals saw many Afghans quitting the Karikot refugee camp a few kilometres south of Wana, and said they were headed back to Afghanistan.																								Elsewhere, militants exploded a bomb in Dera Ismail Khan town, 130 km east of Wana, killing one man and wounding four at the house of a senior official in Pakistans paramilitary border force. The army launched the latest offensive after attempts to negotiate an amnesty with tribesmen protecting the foreign militants failed.																								The fighting is going on, military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan told state-run Pakistan Television, adding the operation would continue to its logical end. 																								Sultan said yesterday 35 militants and 15 soldiers had been killed the previous two days, and a local government officer today reported another soldier killed. Three civilians have also been reported killed. 																								While the gunships have been used in earlier operations in the tribal areas that have failed to net any senior al Qaida or militant leaders, air force jets were sent in for the first time this week to bomb houses where militants had been spotted.																								In late March, more than 120 combatants, including at least 46 soldiers, were killed when the army launched its first major offensive in South Waziristan.																								Up to 600 foreign militants, including Arabs, Chechens and Uzbeks linked to the al Qaida network, have been hiding out in Pakistans semi-autonomous tribal areas, protected by Pakistani tribesmen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Iran MPs not to end protest
																								Tehran, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Despite a bid by Irans Supreme Leader to cool a row over who can stand in next months election, scores of reformist MPs vowed today to press on with a protest sit-in until their demands were met in full.																								Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on all state matters, called on Wednesday on the Guardian Council, a powerful conservative watchdog, to review a decision to ban thousands of liberal candidates from the February 20 vote. But reformist MPs said their sit-in, heading towards its sixth night, would continue until they saw concrete evidence that Khameneis demand was being implemented.																								We want guarantees of a free election with the presence of all the disqualified candidates, said reformist MP Jamileh Kadivar. The sit-in will go on until then. The Guardian Council barred almost half of the 8,200 parliamentary hopefuls, mainly allies of pro-reform President Mohammad Khatami. 																								Those blocked included 80 of the standing 290 MPs. More than 100 increasingly dishevelled reformist MPs are camped out in parliament anterooms, many of them now joined during the day by their families. But their sit-in has drawn little sympathy from students, the vanguard of Irans reformist protests, or the public, frustrated with reformers who have largely failed to deliver swift social and economic change.																								Senior conservative cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani defended the role of the watchdog in weeding out candidates unfit for office.																								It is for the Guardian Council to decide who is competent... (It judges) if a person cannot show a practical commitment to Islam and steer the ship of state forward, he told worshippers at Friday prayers.

 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Blasts rock Damascus
Dubai, April 27 (Reuters): Blasts and heavy shooting shook the Syrian capital, Damascus, late today, Arab television stations reported.																								Al Jazeera television said the blasts and shooting were heard from a western district of Damascus where it said the British ambassadors residence and the Saudi embassy are located. Al Arabiya quoted its correspondent as reporting explosions were heard in the city. A British foreign office spokeswoman in London said the explosion took place on a street close to the Iranian ambassadors residence. It is closer to the Iranian ambassadors residence than it is to our ambassadors residence... (There were no) injuries to UK embassy staff, he said. There was no damage to the British embassy.

 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Korea talks end with no breakthrough, US upbeat
				 	 Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxing in Beijing after the talks ended. (AFP)																								Beijing, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear crisis ended today without a breakthrough but a senior US official said the meetings had advanced Washingtons agenda of disarming Pyongyang.																								Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxing closed the four-day session saying all sides had agreed to set up a working group and hold the next set of talks in Beijing before the end of June.																								Differences, even serious differences, still exist, Li said at the closing ceremony, without specifying what gaps remained.																								Chinas chief negotiator, Wang Yi, cited an extreme lack of trust between the US and North Korean side and said further discussions were needed on the scope of both the norths proposal to freeze its nuclear programmes and the US demand for dismantling all atomic arms schemes.																								But a senior US official declared the talks that also involved South Korea, Japan and Russia very successful, saying all but Pyongyang had agreed to the goal of a nuclear-free North.																								The event has exceeded my expectations in a very important respect. Its been very successful in moving the agenda towards our goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling (CVID) of DPRK nuclear programmes, the U.S. official said.																								CVID is now more on the table than ever.																								Russias chief delegate, Alexander Losyukov, said the talks achieved modest results. But he called the working groups a reasonable base for the continuation of discussions of those problems arising from the different positions. Analysts said, however, that Washington and Pyongyang could both dig in their heels in this US presidential election year.																								North Korea does not have to strike any agreement now, ahead of the November election in the US, said Yu Suk-ryul of Seouls Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security.																								The US has a need to avoid collapse of the talks before the election, he said.																								Chinas Li said the second round featured substantial dialogue and made a big step forward.																								The road is longer and more bumpy. But time is on our side. Time is on the side of peace, Li said.																								But there was little evidence the gulf between North Korea and the US had narrowed. In the end they settled on a chairmans summary statement instead of a joint declaration.																								 They (the Americans) havent succeeded, but they havent failed and they can always say that the process is under way, said Peter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute in Berkeley.																								North Korea, whose 11th-hour rejection of language in a proposed agreement prolonged the talks for hours and prevented the parties from signing a joint declaration, repeated its denial that it had an enriched uranium weapons programme.																								We believe the insistence of the raising of the HEU (highly enriched uranium) issue by the U.S. side is very much related to the position of the U.S. Bush administration, who based this assertion on false information, Kim Gye-gwan, head of the North Korean delegation, told reporters after the talks.																								Kim also repeated North Koreas denial that it had acquired uranium enriching know-how from Pakistan, despite a confession this month by Islamabads top nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, that he had sold nuclear secrets to Pyongyang.																								The crux of the dispute and the reason for the six-party talks is a U.S. accusation  which North Korea denies  that North Korea is pursuing a uranium enriching programme for bombs.																								The U.S. official in Beijing brushed off the denials.																								The DPRK denials are there, but seem only to result in a self-isolation, the U.S. official told reporters in Beijing.																								A Japanese diplomat said late on Friday the United States had not shown any evidence the North had such a programme.																								The U.S. official said the American goal of completely dismantling all of the Norths nuclear arms programmes had essentially been accepted by all of the participants except the DPRK. DPRK stands for the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.																								The DPRK did say and has said that it will dismantle its nuclear programmes. The devil, of course, is in the details, said the official.																								Asked about the Norths offer to give up its military nuclear programme but not its peaceful one, the official said: The problem is, I am not aware of any peaceful programmes in the DPRK.																								Japan chief negotiator Mitoji Yabunaka voiced support for the U.S. goal of a eliminating the Norths nuclear programmes, which he said were agrave threat to our country. FREEZE, INSPECTIONS																								The North wants aid and a security guarantee in return for a nuclear freeze.																								When we freeze nuclear activities I believe it will be followed by inspections. When, who and how we do the inspections will be determined in future talks, said the Norths Kim.																								The discussions took six months of tough diplomacy to pull together after an inconclusive round in Beijing in August.																								Officials in Washington said U.S. negotiators outlined a series of coordinated steps that Washington could take if the North agreed to the complete dismantling of its nuclear programmes.																								Initially, aid would come in the form of energy assistance from other parties to the talks, but the United States would be at the table, the officials said.																								A similar deal was forged between the United States and impoverished North Korea in 1994, but it fell apart in October 2002 after Washington said Pyongyang had privately admitted to the enriched uranium programme.

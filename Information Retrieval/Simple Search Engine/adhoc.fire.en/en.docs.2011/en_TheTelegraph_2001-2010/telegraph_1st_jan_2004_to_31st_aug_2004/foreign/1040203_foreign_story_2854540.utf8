The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Blair bid to calm BBC fears 
																								London, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Britains government scrambled to convince sceptics today that the appointment of the next BBC chairman would be free of its influence after a deep feud over the broadcasters reporting on the buildup to the Iraq war.																								The publicly funded broadcasters chairman Gavyn Davies and director-general Greg Dyke resigned last week after an inquiry by judge Lord Hutton lambasted the BBC for a radio report accusing the government of exaggerating the case for war.																								The culture minister said today a scrutiny team would work alongside the selection panel choosing the chairman.																								We all want a strong BBC that is independent of government, culture secretary Tessa Jowell told parliament. Whoever is chosen will be chosen fairly, freely and with the best interests of the BBC at heart, she added.																								Dyke accused Prime Minister Tony Blairs government yesterday of systematic bullying and revealed Blair had written to him personally to complain about coverage of the Iraq war.																								Jowell praised the former director general for his inspirational leadership and paid tribute to Davies. Whatever the strength of the disagreement between the government and the BBC... I want to place on record the Houses appreciation of the outstanding contribution made by Gavyn Davies, she said.

 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 US restores diplomatic presence in Tripoli
																								London, Feb. 10 (Reuters): The US, responding to Libyas change of heart on banned weapons, has restored its diplomatic presence in Tripoli after decades of hostility, Libyan and US officials said today.																								Libyas once-shunned leader Muammar Gaddafi edged further towards international acceptance with a visit to his home town by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and a promise of a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.																								Yes, Americans came to Libya to work inside the Belgian embassy in the US interests section in Libya and Libyans will go to America to work in the Libyan interests section there, Libyan foreign minister Mohamed Abderrhmane Chalgam said in London.																								A US official confirmed a diplomat had returned to the Libyan capital for the first time, but did not say when. We presently have one US diplomat in Tripoli to assist the US WMD experts, the official said.																								The US official, who asked not to be named, said other American diplomats were expected to go to Tripoli later this month. Libya, whose quest for ties with the US and its allies is driven by economic necessity, pledged in December to scrap its WMD programmes in cooperation with foreign experts.																								A state department official, who asked not to be named, said the US diplomat would remain in Tripoli for a while, but said this fell short of a permanent diplomatic presence. We have not established an official, permanent, diplomatic presence in Libya. That presumes we have a level of relations that we have not established, the official added.																								Washington recalled its last ambassador in 1980 after a mob sacked the embassy in Tripoli. Britain for talks																								British foreign secretary Jack Straw said at a news conference with Chalgam that Blair planned talks with Gaddafi as soon as convenient, but no date had been fixed. Blair earlier met Chalgam, making the first visit to Britain by a Libyan foreign minister since Gaddafi seized power in 1969. 																								Talks between Blair and Gaddafi would set the seal on Libyas reintegration, though Berlusconis meeting with the unpredictable colonel in his home town of Sirte was the first by a western leader since Tripolis December 19 weapons pledge. Berlusconi and Gaddafi were expected to discuss joint efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants from Libyan shores across the Mediterranean.

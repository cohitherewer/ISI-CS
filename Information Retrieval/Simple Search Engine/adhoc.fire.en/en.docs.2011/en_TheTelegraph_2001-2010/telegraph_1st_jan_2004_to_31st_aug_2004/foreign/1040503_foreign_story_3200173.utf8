 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Western scare in Saudi strike
																								Riyadh, May 2 (Reuters): A Western engineering firm said today it was evacuating all 90 foreign staff from the Saudi city of Yanbu after gunmen shot dead five of their colleagues.																								The US embassy urged Americans to leave the kingdom.																								There was no immediate indication if the latest attack would prompt an exodus among the 35,000 Americans  a move that could badly damage the economy of the worlds biggest oil exporter.																								Saudi Arabia has been battling a year-long insurgency by supporters of Saudi-born Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network. Yesterdays attack, the first against a vital economic facility, suggested militants were determined to act on threats to destabilise the kingdom and force Westerners out.																								Two Americans, two Britons and an Australian were killed in the shooting. The body of one victim was dragged by car through the streets of the Red Sea industrial city.																								Yanbu residents said two bearded gunmen dressed in Western clothing dragged the corpse past two local schools and residential areas, firing into the air to attract attention and yelling God is greatest.																								Look how we are dragging this American. Go inform the government about what you just saw, a teacher at one of the schools quoted a gunman as telling students and teachers. Leave your homes and wage jihad, the gunmen shouted. Security sources said the attackers were two sets of brothers from the same family  Sami, Samir, Ayman and Hani al-Ansari. 																								The gunmen killed the top three officials at an upgrade project being carried out by Swiss-based firm ABB Lummus at the Saudi petrochemical firm YANPET, jointly owned by US Exxon Mobil and Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) .																								ABB Lummus said all 90 of its expatriate staff and around 30 dependents were being evacuated from Yanbu.

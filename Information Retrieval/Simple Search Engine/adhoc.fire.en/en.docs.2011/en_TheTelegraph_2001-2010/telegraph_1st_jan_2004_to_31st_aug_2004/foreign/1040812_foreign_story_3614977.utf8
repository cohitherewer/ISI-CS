The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 London congestion toll to spread reach
																								London, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Londons controversial road congestion charge scheme already covering about half the city centre is set to double in size within the next two years under plans put forward by the capitals mayor today.																								The scheme  the biggest in the world  was launched in February 2003 to applause from environmentalists and brickbats from local businesses.																								Drivers entering a zone stretching from Hyde Park to Tower Bridge pay 5 a day from 0700 to 1830 on weekdays.																								Mayor Ken Livingstones plan will extend the boundary westwards as far as Earls Court by late 2006. 																								The new zone will take in the prosperous residential areas of Notting Hill, Kensington and Chelsea  including most foreign embassies and major retailers like Harrods and Harvey Nichols.																								Kensington and Chelsea council immediately protested, saying the plan ignored wide public consultations earlier this year in which two-thirds of respondents rejected an extension.																								This really is staggering. When the Tube (London Underground) is falling apart he wants to chuck 120 million at a money-losing congestion charging scheme, the council said in a statement.																								 The existing scheme raised some 70 million in its first year, about half of what was expected. 																								Major retail chain the John Lewis Partnership also expressed severe disappointment at news of the extension, saying trade in the existing zone had been hit hard since it came into force 18 months ago and was only now starting to recover.																								In the first year of the scheme, traffic in the 21 square-km zone dropped some 16 per cent against expectations of a drop of 10 per cent.																								But in doing so it fell well short of its own projected budget and provoked open revolt from businesses who said their takings had been torpedoed as shoppers shifted allegiance to areas outside the zone.																								On the other hand, evironmental groups and the citys cyclists and bus users all breathed huge sighs of relief that the roads  and the air  were much clearer. 																								Even motorists paying the charge grudgingly agreed their journey times had been reduced  although road hauliers disagreed, saying they had noticed little change.

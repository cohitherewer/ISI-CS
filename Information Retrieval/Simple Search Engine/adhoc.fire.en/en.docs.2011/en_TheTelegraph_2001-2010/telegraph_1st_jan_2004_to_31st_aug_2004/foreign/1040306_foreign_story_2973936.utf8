 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Straw visits madarsas
				 	 British foreign secretary Jack Straw (centre) listens to a student recite from the Quran at an Islamic school in Peshawar. (Reuters) 																								Peshawar, March 5 (Reuters): Britains foreign secretary visited an Islamic school in conservative northwestern Pakistan today and said later that followers of the worlds great religions need to understand each other better.																								Jack Straw watched attentively as young male students sat cross-legged, rocking back and forth, while reciting Quranic verses at the Centre for Islamic Education in Peshawar. Told by administrator Ataul Haq that the madarsas did not harbour terrorism, Straw laughed and said he had never made such an accusation. But Haq said this was the impression Muslims believed was held in the West.																								I understand that, Straw said, later adding: We are all victims of terrorism.																								An estimated 6,000 to 7,000 madarsas in Pakistan provide board, lodging and religious instruction for about 1.5 million students drawn mainly from poor families. Critics see them as hotbeds of Islamic extremism and breeding grounds for terrorists, and the US has provided tens of millions of dollars to help reform the system.																								Earlier this year, President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged that progress had been slow on his governments pledge to reform the schools by registering them and controlling their funding.																								Straw, whose Blackburn constituency in England is home to 25,000 Muslims, left with a gift of a copy of the Quran translated into English.

 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Khamenei asks hawks to review candidate ban
				 	 Iranian President Mohammad Khatami (centre) and Speaker Mehdi Karroubi (in white turban) with reformist MPs at the parliament in Tehran. (AFP)																								Tehran, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today called on a hardline body to review the cases of thousands of candidates barred from standing for parliamentary elections, state television reported.																								Khamenei, whose intervention could defuse a political standoff that has prompted dozens of top reformist officials to threaten to resign, also said incumbent deputies should not have been disqualified unless there was solid proof against them.																								There are legal methods and the Guardian Council has enough time to review the cases carefully... to prevent the violation of anyones rights, state television quoted Khamenei as saying in a meeting with Guardian Council members.																								Those who have been qualified before should be qualified (now) unless the contrary can be proved, he added.																								The Guardian Council, a hardline constitutional watchdog under the direct control of Khamenei, has disqualified nearly half of 8,200 candidates for the February 20 vote.																								The vast majority of those vetoed are reformist allies of President Mohammad Khatami, including more than 80 of parliaments current 290 lawmakers.																								Around 80 MPs today rebuffed an appeal by Khatami to suspend a four-day-old sit-in protest at parliament. Its natural for us to continue because we havent achieved our demands yet, Mohammad Reza Khatami, younger brother of the President and deputy speaker of parliament, said.																								The decision to extend the protest was a further blow to the weakened authority of Khatami, who is also under pressure from cabinet colleagues and state governors to adopt a firmer stance  and to resign, with them, if the bans are not rescinded.																								Another MP said: Khatami didnt have a winning card to offer us. He just wanted us to end the sit-in and see what happens next, which wasnt acceptable to us. He said deputies did not believe Khatami would resign over the crisis, and might urge him to postpone the election if the Guardian Council did not back down.																								Even close allies of Khatami, who swept to office in 1997 promising to promote civil rights and the rule of law, criticise him for failing to stand up to hardliners in the judiciary and Guardian Council who have blocked most of his reforms. 																								Hardliners fear reformist causes such as a free press, free speech and womens rights will undermine the system of clerical rule in place since Irans 1979 Islamic revolution. 																								Reformers say they do not want to dismantle clerical rule  only to place more emphasis on the law and citizens rights.																								But many ordinary Iranians have already lost faith in Khatamis ability to overcome conservative resistance, and the public have shown no sign of rallying to the reformists cause.																								Irans most important pro-reform student body, the Office to Consolidate Unity (OCU), today said the hardline move to bar thousands of candidates proved the upcoming vote is an appointment disguised as an election. In a statement faxed to Reuters the OCU warned protesting reformists that hardliners may try to split them by reinstating some of their candidacies while barring others from the race. It said the political crisis was the last golden opportunity for reformists and if they miss that opportunity... the publics minimal trust in the reform movement would fade away.																								Analysts say the disqualification of candidates was a crude attempt by hardliners to prevent a repeat of the 2000 election.

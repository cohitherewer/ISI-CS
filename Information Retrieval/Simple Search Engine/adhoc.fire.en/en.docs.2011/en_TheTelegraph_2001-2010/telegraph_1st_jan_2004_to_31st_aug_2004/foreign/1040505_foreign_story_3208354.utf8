 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Pak clears blast cloud with China nuke deal
																								Islamabad, May 4 (Reuters): Pakistan and China signed a deal today to build a new nuclear power plant, underlining economic cooperation between the longtime allies a day after a car bomb killed three Chinese technicians in southern Pakistan.																								Officials from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and the China National Nuclear Corporation participated in the signing ceremony, witnessed by Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali, in an agreement experts valued at around $600 million.																								With the signing of the C-2 (Chashma-2) project, PAEC has achieved yet another landmark and this project will be an important milestone in historical relations between Pakistan and China, a statement distributed at the ceremony said.																								Pakistan will be keen to underline close ties with China following the attack at Gawadar port, which Islamabad saw as a strike at the heart of investor confidence and its broader economic interests.																								A car bomb was triggered by remote control as a minivan carrying 12 Chinese and two Pakistanis passed by. Besides the three dead, nine Chinese and two Pakistanis were wounded.																								Pakistani security forces today detained and questioned 13 suspects in the southern port of Gawadar. Reports said police traced details of the van used by suspected militants to carry out the attack with a remote controlled device.																								A red alert has also been issued at airports across the country. 																								Initial suspicions in the bombing focused on Islamic militants opposed to Pakistans support for the US-ledwar on terror or on Baluchistan nationalists angry at being sidelined from the development project.																								More than 300 Chinese nationals are working to turn Gawadar into a deep sea port and major trading hub, and China is providing $198 million of the $248 million project costs.																								The statement said the second nuclear plant to be built by China at Chashma was for peaceful use only, after a nuclear proliferation scandal involving a top Pakistani scientist set alarm bells ringing over the safety of the countrys atomic programme.																								The new power plant will be built at Chashma, on the banks of the Indus river, 280 km south of Islamabad and beside the first plant China helped to build. It will have a capacity of 300 megawatts and take more than six years to complete. 																								The first Chashma nuclear installation was built in 1999 and connected to the national power grid early in 2000. 																								Pakistan vowed to go nuclear after India exploded its first nuclear device in 1974.

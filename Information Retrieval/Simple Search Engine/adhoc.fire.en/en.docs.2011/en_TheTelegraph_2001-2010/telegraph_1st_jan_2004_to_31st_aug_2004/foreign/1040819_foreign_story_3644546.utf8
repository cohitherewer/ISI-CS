The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Rush for free mobile connections
																								Islamabad, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of Pakistanis endured hours of stifling heat this week to accept an offer of free mobile phone connections, a sign of the pent-up demand in a country where cellphone usage has remained low.																								But that may soon change. While only about 4.5 million of Pakistans 150 million people currently have mobile phones, industry executives say fierce competition and cheaper technologies are forcing prices down to eye-catching levels.																								From Saturday to Tuesday, customers thronged state-owned Ufone company offices across the country in response to an offer to save 1,000 rupees ($17) in connection charges.																								It does not sound too much, but it is a saving of a thousand rupees, said Khisar Ali Shah, a resident in Islamabad. I am here because the connection is free.																								Ufone, a wholly owned subsidiary of state-run Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd, is one of Pakistans four cellular mobile companies. Mobilink, the market leader run by Egypt-based regional telephone operator Orascom Telecom, says it is hoping to increase its customer base to four million by 2005 from slightly above three million.

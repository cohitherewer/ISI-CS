(AFP, Reuters) 																								Manila, July 16 (Reuters): The Philippines defied the US and began to pull its troops out of Iraq today, bowing to the demands of militants holding a Filipino hostage and risking souring relations with its key ally and trading partner.																								The move brought harsh criticism from Australia, another US ally in the region, but words of support from Muslim Malaysia. Philippine foreign Affairs Secretary Delia Albert said in a televised broadcast that 11 soldiers, including the head of the 51-member humanitarian contingent, would leave Iraq today to save the life of a Filipino held hostage there by gunmen.																								A videotaped message aired late yesterday showed hostage Angelo de la Cruz alive, looking well and saying he would be home soon. Another message from his captors said he would only be freed after Manila kept its word to withdraw all its troops.																								The Philippine government has recalled the head of the Philippine humanitarian contingent in Iraq. He is leaving Iraq today with 10 members of the Philippine humanitarian contingent, Albert said.																								The rest of the members of the contingent will be out of Iraq shortly. The troops had been scheduled to leave on August 20.																								Contingent commander Brigadier General Jovito Palparan would leave Iraq at 1300 GMT today, Albert said later.																								The 10 other soldiers began their journey out of Iraq bound for Kuwait earlier in the day and will fly from Kuwait to Manila on a commercial flight. A source at Manilas international airport said the soldiers would arrive on Monday.																								Relatives of the hostage who have been on a rollercoaster ride of emotions since his kidnapping last week and subsequent false reports of release, urged Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo today to stick to the pullout plan.																								Set him free. We have faith in President Arroyo, said the hostages younger brother Francisco de la Cruz in the familys home village north of Manila today.																								In Buenavista, villagers were preparing a homecoming for the father of eight. Men set up a big tent and posted signs to de la Cruzs house. The area was decked out with yellow ribbons.																								Despite the mounting pressure at home and abroad, Arroyo has remained silent on her countrys decision to meet the demands of hostage-takers, and on the criticism from allies.																								I dont want to be harsh on a friend but... its a mistake and it wont buy them immunity, Australian Prime Minister John Howard told Australian radio.																								Japan issued a statement urging Manila to stand up to the kidnappers. But Muslim Malaysia was much more conciliatory.																								Its a sovereign decision. I think they have taken into account what they need to take into account, foreign minister Syed Hamid Albar said after a meeting with Albert in Manila.																								The US has expressed disappointment at the withdrawal plans and warned Manila to remember who its friends are.																								Some analysts say the pull-out will severely strain Manilas relations with Washington, costing it millions of dollars of vital US aid and damaging the governments credibility abroad.																								Opportunities for participating in the reconstruction of Iraq are now lost, said AB Capital economic analyst Jose Vistan. Another concern is how the US, the countrys largest trading partner, would react to the pull-out in terms of investments and aid.																								Foreign affairs secretary Albert sidestepped reporters questions about the relationship with the US, but others were quick to insist ties remained strong.																								We have always been strong allies and we believe that this situation will remain, presidential spokesman Ignacio Bunye said in a television interview.																								Roberto Romulo, chairman of the Philippines taskforce for the reconstruction of Iraq, said: We are a member of the coalition of the willing. We have been since the beginning.

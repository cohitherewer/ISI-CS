(AFP)																								Colombo, April 10 (Reuters): Sri Lankas east remained volatile today with unconfirmed reports of fresh clashes between rival Tamil Tiger factions, a day after the worst fighting since a two-year truce halted the islands civil war.																								Officials said the death toll in yesterdays violence could be triple initial reports, and thousands of frightened civilians were holed up in schools after fleeing the clashes the government said were a violation of the February 2002 ceasefire.																								Fighting began again a short while ago about 16 km north of Valaichchenai, said Agnes Bragadottir, spokeswoman for the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, referring to a town in the eastern district of Batticaloa, about 220 km east of Colombo. But an army official in Valaichchenai said he could not confirm the report.																								We cant give a strong no, but we dont hear any firing or see anything unusual, he said.																								Military spokesman Colonel Sumedha Perera said the area had been calm overnight but that thousands of civilians had crossed into government-controlled areas, including about 350 children under five.																								Sri lankan security forces have been ordered to restore law and order in the islands east even as the new government said it will take up with peace broker Norway the issue of the internecine war because it was violation of an Oslo-arranged truce.																								The fighting had caused civilian casualties, the defence ministry said in a statement.																								The President directed the chief of defence staff and service commanders to visit the area and take all necessary steps to enforce law and order, it said.																								It was not immediately clear how security forces would move to restore law and order as the rebel fighting was concentrated in an area where government forces have no control. 																								However, the defence ministry said peace broker Norway will be informed of the intense fighting with a complaint that the outbreak of hostilities was a violation of the truce that is in force since February 2002.																								It is intended to inform the Norwegian facilitators to convey to the LTTE that this is a violation of the ceasefire agreement and the government expects to take up this issue with the ltte leadership, the statement said.																								Reports yesterday said eight fighters and an ambulance driver had died in the clashes, but a spokesman for breakaway eastern commander Karuna said there were 10 dead on their side and officials said the main Tiger group could have lost 15-20.																								Karuna  the nom de guerre for eastern rebel commander V. Muralitharan  broke from the Tigers in early March with about 6,000 of their 15,000 troops.																								That party launched the attack, Karunas spokesman, Varathan, said, referring to the northern-based LTTE.																								We have recovered 10 dead bodies, but we have no idea of the casualties on their side. We are re-organising our teams.																								Military sources said Karunas group had retreated south of a major east-west road controlled by the government leaving the northern troops on the other side  a worry for the army, which does not want to get caught up in the conflict.																								The main LTTE group does not take its wounded to hospitals in government areas, so officials said there was no firm estimate as to the number of casualties but from the types of heavy weapons fire exchanged they could be high. A defence ministry statement said only that there had been several casualties.																								President Chandrika Kumaratunga told US secretary of state Colin Powell she would move to restart talks after next weeks local New Year holidays and would not let the split in the Tigers stand in the way, but it is difficult to see how that would work in practice.																								The Tigers consider themselves the sole representatives of the Tamil people and when Karuna broke away it was a major blow to their internal discipline.																								The Tigers, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil state, are known to brook no dissent and have vowed to get rid of Karuna from our soil.																								Two Sri Lankan youths, who fled the island nation not willing to be trapped in the clash between the two LTTE groups, were arrested by the coastal police in Rameswaram island under the Foreigners Act today, police said. 																								The youths Pradeepan (18) and Ganeswaran (19) had fled on the advice of their parents from Vavuniya and Killinochchi areas where clashes had peaked in the last two days.																								The police said the youths were arrested after they were found roaming around aimlessly in the island. They were later handed over to the Mandapam police who arrested them under the Foreigners Act and remanded them to custody. The arrival of the youths was an indication of the situation in Sri Lanka.

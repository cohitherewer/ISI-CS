 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Sharon survives no-trust vote
																								Jerusalem, July 12 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon survived a no-confidence vote in parliament today although the Opposition, in an embarrassing blow to his political prestige, tied him in the ballot.																								The final tally on the no-confidence motion on the governments economic policy ended 55-55, short of the 61 votes the Opposition needed to topple Sharons shaky coalition government in the 120-seat parliament.																								A first count showed a one-vote majority in favour of the no-confidence motion, but parliament speaker Reuven Rivlin said that was wrong due to a problem with the electronic voting system.																								Todays ballot illustrated how vulnerable Sharons Rightist coalition has become after far-Right defections last month in protest against his plan to withdraw from Gaza cost him his parliamentary majority.																								Earlier today, Sharon won agreement from veteran Opposition leader Shimon Peres to try to forge a unity government that could push through the Gaza Strip pullout.																								But Peres Centre-Left Labour Party went ahead anyway with sponsorship of one of the no-confidence motions. Confidence votes have recently taken place on a nearly weekly basis in the Israeli Knesset, or parliament, and Sharon has yet to be harmed by any of them.																								Sharon faced three no-confidence motions today, tying on one and beating back the other two.

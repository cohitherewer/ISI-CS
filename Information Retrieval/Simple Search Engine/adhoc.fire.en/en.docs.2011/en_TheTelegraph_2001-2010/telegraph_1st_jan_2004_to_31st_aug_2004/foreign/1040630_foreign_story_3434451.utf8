 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Father of beheaded American attacks Bush
 AMIT ROY				 	 Michael Berg																								London, June 29: The father of Nick Berg, the 26-year-old American who was beheaded by his kidnappers in Iraq, today appeared at a surprise news conference in London to lend his passionate support to the Stop the War Coalition and to condemn the policies pursued by President Bush and Tony Blair.																								The comments by Michael Berg, 59, come a day after the transfer of power to an interim government in Iraq but the move was dismissed as mere window dressing. Opinion polls show Blair has lost so much support among the electorate that many in the Labour Party now consider him an electoral liability and want him replaced by Gordon Brown before the general election next year.																								 While Bergs tirade will be taken as the reaction of a grieving father, Blair and Bush could have done without his opposition. Nick Berg, who ran his own communications business, was decapitated by Iraqi militants last month, after being kidnapped in Baghdad. Three days after his headless body was discovered, a horrific video tape of the execution was posted on an al Qaida-related website.																								The young man was described by his family as an idealistic adventurer who had gone to Iraq to offer whatever help he could but this had led a difference of opinion with his father. The pair had agreed to disagree over Iraq and respected each others views, his anguished father said today.																								Berg Senior, a retired teacher from Westchester, Philadelphia, said: This transfer of power is nothing more than another nut and shell game (PR exercise) of the Bush and Blair coalition. We know that the Iraqi people have not had an election yet and so we do not have a democracy over there, we just have a dictatorship of Bush and Blair.																								 He said his son of 26 was a grown man and could not be stopped from going to Iraq. But he would never get over the pain of losing his son and accused both President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, the American defence secretary, of being callous.																								People like George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, they do not see the pain that people have to bear, they do not know what it feels like to have your guts ripped out, he said. Berg added that he had received thousands of letters, emails and telephone calls from people expressing sympathy over his sons death.																								 He estimated that more than 11,000 Iraqis had also lost their lives either through American bombs or through instability, and each one of their families had been affected in exactly the same way as he had been by his sons death, he told the news conference.																								 Berg is expected to be a guest speaker at the Stop The War Coalition demonstration tomorrow in Parliament Square right opposite the Houses of Parliament.																								 Blair has stuck to his line he and Bush were right to go to war and that eventually a better post-Saddam Iraq will emerge.																								 However, many Labour MPs who loyally sided with Blair when the crucial Commons vote to go to war was taken last year now fear they could lose their seats at the next election. They want Blair dumped and replaced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer but the Prime Minister has given no sign he is willing to step down.

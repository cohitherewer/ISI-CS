The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Sunday not for sports
				 	 Prayer power : Pope John Paul 																								Vatican City, March 26 (Reuters): Pope John Paul today said Sunday should be a day for God, not for secular diversions like entertainment and sports.																								When Sunday loses its fundamental meaning and becomes subordinate to a secular concept of weekend dominated by such things as entertainment and sport, people stay locked within a horizon so narrow that they can no longer see the heavens, the pontiff said in a speech to Australian bishops.																								The 83-year-old pope also encouraged Christians, especially young people, to remain faithful to Sunday Mass.

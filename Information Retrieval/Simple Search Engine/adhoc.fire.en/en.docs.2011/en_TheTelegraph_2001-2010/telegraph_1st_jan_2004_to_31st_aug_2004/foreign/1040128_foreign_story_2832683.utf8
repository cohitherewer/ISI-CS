 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 KFC takes the C out, replaces it with fish
																								Bangkok, Jan. 27 (Reuters): The bird flu rampaging across Asia, killing chickens and humans alike, is starting to take the C out of KFC.																								In Vietnam, the US fast food chain known for its fried chicken said today it had closed almost all its outlets while it switched to a fish menu, as customers were unwilling to tuck in to chicken.																								Eight KFC restaurants were shut yesterday in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnams commercial centre, which has banned the sale of poultry and culled more than two million chickens. It has been very hard for us, Nguyen Chi Kien, KFCs Vietnam deputy country director, said.																								In Bangkok, normally busy KFC restaurants were almost empty at lunchtime, even though health officials said well-cooked meat represented no risk. Shares in KFCs Malaysian franchisee fell.																								KFCs website says that out of 12,500 outlets globally it has more than 3,000 restaurants in Asia, around one third of those being in Japan. There are more than 900 outlets in China and Hong Kong, while Thailand and Malaysia account for just over 300 each. Kien said KFC would reopen its Vietnamese restaurants at the end of this week, offering fish burgers. Chicken has also disappeared from posh restaurants, hotels and homes in big cities in the Southeast Asian nation but is still widely available at street stalls.

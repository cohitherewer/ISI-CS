 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 China denies flu cover-up 
				 	 A farm worker vaccinates a chick at a poultry farm in Bogor, Indonesia. (AFP)																								Bangkok, Jan. 29 (Reuters): China, accused of deceiving the world over Sars, denied today a similar cover-up that allowed the bird flu scourge to sweep across Asia.																								Chinas foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said the accusation made in the British weekly New Scientist is completely inaccurate, is without proof and moreover does not respect science. 																								The New Scientist report quoted experts as saying they suspected the new strain of bird flu, which could be a greater threat than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, also began in China, probably in the first half of 2003. A combination of official cover-up and questionable farming practices allowed it to turn into the epidemic now under way, the weekly magazine said.																								The magazine said a decision by Chinas poultry producers to vaccinate birds after an outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 may have been a mistake and could have contributed to the current problem. Hong Kong conducted a mass slaughter of chickens when the H5N1 bird flu killed six people. 																								To protect their poultry Chinese producers later vaccinated them with an inactivated H5N1 virus. Health officials fear the H5N1 avian flu virus might mix with human influenza and unleash a pandemic among people with no immunity to it. So far, there is no sign of people-to-people transmission. 																								We are aware of samples taken early last year that turned out to be this strain exactly, Klaus Stohr of the WHO said.																								Although Stohr would not say where the early samples came from, New Scientist said comments from other experts suggested China was the origin.

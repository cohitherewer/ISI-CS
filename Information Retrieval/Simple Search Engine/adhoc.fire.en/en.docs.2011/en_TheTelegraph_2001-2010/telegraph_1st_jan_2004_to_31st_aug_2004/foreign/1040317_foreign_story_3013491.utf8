Susan Lindauer leaves a court after her indictment in New York. Lindauer was charged with spying for Iraqi Intelligence and taking $15,000 in payment for her efforts. (AFP)																								Baghdad, March 16 (Reuters): A year after US and British troops invaded Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein, the majority of Iraqis say life is better than it was under the former dictator, according to results of an extensive poll released today.																								But many have little faith in occupying troops and the US-led administration  and nearly one in five say attacks on foreign soldiers in Iraq are justified.																								Asked whether their lives were better now than in the spring of 2003, nearly six in ten Iraqis said the situation was somewhat better or much better than it was, according to the survey of 2,500 people conducted for a group of broadcasting organisations by Oxford Research International.																								Those responses are likely to come as a positive surprise for coalition forces and the US-led administration in Iraq as they continue to grapple with a determined guerrilla insurgency and widespread social problems a year after Saddams fall. Iraqis often complain about a lack of security, the scarcity of jobs and their fears for the future, but the survey suggests that despite this, most feel life has improved.																								Asked how things were going in their lives these days, seven in 10 said the situation was very good or quite good, and only 15 per cent said things were very bad. Looking ahead, 71 per cent said they expected conditions in their lives to be much better or somewhat better a year from now. But there are grievances and inconsistencies in the way Iraqis feel 12 months after Saddam.																								One of their chief complaints is about the effectiveness and continued presence of US, and British forces in Iraq.																								While half of those questioned believe the invasion was the right thing to do, compared with 39 per cent who said it was wrong, more than four in 10 said they had no confidence whatsoever in US and British occupation troops, and 51 per cent oppose the presence of coalition forces in Iraq.																								That said, Iraqis generally appear to want occupation forces to stay at least until security is restored and an Iraqi government is in place. Only 15 per cent say they should leave now. 																								An Iraqi government is due to take power from July 1 this year, but it is likely to be many more months before security is restored. US and British troops have made plans to maintain a presence in Iraq till the end of 2005. As well as doubts about the ability of foreign troops to restore security Iraqis also have concerns about the capability of the US-led administration.

 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Incurious George revives a rare word
Los Angeles, April 17 (Reuters): Incurious, a rarely used word, is making a curious comeback as pundits dust it off to describe President George W. Bushs alleged lack of curiosity about intelligence reports prior to September 11, 2001, according to a California language expert.																								Paul JJ Payack, founder of the Global Language Monitor, which tracks word usage on the web and elsewhere, said that since he first spotted it used in a March Time magazine report, it had appeared some 5,000 times, jumping about 1,000 uses after the New York Times lead editorial on Thursday was headlined: The Price of Incuriosity.																								Americans knew George W. Bush was incurious man when they elected him, but the hearings of the 9/11 commission, which turned yesterday (Wednesday) from the FBIs fecklessness to the CIAs blurred vision, have brought that fact home in a startling way, the Times said.																								The Times then went on to criticise the President for not seeming to show enough curiosity about a CIA briefing entitled: Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US.																								Other newspapers and several columnists have also used incurious, a word Payack says made its first appearance in the 16th century, to describe the President. Part of the reason may lie in its having a punning quality  calling the President Incurious George in headlines conjures up visions of the popular childrens book monkey Curious George.																								Payack said the term incuriosity has rocketed to the top of the Global Language Monitors PQ (Political-sensitivity Quotient) Index, which is an algorithm that tracks politically sensitive words and phrases in the media. Incuriosity is followed by quagmire, two Americas, global outsourcing and war for oil on the Global Monitor list of most popular political phrases.

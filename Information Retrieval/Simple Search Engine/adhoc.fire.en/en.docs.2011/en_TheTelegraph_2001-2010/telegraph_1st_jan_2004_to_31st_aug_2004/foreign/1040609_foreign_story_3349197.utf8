 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Fistfights in Lanka House cloud peace prospects

(AFP)																								Colombo, June 8 (Reuters): Sri Lankas parliament reopened to fistfights today, casting fresh doubts on the minority governments ability to pass legislation and provide the stability needed to pursue peace with Tamil rebels.																								It was only the fourth meeting of parliament since President Chandrika Kumaratungas United Peoples Freedom Alliance won elections on April 2, and caps a series of sessions in which political bickering has prevented the tabling of legislation.																								It means theyre not interested in the manifesto. Their priorities are much more with ensuring they get a stable majority, said constitutional lawyer Rohan Edrisinha, referring to the Freedom Alliance.																								The alliance  itself a fractious coalition  has been battling for support from the Opposition to strengthen its hand after the election left it eight seats shy a majority in the 225-seat House.																								The chaos also complicates peace efforts, underscoring the feeling among the Tamil Tiger rebels that discussing a final settlement to end the 20-year civil war is futile in the absence of a government strong enough to pass constitutional changes an agreement would require.																								Kumaratunga has herself been handling the bid to end 20 years of civil war, bypassing her divided party, but she and the Tigers have been unable to agree an agenda to restart stalled talks.																								The government wants talks to address a final settlement to the war, but the LTTE insist they be based on their interim power-sharing proposal. Todays chaos only adds to the sense of stalemate.																								Parliament descended into mayhem when the speaker tried to swear in a new member whose seat is subject to a court case, with more than 20 members swarming the floor, hitting each other and someone stealing the mace, the ceremonial staff that indicates the chamber is in session.																								The House was then adjourned until July 20, leaving a six-week gap before the legislative branch will convene again.																								Basically all the existing laws will be in force and the government will function without lawmaking, said Edrisinha.																								Media have speculated the Ceylon Workers Congress  which has eight seats  might cross the floor after local elections in mid-July, giving the Freedom Alliance the majority it needs to settle down to more stable governance. Currency sinks																								The Sri Lankan rupee sank to its lowest level ever against the US dollar today, the Central Bank said, amid fears that the countrys civil war could resume. 																								The dollar bought 100.13 rupees in afternoon trading, rising from 99.32 earlier in the day and above the psychologically important 100 rupee mark, the Central Bank said.

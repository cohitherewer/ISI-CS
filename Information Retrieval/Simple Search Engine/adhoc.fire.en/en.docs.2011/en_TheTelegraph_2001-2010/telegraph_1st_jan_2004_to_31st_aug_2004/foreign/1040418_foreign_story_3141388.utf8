 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Top Hamas leader killed in Israel copter strike
				 	 Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi																								Gaza, April 17 (Reuters): An Israeli helicopter missile strike on a car in Gaza City killed top Hamas leader Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi today, Hamas sources and medics said.																								Witnesses said two of Rantissis bodyguards were also killed in the attack in which two missiles were fired.																								Medics said Rantissi, 56, Hamas leader in the militant groups Gaza Strip stronghold, had been rushed to a Gaza City hospital in critical condition after the attack. Sources said he had been wounded in the head with shrapnel. Hundreds of Hamas members and supporters flooded to the hospital after news of the Israeli raid.																								A crowd of Palestinians swarmed around the wreck of the white car, pulling out what appeared to be fragments of clothing. 																								Hamas, which has been behind scores of suicide attacks against Israel in the three-and-a-half-year-old Palestinian uprising and has pledged to destroy the Jewish state, issued an immediate vow of revenge.																								Israel will regret this. Revenge is coming, said a senior Hamas leader at the hospital.																								This blood will not be wasted. It is our fate in Hamas and it is our fate as Palestinians to die as martyrs. The battle will not weaken our determination or break our will, Ismail Haniya said.																								The air strike occurred hours after an Israeli border policeman was killed by a Palestinian suicide bomber at the Erez crossing on the Israeli-Gaza border.																								The killing of Rantissi occurred against the backdrop of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon winning US backing for a unilateral Gaza pullout plan.																								Palestinian anger has mounted over US President George W. Bushs related decision this week to allow Israel to keep some parts of the West Bank.																								We condemn in the strongest possible terms this Israeli crime and state terror, said a senior member of Palestinian President Yasser Arafats Palestinian Authority. It is evident now to the world that the Palestinian people need international protection more than ever, cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said.																								No immediate comment was available from Israel on the helicopter strike. Rantissi, a co-founder of Hamas, had become one of its two main leaders since Israels killing of Hamas spiritual head Ahmed Yassin in Gaza on March 22. Israel has been vowing to kill leaders of Hamas because of its attacks against the Jewish state. 																								It tried to kill Rantissi, public face of a Palestinian militant group that normally stays in the shadows, last June.																								On that occasion he and his teenage son were wounded in an Israeli helicopter missile strike on his car, also in Gaza City.																								Rantissi had refused to go into hiding like many of his comrades on Israels wanted list since Hamas launched a suicide bombing campaign to spearhead the Palestinian uprising.																								He had long depicted himself as a Hamas politician with no links to the military wing.																								But Israel had refused to accept the distinction, accusing him of being a top decision-maker on attacks and of using his media role to incite violence.																								With Rantissi filling the role of Hamas spokesman, camera crews from around the world have trooped to his modestly furnished living room to hear him issue vows of revenge, often in calm, even tones, for Israels killing of militants.

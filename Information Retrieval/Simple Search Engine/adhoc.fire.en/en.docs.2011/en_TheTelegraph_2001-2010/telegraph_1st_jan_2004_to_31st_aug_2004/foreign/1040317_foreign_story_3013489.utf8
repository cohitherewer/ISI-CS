 ALEX SPILLIUS																								Singapore, March 16: Singapore is to lift the ban on chewing gum that has epitomised its pedantic and overbearing style, but only for those trying to stop smoking.																								From Thursday the city-state will allow the sale of a nicotine gum as part of a compromise forced by a free trade agreement with its close ally America.																								Singapore agreed last year to drop its 12-year ban on gum to allow the sale of brands that its health authorities deemed therapeutic. So far only one brand has been approved. Pfizer, the manufacturer, is planning to send senior executives to launch the gum.																								The ban was originally imposed because of complaints that discarded gum was fouling pavements, buildings and buses.																								It has been accompanied by campaigns for tidier use of public toilets, urine detectors in council flat lifts and fines for stubbing out cigarettes on the pavement. 																								The island has recently tried to lessen its strait-laced image by allowing dancing on bar tops and bungee jumping, and by extending licensing hours and promoting the arts. But it remains a place where free speech is very hard to come by.																								The gum reforms followed pressure by Philip Crane, a US congressman representing Chicago, where the Wrigley chewing gum company is based, to open the Singapore market.																								Singapore will tighten environmental regulations in 2006 to meet a European air pollution standard that would sharply reduce dangerous fuel emissions, a government official said.

 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Publishers axe new books to focus on big names 
 MATT BORN AND SALLY POOK				 	 Madonna																								London, Jan. 5: Publishers are reducing the number of books they release to concentrate on big name authors or good-looking first-time novelists who are more marketable.																								Research by The Bookseller magazine has found that leading publishers are set to cut new adult titles by up to 20 per cent over the next three years to try to boost profits.																								Choice will be sharply reduced and it is feared that off-beat authors and wild-card hits will be ignored or missed.																								One literary agent said it would mean the end of the literary apprenticeship which enabled authors such as Philip Pullman to publish several novels before becoming international best-sellers. Louis de Bernieres would never have written Captain Corellis Mandolin if he were starting out now, the agent was quoted as saying.																								In contrast, Madonnas first book, The English Roses, became the largest childrens book release in publishing history with a first printing of 1 million copies. Set in London, The English Roses is a moralistic tale about the importance of compassion and friendship through the story of four little girls.																								The Bookseller, the trade journal, said HarperCollins, Britains fourth biggest publisher, planned to cut the number of its new titles each year by about 20 per cent by 2006. 																								Time Warner has nearly halved its list in the past four years and Pan Macmillan will cut new titles by seven per cent this year.																								Established authors are also likely to suffer. Literary agents said careers had become a lot shorter now as publishers sought immediate returns on their investments.																								Rose Tremain, author of Restoration, Music and Silence, and The Way I Found Her, said yesterday: Bookshops are overwhelmed. Too much is produced and a titles shelf life is becoming shorter.																								Focusing on quality and seriousness, rather than casting around helplessly for the next great idea, has to be a good thing. But it has to be done in a careful way. Tremain said it was likely publishers would target the mid list  authors who have a small but loyal following but have never had a best-seller. Restoration was considered my breakthrough, but without that, I may well have been dropped by my publishers.																								A novelist who left Random House after a row over the marketing of her book, said: Its rather disconcerting as a writer to have your work labelled as commercial fiction or literary fiction. 																								If your book doesnt fit neatly into one genre or another the publishers get very nervous and dont support it. Publishers blame the cutbacks on book chains such as Waterstones, Books Etc and W H Smith. 																								In particular they cite the increased importance and cost of the retailers promotions.																								David North, managing director of Pan, said: If books dont make it into promotions they have little or no support and competition for those slots is getting stronger.																								The Bookseller warned the industry that narrowing of ambition would be shortsighted. If the chain booksellers do not fulfil the demands of discerning readers, the market will punish them.

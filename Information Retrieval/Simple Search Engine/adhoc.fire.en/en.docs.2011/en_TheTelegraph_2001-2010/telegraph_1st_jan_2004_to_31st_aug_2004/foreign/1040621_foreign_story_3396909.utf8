 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Allen steps out of New York
 MATT BORN				 	 Woody Allen (top) and Kate Winslet: Blend in BritainLondon, June 20: He is as synonymous with New York as the Statue of Liberty or Macys department store.																								But Woody Allen is about to bring his unique brand of neurotic humour to Britain, with his first film made entirely outside his home city. Kate Winslet is due to star in the 8-million film, which is being part-funded by the BBC. She will appear with Emily Mortimer and Jonathan Rhys Meyers in what is believed will be a wholly British cast.																								Filmed on location in London, it will be the first time in Allens 33-year career that he has made a movie that does not feature New York. Although the plot is being kept secret it is believed the story will be set in the capitals high society.																								The writer and director, whose films such as Manhattan, Bullets over Broadway and New York Stories, are often described as being as much about New York as the characters in it, said he was looking forward to working in London. I have a great admiration for English actors and actresses and have used them at every opportunity over the years, but now I wont have to import them to New York, he told Variety.																								My family and I love the idea of spending the summer in London. I only hope I can live up to the high standards of British movies I grew up with.																								Allen has used a number of leading British stars in previous films, including Michael Caine, Tracey Ullman, Samantha Morton and Helena Bonham Carter. The film  known only as the Woody Allen Summer Project  will be shot in London during July and August. It is expected to be darker than his more recent offerings, such as Small Town Crooks and Mighty Aphrodite, which have been criticised for being too whimsical and lightweight.																								David Thompson, the head of BBC films, said the BBC was investing a significant sum  at least by our standards in the project.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

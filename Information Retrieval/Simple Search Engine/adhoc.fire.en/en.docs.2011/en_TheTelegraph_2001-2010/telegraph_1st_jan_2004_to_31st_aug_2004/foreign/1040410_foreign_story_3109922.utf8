The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Koizumi firm despite threat
				 	 Relatives of three Japanese nationals kidnapped in Iraq wait to meet foreign minister Yoriko Kawaguchi in Tokyo. (AFP)																								Tokyo, April 9 (Reuters): Facing his toughest political test, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told an anguished Japan today he had no plans to pull troops from Iraq despite a threat by kidnappers there to kill three Japanese civilians.																								Tearful families of the three pleaded for the government to withdraw Japans non-combat troops from the southern Iraqi city of Samawa, where they have been helping to rebuild the area.																								Thousands of protesters gathered in a Tokyo park, waving rainbow-coloured peace flags and holding placards reading: Government: Dont murder the three people. Pull out the troops.																								Some analysts said mishandling of the crisis could bring down the government, a prospect that worried financial markets. I dont think they can be saved if the government does not consider pulling the troops out. There are only two days left, Kyodo news agency quoted the mother of 18-year-old hostage Noriaki Imai as telling a news conference. 																								Koizumi, however, said he was not considering withdrawing troops from Samawa, where 550 Japanese soldiers are stationed. We should not give in to these despicable threats from terrorists, he said.																								He added the government was working to confirm the facts and that if the kidnappings were confirmed, the hostages safety was the top priority.																								Japanese were stunned when a previously unknown group released a video late yesterday showing what it said were three hostages, blindfolded and with a gun to their heads. The group vowed to burn them alive if Japanese troops did not leave Iraq within three days. 																								The mission is Japans riskiest military operation since World War Two and a major shift away from the purely defensive miliary stance Tokyo adopted after its defeat in the war.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Clashes hit quake zone
Al Hoceima (Morocco), Feb. 26 (Reuters): Several people were hurt when troops quelled crowds attacking a Moroccan governors offices today, angry at what they called inadequate official aid in the aftermath of Tuesdays earthquake.																								There are clashes right now as we speak, said a local official who witnessed the violence involving about 1,500 people in this Mediterranean port.																								Several people have been wounded, said the official, who asked not to be identified. Shortly afterwards, a Reuters correspondent in nearby village saw trucks carrying anti-riot forces heading for Al Hoceima at speed.																								The official said the militarys violent intervention began when the crowd started looting relief trucks of supplies for the tens of thousands of people made homeless by Moroccos worst quake in four decades.																								Anger at the perceived slowness of the official response has been mounting since yesterday, when some survivors blocked a main road in a sit-down protest.																								Interior minister Mustapha Sahel said earlier the official death toll from the quake, the worst in over 40 years, had risen to 571, and that the government was doing all in its power to offer psychological help to traumatised survivors. A five-year-old boy was dug out alive after two days spent under the wreckage of his home, but some foreign rescue workers said they had been left standing idle.																								The senior official in (Ait Kamara) told us 200 people died in the village and that two or three were still alive under the rubble, but that he was too busy to show us where they were, said Austrian search and rescue team member Wolfgang Wedan.																								In another village, Tazagin, his team were told they were 24 hours too late: We have come here for nothing. We wanted to help but we cant. They send us away wherever we go, he said.																								There has been no identification of sites where rescue is needed, said Eliane Provo Kluit, of the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team.																								The government has defended its performance, pointing to tent villages set up to provide emergency shelter in low temperatures and pouring rain. 																								But exasperated survivors have started taking matters into their own hands. Earlier, around 100 people blocked trucks at Al Hoceima airport containing mattresses and blankets.

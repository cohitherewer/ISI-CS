 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Baghdad bodybuilder flexes Arnie muscles
				 	 Arnold Mehdi at his fathers Baghdad gym named after Arnold Schwarzenegger. (Reuters)Baghdad, March 30 (Reuters): Film-star-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger has fans around the world, but few are as avid as Baghdad gym owner Sabah Mehdi. 																								In a country where Americans are highly unpopular, Mehdi was thrilled to receive a letter from the governor of California saying he was honoured that Mehdi had changed his five-year-old son Abdullahs name to Arnold.																								Arnold is a legend. Before the war nobody was allowed to give their children western names. But now I was able to give him Arnolds name, said Mehdi, who has already started his son on a weightlifting programme.																								When Schwarzenegger was elected the governor of California, Mehdi changed the name of his run-down gym in central Baghdad to the Arnold Classic. 																								Its poster shows a picture of Schwarzenegger flexing his muscles, with the slogan Arnold name is enough.																								Encouraged by his letter from Schwarzenegger  who wrote to him once before, in 1977  Mehdi hopes the slogan is true as his landlord asks for more rent and threatens to close the gym. 																								We need help or I will go bankrupt. I hope he can help, he said. I have sent him a letter and we are writing another one.																								Times really have changed. Before the US invasion of Iraq a year ago, Mehdi, a former Iraqi bodybuilding champion, trained the sons of Saddam Husseins most feared aides, including Ali Hassan al-Majeed, dubbed Chemical Ali for his gas attack on the Kurds in 1988.																								This would have never happened before when I was training the sons of Iraqs most important people, Mehdi said.																								The landlord would have been too scared to mention the rent.

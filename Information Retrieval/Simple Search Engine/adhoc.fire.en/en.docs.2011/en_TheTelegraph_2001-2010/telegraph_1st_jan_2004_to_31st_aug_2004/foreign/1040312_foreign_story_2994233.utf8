Bush, caught in a controversy last week over campaign ads using images of September 11, 2001, will attend groundbreaking ceremonies for a 9/11 memorial on New Yorks Long Island, then attend a campaign fund-raising event.																								Bush will visit East Meadow, New York, for an Eisenhower Park ceremony breaking ground for the Nassau County 9/11 memorial. Nearly 300 people with ties to Nassau County were killed in the attacks that brought down the World Trade Center towers.																								The White House said Bushs attendance at the event was not in response to the controversy that sprang up last week over television advertisements put out by his re-election campaign that showed a blasted World Trade Center tower building behind an American flag and images of firefighters carrying a flag-draped coffin. This was an invitation that was extended to the President in mid-February, said White House spokesman Scott McClellan. The President is honoured to accept the invitation and pay tribute to those who tragically lost their lives on that September day.																								Some families of the 9/11 victims and a firefighters association had protested the Bush ads and Democrat John Kerrys presidential campaign had accused Bush of exploiting the 9/11 tragedy for political gain.																								Bush is expected to appear with New York Governor George Pataki and other officials to pay respects to the Nassau County victims of the attacks and is expected to turn a shovel of dirt to mark the beginning of the construction.																								Later, he is to attend an Eisenhower Park reception to raise money for his re-election campaign, which has already taken in about $150 million, far surpassing his own $100 million record from the 2000 campaign.																								Some Republicans are concerned about the appearance Bush is leaving  attending a 9/11 event then a fund-raiser  particularly in light of last weeks flap over the ads. It is politically awkward  and quite surprising, said one Republican strategist with close ties to the White House.																								This Republican and others, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there is a broad sense among Republican circles in Washington that the campaign ad controversy was a debacle that served to create a controversy while consuming several million dollars of badly needed campaign funds. Its hard to say there is anything other than fund-raising that theyre doing well, said one Republican.																								The Republicans said there is unease in the White House about the direction of the campaign, with Bush down in the polls.

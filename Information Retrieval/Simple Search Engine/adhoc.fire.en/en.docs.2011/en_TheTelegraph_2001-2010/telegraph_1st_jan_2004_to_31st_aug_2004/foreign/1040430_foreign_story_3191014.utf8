 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 US eases Falluja grip
																								Falluja, April 29 (Reuters): US Marines eased their grip on Falluja today, but details of a deal with former Iraqi army officers remained sketchy and new air strikes on the besieged city showed a month-old insurgency was not over.																								On another bloody day in the bloodiest month for US troops in Iraq, 10 soldiers were killed  including eight by an apparent suicide car bomber  in attacks around Baghdad.																								Within hours of Marine officers and Fallujas police chief saying troops were pulling back from some siege positions around the Sunni bastion west of Baghdad, US warplanes again pounded districts where as many as 2,000 guerrillas are holed up.																								As darkness fell, gunfire crackled across streets where ambulances raced to the scene of the bombings. Doctors say about 600 people have been killed since Marines encircled the city at the beginning of April after the killing of four American security guards, whose bodies were then mutilated in public.																								In Washington, US deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz said the situation in Falluja was confusing, but a deal was being worked on. 																								The goal has got to be to try to isolate the killers from the population so that if military action is necessary, it can be done with a minimum of civilian casualties, said Wolfowitz.																								Previous deals in Falluja, notably a ceasefire two weeks ago, have broken down and US air strikes this week and tough talk by President George W. Bush seemed to herald a possible all-out assault. The Pentagon said it had sent more tanks to Falluja and other restive areas around Baghdad. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged restraint. 																								US officials are keen to stabilise the country before handing over sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government on June 30. Annan, whose envoy is helping form a new administration, said more military force could stiffen guerrilla resistance.																								The 10 latest US combat deaths brought to at least 125 the number of Americans killed in action this month, far outnumbering the toll in the three weeks it took to dash to Baghdad and topple Saddam Hussein a year ago. 																								Falluja police chief Sabar al-Janabi said that the US withdrawal would be completed by tomorrow.

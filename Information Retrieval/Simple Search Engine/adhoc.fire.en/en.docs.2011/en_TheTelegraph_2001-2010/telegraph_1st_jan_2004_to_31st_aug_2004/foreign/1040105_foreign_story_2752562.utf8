 KIM WILLSHER  Paris, Jan. 4: An aspiring  French writer who was sacked from his job in an insurance  company after colleagues complained that he had portrayed  them as a mixture of killers, philanderers and antisocial  alcoholics, has been vindicated.																								In Bruno Pereras thriller Little Murders Among Partners, the chief executive of his fictional insurance company looks like a pig, his secretary is a blonde bimbo and the head broker is a drunk. 																								The companys computer whizkid is a pervert and half the employees are sleeping with each other, have their hands in the till or are always taking sick leave.																								Perera, 46, insisted in the books foreword that his unsympathetic characters were fictional, and that any resemblance to anyone living or dead was purely coincidental. 																								Unfortunately, more than a dozen colleagues at the company where he was employed as a regional executive did not believe him. 																								Perera was first suspended, and then fired. 																								He has, however, had the last laugh. 																								He took legal action against his company and has been awarded 50,000 for unfair dismissal  four times more than he earned from sales of the novel.																								The authors colleagues at the French Def ence andProtection Company (CFDP), whose head office is in Lyon, were among his most avid readers. 																								The plot involves a power struggle at an insurance company  also based in Lyon  whose offices, say Pereras critics, bear a strong resemblance to those of CFDP.																								Indeed, on reading Pereras book,15 of his colleagues claimed that they were shocked to recognise themselves among some of the unflattering portraits.																								The workers at this firm were portrayed with violence and nastiness, Myriam Adjerad, a lawyer representing CFDP told an employment mediation court.																								She said that the depiction of characters in the novel was often insulting and was regarded by some of the companys workers as a virulent personal attack. People didnt want to work with Perera anymore, she added.																								The company admitted that it had not suffered financially or lost clients as a result of the book; in fact business had improved. It said that it had dismissed Perera because of the bad feeling the book had created in the company.																								Patrick Elghozi, Pereras lawyer, said that his client had worked at CFDP for 10 years and so it was hardly surprising that this had influenced his writing. This doesnt merit such an over-reaction and the indignity of forcing the man out of his job, he said.																								The mediation court in Brittany, where Perera lives with his wife and four children, ruled that he was entitled to draw inspiration from real life, and upheld his claim for unfair dismissal and damages, saying his colleagues reaction was disproportionate.																								The author, who is now retraining as a computer technician, said that he was delighted with the judgement and accused his former employers and colleagues of being almost paranoid and of threatening the principle of freedom of expression.																								I didnt defame anyone, I didnt harm the company, whose results improved, he said. If the company, or certain employees, feel that they have been libelled they should take action against me for that.																								No one was hurt as a result of the book, the tribunal concluded. 																								After all, the judges declared, there have not been any murders in this firm.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

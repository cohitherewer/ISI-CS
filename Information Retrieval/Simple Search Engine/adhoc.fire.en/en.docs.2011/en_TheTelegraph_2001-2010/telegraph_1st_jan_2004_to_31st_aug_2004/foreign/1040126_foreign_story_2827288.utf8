 GREG MORAGO 				 	 Beyonce Knowles 																								Los Angeles, Jan. 25: Maybe its not enough that Beyonce Knowles is one of the most beautiful women in the world. Or that shes sold enough records to keep her in ermine for the rest of her life. Or that shes only scratched the surface of whats likely to be a very successful movie career.																								No, Knowles has not yet arrived, at least in terms of becoming a complete global brand. That wont happen until later this year when the entertainer launches the first of two clothing collections in collaboration with her mother, Tina Knowles. The first line will be a funky and hip-hop collection of T-shirts and jeans to be followed by a designer collection of feminine dresses and separates that focuses on bringing some of the couture look to the broader public, Beyonce told Womens Wear Daily. 																								Is she simply living out some sartorial destiny? Knowles is only one of the growing number of celebrities  especially top music stars  who is taking up a needle and thread for the masses. Its practically gotten to the point where celebrities cant map out a road to fame without a measuring tape and fabric swatches tucked inside their Louis Vuitton satchels. 																								The celebrity fashion wave is reaching ridiculous proportions. Its symptomatic of one of the problems in the fashion industry today that we offer too much choice in fashion, and consumers, especially young consumers who are seeking to find their fashion identity, have no guidance because everything is OK, said David Wolfe, fashion and trend analyst for the Doneger Group. Vogue magazine offers 740 looks every issue, so whats a girl to do? Whats a guy to do? If you dont have your own identity firmed up yet, then you hitch-hike on someone elses identity. 																								And there are plenty of celebrities with their own fashion lines willing to give a ride. J.Lo has her own clothing brand (as well as a best-selling perfume). And hold onto your garter belts: Pamela Anderson will launch the Pamela Collection  clothing, lingerie, jewellry and fragrance  next month at the huge Magic apparel trade show in Las Vegas. 																								Why this growing trend of celebrities sporting their own clothing lines? Its all part of the publics voracious appetite for celebrity lifestyle. 																								Id say that in the last three to five years, the look of celebrities has been embraced by manufacturers and licensing partners to create more retail-friendly offerings for todays shoppers, said Tom Julian, fashion and trend analyst for advertising agency Fallon Worldwide. 																								At one time, a celebrity who was washed up licensed their name to make some money. Today, its a brand celebrity statement. 																								Not everyone sees this trend as a good thing. Were so celebrity conscious. We no longer want to emulate society people or people who are admirable role models, Wolfe said. 																								Instead, were going for the easy, no-brainer role models. The thing I find most amusing is that the celebrities actually have no fashion identity, especially the ones who are promoting their lines, like J.Lo. Theyre simply being dressed by stylists in clothes that already exist. 																								The Los Angeles Times- Washington Post News Service

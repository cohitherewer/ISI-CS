 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Gyanendra urged to fire royalist PM in huge rally
				 	 Former Prime Minister Sher Badhadur Deuba at the rally in Kathmandu. (AFP)																								Kathmandu, April 1 (Reuters): About 30,000 people rallied in the Nepali capital today to press King Gyanendra to fire a royalist Prime Minister and form an all-party government in the biggest anti-king rally in the Himalayan kingdom since 1990.																								King Gyanendra, who took over after his brother was killed along with several other royals in a palace massacre in 2001, has been under attack since he dissolved parliament nearly two years ago and sacked an elected Prime Minister in a row over elections.																								This is an important beginning to end the present autocratic system and restore democracy, Girija Prasad Koirala, chief of the centrist Nepali Congress party, said as he squatted on a road with thousands of his supporters.																								The Nepali Congress is one of five political parties that have vowed to continue protesting until the monarch appoints their nominee as Prime Minister or revives parliament.																								Police set up barbed wire roadblocks to stop protesters from marching on the kings palace, as demonstrators marched through the streets with placards saying: No to active monarchy.																								Officials said there was no violence. Protesters said they would defy government orders banning protests near the monarchs official residence and other key government buildings.																								King Gyanendra, whose popularity has been sliding since he suspended democracy and assumed executive powers, is currently touring district capitals in west Nepal, meeting people in his latest public relations drive.																								Gyanendra says he hopes to hold polls delayed since late 2002, by mid-April next year  but only if it is safe to do so.																								Many doubt elections can ever be held until the Maoists fighting to topple the monarchy are brought back to the negotiating table, something most say rests in the kings hands.																								A constitutional monarch by title, Gyanendra now effectively has full control of the government and the country until an election can be held and a new government formed.																								The turmoil is the latest in Nepal beset by a bloody Maoist revolt that has killed more than 9,250 people since 1996 and hit the impoverished economy.

Also among the potential new inductees are French actor Audrey Tautou, who starred in the Oscar-nominated film Amelie, Japanese actor Ken Watanabe, nominated this year for his role in 2003s The Last Samurai, Lord of The Rings star Viggo Mortensen and British actor Paul Bettany.																								The idea is that over the next 20 years or so well bring about an academy that is as distinguished as we can possibly make it, said Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president Frank Pierson.																								The body that organises the Academy awards usually admits more members annually, but this year changed its rules for admitting voting members in order to slow down its growth. 																								Around 5,880 members of the Academy vote each year on the winners of cinemas most prestigious awards. At 13, New Zealands Castle-Hughes this year became the youngest person ever to win a nomination for best actress for her role in Whale Rider.																								Coppola, 32, who won the best original screenplay Oscar this year for Lost in Translation, has been invited to join the writing and directing branches, but only one type of Academy membership will be accepted.

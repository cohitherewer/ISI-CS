 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Spirit high on Mars, rover raring to roll
 Pasadena (California), Jan.  11 (Reuters): The US robotic rover on Mars completed  its transformation from folded landing craft to mobile explorer  earlier than expected and may roll off its landing pad as  early as Tuesday, scientists at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory  said yesterday.																								The Spirit rover was set to begin a three-month search for signs of water on the Red Planet on Thursday  its 14th day on Mars  but the ease of the stand-up manoeuvre and a quick fix to a problem with the lander put the mission ahead of schedule.																								On its seventh martian day, or sol seven, Spirit flawlessly executed one of the most complex space deployments ever to morph from its tetrahedron landing shape into a six-wheeled, golf cart-sized vehicle, scientists said.																								The lander retracted a lift mechanism that raised Spirit to its full height, allowing the rover to push its front and rear wheels into place in the final steps of a reverse robotic origami, said Chris Voorhees, mechanical systems engineer.																								She is asleep right now and resting comfortably on all sixes, he added.																								The Nasa team spent time on Friday in the test bed, a sort of Mars sandbox mocked up as the Spirits landing site, trying to identify hazards in the rovers path.																								The landers front ramp is blocked by partially deployed airbags that scientists were unable to fully retract and test runs in the sand box showed the rovers right rear solar panel could snag on them, said mission manager Jennifer Trosper.																								That led the Spirit team to settle on an alternative path down the back of the lander, which will require the rover to rotate from its south-facing position to face northwest.																								If all goes as planned, the rover will move into place atop the lander tomorrow for a Tuesday night egress at around midnight, Trosper said.																								The rover faces a 15 cm drop from the edge of the landers ramp to the planets surface. It will probably drive about a half-metre on its first day  just enough to get all six wheels onto the planet, she said.																								In the intervening days, the team will cut the final cables holding Spirit to the lander and move a robotic arm laden with scientific instruments for the first time since it was lashed down for landing.																								Scientists are thrilled with Spirits ability to gather and transmit data of unprecedented detail and volume. 																								The craft has surpassed the capabilities of the 1997 Pathfinder rover by tenfold, Trosper said.																								Meanwhile, another team of scientists prepared for the January 24 landing of Spirits twin rover, Opportunity, which is heading toward a site on the opposite side of the planet.																								Scientists completed an analysis of Martian weather conditions during Spirits landing to see if their forecast models needed to be tweaked for Opportunitys landing.																								We were thrilled to see the good match between what Spirit measured and what we predicted ... and that gives us confidence that we can use the same model for Opportunity, said Joy Crisp, project scientist.																								Scientists selected landing sites in the massive Gusev crater for Spirit and on the Meridiani Planum for Opportunity because data gathered by orbiting spacecraft suggested they once held water, and possibly some form of Martian life.																								The Opportunity team expects their rover to touch down in a rolling, dark-gray basalt plain much different from the burnt-orange rocky desert revealed by Spirits panoramic cameras, said Matt Golombek, a JPL science team member.

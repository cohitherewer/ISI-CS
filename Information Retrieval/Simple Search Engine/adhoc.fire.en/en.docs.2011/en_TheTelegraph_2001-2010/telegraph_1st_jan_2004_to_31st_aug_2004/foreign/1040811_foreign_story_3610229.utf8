The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Imran missed chance to be PM, says Pervez
				 	 Imran Khan: Clean bowled																								Islamabad, Aug. 10 (AFP): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said in an interview today that cricket-hero- turned-politician Imran Khan had missed out on becoming Prime Minister because he turned against the ruling party.																								Imran knows nothing, despite the fact that I went to his hospital and helped him a lot, Musharraf told The News daily, referring to the cancer hospital Khan set up and runs as a charity.																								Khan, 50, initially backed Musharraf after he led a bloodless coup against the elected government of Nawaz Sharif in October 1999, saying he believed the army chief could stamp out corruption  one of Khans top policy platforms.																								But in the past two years he has turned against Musharraf, accusing him and the army of backing corrupt tycoons to stand as civilian proxies in a breakaway faction of Sharifs party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid-e-Azam (PML-Q).																								Nevertheless, Musharraf said he had overlooked the ex-cricketer for the post because of his change of heart.																								Imran Khan lost his credibility by parting ways with the coalition, Musharraf was quoted as saying, referring to a coalition of pro-army parties who hold a majority in the parliament. 																								Last week, Khan reacted sceptically to Islamabads crackdown on al Qaida, saying the government was desperate for US support. Just because the government calls someone al Qaida, doesnt mean they are al Qaida, because the government is desperate for US support, Khan told BBC Radio.

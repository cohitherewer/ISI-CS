																								London, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Scientists have taken a step closer to creating a vaccine against a virus that causes the most common form of diarrhoea and vomiting in children.																								A team of scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Childrens Hospital Boston in the US created models down to the atom of key proteins that form part of the virus, called the rotavirus.																								The rotavirus infects almost all children, usually between six months and two- years-old, and kills an estimated 440,000 children per year, mostly in poor countries.																								The only licensed vaccine against the rotavirus, called RotaShield, was pulled from the US market in 1999 over fears it could cause complications. It is made from live viruses.																								But the American scientists, who published their findings in the British journal Nature, said a virus produced from the proteins they modelled could be more stable, cheaper and safer.

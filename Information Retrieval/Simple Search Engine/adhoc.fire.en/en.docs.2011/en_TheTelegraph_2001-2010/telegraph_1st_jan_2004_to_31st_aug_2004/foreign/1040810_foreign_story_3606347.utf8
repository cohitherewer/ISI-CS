 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Ring-road boss in China bribe web
																								Beijing, Aug. 9 (Reuters): The man entrusted with building possibly the worlds largest network of ring-roads, around Chinas fast expanding capital, is under criminal investigation for taking huge bribes, state media said today.																								Bi Yuxi, head of the Capital Road Development Corporation and a deputy director of the Beijing City Transport office, had been expelled from the Communist Party for degenerate behaviour and was under investigation, the Beijing Youth Daily said.																								He several times accepted huge bribes, the Youth Daily said in a front-page article. 																								Bi Yuxi was morally degenerate and his lifestyle was decadent and dissolute.																								Bi had been handed over to judicial authorities for criminal investigation, it said. 																								Chinese media, unfettered by Western-style contempt of court laws, often quote police confirming a defendants guilt or confession before a case has come to court.																								It is the first major corruption case to break in the capital since Hu Jintao took over as Communist Party chief in November 2002 and as state president in March 2003.																								It was unclear how wide the net would be cast or whether other officials with the firm  closely linked with the Beijing city government  were under investigation.																								An official at the Road Development Corporation said only that Bi had left last year but refused to say if any other officials were involved in the corruption case. 																								Beijing now has five ring roads in operation with a sixth due for completion at the end of the year. Bis firm built them all.																								A Chinese source said Bi had implicated other corporate leaders after his arrest in April on suspicion of embezzling as much as 60 million yuan ($7.25 million). 																								I just took tea money, Bi was quoted as saying. If all he took was tea money, what did the others take? Food money? the source said.

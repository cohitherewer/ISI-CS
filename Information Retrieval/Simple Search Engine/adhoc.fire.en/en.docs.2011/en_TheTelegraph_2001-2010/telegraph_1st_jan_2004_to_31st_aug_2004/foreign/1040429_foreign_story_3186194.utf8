 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Anger, defiance rising in Najaf
Najaf, April 28 (Reuters): An Arab headdress hiding his face and a martyrdom-seeker badge slung around his neck, a man knocks hurriedly on the door of an office of Iraqs rebel Shia leader Moqtada al-Sadr.																								I spotted an American checkpoint, give me an explosive belt, he tells a cleric who opens the door in the holy Shia city of Najaf. The cleric pats the volunteer on the back and asks him to come in.																								A US night air raid on positions of Sadrs Mehdi Army militia that killed dozens of fighters just north of Najaf on Monday has stoked anger and defiance among supporters, many of them unemployed young men. Every day the number of martyrdom-seekers is multiplying and we keep holding them back. But when the time comes, those Iraqis will be human timebombs, Qais al-Khazaaly, Sadrs main lieutenant, said. Muslim fundamentalists call suicide bombers istishadiyeen, those who seek martyrdom.																								The Shia readiness for martyrdom defending their holy cities and leaders could be new on the Iraqi arena, but it was the Shias who drove the Israelis out of southern Lebanon using such operations, Khazaaly said. On the streets of the holy city, far fewer Mehdi militiamen were visible than at any time since Sadr supporters rose up against US-led forces in Baghdad and a number of southern cities three weeks ago. We dont have any shortage of fighters, Khazaaly said. Lots of men come from all over Iraq to support us and fight with us, especially from the tribes around Najaf. We keep telling them we have sufficient numbers now.																								But across the political divide in the city, the Mehdi militia is seen in a different light. Officials from other Shia parties say many militiamen are deserting the ill-equipped Mehdi Army, scared away by the heavy casualties they suffered in the latest clashes.																								Most of these people are coming from Sadr City, he said of the impoverished Shia Baghdad suburb named after Moqtadas assassinated father, from where the cleric draws huge support.																								They dont have any military training, they can chant in support of Sadr all day, but can they last in the battlefield? I doubt it, said a senior officer of another Shia militia.

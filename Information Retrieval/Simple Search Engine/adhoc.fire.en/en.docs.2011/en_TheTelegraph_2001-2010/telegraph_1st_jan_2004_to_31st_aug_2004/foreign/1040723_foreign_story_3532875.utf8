 Friday, July 23, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Monkey madness																																	Jerusalem, July 22 (AP): A young monkey at an Israeli zoo has started walking like a human following a near death experience, the zoos veterinarian has said.																																	Natasha began walking exclusively upright on two legs after a stomach ailment nearly killed her. Monkeys usually alternate between upright movement and walking on all fours. A picture in the Maariv daily showed Natasha standing ramrod straight like a human. The picture was labelled humorously: The missing link?																																	Two weeks ago, Natasha and three other monkeys were diagnosed with severe stomach flu. At the zoo clinic, she slipped into critical condition, said Igal Horowitz, the veterinarian. Ive never seen or heard of this before, said Horowitz. One possible explanation is brain damage from the illness, he said.																													 																Tough coatTokyo (Reuters): They may not look cool, but knife-resistant kids sweatshirts and coats are the latest products aimed at providing parental peace of mind in a Japan horrified by a series of gruesome attacks on children. The sweatshirts, and coats that look like plain waterproofs, are made from the same fibres used in police and military knife-proof and bullet-proof vests, according to the maker, Madre. We created this product so children would be OK, even if they went off to play by themselves, said a spokesman for Madre, a provider of child day-care services before it added protective clothing to its portfolio earlier this year. The clothing, sold only through the companys website, www.defense.to, isnt cheap, at 46,095 yen ($419) for the coat.

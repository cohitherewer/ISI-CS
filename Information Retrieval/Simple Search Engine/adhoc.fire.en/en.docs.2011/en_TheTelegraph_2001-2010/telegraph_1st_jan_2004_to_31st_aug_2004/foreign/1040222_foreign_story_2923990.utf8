				 	 Norah JonesNew York, Feb. 21 (AP): Norah Jones has done countless interviews with relative ease, but her scheduled chat with Jon Stewart of Comedy Centrals The Daily Show has the songbird feeling a bit apprehensive.																								Im afraid Im going to say something stupid, the Grammy-winning singer told the Associated Press in a recent interview. Jones is scheduled to appear on Wednesday on the comedy show that focuses on current events. Shes on a promotional tour for her new album, Feels Like Home.																								I know whats going on, but Im not like current event savvy. Im not perfect, I dont know everything. Im a bit nervous about that, the singer said. Jones wont be performing, but shell chat with the sharp-tongued host Stewart, of whom she raves: Hes so smart.																								I hope he doesnt say something and Im like: I dont know, she said, laughing. Her mother is a big fan of The Daily Show, Jones said. The singer doesnt watch television that often, she said, and doesnt even have cable. Instead, she prefers to read.

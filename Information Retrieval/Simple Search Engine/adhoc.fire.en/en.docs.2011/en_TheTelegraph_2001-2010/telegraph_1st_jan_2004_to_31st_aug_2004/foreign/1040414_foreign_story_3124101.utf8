(AFP)																								Colombo, April 13 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers freed more than 100 child soldiers today after vanquishing a breakaway rebel faction in weekend clashes that threatened the islands fragile peace bid.																								The Uniecf said that it was the Tigers single largest release of children, and that there were possibly hundreds more who had given up arms and returned to their villages since the rebels factional infighting eased.																								We hope that this large release of children is the beginning of a new trend by the LTTE towards the large-scale demobilisation of child soldiers and meeting their commitments under the peace process, Unicef resident head Ted Chaiban said in a statement.																								The whereabouts of breakaway rebel commander Karuna were unknown and most of his forces had dispersed as the Tigers emerged triumphant from the split that shattered their iron discipline and complicated efforts to end 20 years of civil war.																								Most of the released children were thought to belong to Karunas faction, although the Tigers have long used fighters as young as 10 in their struggle for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the island.																								Thousands of civilians in the east were also returning home after fleeing when the Tigers launched the offensive to retake areas held by Karuna  the movements name for V. Muralitharan  who split from the group in early March with about 6,000 of its 15,000 troops.																								We visited the area and found the situation returning to normal and that there is no conflict at all. People were found gradually returning to their homes, said Sukumar Rockwood, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Monitors who oversee the islands two-year truce said the Tigers had installed Karunas replacement, Ramesh, in the area, adding that they had met him late yesterday.

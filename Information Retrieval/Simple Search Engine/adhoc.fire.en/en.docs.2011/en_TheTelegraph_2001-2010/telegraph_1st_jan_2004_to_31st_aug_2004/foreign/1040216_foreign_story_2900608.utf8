 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Russia park crash kills 25
																								Moscow, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Cries under the debris today spurred on rescuers at a Moscow water park where a snow-laden glass dome caved in, killing at least 25 people and injuring more than 100 in a hail of glass shards and broken concrete.																								Emergencies minister Sergei Shoigu, saying about 17 people were unaccounted for, suggested shoddy construction of the award-winning complex of swimming pools and waterslides was to blame for the roof crashing down on bathers last evening.																								The horror struck on a busy Saturday evening in the popular new playground for middle class Muscovites, again shattering peace in a city already on edge after more than 40 people died in a metro train bombing 10 days ago. Shoigu said 700 rescuers stopped work every two hours to listen in the stillness for signs of life.																								We still dont know the fate of about 17 people. No one is losing hope, he said on local television. Its time to stop this chaos and establish control when these kinds of sites are being built, he added, in a reference to the rush of new construction in the Russian capital. 																								He said all such roofs in Moscow were being checked. The centre, called Transvaal Park, was just two years old.																								With the temperature deeply below freezing, heat cannons were used to blast the site with warm air to keep any trapped survivors from freezing to death.																								Shoigu said the search was hampered by shards of glass cutting the feet of sniffer dogs.																								Police said the death toll had risen to 25. The emergencies ministry said at least four and perhaps as many as six children had died and at least 110 people were injured.																								Russian television said the roof collapsed directly over the childrens pool.

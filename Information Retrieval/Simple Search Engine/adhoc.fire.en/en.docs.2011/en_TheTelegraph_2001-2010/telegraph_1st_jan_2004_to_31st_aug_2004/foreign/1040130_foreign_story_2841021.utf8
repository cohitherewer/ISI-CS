 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Suicide blast rips bus apart near Sharons residence

(Reuters)																								Jerusalem, Jan. 29 (Reuters): A suicide bomber blew up an Israeli bus in Jerusalem today, killing 10 people in the deadliest such attack in four months, as Israel and the Lebanese guerrilla group Hizbollah carried out a prisoner exchange.																								Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, linked to President Yasser Arafats Fatah faction, issued a letter left behind by the bomber in which he said he belonged to the group and was avenging an Israeli raid in Gaza yesterday that killed eight Palestinians, including five gunmen.																								The explosion on Bus 19 peeled back part of its roof, shattered windows and scattered body parts up to 15 metres away on Gaza Street near Prime Minister Ariel Sharons official residence. Sharon was at his ranch in southern Israel at the time. Police said the bomb was packed with nuts and bolts to maximise casualties. Dozens of wounded were rushed to hospital.																								It was like a pastoral scene  the sun was shining and it was serene outside  but the bus was a nightmare. Bodies were sitting in their chairs, burnt, motionless, said witness Drora Resnick.																								There were burnt children sitting together. People started rushing off the bus, but they were still there, not moving.																								Hours after the blast, Israel released some 400 Palestinian prisoners into the West Bank and Gaza and returned over its border with Lebanon the bodies of 59 Lebanese and Arab fighters killed during a 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon. Some of the prisoners knelt in prayer as they alighted from Israeli tour buses and others waved farewell to jailers who watched them go.																								Most of those freed were due to be freed in a few months time anyway, said released prisoner Annam Sayel, 20, who was sentenced in August 2002 to 28 months in jail for throwing petrol bombs and stones at soldiers.																								The key to the deal was the identification at an air base in Cologne, Germany, of the bodies of three Israeli soldiers abducted at the Lebanese border in 2000 and handed over by Hizbollah with abducted Israeli businessman Elhanan Tannenbaum.																								Twenty-nine prisoners, most of them Lebanese and including a German convert to Islam jailed in 1997 as a Hizbollah agent, were also flown from Israel to Cologne. After Israeli forensic experts identified the soldiers remains, a plane carrying their coffins and Tannenbaum took off for an airbase near Tel Aviv, where Sharon was to attend a ceremony for the three dead.																								A second aircraft with the prisoners released by Israel left Cologne for Beirut.																								The Jerusalem bombing came in the midst of a visit by US envoy John Wolf, who met this week with Israel and Palestinian officials to try to revive a violence-stalled peace road map.

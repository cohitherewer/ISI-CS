 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 UK hears first cloning application
																								London, July 16 (Reuters): The head of the scientific team that has applied for Europes first licence to create human embryos for stem cell research said they are not trying to clone babies but to help millions of people with diabetes.																								My biggest worry is that people will not understand what we are trying to do, said Dr Miodrag Stojkovic, of the University of Newcastle in northern England. My intention is to remove these fears  we dont want to clone human beings, he said in an interview. Our aim is to try to understand type 1 diabetes and to try to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease, he added.																								Britains Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the countrys cloning watchdog group, was considering the universitys application for human therapeutic cloning, creating embryos as a source of stem cells to cure diseases.																								Stem cells are master cells of the body that can develop into other cell types.																								A decision is not expected for a week or longer but it has re-ignited the ethical debate on human therapeutic cloning and caused uproar among opponents who fear it will could lead to reproductive cloning, which is outlawed in Britain.																								We dont want to do reproductive cloning. We want to use cloned embryos to derive stem cells which have no possibility of developing into a baby, Stojkovic said. Stojkovic, a stem cell expert from Serbia who has also worked in Germany, came to Britain 18 months ago.

				 US does not seek empire, says Ashcroft

																								Davos (Switzerland), Jan. 23 (Reuters): The US top law officer denied today that Washington was greedy for empire and stressed it needed partners to prevail in the war on terror.
																								Attorney-general John Ashcroft was forced to defend the conduct of the war in the face of criticism at a major world summit. If you look at the US and its performance, and where it is in the world and what it does in the world, its not an aggressor, Ashcroft told the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
																								The US doesnt seek to consume territory or to acquire an empire, he told the gathering, at which Washington has at times faced criticism over its security policies and the war in Iraq.
																								Ashcroft was speaking from the same platform where UN chief Kofi Annan had earlier told delegates that global security must not be dictated by the laws of the jungle. The secretary-general said the dangers stemmed not only from terrorism itself but also from the way the war on terror was fought, although he did not mention any country by name.

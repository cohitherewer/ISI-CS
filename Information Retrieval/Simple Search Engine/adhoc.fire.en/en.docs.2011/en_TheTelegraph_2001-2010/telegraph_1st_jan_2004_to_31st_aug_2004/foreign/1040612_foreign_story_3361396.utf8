 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Pak targets Qaida hideouts in new raid
 IMTIAZ GUL				 	 Military spokesman General Shaukat Sultan during a press conference in Islamabad with a satellite picture of the South Waziristan area in the background. (AFP)																								Islamabad, June 11: Three days after clashes with local and foreign al Qaida militants near the Afghan border, a senior Pakistani military officer said today that his troops had killed 35 rebels and are looking for a financier of the terror network, Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi.																								Intelligence reports suggest that al-Iraqi used to visit the house of local tribesman Eda Khan but right now we cant say anything about his whereabouts. chief army spokesman General Shaukat Sultan said at a press conference here.																								Sultan admitted that the military lost 15 soldiers in the skirmishes. The militants captured nine soldiers in an attack on Inzer checkpoint on June 9 and later mutilated their bodies after killing them.																								With the help of satellite imagery, Sultan said three targets have been identified in a location where about 50 local and foreign miscreants have been putting up fierce resistance to the Pakistani forces.																								Besides the three hideouts, Sultan said an area was identified that is being used for the training of local and foreign militants.																								The general said fighting is still raging in the Shakai area of South Waziristan and will continue till miscreants are eliminated.																								Every terrorist act makes the government more determined to pursue its agenda that runs against the agenda of terrorists, he said.																								Their agenda is to destabilise Pakistan by hindering its growth and development we will pay any price to bring our fight (against terrorism) to its logical end.																								To a query, Sultan said the troops could not use their full might as it was difficult to clearly separate the civilian population from the foreign fighters. We can use only operationally required force, he said. 																								Earlier in the day, Pakistani fighter aircraft pounded fugitive hideouts in the rugged mountains of South Waziristan.																								Residents in Wana, the regions administrative headquarters, said they saw fighter jets flying over the Shakai hills followed by huge explosions. We also saw smoke rising from the targeted areas, a Wana resident Ahmed Wazir said.																								Wazir added that the Pakistani army sent in fresh reinforcements to help the paramilitary South Waziristan Scouts who have been busy hunting tribesmen sheltering al Qaida and Taliban fugitives.																								Another tribesman, Allah Noor, said security forces have seized 40 houses belonging to suspected militants after bombing the area in the morning. 																								Sultan said earlier in the day that Pakistani forces were appropriately responding against the known and confirmed hideouts of militants in the region.																								Clashes broke out on Wednesday after suspected terrorists launched a rocket attack on a military checkpoint in Wana. Yesterday, the checkpoints again came under rocket attack, provoking the government to escalate its military offensive in the region.																								Authorities in South Waziristan have also revoked an amnesty for pro-Taliban militants who are suspected of sheltering foreign rebels. 																								The government accused them of violating the April 24 peace deal and refusing to cooperate on the registration of foreigners.																								Sultan accused local tribesman Nek Mohammed and his colleagues of taking undue advantage of the amnesty to draw personal benefits at the cost of their fellow tribesmen.																								Tribesmen loyal to Moh ammed have been a major hurdle in government efforts to secure the arrest or surrender of foreign militants believed to be hiding in																								the region since the fall of the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan in late 2001.

 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Iraqs most wanted not captured, says US
				 	 Zarqawi																								Baghdad, June 28 (Reuters): The US military denied reports today that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant who Washington says is allied to Osama bin Laden and al Qaida, had been captured in Iraq.																								Its not true, the reports are not true, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, deputy director of operations for the US military in Iraq, said. Weve heard the reports about it, but they are not true.																								Earlier, reports on a US-funded Iraqi radio station had suggested Zarqawi had been captured near the town of Hilla, 100 km south of Baghdad, in an area controlled by Polish troops. Iraqi officials in Hilla said a man had been captured who resembled Zarqawi and spoke with a similar accent. But Polish forces said the man was not Zarqawi.																								The detained man looked like al-Zarqawi but it was not him, a military source in the Polish-led multinational force headquarters in Babylon said.																								Zarqawi is accused of organising or carrying out dozens of deadly attacks in Iraq over the past several months, including a series of blasts and attacks last week that killed more than 100 Iraqis and three US soldiers.																								His group has also beheaded a US and a South Korean hostage in Iraq, and is threatening to execute three Turks. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and the Bush administration agree on one thing: the Jordanian militant is the deadliest threat to US efforts in Iraq.																								He remains the number one target inside this country. He is a very effective terrorist, US military spokesman Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said on Saturday.																								President George W. Bush has repeatedly portrayed Zarqawi as al Qaidas link to Iraq before last years US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, though the evidence is disputed.																								While Zarqawi may well share al Qaidas outlook, some analysts suggest he is a like-minded independent operator, rather than an integral part of Osama bin Ladens network.																								Zarqawi lives in hiding, a $10 million US bounty on his head, and speaks to the outside world via video tapes posted on websites. We need every citizen in this country to understand that they have a role in the hunt for Zarqawi, Kimmitt said.

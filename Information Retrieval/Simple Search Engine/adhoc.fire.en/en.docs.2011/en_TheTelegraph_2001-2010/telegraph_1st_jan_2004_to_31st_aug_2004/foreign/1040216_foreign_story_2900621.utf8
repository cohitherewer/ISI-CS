The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Lanka talks threat
																								Colombo, Feb. 15 (Reuters): A Marxist party that is a key partner of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga has rejected a two-year old ceasefire between the government and Tiger rebels, a newspaper today quoted a top party official as saying.																								Wimal Weerawansa, media secretary for the Peoples Liberation Front (JVP), refused to deny or confirm the report in Lanka, a pro-Kumaratunga Sunday paper. Next week we will send a correction letter to this newspaper, he said, refusing further comment. Other JVP members were not available for comment.																								A JVP rejection of the ceasefire would be a major upset for the Left-leaning Kumaratungas Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which signed an alliance with the JVP before she called elections for April 2.																								The JVP has 16 seats in the 225-member parliament, and Kumaratungas Peoples Alliance, formed by the SLFP and small parties, holds 79 seats. Replying to a readers question about whether the alliance between Kumaratungas party and the JVP would respect the two-year old ceasefire if it came to power, Weerawansa was quoted as saying the JVP was against it and would try to negotiate a new ceasefire with the rebels.

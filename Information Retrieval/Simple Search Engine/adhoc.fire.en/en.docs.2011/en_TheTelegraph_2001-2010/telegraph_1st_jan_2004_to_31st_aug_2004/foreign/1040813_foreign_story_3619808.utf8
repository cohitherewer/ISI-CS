 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Pak Qaida arrests gather pace
				 	 A policeman stands guard in Karachi. (AFP)																								Islamabad, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Pakistan has arrested more foreign and local al Qaida suspects in the last two days as its month-long crackdown on Osama bin Ladens shadowy network gathers pace, officials said today.																								Intelligence and police officials have announced at least five fresh al Qaida-linked detentions in the last 24 hours.																								The authorities are chasing various leads after questioning at least three top al Qaida operatives caught in the last month  Tanzanian-born Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, Qari Saifullah Akhtar and computer engineer Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan.																								They hope the trail will eventually lead to al Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden, who Pakistani intelligence officials said yesterday had exhorted his followers to launch strikes on the US, Britain and Pakistan.																								Government officials said the suspects caught in the last two days were captured in various parts of the country.																								These people keep many aliases and it is too early to say whether there is an important target among them, one official said on condition of anonymity.																								They often appear as ordinary people, but during interrogation and investigations, they turn out to be real valuable people, big gems, he said.																								Reuters reported yesterday the arrest of two Turkish al Qaida operatives, believed to be behind car bomb attacks on two synagogues in Istanbul in November last year that killed 25. They also fought with rebels in Russias breakaway region of Chechnya.																								Today, Pakistani officials reported new breakthroughs in the hunt for al Qaida and its local Islamic militant allies.																								Rao Mohammad Khalid, from a new group tied to al Qaida called Jundullah, was arrested in Karachi today on suspicion of involvement in a June attack on Karachis army chief. The commander survived but 10 people died.																								An Uzbek, suspected of being trained by Ghailani to carry out a suicide attack, was arrested in Nowshera, 120 km west of Islamabad, yesterday. The man, identified as Mansoor, was caught by electronic surveillance and is being interrogated.																								Ghailani, wanted in the US for the 1998 embassy attacks in east Africa, was arrested with 13 other foreigners in a raid in the eastern Pakistani city of Gujarat on July 25. He gave information leading to Mansoors capture, officials said.																								Also yesterday, a man from the UAE called Mohammad Khalid Rashid Ahmed was detained in Pakistans tribal region of Mohmand trying to cross into Afghanistan. The al Qaida suspect was accompanied by three Pakistani militants. Hundreds of al Qaida suspects have been handed to US custody by Pakistan since September 11, 2001.

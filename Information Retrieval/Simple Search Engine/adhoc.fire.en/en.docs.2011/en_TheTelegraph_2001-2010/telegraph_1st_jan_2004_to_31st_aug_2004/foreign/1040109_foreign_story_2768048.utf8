(AFP)																								Abu Ghraib (Iraq), Jan. 8 (Reuters): A Black Hawk helicopter came down in Iraq today, killing all eight US soldiers aboard; it was not immediately clear if it had been shot down.																								News of the incident near the restive town of Falluja, west of Baghdad, came as US authorities released about 60 Iraqis from what was Saddam Husseins most notorious prison, the first batch to be set free under a new amnesty programme.																								At the Abu Ghraib prison near the capital, which once housed Saddams enemies, the freed inmates were brought out in two open trucks late in the afternoon and let out 2 km away.																								Honking their car horns and raising huge clouds of dust, hundreds of people who had been waiting outside the jail all day set off in pursuit. Later, they surrounded the freed men, searching desperately for friends and relatives. Many of those released looked relieved but some were bitter.																								Im very happy to be free, shouted Kamal Risaeya, 32, an identification tag still hanging from his leg. Im just looking forward to seeing my family. 																								Risaeya said he was detained in Saddams hometown of Tikrit and held for five months. He said he was not harmed in custody.																								But another man, who refused to give his name, said he had been mistreated. His voice shaking with anger, he said:Im free, but now I will attack them.																								The downed Black Hawk was on a medical evacuation mission with four crew and four passengers aboard, the military said.																								There are no survivors, a U.S. military spokeswoman said.

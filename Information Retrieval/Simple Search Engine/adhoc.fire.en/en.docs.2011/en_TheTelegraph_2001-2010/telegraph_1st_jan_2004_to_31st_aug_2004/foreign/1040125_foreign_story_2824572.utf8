 DAVID SAPSTED																								London, Jan. 24: Stephen Hawking defended his wife last night at the end of a week of claims that the renowned scientist had been repeatedly assaulted in his own home.																								In a defiant statement issued by Prof. Hawking from his bed at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, the crippled physicist described reports that he had been attacked as completely false and said he owed his life to his current wife, Elaine.																								I firmly and wholeheartedly reject the allegations that I have been assaulted, he said. The stories in the media are completely false and I am profoundly disappointed by the circulation of such personal and inaccurate information. My wife and I love each other very much and it is only because of her that I am alive today. I request that the media respect my privacy and allow me to focus on recovering from my illness. 																								It was the second statement that Hawking, 62, who has been in hospital for the past month with a lung infection, had issued after police confirmed that they had opened an investigation into the alleged assaults. 																								The current police inquiry will continue though it was conceded yesterday that it was being hampered by misplaced loyalty to the scientist, who has motor neurone disease. 																								Though former members of his nursing team have come forward this week, alleging that they have witnessed assaults on him, detectives have encountered a reluctance by many others connected to Hawking to speak. 																								A source revealed that the current investigation, the second in four years, had been going on for more than four months and that current and former employees and nurses, who care for Hawking 24 hours a day, had been interviewed. 																								The source added: The problem is that Hawking generates a terrific loyalty among those who surround him. In this case, it is a misplaced loyalty as all the investigation is aimed at doing is ensuring he suffers no harm.																								But the fact that he himself denies being the victim of any assaults results in others denying it, too. Hawking defends his privacy fiercely.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

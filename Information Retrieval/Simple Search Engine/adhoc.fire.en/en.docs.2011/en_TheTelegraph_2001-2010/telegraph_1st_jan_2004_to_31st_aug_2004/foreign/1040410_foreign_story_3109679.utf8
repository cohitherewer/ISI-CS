Prabhakaran (top) and Karuna 																								Colombo, April 9 (Reuters): Thousands of civilians fled rebel-held areas in Sri Lankas east today, as rival factions of Tamil Tiger guerrillas exchanged mortar fire in the worst fighting since a two-year truce halted the islands civil war.																								The fighting, which does not involve government troops, has killed at least 22 people and complicates efforts by a new government to revive a stalled peace process with the LTTE.																								Thousands of civilians are moving out of the area into government-controlled areas where they will be housed in schools, said Sukumar Rockwood, spokesman for the International Committee for the Red Cross.																								Pro-rebel media said 300 fighters loyal to breakaway eastern commander Karuna had surrendered.																								About eight fighters were reported killed on both sides, the Tamilnet website said. The infantry formations... were spearheaded by crack commando units of the LTTE and were backed by heavy artillery fire.																								It said eight wounded had also been brought to hospital in Batticaloa, the stronghold of Karuna, who is estimated to have the support of more than 6,000 of the LTTEs 15,000 fighters. The ninth person killed was an ambulance driver who died when his vehicle hit a landmine, local officials said.																								Military spokesman Colonel Sumedha Perera said the main LTTE group and Karunas faction had exchanged mortar fire across the Verugal river just south of the port of Trincomalee, about 240 km northeast of Colombo.																								There was intermittent heavy weapons fire, Perera said. Defence secretary Cyril Herath said the Sri Lankan army had not been drawn into the fighting.																								So far they (the rebel factions) are not moving through government-controlled areas. Should they move into our areas we will have to ask them to move back. We will have to deal with that situation as it arises, he said. A spokesman for Karuna  the nom de guerre for eastern commander V. Muralitharan  could not be reached for comment. Sri Lankan rebels loyal to breakaway eastern commander Karuna ride on a tractor in the jungles of Batticaloa district, eastern Sri Lanka. (Reuters) 																								The split is the worst internal threat to the LTTE since the group began its fight for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the island in 1983.																								The Tigers are known to brook no dissent and have vowed to get rid of Karuna from our soil. We have had confirmation from Kilinochchi the LTTE has started fighting and is trying to regain territory controlled by Karuna, said Agnes Bragadottir, the spokeswoman for the truce monitors, referring to the Tigers northern headquarters.																								Karuna broke from the Tigers in early March, saying the groups northern leadership  which controls a large jungle area in northern Sri Lanka  was mistreating eastern Tamils.																								The LTTE, previously known for its strict discipline, has a history of showing no tolerance of internal challenges, and says Karuna left to evade charges he had stolen money from the rebels.Chandrika assures US																								Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga told US secretary of state Colin Powell she will move to restart peace talks with the Tamil Tiger rebels after next weeks New Year holidays, one of her aides said today.																								In a telephone conversation with Powell, Kumaratunga also said the Sri Lankan military would stay out of a split in the Tigers and that the split would not stand in the way of resuming talks.

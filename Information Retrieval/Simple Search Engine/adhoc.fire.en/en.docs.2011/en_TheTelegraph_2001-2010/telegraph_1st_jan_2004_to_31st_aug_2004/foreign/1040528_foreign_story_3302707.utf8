The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Caribbean flood toll rises to 2000
																								Port-au-Prince (Haiti), May 27 (Reuters): Rescue workers rushed to fly in drinking water, chlorine tablets and first-aid kits today to a remote Haitian town submerged by floods that killed an estimated 2,000 people on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.																								The discovery of more than 1,000 bodies in Mapou, a village southeast of the capital, dramatically raised the death toll from flash floods and mudslides triggered by torrential rains in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.																								Foreign troops sent to Haiti after a rebellion in February, turned to relief efforts. They provided helicopter flights to aid agencies trying to reach survivors who were isolated when floods washed out roads across southeastern Haiti.																								Mapou is in the middle of a valley and the village is practically under water, said Lieutenant Colonel David Lapan, spokesman for the multinational force. It is like a lake when you look at it from the air.																								Heavy rains last weekend sent rivers of mud and debris through villages, sweeping away shanties and burying residents on both sides of the Haiti-Dominican Republic border.																								The toll in Haiti stood at about 1,660, while 329 bodies have been recovered in the Dominican Republic, mostly in the town of Jimani near the Haitian border.																								Haiti confronted its worst natural disaster in years less than three months after a rebellion killed more than 200 people and helped oust President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The 3,500-member peacekeeping force sent to Haiti by the UN pitched in to help the relief effort.																								Three helicopter flights left Port-au-Prince early today in a race against thunderstorms threatening more misery. They carried chlorine tablets to purify drinking water, shovels and other emergency supplies to Mapou and hard-hit areas around Fond Verettes, where at least 158 were killed.																								Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas and four out of five of its 8 million people live in poverty. The countryside is vulnerable to floods and landslides because inhabitants have virtually stripped it of trees to make charcoal cooking fuel.																								Prime Minister Gerard Latortue said his government would make hard decisions to relocate people who have built shanties on riverbanks and in other areas prone to flooding.																								Even in the best of conditions, remote Mapou can take three or four hours to reach from Jacmel, the nearest city on the southeast coast, said Sheyla Biamby, a spokeswoman for Catholic Relief Services in Haiti.It is difficult to access this town. It is a small town, there is no road access, she said. It is very alarming, not many people can reach it to bring food and water.

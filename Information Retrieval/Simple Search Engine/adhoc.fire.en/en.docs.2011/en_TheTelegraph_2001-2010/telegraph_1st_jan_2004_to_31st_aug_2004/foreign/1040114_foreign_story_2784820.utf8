 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Dr Death brings his own death
 															- Motive  for 215 murders will never be known  Harold Shipman London, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Britains worst mass murderer Harold Shipman  a family doctor who killed hundreds of his patients  was found hanging dead in his cell today, the prison service said.																								Shipman, nicknamed Dr Death after his horrific killing spree came to light, was convicted in 2000 of murdering 15 of his patients and sentenced to life in prison. 																								An inquiry later ruled he had murdered at least 215 of his patients with heroin injections, making him Britains  and one of the worlds  most prolific serial killer. He was found dead, hanging in his cell, a prison service spokesperson said. 																								Shipman killed his patients over a more than 20-year period from 1975 to 1998. Of his victims, 171 were female and 44 male. The oldest was a 93-year-old woman and the youngest a man of 41.																								A statement from Wakefield high-security prison, where Shipman had been held, said he was found at 0620 GMT today, the day before his 58th birthday. 																								Despite the best efforts of staff who immediately attempted resuscitation, he was pronounced dead by a doctor at 0810 GMT, it said. Shipmans body was driven away from the prison in a funeral service van flanked by a police escort.																								The official inquiry into Shipmans killings found he had murdered his victims quietly, coldly and systematically, ending the life of patient after patient in a betrayal of trust unparalleled in history. It said he may have been addicted to killing, but found no conclusive motive.																								The serial killers death means his victims families will now never know what drove him to kill their loved ones.																								Shipmans conviction sparked horror among Britons at how a doctor who had previous convictions for forging prescriptions to feed his own drug addiction was able to continue his career and run a one-man practice.																								Working alone, he was able to stockpile huge amounts of diamorphine  the medical name for heroin  at his home and surgery, ready to use on his often elderly victims. He was finally captured after the daughter of Kathleen Grundy, his last victim, challenged a new will that left all her mothers wealth to Shipman. Her body was exhumed and traces of the fatal dose of heroin were found in her remains.																								Prosecutors at Shipmans trial said his drive to kill was fuelled by his need for a God-like power over life and death. 																								Others say the killer was profoundly affected by the experience of watching his own mother die from cancer  and taking diamorphine to ease her pain.																								The trial judge said his actions were a calculated and cold-blooded perversion of his medical skills. Wakefield prisons statement said the killer had not been on suicide watch at the jail, but had been following a normal pattern of work and education. It said Shipman was alone in his cell when he died.																								Danny Mellor, whose 73-year-old mother Winifred was one of Shipmans last victims, condemned the killer as a coward and said it would now be desperately hard for relatives to live with the mystery. I always harboured the remote possibility that one day I could confront him and ask him why, he said. Now thats been taken away from me. Ann Alexander, a lawyer who represents some of the victims families, said many of them would feel cheated.

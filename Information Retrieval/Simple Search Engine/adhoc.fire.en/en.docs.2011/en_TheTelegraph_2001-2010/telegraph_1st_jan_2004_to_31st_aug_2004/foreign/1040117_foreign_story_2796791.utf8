 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Jackson pleads innocent, fans, family back star
		 Michael Jackson outside the court in Santa  Maria,  California. (AFP)Santa Maria (California), Jan. 16 (Reuters): King of Pop Michael Jackson pleaded innocent to child molestation charges today during a hearing that attracted hundreds of fans who sang and chanted their support outside the courthouse.																								Superior court judge Rodney Melville scolded Jackson for arriving 20 minutes late for the five-minute hearing and warned him not to be tardy again. He set a pre-trial hearing for February 13. 																								Melville read the nine child molestation charges against the 45-year-old star, who quietly answered with his not guilty plea.																								Hundreds of fans from around the world sang songs and chanted support as Jackson and his family members and friends arrived today for the court appearance, his first since being arrested on the charges late last year. The arraignment was the first step in a case that could see Jacksons remarkable career in ruins and send him to prison for years if convicted.																								Jackson, wearing sunglasses and a black suit with a white armband, arrived at the court shortly after 1710 GMT. He left a black sports utility vehicle and was escorted under a black umbrella to the courthouse. En route he shook hands with fans and flashed the peace sign.																								The reclusive pop star is charged with seven counts of committing lewd acts on a boy under the age of 14 and two counts of plying him with alcohol in order to molest him.

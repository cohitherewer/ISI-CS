The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 80 injured in Dhaka clashes
				 	 Police arrest an Awami League activist in Dhaka. (AFP)																								Dhaka, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Opposition activists in Bangladesh attacked railway stations and battled police across the country today on the first day of a two-day strike called to protest against a deadly grenade attack at the weekend.																								More than 80 people were wounded in clashes with police when protesters smashed railway stations and removed tracks to stop trains and attacked government buildings, witnesses and police said.																								Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse anti-government mobs shouting: Punish the bombers.																								The dawn-to-dusk strike was called by the main opposition Awami League after a deadly Saturday grenade attack on a crowd listening to a speech by party president and former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.																								Hasina escaped with minor cuts, but 19 people were killed and about 150 wounded.																								This is a heinous and barbaric attack, foreign minister Morshed Khan said. If we can avoid the blame game, all parties should put their heads together, take stock of the situation and identify the culprits.																								The most high-profile victim, the popular head of the Awami Leagues womens wing, Ivy Rahman, died early today. Ivy Rahmans death intensified the countrywide protest, Abdul Jalil, general secretary of the party, said. The League later said the strike would end early  at noon tomorrow  to allow people to attend Rahmans funeral.																								The secular party, which helped lead Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in 1971, blamed Islamic fundamentalist partners in the four-party ruling coalition for the violence and demanded Prime Minister Khaleda Zia resign.																								The government has rejected the accusations and blamed the attack on groups that want to destabilise Bangladesh.																								The image of Bangladesh as a role model Muslim-majority democracy had taken a short-term hit, foreign minister Khan said.																								This image has taken a temporary hit. he said. In a matter of months Bangladesh will be again resilient and, Inshallah (God willing), we hope we will be able to take the culprits to task.																								Dhaka was open to the idea of foreign help to investigate the blasts but at a later stage and if required, he said.																								Several countries, alarmed at the attack on a former Prime Minister, have offered to help. They include the US, India and Britain.

																								Camp Falcon (Iraq), Jan. 23 (Reuters): No longer afraid of dying, thrilled to be going home and thirsty for a beer.
																								Thats how American soldiers felt today as they handed over control of a Baghdad suburb to fresh troops and prepared to return to the US after nearly a year in Iraq. Im excited, ecstatic about going home. Im going to say hi to my family and then go out and drink a lot of beer, said Private Anthony LaPaglia, 20, from Atlanta, Georgia, a big grin on his face. The troops from the 82nd Airborne Divisions 2nd Brigade are part of a massive rotation just getting under way.
																								Around a quarter of a million American soldiers will move in or out of Iraq over the next four months, their movements complicated by the constant threat that guerrillas will exploit opportunities to attack them as they arrive or depart.
																								At a ceremony inside a cold hanger at the Camp Falcon military base on the outskirts of Baghdad, 100 departing troops in full combat gear joked as they waited for the formal handover. A similar number of newly-arrived soldiers stood nearby, stern-faced and unsmiling.
																								Those leaving said they had never expected to stay in Iraq for nearly a year and would always remember the fear of patrolling Baghdads dangerous streets.
																								Almost every time I went out, every time we got mortared, something could have happened. All I could think of was my family, said Private Caesar Sierra, 19, from Los Angeles. Sierra said there was nothing he would miss about Iraq. What he wanted most, besides seeing his family, was to get sleep and regular food and then hit the beach.
																								Around 3,000 troops from the 2nd Brigade will leave Iraq. Those handing over duties today depart in a few days.

 Wednesday, July 21, 2004 				 Jackson to be father of 4, says report
 Michael Jackson Los Angeles, July 20 (Reuters): Pop star Michael Jackson, facing a trial on child molestation charges, is about to become a father to four more children  quadruplets  by way of a surrogate mother, Us Weekly magazine reported today.																								Citing unnamed sources close to the self-proclaimed King of Pop, the magazine said Jackson recently spent time with the pregnant mother-to-be in Florida, where he stayed in a $4,000-a-night luxury hotel suite in Miami Beach.																								The magazine said Jacksons spokeswoman Raymone Bain declined to confirm or deny the story, saying: We do not respond to these kinds of stories. Bain could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.																								Jackson, 45, already has three children  Prince Michael I and daughter Paris Michael by his former wife, Debbie Rowe, and Prince Michael II, the child he notoriously dangled from the balcony of a Berlin hotel in November 2002.

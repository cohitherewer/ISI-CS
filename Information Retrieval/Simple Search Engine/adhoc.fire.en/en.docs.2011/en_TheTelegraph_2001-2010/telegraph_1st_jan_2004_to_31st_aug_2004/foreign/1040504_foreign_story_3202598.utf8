 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Tigers ready for talks
																								Colombo, May 3 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tiger rebels said today they were ready to resume peace talks with the government if it accepts their proposal for power-sharing, a plan the President has previously rejected.																								The proposal came in a meeting between Tiger representatives and envoys from Norway who are trying to end one of Asias longest civil wars by getting stalled peace talks back on track. The mediators said after a meeting yesterday with President Chandrika Kumaratunga that face-to-face talks were unlikely soon. 																								The Liberation Tigers are fully prepared to resume the negotiations on the same principles and atmosphere as it did with the previous government in Colombo, the leader of the LTTE rebels political wing, S.P. Thamilselvan, was quoted as saying on the Tamilnet website.																								Thamilselvan made the remarks during a meeting in the rebel-held north with the Norwegian representatives.

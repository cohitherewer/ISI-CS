 Tuesday, March 30, 2004  Fine Print				 				 				 																Mobile madness																																	Hong Kong, March 29 (Reuters): A 14-year-old Hong Kong girl flew into a rage and chased her mother around their flat with a knife and wooden pole after she confiscated the teenagers mobile phone, a police spokeswoman said today.																																	The terrified mother locked herself in the bedroom and police arrived at the scene on Saturday to see the girl in a frenzy, hacking at the door with the knife. They had to use pepper spray to subdue the girl before they could rescue the mother, the police said. The mother sustained slight injury to her arm, but no charges were made. Social workers are now handling the case.																													 																Credit cutBerlin (Reuters): A German man was arrested for credit card theft after trying to buy 76 euros ($90) worth of beer and cigarettes at a fuel station with a stolen card that belonged to the cashier, Berlin police said on Monday. When I looked at the credit card I saw it was my name, the 33-year-old named Heiko told Berlins B.Z. newspaper. He locked the man inside the shop and called the police. He said he had recently ordered a credit card but it never arrived in the post. It was not a common name, so there was no chance of coincidence, the police said.																													 																Sick slice																																	Phnom Penh (Reuters): A Cambodian man cut off his penis when he said he was visited by four hungry spirits in a dream and he had no chicken or duck to offer them. According to the police, 33-year-old Soun Ney told the spirits to go away when they first appeared to ask for food, and waved his penis at them in defiance. Devils, I dont have any chicken or duck for you, he was quoted as saying by local police chief Phoeung Vat. If you want to eat anything, you can eat my penis. Soun Ney said the spirits agreed to eat his penis. He was rushed to a hospital near Phnom Penh after he castrated himself with a butchers knife. He is lucky to be alive, Vat said.

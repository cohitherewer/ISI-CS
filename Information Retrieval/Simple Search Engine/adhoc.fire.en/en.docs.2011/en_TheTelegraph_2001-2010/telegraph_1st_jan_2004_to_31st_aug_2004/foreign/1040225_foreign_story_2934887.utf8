 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Alec, Kim spar in court
																								Los Angeles, Feb. 24 (Agencies): Former Hollywood celebrity couple Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger have been reunited in a courtroom where they sparred over a bitter child-custody battle.																								In clearing his courtroom before the trial began, Superior Court judge Roy Paul said he had to consider the possible harm news coverage could inflict on the girl, Ireland, as the pair battled over issues stemming from their divorce.																								We have an eight-year-old child who is the subject of this dispute, Paul said. 																								The detrimental effects to her outweigh the right of the public to be present.																								Before ejecting about a half-dozen reporters and several members of the public, Paul said he would open doors again for portions of the trial that did not concern Ireland.																								Basinger and Baldwin were both in court but sat at opposite ends of a long table, separated by three attorneys, and did not appear to speak or make eye contact during the brief time that reporters were allowed in court. 																								An attorney for Basinger, 50, began the court session by arguing that the entire trial should be conducted behind closed doors because theres going to be a media frenzy and the person who is going to be most affected is Ireland. Baldwins lawyer, Vicki Greene, agreed and said much of the hearing would discuss confidential documents relating to the girls welfare.																								While the former couple appeared to agree on nothing else, they agreed that media should be barred. Basinger won an Academy Award for best supporting actress the 1997 film LA Confidential. Baldwin, 45, is nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar this year for his role in The Cooler.																								In an interview, Baldwin called The Cooler a nice little film made out of nothing. It is better than they had any right to make, he said. Better than you could have ever expected.

 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Rapists wife eyes share of jackpot
																								London, Aug. 12: The wife of the convicted rapist who won 7 million on the National Lottery is considering suing him to get a share of the cash to distribute among his victims. 																								Irene Hoare, 55, from Middlesbrough, said that she did not realise her husband, whom she married in 1993 after she became a prison penpal, was a rapist. 																								Iorworth Hoare told his wife he was a bank robber and she married him in a prison chapel, she claims. The marriage foundered after he was moved to prisons too far away for her to visit him. Although Irene Hoare has not seen her husband for nine years, she could be entitled to a share of the Lotto winnings because the couple are not divorced. 																								She said: Ill try to give any money I get to deserving causes, like the women he attacked and organisations that look after rape victims. She said that although she had to go to hospital to have her wedding ring sawn off because her joints had swollen, she eventually forgot about her husband and needing a divorce. Not a penny																								Home secretary David Blunkett said today he wanted to ensure Iorworth Hoare should not get a penny of it while in prison.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 US outlines case against UK radical
																								London, July 23 (Reuters): US government lawyers seeking to extradite a radical Muslim cleric told a British court today he hated the West and had links with the al Qaida.																								Abu Hamza al-Masri is accused of plotting to create an al Qaida training camp in the US and giving material support and resources to terrorists in Yemen. Outlining the US case against him, lawyer James Lewis told Belmarsh magistrates court in east London there was enough evidence to extradite him.																								Abu Hamza advocated hatred and violence towards the West and specifically the US and had often referred to the United States as the United Snakes of America, he said.																								An 11-count American indictment also accuses the cleric, an open admirer of Osama bin Laden, of having a role in a 1998 hostage-taking attack in Yemen in which four people were killed.																								If convicted by a US court, the Egyptian-born cleric could face the death penalty or up to 100 years in jail. Britain, however, abolished capital punishment in 1965 and has said it will only extradite him if the US gives assurances the death penalty will not be imposed.

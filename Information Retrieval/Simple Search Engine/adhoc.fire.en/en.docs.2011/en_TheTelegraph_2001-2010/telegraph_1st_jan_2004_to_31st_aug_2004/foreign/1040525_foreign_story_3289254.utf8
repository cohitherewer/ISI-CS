The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Israel tanks pull out from Rafah 
																								Rafah (Gaza Strip), May 24 (Reuters): Israeli forces withdrew from two key neighbourhoods of a Gaza refugee camp today, leaving behind a swathe of destruction after killing 42 Palestinians in a six-day siege that drew international outrage.																								As the army loosened its grip on the Rafah camp and thousands of mourners chanted for revenge, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon lobbied hardline ministers over a gradual Gaza pullout plan he intends to put to a cabinet vote next week. 																								Wary residents venturing out in the Tel Sultan and Brazil districts begged for water as they confronted demolished homes, flattened greenhouses and torn-up streets flowing with raw sewage after Israeli tanks rumbled out.																								The army also lifted a blockade that had cut Rafah off from the rest of the Gaza Strip for nearly a week, saying it was easing conditions for the beleaguered population. But it kept a small force in the Kishta neighbourhood of the crowded camp.																								Tel Sultan and Brazil were the main targets of Israels largest Gaza raid in years.

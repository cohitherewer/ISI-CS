 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Explorer speeds towards Mars
				 	 The Mars Exploration Rover, Spirit, is shown in an undated artists drawing released by Nasa. (Reuters)																								Pasadena, Calif, Jan. 3 (Reuters): A rock-inspecting rover hurtled toward Mars for a perilous landing today on what Nasa hopes will become a historic mission to answer the age-old question of whether life existed on the red planet.																								The robotic explorers arrival on Mars would be the climax of a weekend of interplanetary discovery after a US spacecraft yesterday gathered particles from a comet in a first that could give scientists clues about how Earth began.																								Scientists from the US space agency anxiously monitored the Spirit Rovers approach to the rugged Martian landscape for a bouncing landing scheduled for 0435 GMT on Sunday.																								A second rover, nicknamed Opportunity, is expected to land on the other side of the Red Planet in three weeks.																								The rovers, which were launched in June and July, have been travelling through space tucked inside a folded-up lander, which is wrapped in deflated air bags inside a protective shell.																								As each lander heads toward the planets surface by parachute, it should jettison the shell and inflate the air bags, allowing the craft to bounce safely for up to 1 km before coming to a stop. But the landing is not without risk.																								One gust of wind, one sharp pointy rock and we could have a really bad night, Steve Squyres, principal scientist for the rover at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, said.																								The laboratory is fresh from one success. Yesterday, it celebrated a milestone when another spacecraft, Stardust, survived a wild ride inside a gas and debris field surrounding the comet and returned vivid images of its pitted nucleus to scientists.																								The cometary particles, believed to be among the oldest and most primitive material in the solar system, will be returned to Earth in 2006 for study.																								The Spirit Rover is expected to touch down inside the Gusev crater, an impact crater bigger than the US state of Connecticut that may have once held a lake.																								The landing sequence takes the spacecraft from 19,000 kph to a full stop in six minutes, and must be executed flawlessly, Ed Weiler, Nasas associate administrator for space science, said: Its going to be six minutes from hell ... its going to be high anxiety.																								Mars is an incredibly difficult place to land ... some call it the death planet, Weiler added.

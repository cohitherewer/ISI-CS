 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Minorities not happy with Tory crime plan
																								London, Aug. 10 (Reuters): The Opposition Conservative Party launched its crime-cutting strategy for the next general election today with a pledge to do away with politically correct nonsense that drew criticism from minority groups.																								Conservative leader Michael Howard said bureaucracy and paperwork were wasting police time and undermining the fight against crime. The clear distinction between right and wrong has been lost in sociological mumbo-jumbo and politically correct nonsense, said Howard, a veteran Right-winger and a former home secretary.																								Under a Conservative government, police would not have to take a record and issue a receipt for every person they stop and search, Howard said.																								Recording every stop-and-search incident was a key recommendation in a damning report into the 1993 murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence.																								Lawrence was stabbed to death by a gang of White youths in an unprovoked attack. Police failed to prosecute the suspected killers and retired judge William Macpherson accused officers of institutional racism in his report in 1999. Howard said the Conservatives would not implement the Macpherson recommendation on stop-and-search.																								Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, which encourages ethnic minorities to engage in democracy, told BBC Radio the Conservatives pledge was deeply disappointing. The stop-and-search policy was often humiliating and degrading and a failure to implement the Macpherson recommendation would be a blow to race relations, Woolley said.																								Crime and anti-social behaviour are set to be key issues in a general election expected next year, and Howard said violent crime had soared under the Labour government of Tony Blair.																								There is now a palpable sense of outrage that so-called human rights have tipped the balance of justice in favour of the criminal and the wrong-doer, rather than the victim and the law abider, Howard said.

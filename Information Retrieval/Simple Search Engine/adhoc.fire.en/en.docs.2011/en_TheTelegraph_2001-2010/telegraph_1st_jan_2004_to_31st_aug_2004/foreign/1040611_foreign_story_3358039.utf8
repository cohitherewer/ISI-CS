 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Biggest cross-border vote starts

(Reuters)																								London, June 10 (Reuters): The British and the Dutch kicked off the biggest cross-border ballot in history today with European Union elections that look certain to embarrass governments across the 25-nation bloc.																								Over four days until Sunday, nearly 349 million Europeans in the newly enlarged EU are eligible to vote for the 732-member European Parliament.																								Turned off by Brussels and focused on national issues, voters appear set to deliver protest votes to many leaders  if they can be bothered to turn out. In Britain and the Netherlands, the only nations to vote today, electors showed little passion for European affairs as they cast ballots in a trickle from early morning. I was mostly thinking about my back yard today, said London cyclist Melanie Marwick, 27, for whom traffic is the big issue.																								Amsterdam restaurant owner Fared Assarte  like many across Europe  was far more interested in the impending Euro 2004 soccer championship. I am going to vote, although for me... it is all like a fog from Brussels, he said.																								Britains Super Thursday poll, so-called because it includes elections for local councils and for a London mayor, was shaping into a protest vote against Prime Minister Tony Blair for his support of the US-led war in Iraq.																								I am sending a message to Tony Blair that we are not happy, consultant Edward Lord, 42, said on his way to vote.																								Blair is universally predicted to fare badly today and that will inevitably fuel speculation about his leadership. 																								But most analysts still see him winning a third general election, expected in 2005, despite public disquiet over Iraq and his closeness to US President George W. Bush.																								In the Netherlands, the Centre-Right coalition government of Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende was in a close battle with the Opposition Labour Party as domestic issues like the economy, jobs and spending cuts dominated.																								The Netherlands was to release provisional results  the first country to do so  despite a row with the European Commission over making them public before the rest of the bloc has finished voting on Sunday. The commission has threatened legal action.																								Britains local election results were to start coming in soon after polls close at 2100 GMT. London mayor results  where maverick Left-winger Ken Livingstone is seeking re-election for Blairs Labour Party which once expelled him  were expected late tomorrow. EU parliament vote results are due from late on Sunday.																								Like Blair, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was expected to pay for his support of war in Iraq. 																								Among incumbents, only Spains recently elected Socialist Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, was likely to win a show of support from voters delighted by his swift move to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq.

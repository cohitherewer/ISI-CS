 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Flu not yet in control, says WHO as toll rises to 22
																								Bangkok, Feb. 18 (Reuters): Asias human bird flu toll rose to 22 today as Thailand and Vietnam reported deaths from the disease ravaging poultry flocks across the region and the WHO pleaded with governments not to rush to declare it under control.																								This virus is still spreading no matter what some authorities are saying about it being under control. It is spreading on a daily basis, the WHOs Manila-based spokesman Peter Cordingley said. Hardest-hit Thailand and Vietnam, where all the human cases have been reported, are talking about declaring victory over the virulent H5N1 virus in a matter of weeks.																								Cordingley said doing that would carry great risks.																								If you re-stock too soon and the virus is still in the environment and you get a second infection in a re-stocked flock, then you have an endemic situation where the virus is embedded in the region and risk a recurrence every flu season, he said.																								We all got a lesson of what just happened in Thailand, he said after the Bangkok government announced the virus was still present in eight areas in which all poultry had been slaughtered and had spread to a new region. We dont want anybody declaring this is over, Cordingley said after the slaughter of 80 million poultry in the eight Asian countries afflicted by the H5N1 virus.

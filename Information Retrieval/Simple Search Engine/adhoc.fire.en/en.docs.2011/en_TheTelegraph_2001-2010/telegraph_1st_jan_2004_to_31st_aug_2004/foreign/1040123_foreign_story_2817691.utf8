 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Nasa loses contact with Mars rover
 Pasadena (California), Jan.  22 (Reuters): Nasa scientists said today they had lost  contact with the robot rover Spirit on Mars and were unsure  what had caused the problem.																								Spirit project manager Pete Theisinger told a news briefing that there was a very serious anomaly in communications with the six-wheeled craft, which landed on Mars on January 3 on a planned three-month mission to explore the geologic history of the planet.																								Theisinger said scientists had been unable to communicate with Spirit for about 24 hours and had so far been unable to explain the source of the problem. There is not one single fault that explains this, Theisinger said, adding that mission scientists had worked throughout the night on scenarios ranging from a major power failure to a software or memory corruption.																								Mission managers said Spirit was not completely dead, and had sent out a communication beep and default signals. But they said several attempts since yesterday afternoon to send commands to the rover and to receive data from it via the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter and the Mars Odyssey orbiter had failed.																								The grim news dampened the elated atmosphere at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where mission controllers have delighted up until now at the virtually flawless landing on Mars. Spirit last week began its first tentative journeys sampling the surface soil of the Gusev Crater  a barren, wind-swept basin.																								The first hitch in the mission came yesterday when a thunderstorm in Canberra, Australia, prevented mission controllers from transmitting command sequences from the Canberra large dish antenna complex to Spirit.																								Project managers initially seemed unconcerned at the setback but are now examining whether the communications glitch may have contributed to the more serious problems with Spirit. Mission managers said today that the Spirit communications problems would have no effect on the scheduled arrival on Sunday of Spirits twin exploration rover, Opportunity.

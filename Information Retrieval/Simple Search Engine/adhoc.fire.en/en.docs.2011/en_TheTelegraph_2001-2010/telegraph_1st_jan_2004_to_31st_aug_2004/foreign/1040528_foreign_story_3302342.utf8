 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Pervez lifts veil on very junior army plot
				 	 Pervez Musharraf																								Islamabad, May 27 (Reuters): Pakistans President and army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, said junior army and air force personnel were involved in attempts to kill him last December.																								Speaking to private Pakistani television channel Geo in an interview broadcast today, Musharraf said several personnel had been arrested and would soon be tried in open court.																								Musharraf said all those involved were very junior and there had been no involvement of senior military figures. There are some people in uniform, junior level, people in uniform, air force and army, he said.																								He said the men were directly involved in the first of two attacks on him, on December 14, when an explosion blew up a bridge in the city of Rawalpindi near Islamabad moments after his motorcade passed over it.																								He said the men were not directly involved in a second attack, also in Rawalpindi on December 25, in which 15 died, but did not make clear whether they had participated in any way.																								Diplomats have long suspected that the December attacks, both of which involved powerful explosions detonated close to Musharrafs motorcade, must have been carried out with the help of inside knowledge of the Presidents movements.																								Some Islamic elements in the army are thought to be angry about Musharrafs policy of backing the US-led war on terror and concerned about his moves towards peace with India.																								Asked if he was concerned that some senior ranks might have been involved, Musharraf replied: No, no, not at all. Hundred per cent sure. Two hundred per cent sure.																								Musharraf said all those involved in the attacks, apart from the Pakistani mastermind and the two suicide bombers who carried out the second, had been arrested. Musharraf declined to name the mastermind, whom he described as very clever, saying it would compromise the investigation. But we will get him, he said.																								Military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan declined to say how many military personnel were being held or what they were charged with. But he said the number was less than 10.																								None of them is of officer rank  all of them are junior people, privates or corporal, he said. Musharraf suggested that religion was not the motivation of some suspects. Some of them are for money, he said.																								Shaukat said Musharraf had reiterated that Osama bin Ladens al Qaida had been the overall mastermind. But the spokesman said this did not mean al Qaida had infiltrated the military.																								He did explain that there is a mastermind in al Qaida somewhere, some foreigner, and he is the mastermind who had recruited some local Pakistani who recruited the guys to work for him, Shaukat said.																								So those people who were working for him, whether in the air force or army, might not have known exactly who they were working for. Al Qaida has vowed to overthrow Musharraf and in March the President said a Libyan linked to the network was a prime suspect in the plots against him. He did not identify the man.																								In February, authorities arrested a Tunisian, Khalifa bin Hussain, and a Pakistani, in connection with the attacks.																								They and other suspects have been linked by police to Jaish-e-Mohammad (Army of Mohammad), an outlawed militant group which carries out terrorist attacks in Kashmir.																								In the past 10 days, authorities have arrested seven members of Harkat-ul Mujahideen al-Alami, an al-Qaida-linked group that tried to assassinate Musharraf in 2002.

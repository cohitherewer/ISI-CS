 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Christians, Sikhs unite against France ban
 PHILIP DELVES BROUGHTON				 	 A girl protests against Frances scarf and religious symbols ban in Paris. (AP) Bobigny (France), Jan. 24:  Christians from Iraq and Sikhs from India expressed outrage  yesterday at French government plans to ban the wearing  of religious symbols in school  a move which could force  them to hide their crucifixes and swap their turbans for  shower caps.																								Everything was fine until they decided to have this law, said Joseph Adlun, the head of the Association of French Assyro-Chaldeans, a Christian community which originates from ancient Mesopotamia.																								Now theyre trying to create confrontations between us and other communities. Were Catholics, we acknowledge the Pope and when dealing with the state we are secular. Why are they picking on us?																								Slipping into Aramaic, the language of Christ, he summoned one of his young colleagues, Ayten Karatay, who produced a small silver cross from inside her jumper. Can they really want to ban this? said M Adlun. Its ridiculous. 																								In Britain if you talk about being part of a community, its a good thing. In France, if you talk about your religious or ethnic community it is bad, it means youre trying to ghetto-ise and fracture society.																								The Sikh community is similarly agitated since Frances education minister, Luc Ferry, proposed that Sikh boys be banned from wearing turbans to school. He suggested they wear a transparent hat, like a shower cap.																								If they make me take off my turban, I will not go to school, said Bikramjit Singh, 17, who was born in France. In England, Sikh policemen can wear their turbans. In Germany, Sikhs can ride scooters without their helmets. Every other Western country respects our turban as part of our faith. I will have to finish my schooling elsewhere.																								His uncle, Gurdial Singh, 50, a magnificently bearded and turbanned builder, agrees. When I arrived in France in 1980 from India, people were very warm and friendly. They were curious about my religion. Recently, I went to the Eiffel Tower and people called me bin Laden. Now were confused with the Muslims. Were caught in the middle of all these problems. If they try to make us remove our turbans, it will be shameful for us and for France. 																								Dravinder Singh, the head of the Bobigny Sikh association, said: I would no more take off my turban in public than you would walk naked down the street. Id prefer to leave this country than remove my turban.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

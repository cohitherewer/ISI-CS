 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 American pilot burns finger
				 	 US pilot Dale Robin Hirsch in Sao Paulo. (AFP) Sao Paulo, Jan. 15 (Reuters):  An American Airlines pilot was arrested at Sao Paulo International  Airport yesterday after making an obscene gesture while  being photographed by Brazilian immigration officers, police  said.																								The pilot, Dale Robin Hirsch, raised his middle finger at police while undergoing recently introduced Brazilian security measures that require US citizens to be fingerprinted and photographed upon entering the South American country. Local media said the 52-year-old pilot was fined $12,775 and released, but his passport was confiscated pending receipt of the payment. 																								American Airlines had agreed to pay, they reported. Brazils decision to implement the policy on January 1 in retaliation for a similar US programme to fingerprint and photograph visitors who need visas for the US has soured relations between the two countries.																								He (Hirsch) behaved in a mocking manner toward federal police and made an internationally recognised obscene gesture while he was was being photographed for identification, Sao Paulos police chief Francisco Baltazar da Silva said.																								Ten crew members from the same American Airlines flight 907 from Miami were also denied entry to Brazil after refusing to cooperate with security officials. They were waiting in the airport for a return flight to the US, police said. American Airlines expressed regrets. 																								The company apologises to the Brazilian government, the airport authorities, the police, or anyone else who perceived anything they believed to have been disrespectful, the airline said in a statement. 																								The captain and other crew members certainly meant no disrespect. The incident came a day after  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva appealed to  US President George W. Bush to suspend visa requirements  so the two countries could drop the fingerprint checks.

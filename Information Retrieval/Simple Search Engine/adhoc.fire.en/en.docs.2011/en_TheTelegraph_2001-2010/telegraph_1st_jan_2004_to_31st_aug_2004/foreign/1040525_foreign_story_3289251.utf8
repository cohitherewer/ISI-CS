The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 My David never cheated: Posh
				 	 Victoria BeckhamLondon, May 24 (Reuters): English soccer star David Beckham was never unfaithful and is a home-lover who prefers watching TV gardening shows to pornography, his pop star wife Victoria told a glossy magazine this week.																								I know my Davids never cheated on me, she said in the Marie Claire interview in response to allegations Beckham had affairs with his former personal assistant and a model.																								I really do believe deep down that I have the most faithful husband I could hope for, she said in the interview to be published on Thursday and reported in British newspapers today.																								The English soccer captain and Real Madrid star had already dismissed reports he slept with Rebecca Loos as ludicrous. 																								And the Beckhams said they called in lawyers after Malaysian-born Sarah Marbeck also said she had an affair with him.																								Far from wanting to play away, Victoria, still known as Posh Spice to fans of the 1990s girl band the Spice Girls, said Beckham would love to be a house-husband if he wasnt the worlds most famous footballer.																								And she poked fun at press reports which had said Loos enjoyed watching pornography, saying Beckham preferred the British gardening makeover show Ground Force.																								We got into bed the other night and he put on the TV, Victoria Beckham said. And whats he watching? Ground Force. I said to him: But I heard youre really into porn! But he just loves Ground Force and Ready Steady Cook.																								The Beckhams announced last week that Victoria and their two children would move to Spain to be with David, who left Manchester United to play for Real Madrid for 35 million euros ($42 million) last year.																								She denied speculation she had stayed with David to make money from the Beckham brand. 																								I couldnt live a lie and it would be unfair on our children, she told the magazine.																								We are working on things together, but it is absolutely not a business arrangement.

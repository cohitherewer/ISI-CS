The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 18, 2004 							 																						TWAS A FAMOUS VICTORYIndias cricket tour of Pakistan was a double success. It made the relationship between the two countries warmer and brought India a historic victoryThe battle of Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington famously remarked, was won on the playing fields of Eton. Taking a lead from that comment, it can be said that the unfinished battles of 1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999 were won on the cricket ground of Rawalpindi. The military encounters between India and Pakistan were all incomplete with the results slightly in Indias favour while the battles on the cricket pitch since 1952 have been in favour of Pakistan. India, till Friday afternoon, had never won a test match in Pakistan, let alone a test series. But all this is now history. India won decisively this time round in Pakistan, defeating the home team not only in the test matches but also in the one day internationals. When the team went out from India, amidst unprecedented security cover, very few predicted this outcome. Most Indian cricket fans were cheerfully pessimistic because Indian cricket teams seldom perform to their full potential against Pakistan. But this team, buoyant because of its youth and confident because of its unexpectedly good showing Down Under, is made of different stuff. In both versions of the game, they played well and won convincingly. There is good cause to rejoice after the triumph against a traditional rival but the jubilation should not take away from the context.																														The context was defined by the opposition. This, by any reckoning, was not a top class Pakistan side. The bowling was average. Pakistan had no world class bowler save Shoaib Akhtar and no outstanding batsmen except Inzamam-ul Haq. Talent was visible but there was no experience to bolster that talent. Captaincy was also below par. The days of Imran Khan, Waqar Younis, Sarfaraz Nawaz, Abdul Qadir, Majid Khan, Zaheer Abbas, Javed Miandad, Rameez Raza et al suddenly seemed very far away and remote. The Pakistan team, as Imran Khan noted on television, seemed to have begun on the defensive. Cricket, they say, is as much a game of the mind as of brawn. In contrast was the storehouse of batting talent in the Indian side. What the bowling lacked in skill, it made up in enthusiasm. These, and the fact that Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid scored when the team most required runs, made all the difference. In the most important but most neglected department of the game, fielding, both teams were deplorable. India, to take an example, floored as many as seven chances on the last day of the Rawalpindi test match. Victory should not be allowed to obscure these aspects of the series.																														Cricket was not the only point on the agenda of this tour. It was a goodwill tour and the cricketers, apart from playing the game, were also proxy diplomats. On this front, the tour was an unqualified success. Cricket, like ping pong in the Seventies between China and the United States of America, has begun the process of changing the nature of Indo-Pak relations. The time is not far when no more battles between India and Pakistan will be necessary and playing fields will only be just fields to play on.

		 Friday, March 05, 2004 							 																						BENGALS GRIMACING WOMEN																														A PORTRAIT OF THE HINDUS: BALTHAZAR SOLVYNS amp; THE EUROPEAN IMAGE OF INDIA 1760-1824 (Oxford and Mapin, Rs 3,950) by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr, is a lavish edition, with detailed annotations and a scholarly introduction, which combines this Flemish artists invaluable collection of etchings published from Calcutta in the 1790s, and then from Paris between 1808 and 1812 as Les Hindos. Solvynss portrayal of Bengals festivals are the most complex, and his commentary delightfully observant and uncomprehending. This is the bisarjan of Kali, titled Busso-jun: the throwing the images of gods into the river. About Kali putting out her tongue, Solvyns observes, This would be in conformity to the custom of the Hindoo women who make that grimace where any thing affects them disagreeably and even when they do or say any thing improper. Solvyns mistakenly calls the goddess Calkee, and describes her as the genius of evil.

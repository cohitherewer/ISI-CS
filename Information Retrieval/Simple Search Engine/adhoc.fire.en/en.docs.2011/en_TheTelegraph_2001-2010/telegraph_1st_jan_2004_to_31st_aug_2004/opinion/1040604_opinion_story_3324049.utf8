Manohar, Rs 450The 1998 Indo-Pak nuclear tests had let the nuclear genie out of the bottle in the two south Asian states. The explosions in Pokhran and Chagai had resulted in a public debate among Indian and American scholars. This volume is the fruit of these deliberations.																														The essayists here argue that in order to assess the consequences of nuclearization, non-south Asian countries must also be taken into account. Sonika Gupta and Arpit Rajain, emphasizing Indias tense relationship with China and Beijings strategic partnership with Islamabad, integrate south Asia and China into a single region, which they term southern Asia. In this regard, Jasjit Singhs essay, which takes in all south east Asian countries, is valuable because of Indias recent attempts to build bridges with these countries and thereby neutralize China.																														Gupta and Rajain argue that in order to understand the nuclear politics of southern Asia, inter-state and intra-state politics must be taken into account since they have a bearing on the governments nuclear stand. But most of the essays deal with the role of foreign policy in charting the trajectories of nuclear programmes in these countries.																														Ashley J. Tellis, echoing Atal Bihari Vajpayee, argues that Indias current nuclear stand is a continuation of its earlier policies. Owing to the nuclearization of India and Pakistan, Tellis continues, conventional warfare is no longer possible between them. Probably he is hinting that the next war between India and Pakistan would be a nuclear one. However, in an interview General V. P. Malik, indicates that a limited conventional war between India and Pakistan is still possible. 																														Raja Menon writes that Indias lack of a coherent nuclear doctrine and its advocacy of a minimum credible deterrent contradict the attempt to nuclearize air, land and sea delivery platforms. Rounding off the arguments, Rajesh M. Basrur says that India is yet to perceive its nuclear capacity in military-strategic terms.																														The essays in this volume suggest that, unlike China, politicians in the subcontinent are not too good at handling a nuclear crisis. Further, they undermine the reality of a Chinese threat and instead seem to preferAmerican intervention. The only exception to this is G. Balachandran, who argues that the threat of nukes falling into the wrong hands, of nuclear proliferation by terrorists, is higher in Europe than in south Asia. 																														The collection, which has essays by some famous names, does not offer anything substantial. Moreover, the essays seem to have been written without much care. For instance, Telliss insipid essay is in marked contrast to his more incisive Indias emerging nuclear posture. Increasingly, books on nuclear politics are characterized by a lack of substantial research and conceptual creativity. This volume is indicative of this trend.						KAUSHIK ROY

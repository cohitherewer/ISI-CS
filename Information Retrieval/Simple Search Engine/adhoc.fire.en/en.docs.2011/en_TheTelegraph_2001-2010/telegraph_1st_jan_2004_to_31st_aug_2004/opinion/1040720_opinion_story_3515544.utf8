		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 							 																						AQUA NATURAL																														Equality, however desirable in society, is not a condition in nature. Not all areas are equally blessed with natures bounties. In a country the size of India, where natural conditions vary greatly, differences between two states, even adjoining ones, can be marked. Take the example of Punjab and Rajasthan. One is Indias granary and the other contains Indias only desert. Punjab is watered, as the name itself indicates, by five rivers, Rajasthan has none. Sand predominates in one, wheat in the other. To overcome this inequality, an agreement was signed under the aegis of Indira Gandhi by which Punjab was to share its water resources with Haryana and Rajasthan. To further this sharing, the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal was begun the same year. This agreement was never quite accepted by the people of Punjab and the political groups of that state. The Punjab end of the canal was stalled by agitations while Haryana has completed its own part of the canal. But the dispute has now acquired a different dimension with the Punjab termination of agreements bill, 2004 which was passed unanimously in the Punjab assembly. The passing of the bill came two days before the Supreme Court deadline for the Centre to take over the completion of the Punjab portion of the canal.																														There has been a pronounced tendency to condemn the Punjab government for the termination of the agreement about the sharing of the waters. Most of the criticism has dwelt on legal niceties. The more important and unpleasant fact is that the 1982 agreement was patently unfair. None of the five rivers of Punjab runs through either Rajasthan or Haryana. The question of Punjab sharing the waters of its rivers with the two states is an irrelevant one. Haryana and Rajasthan have no claims whatsoever on the Punjab waters. The parallel with the dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the Cauvery waters is an entirely spurious one. In the southern case, the river in question passes through both the states and hence the disbursement of water between the two states can be open to discussion and negotiation. This is emphatically not the case with the Punjab rivers. The federal structure of the Indian polity would suggest that Punjab should be allowed to enjoy and maximize its own natural resources. Other states cannot have a claim on those resources but they can have access to them by paying an adequate price. The logic of the free market and of federalism should prevail for the Punjab waters. To do otherwise would be unfair and would also violate the logic of federalism in favour of centralization.

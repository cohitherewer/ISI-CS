The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 							 																						A BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUE Gouri Chatterjee																					He was of course a stickler for routine and this was a habit that went back to his struggling teenage days. But that was not the only reason that drove this former colleague, now happily retired in the hills, to the neighbourhood bazaar every single morning of his working life. You cant be a journalist otherwise, he used to admonish his lazy juniors. Theres no better way to find out what people are thinking. His parting gift  blithely ignored at that point  was to warn his fellow scribes about the sharp rise in onion prices, months before the so-called onion elections.																					That was how journalism used to be. It was important to know what mattered to people. And nothing concentrates the mind of the poor and the middle class alike as rising prices. But today, well-heeled editors and newsroom bosses, sitting in their air-conditioned chambers, are shocked into such a development only when the government announces a sudden jump in the rate of inflation. Ordinary people, especially those with fixed incomes like pensioners, may have been muttering about it for months now, but that hardly qualifies them to be newsmakers.																					Inflation, it would appear from the way the press has been tracking the governments activities over the last few weeks, is primarily an administrative issue, at best a political issue, but hardly a bread-and-butter issue. It matters because it matters to the government. Its interesting because a reputedly apolitical prime minister has pulled out politics to deal with the problem. Its piquant because the team that reined in the runaway inflation in the early Nineties was back in action. Its ominous because it might end the low interest rate regime that has so helped the businessmens profit margins. It holds promise because it might become an issue in next months Maharashtra elections. And it is quite incidental how the common man is affected in the process.																					Whose turn?																					More than a month has gone by since the saffron-tainted Deepak Chaurasia was gently eased out of DD News but theres still no news on who is going to sit in his vacant chair. All sorts of names are being bandied about. A quasi-academic with a background in journalism has told friends that he has turned down the offer because he has too much on his plate. A former television anchor known for his anti-BJP views is supposedly the front-runner. But a senior reporter with a Delhi newspaper and said to be close to the Congress party is also in the running.																					But the real competition is coming from within. Information officers (those who join the Central information service as part of the administrative allied services and go on to pen those boring, TASS-style government handouts) are most upset at the idea of the post, traditionally their preserve, going away to outsiders. So they are lobbying hard to keep it to themselves.																					The minister of information and broadcasting, whose motto seems to be nothing ventured nothing lost, has, true to character, not indicated what his preferences are. Now, political leaders prefer a journalist  or a professional  for such posts. After all, a trained journalist does provide Doordarshan with the best chance of survival in todays competitive media scene, even if the most biddable hack may never be as servile as a bureaucrat. Well know what Jaipal Reddy thinks is a lesser evil if and when he makes up his mind.																					Secret of selling sex																					Cosmo, Cosmopolitan to the unversed, is going in for a makeover: more men, less sex. Its not easy to sell sex when letting it all hang out is no longer a novelty.

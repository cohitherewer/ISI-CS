		 Friday, August 20, 2004 							 																						THE QUESTION REMAINS				 	 New woman TALKING OF POWER: EARLY WRITINGS OF BENGALI  WOMEN FROM THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY TO THE BEGINNING OF  THE TWENTIETH CENTURY Edited by Malini Bhattacharya and  Abhijit Sen, Stree, Rs 450 The ball is finally in the other court. Almost 15 years after the publication of Recasting Women: Essays in Colonial History in 1989, Talking of Power directly engages with one of the essays in this volume, Partha Chatterjees The Nationalist Resolution of the Womens Question. It also carries forward the argument in its attempt to trace the pre-history of the concept of womensempowerment. 																					In her introduction, Malini Bhattacharya says that the central theme of the book is the construction of certain ideas of womens power as it evolved in this crucial phase of history when the need arose to readjust structures of gender relationships as power relationships. (Arent gender relationships always power relationships?)																					But what was happening during the later decades of the 19th century? This was when the womens cause suddenly disappeared from the nationalist agenda, followed by what seemed like a backlash of conservatism. Historians have argued that the pressing demands of nationalist politics cut short the modernization process. Chatterjee challenged this postulate, arguing that the change can be explained by nationalisms resolution of the womens question in keeping with its preferred goals. The new woman of colonial India, with her selective exposure to Westernization, distinct dress and food habits, circumscribed role within the home and outside, was now subjected to the hegemony of the new patriarchy.																					Bhattacharya does not disagree with the fact that the face of patriarchy had changed. What she disagrees with is the presumed passivity of the female subjects as receptors of this hegemonic design. She argues, The womens question...is not resolved within the nationalist discourse, rather the presence of the literate, articulate, elite woman within this discourse creates new tensions in the texture of gender relationships....Women are seen to seek power not merely to address the revised needs of the home, but for self-development, to effectively critique the inequities of their social condition, and even to forge their own direction in the political struggle  something beyond what was envisaged by the givers of power. Traces of this agency are found in the writings of 16 lekhikas this anthology translates, some for the first time.																					Among them are the earliest women writers (Bamasundari and Kailashbashini), women of elite Brahmo families like Swarnakumari Devi and her two daughters  Hiranmoyee and Sarala Devi, women from Hindu families like Girindramohini, Krishnabhabhini, Muslim writers Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and Khairunnissa Khatun, and the unknown Jagadishwari and Kusumkumari Devi. 																					They redefine the goal of education for their intellectual freedom, question the relevance of tradition, of woman-worship, answer male allegations of Westernization, justify their dress sense on the basis of propriety, prescribe economic freedom for women and even their sexual freedom. Their only limitation is the overarching presence of class hegemony which they cannot transcend.																					But were the concepts of power as tangible to these women as Talking would have us believe? Isnt it reading too much into the beginning of the growth of self-awareness?						CHIROSREE BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 							 																						BREACH																													OF																													TRUST Everything seemed to be going fine for this poster boy of banking reforms. Until the elections brought down Ramesh Gellis most powerful ally STEP BY STEPThe RBI action: 
	 Three months moratorium on GTB
	 Three new directors on its board
	 Depositors may withdraw up to Rs 10,000 at a time
	 ATMs closed.When fortunes turn, the financial whiz kids tend to perform spiritual U-turns. Ivan Boesky said hed become a rabbi and Michael Milken herded poor children to baseball games. 																														So does Ramesh Gelli, who has managed to erase the middle name from the bank he created, Global Trust Bank (GTB). My career as a banker is over. I may pursue academics or be a mentor to new entrepreneurs, he said in an interview after GTBs collapse last week, from his prominent villa, known for its celebrity parties and its famous collection of crystals, on Hyderabads Banjara Hills. 																														With the closed sign hung on the banks 103 branches and 276 ATMs, and its transactions put on a three-month moratorium before its merger with the state-owned Oriental Bank of Commerce, the ex-banker is marching double-quick to his next destination of mentoring. 																														He says hes setting up a turnaround fund for which he has narrowed the choice of name, expectedly, between the Indian Phoenix Fund and Second Life Fund. The phoenix act could well be more appropriate for the mentor than his acolytes. If Gellis reputation has to rise from the ashes, it cant be his alone, without that of his friend, former Andhra Pradesh chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu. 																														Gellis political links are even older. As the youngest chairman of a private bank, Vysya Bank, he became the poster boy of reforms in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government. It conferred the Padmashri award on him in the first year of its installation, in 1991. 																														But Gellis un-bankerlike taste for speculation in the stock market became evident when he and Jayant Madhab, an ex-director of the Asian Development Bank, went about raising capital for GTB. They tied up the equity funds with a little known leasing company in Mumbai on condition that the contribution would be put down as loan if the share price of GTB fell below a certain level on the due date. In the following days, Gelli kept the price of the GTB share artificially high by running an assured return scheme. The act, however adventurous, is quite unbecoming of a banker. But the Reserve Bank of India, whose job is to regulate commercial banking, checked only if the capital was there and didnt fuss over how it was obtained. 																														Gellis political moorings in Andhra Pradesh struck deeper with Naidu taking over the reins in 1995. In the post-Congress years, as Naidu held the plug to the life support system of successive governments in Delhi, Gellis star was in the ascendant. Image-wise, one complemented the other, with Naidu bringing IT to governance and Gelli to banking operations. 																														But if GTB became a smart bank as a result, its owner was smarter. In 1999, Gelli became its non-executive chairman but drove from the back seat as it took a plunge into the stock markets. 																														In just two years, the banks capital market exposure exceeded 30 per cent of its total assets, until the bull run triggered by Mumbai stockbroker Ketan Parekh ended, burning a hole in the banks balance sheet which it could never mend. The Joint Parliamentary Committee identified GTB as one of Parekhs main sources of fund for pumping up the market. 																														But nobody blew the whistle on the grave risk to which Gelli had put his depositors until the RBI began inspecting the GTB books, and was aghast to find the extent of white wash. It began to crack its whip, though gently, as its bosses in Delhi were still in power at the mercy of Gellis friend in Hyderabad. 																														In 2001, the central bank scuttled a merger deal between GTB and UTI Bank that could enable Gelli to find cash for recapitalising his Non-Performing Assets (NPA). In March 2002, the RBI accused it of cooking up the book and forced it to change its auditors. But the NPA time bomb kept ticking regardless while its capital was hopelessly over-extended. Banks are required to hold a minimum of nine rupees as capital for every hundred rupees that they lend out. When GTB was finally closed, this figure had in fact come down to just seven paise. 																														Gelli tried till the last moment to tie up capital, from Newbridge Fund, a joint venture between GE, the World Bank and the Singapore government. The promise fell on receptive ears as long as the NDA government lasted. 																														Gelli surely overreached himself in the banking business for which he never had the ethical make-up. But hes a consummate player on the political stage. When the RBI was drawing skeletons out of his cupboard, instead of showing fright, he ingratiated himself with Naidu by teaming up with his corporate peers to raise money for a foundation whose avowed mission was, among other things, to reduce the drop-out rates of the states school children. He had a noble cause and a powerful ally, until the election results shattered his defence.

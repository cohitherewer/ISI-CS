		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 							 																						LIBERATION PARTY																														Pulling out of a conquered country is always a messy business. History proves this. Witness, the British leaving India or the French withdrawal from Indo-China. The United States of America, for reasons best known to itself, attacked and conquered Iraq. Its domination of Iraq is, of course, by no means comparable to British rule in India or the French one in Vietnam. But the duration of the US dominance of Iraq is inversely related to the mess the US will leave behind. It is evident that the establishment of the rule of law is a distant dream in Iraq. One major reason for this is the USs own violation of the rule of law  and even some of the rules of war  in the way the US occupying forces and protem administrative set-up have conducted themselves. The graphic pictures of US soldiers torturing and humiliating Iraqis in the Abu Ghraib prison are unforgettable symbols of the behaviour of US troops in Iraq. Conquering armies, even those that carry out acts of liberation, like the Allied army in Germany at the end of World War II, often engage in acts of gratuitous violence. The US army in Iraq is no exception despite the self righteous pronouncements emanating from Washington.																														Law and order is nowhere near being established, so the promise that a democratic regime will be installed in Iraq before the Americans leave sounds like a bit of a bad joke. Officially, the transfer of power will take place in Iraq on June 30. The issue is whether the new Iraqi government will enjoy all attributes of sovereignty including in matters concerning security. Washington, perhaps because it knows the extent of violence that still lurks in the streets of Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, is unwilling to provide such a carte blanche to the new government. This has been a bone of contention between the governments of France and the US. France, which was against the invasion of Iraq in the first place, and continues to describe the invasion and its aftermath as a tragedy, was in favour of giving to the new rulers in Baghdad all the attributes of sovereignty. It had even threatened to oppose a United Nations resolution on this ground. But a compromise has been reached and the resolution is likely to go through without a fuss. This will make the transfer of power appear shoddier than it is. But a UN resolution will in no way alleviate the miserable conditions in which the Iraqis live today. There is no guarantee that a new regime, more humane and more representative of the popular will than the tyranny of Mr Saddam Hussein, will be able to bring to Iraq a modicum of peace and establish conditions which provide the hapless people of Iraq with the basic amenities for existence and survival.

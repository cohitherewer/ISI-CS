The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 27, 2004  A town called Mumbra
 							 - Issue of Ishrats death may be raked up during October Assembly pollsIn this small, cramped borough on the outskirts of Mumbai, the living isnt easy. And, like Ishrat Raza, its youth find their national loyalties perpetually called into question.

 Muslims: 80% 
 Floating population: 40 % 
 Accommodation: Pigeon-hole apartments are rented out for as low as Rs 500 per month 
All figures are approximate																														In Mumbra, you can find a hundred reasons for angst and muse. Squalid quarters, cramped lanes, filthy streets and an all-pervasive odious stench  there is plenty to pen about the lives and times of the lowly and the wretched. And there are so many poets in the so-called terrorist hotspot that you can easily organise an impromptu mushaira  a gathering of poets  in this bustling town poised on the outskirts of Mumbai. 																														But on Saturday morning, Urdu poet Abdulla Kamaal, whose modest first-floor apartment faces the towns Sunni Muslim cemetery, wasnt thinking about verse as he saw a sea of white moving towards the home of the dead. It was as if the entire town had gathered there. Forget a funeral, nobody had ever seen so many people in Mumbra for any event, he says.																														It was Ishrat Jahan Razas funeral. And everybody had come out on the streets both in a show of solidarity and a collective gesture of protest. Traffic had stopped and shops had shut down. Political scientist Imtiaz Ahmed puts it succinctly. People gathering in such huge numbers at her funeral was an expression of an inherent fear that if it happened to her, it can happen to us as well.																														The jury is still out on whether the 19-year-old girl killed in a police encounter in Ahmedabad along with three alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) militants last week, was a terrorist. The latest reports, however, are increasingly emphatic about her dangerous liaisons.																														In Mumbra, few are ready to believe that Ishrat was a terrorist. But many stress that her killing shows a new trend. Till now, only young Muslim males were picked up and eliminated by the police. Now even women are being targetted, says a middle-aged Mumbra woman. It is not an isolated voice. Thats the way most of the town thinks. Its not easy living in Mumbra. The police look at every young man as a potential terrorist or a criminal. And as the oppression grows, the towns youth turns increasingly rebellious.																														Mumbras evolution from a small agricultural kasbah to a busy town is itself a fallout of a society in churning. The town grew as many lower and middle-class Muslims moved from Mumbai to Mumbra after the 1992 riots in search of security. With its low real estate rates acting as a magnet, Mumbras population swelled from a few thousand in the Eighties to about 7,00,000 now. Of them, an estimated 80 per cent comprise Muslims.																														The last ten years have been a long-running serial of police high-handedness, and often, lock-up brutality. The townsfolk complain about regular police raids where youngsters are routinely picked up for harsh questioning. Occasionally, a terrorist is nabbed in the town  Abu Hamza, who allegedly had links with the Fidayeen squad that attacked Parliament, was arrested in these parts, for instance. And back in 1993, Mumbai police had also seized 1.5 tonnes of RDX and gelatin following the March 12 blasts in the Maharashtra capital.																														But, it is also true that on many occasions, the police have barked up the wrong tree. Two years ago, the Thane police, under whose jurisdiction Mumbra falls, arrested four youths and charged them with being Lashkar militants. The young men turned out to be unemployed Kashmiri youths who were working in Mumbra as security officers and watchmen. 																														The court released them a year later when the Jammu and Kashmir police filed a report saying that they were not wanted in the Valley and that they had no evidence of any links with terrorists. Urdu newspaper journalist Sarfaraz Arzoo claims that recently two criminals who had escaped from a Madhya Pradesh jail were gunned down by the police and paraded as LeT militants. But once the police brand somebody a Lashkar terrorist, no questions are asked. 																														The geography and economics of Mumbra make it a potential catchment area for terrorists and a target of the police. Accommodation is cheap. According to police estimates, 40 per cent of those who live in Mumbra are short-term occupants  those who have moved in recently and are unlikely to stay there for long. In other words, there is a large rootless and floating population. Thousands co-mmute to Mumbai everyday either to sell their wares or work in the lower rungs of offices. It is also a town that provides relative anonymity.																														If you have a footloose mobile population dislocated from its traditional moorings, you have a natural propensity to seek new identities and form new associations, says political scientist Ahmed. And, since nobody knows the antecedents of the other person too well, it is possible to get into a kind of company that one may not have been looking for. As it possibly happened in Ishrats case. Mumbras tragedy is that, on the other side, such a town is always vulnerable to the police. Anyone young becomes a natural suspect in such a place. And since they find it difficult to establish their social links, it is easy for the police to round them up, says Ahmed. 																														The police, of course, have their own reasons for believing that Mumbra is used as a hang-out by criminals. Because it is thickly populated and because it is easy to rent premises, says deputy commissioner of police (crime) Amar Jadhav. And because the people are poor, he says. 																														What irks the people of Mumbra is this very image. Many are fighting to erase the general impression that the township offers shelter to criminals and terrorists. What worries them most is that because of a few stray cases, the entire town is being painted black. 																														All kinds of people come and stay in the area. There are bound to be good people and bad people, says poet Kamaal. But it is unfair to brand Mumbra as a support base for terrorism. So many poets also live in Mumbra. But only its negative aspect gets written about. The poet believes that the town is repeatedly being asked to prove its patriotism because it is predominantly Muslim. We are tax-payers. But what do we get in return? The place doesnt have a single hospital. And power failure is regular even during the month of Ramzan, complains his wife, Shirin, even as the power goes off.																														It was in a climate such as this that Ishrat grew up. Those who knew her find it difficult to believe that the girl could have had any terrorist links. But what is even more difficult for them to comprehend is why she had to die. We are not saying that Ishrat is innocent, says former Mumbra Intelligence Branch officials were tailing her for months, as it claims, then why wasnt she arrested and interrogated? We want to know the truth. IN conference: Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi speaks to members of Ishrats family 																														Police are saying now that Ishrat, the 19-year-old Mumbai college student, worked for Javed Sheikh, an electrician turned LeT member. Latest reports suggest that the June 15 encounter was the fall-out of an elaborate four-month covert operation by the Intelligence Bureau. And the alleged terrorists were, in fact, set up by Intelligence officials. But the encounter is still being questioned. According to Gujarat polices own admission, 42 rounds were fired by the terrorists, yet no lawman was injured.																														It is such loopholes in the police version that have made many in Mumbra doubt the official version. Says Mumbai-based social activist Sheela Barse, Several things seem to be missing from the public discussion so far. Was Ishrat armed? What did the post-mortem report show about the bullet injuries she suffered? Was the professional process of panchanama followed? She was just 19 and probably had a chance to reform. Was she given that chance?																														Imtiaz Ahmed feels that in such situations where there are doubts about the veracity of a case, a towns opinion is divided into two schools of thought. There is a section among minorities in the city which becomes critical of those rounded up. This group believes that by presenting itself as a law-abiding group, it can save its own skin, he says. But the other section, Ahmed stresses, are those who turn bitter because they feel that they are being targetted without a reason. They no longer condemn terrorist violence but begin to endorse it. The moment such a constituency is created, the police get more oppressive. It is a cycle, he says. 																														It is also politics that prevents the truth from coming out. Mumbra, for instance, is a hub of frenetic political activity now. The Congress-NCP led Maharashtra government swiftly ordered a probe into Ishrats background to verify if she was innocent. NCP leader from Thane Vasant Davkhare offered financial support of Rs 1 lakh to Ishrats family, but withdrew the offer when the Shiv Sena-BJP targetted him for supporting terrorists. 																														Though the encounter has left many unanswered questions, whats certain is that political parties in Maharashtra would use Ishrats death to their advantage in the forthcoming state Assembly elections in October. And those in Mumbra know that too well. The politicians only have their self-interests in mind. And their interest is nothing but votes, says a Mumbra resident. 																														But that hasnt stopped the politicians from making their rounds even now. An uneasy silence still surrounds Ishrats house in Hasmat Park housing society as Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi with Azam Khan, a minister in Mulayam Singhs cabinet in UP, meets the mourning family of six. That the family is fed up of media interviews, police interrogation, prying neighbours and VIP visits is made amply clear moments later. Koi baat nahin karni hamein, screams Ishrats angry elder sister Zeenat, after the Samajwadi Party leaders leave the house, and slams the door shut. Neighbours prefer to remain behind closed doors, afraid that any mention of Ishrat would mean a police interrogation. 																														The fear is all pervasive. In an Urdu couplet he wrote sometime ago, Kamaal sums up his anguish. Lahoo ki cheekhti tasveer ho raha hoon, main jaise wadiye Kashmir ho raha hoon. (I am a screaming poster of blood, I feel like the valley of Kashmir). For him  and for all the poets of Mumbra  every day raises new questions about their self and their existence. Like them, trapped between politicians, poetry and pistols, Mumbra continues to grope for its identity.

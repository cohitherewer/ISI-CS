		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 							 																						SLOW TO LEARN																														Some learners are slower than others. When it comes to learning of responsibilities, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has been slower than its compatriots. The reason for this is to be sought in the partys faith in the old politics of agitprop. Its transition from that to a party which can run governments or institutions has not been easy. The partys decision to stay away from the Congress-led government at the Centre had shown how it still remained a prisoner of its old rhetoric. But even the most obfuscated of minds cannot quite resist the winds of change. The closed world of the CPI(M) seems to have opened a wee bit. The proof comes in the partys decision to allow its veteran parliamentarian, Mr Somnath Chatterjee, to be the ruling United Progressive Alliances candidate for the election to the post of Lok Sabha speaker. Mr Chatterjee is thus tipped to make history by becoming the first communist to hold such a high office in India. That Mr Chatterjees name was suggested by the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, speaks of the changing political equations in the country. Obviously, she rose above partisan considerations to make her choice. The CPI(M), on the other hand, had been too enmeshed in its partisan rhetoric to see the larger point of her gesture. 																														Better late than never, though. It is crucial that the Marxists now realize the importance of the new role they have been called upon to play. Donning the speakers mantle is only a symbol of this larger role. Mr Chatterjees long and varied experience as a parliamentarian could make him eminently suitable for the job, particularly at a time when the country is on the threshold of an important change of regime. But the real challenge for his party is to live up to the expectations about its role in the new dispensation. Even if it supports the government of Mr Manmohan Singh from outside, it has to bear the responsibilities of governance in a manner it has never done before. The transition for the party clearly has to be from the conventional mores of politics to finding its place in the society at large. To achieve that, the CPI(M) would need more than the sophistry with which it sought to justify its acceptance of Ms Gandhis offer of the speakers post for Mr Chatterjee. The sooner the party fully accepts that power  even if from outside the government  has its responsibilities, the better it will be for itself and the country. How soon the party emerges into this new realization will largely determine whether it is fit for a larger, non-partisan role in a pluralist society like India.

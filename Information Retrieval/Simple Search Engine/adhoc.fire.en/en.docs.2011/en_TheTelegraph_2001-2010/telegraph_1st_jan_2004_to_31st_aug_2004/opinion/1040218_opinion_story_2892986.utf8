The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Lend us your ears				 																																																				Sir  In India, anyone who has made it to Page 3 takes it as his moral responsibility to sermonize people. Instead of concentrating on the work for which they are paid, these celebrities are hellbent on getting themselves an identity as activists, and if that means they must barge into fields where they have no specialization or professional competence, then so be it. And what is more, they sincerely believe that people are gullible enough to be influenced by what they say. It is our misfortune that we must learn about the nutritional value of chicken, or about their fitness for human consumption amid the avian flu scare, not from any expert, but from film actors such as Sunjay Dutt or Suniel Shetty (Dont chicken out, cry stars, Feb 14). Filmstars endorsing cars and toothpastes is fine, we know they are after a fast buck. But on public health issues, they better keep mum. Microbiologists and virologists are already working overtime to find a solution. It is their opinion that counts.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Tapan Pal, Batanagar
				 																All that glitters				 																																																				Sir  Barun Des article, Advertised revolution (Feb 11) is a lop-sided exposition of reality. It would appear from the article that Muslims in India have been strategically filtered out by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government, in much the same way as the colonial rulers divide-and-rule policy. I do not believe that this has been the case. The Muslims in India, as a politico-religious group, have always maintained their distinctive identity in every walk of life. If the Hindus constructed the Muslims as the Other, the Muslims themselves contributed to the construction of this so-called otherness. This is comparable to the Israelis constructing the idea of the Palestinians and vice versa. The construction of the Other is not always an exercise in discrimination. In India, it should not be regarded as an unjustified basis for propagating and emphasizing Hinduness, as De argues. The United States of America has different ethnic/racial groups with distinctive spheres of interests, and it is politically becoming to recognize and respect this separateness without blaming everything on political construction. Democracy does not entail the erosion of distinctive interests or interest-groups in favour of a single dominant one. Democracy means equal representation and open dialogue among opposed interest groups. Finding commonness amidst differences  this is what democracy aims to do. A lot of political misunderstandings can be eliminated if the concept of democracy is understood rightly.

				 																																																				Sir  India has been shining since 1999, when the BJP came to power. It has already shone so much that Gujarat got burnt. Now, with all the advertisements in both the print and electronic media, the rest of the country can be expected to shine over the next five years if the BJP returns to power. Should we let India shine any more under the BJP, only to be burnt to ashes? The people have to decide, and soon.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amitava Banerjee, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  It used to be said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee is a prime minister, and the BJP a party, with a difference. People have realized at a great cost how false these claims are (PMs India will shine until code of conduct, Feb 10). Vajpayees claim that it is the governments duty to project what it has done while in office holds no water. For, if anything has been done, its effects will be felt by the electorate without Rs 450-crore ads to trumpet them. India is not shining but trembling for fear that the same lot might come back to power, thanks to a weak and divided opposition. It is a pity that the law of our land is not adequate to handle such misuse of democratic norms. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Growth feels good (Feb 1), says that there is no guarantee that the feel good factor will translate into votes for the NDA. But the NDA should not worry about meeting the same fate as Rajiv Gandhi in 1989 and P.V. Narasimha Rao in 1996. Even without feel good, the divided opposition will find it hard to dent Atal Bihari Vajpayees image.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is unfair of the party or coalition in power to resort to publicity stunts highlighting its achievements just before the elections. The chief election commissioner was right to question the action, for it is unethical misuse of administrative machinery. Instead, public debates can be arranged in the media. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Ram, Calcutta

				 																Watch this space				 																																																				Sir  Barun Des article, Space as heritage (Feb 3), does well to highlight the need for escalating heritage conservation beyond buildings to spaces. However, De disappoints in providing neither conceptual clarity nor practical guidance for policy-makers or activists interested in heritage conservation. 				 																																																				We are aware that heritage includes built heritage, natural heritage and cultural heritage. Our policy-makers thus far seem to have focussed more on built environment than on cultural or natural heritage. Witness the relative ease with which the money received from the Centre for the improvement of Rabindra Sarobar, now a national lake, was used to add concrete embankments and fencing rather than to improve the natural ambience. Certainly some spaces need a heritage focus, but by decrying efforts at conserving buildings as tinkering away at grim old ruins, De displays an ideological blind spot. The conservation of buildings and spaces is not mutually exclusive. Buildings give a city its character and add to the sense of identity of its citizens. Whether one looks at buildings as part of built heritage or cultural heritage, there is no denying their significance as physical and psychological landmarks. To those concerned with the more pragmatic issues of what a heritage label implies and how resources can be raised to carry these implications through, the article could have provided more thought. BBD Bag, supposedly a heritage zone, still has hoardings mocking anyone interested in the architectural treasures of the area. The flyover fever that has gripped the city has destroyed the link with the Maidan and ruined the pride of the Chowringhee skyline. De would have done well to address questions as to why heritage conservation has not received more than lip- and committee-service in Calcutta and in this state.

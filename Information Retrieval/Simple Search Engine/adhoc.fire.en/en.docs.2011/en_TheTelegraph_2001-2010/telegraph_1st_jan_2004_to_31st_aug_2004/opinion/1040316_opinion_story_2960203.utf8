		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 							 																						TURNING RED INTO GREEN Darjeelings tea industry requires intervention at the international, governmental and local levels in order to be rejuvenated, writes Mahendra P. Lama Healthy concernThe Darjeeling tea industry, located at the core of the eastern Himalayas, is one of the oldest and most famous tea ventures in India. Darjeeling tea, which consistently fetched high prices in both domestic and international markets, is now struggling to survive. It is facing serious problems, ranging from low yield to poor health and militancy among workers, steadily falling prices to fleeing management and competition from new estates in Nepal. All this at a time when the tea industry itself in India is in peril. 																														The fate of the Darjeeling tea industry, much of which can be attributed to deliberate neglect by the estate owners, governments and the trade unions, has not only dislocated thousands of workers but also brought about very visible social and political tensions in the region. What is more worrisome is the fact that ownership has been totally usurped by the merchant capitalists who have no knowledge of or attachment with Darjeeling. These owners use the gardens as their milching cows and abandon them at their own will. Well-known tea companies have quietly sold of their stakes, the most recent being Darjeeling Plantation Industries Limited. It is only the part-time tea companies that are in the forefront today.																														As a result, management of the tea gardens is terrible. Most of the tea bushes have outlived their productive cycle. Though replantation has been talked about, only some cosmetic changes have been made. The management does not want to undergo the loss of profit during the gestation period of 5-8 years after replantation. They make the most of the existing tea bushes with the help of over doses of dangerous fertilizers and pesticides. Naturally some of the developed countries have rightfully highlighted the high doses of pesticide residues in Darjeeling tea and restricted import. Meanwhile, no one is talking about what damages the chemicals are doing to the local environment and other livelihood practices like bee-keeping and dairy farming, leave alone their larger impact on workers health. 																														Workers remain deprived of the basic needs like primary health and education. The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the region is reported from the gardens. Since most are privately owned, tea gardens do not receive any grants from projects connected with the national poverty alleviation programmes. The panchayat act was extended to the gardens only very recently. There are hardly any social security measures for workers, most of whom are regarded as casual help. The trade unions fight for only fringe benefits like bonus for Dussehra and Diwali. Substantive issues like the ownership and health of tea gardens or development of skills and more productivity are never their concern. A study on the tea industry of Darjeeling showed that during 1979-1983, over 75 per cent of the total 285 strikes in these gardens were caused by sympathetic political reasons. Hardly any had taken place pertaining to workers interests like ration supply, wages, leaves, housing and so on. 																														Competing trade unions with varied political and ideological affiliations have injected militancy into the otherwise quiet and hardworking tea workers. This has had a debilitating impact on their productivity, leading to violence not only against the management but also among themselves. The recent case of Glenburn tea estate, where the management fled in October 2003, is a telling example. It negotiated a settlement with the Himalayan Plantation Workers Union in February 2004 by which the management has been allowed to lay off 300 workers to facilitate the reopening of the garden. This is unprecedented and a blatant case of surrender. More alarming is the fact that other trade unions are quiet on this settlement which has farreaching implications for workers.																														Many gardens remain closed today. Some gardens have changed hands four times in ten years. The uncertainty this generates among workers is well known. The government-owned gardens have been the biggest failure. In some of the gardens under the West Bengal tea development corporation and tea trading corporation of India there are reported cases of starvation deaths. In the absence of any constructive help from either the trade unions or the government, it is a straight fight between the estate owners and the workers. The result is obvious. Workers are the biggest losers.																														There can be both short- and long-term solutions to the problem. In the short run, individual ownership should be totally banned and companies should be allowed to have a stake in at least five gardens. Besides basic amenities, the management should devote 5 to 10 per cent of the total sale proceeds to community welfare. This should be supplemented with grants from the government. All the development projects and programmes run by the government and non-governmental agencies in the gardens should reconsider their focus to enable workers to opt for alternative livelihood practices like cooperatives. 																														In the long run, replantation is the only option. Compulsory replantation with the support of financing agencies needs to be instantly implemented. The Ambootia and Makaibari experiments with organic tea have been useful. This practice needs to be replicated in a more scientific and organized manner. This will also match the changing needs of the world tea market. Darjeeling tea should be withdrawn from the auction centre sale and put through the direct sales mode. There are scores of buyers and niche markets in Europe and east Asia, including Japan, which aspire to buy tea directly from the gardens. Fair trading is another possibility which needs to be explored.																														It is essential to have a patent on Darjeeling tea. In other words, Darjeeling tea today requires a comprehensive and protracted intervention at three levels. International coalition, particularly in the market-price management and safeguard of workers interest, is the first level of action. The earlier efforts of the United Nations conference on trade and development related to international commodity agreements and common funds and the recent initiatives taken by the representatives of the world tea workers in the World Social Forum need to be taken up more forthrightly in international negotiations once again.																														At the national level, legislation to rejuvenate the gardens and reorder the tea-exclusive plantation act is a must. This has to be backed by a strong national regulatory authority. The Darjeeling tea industry needs to be opened to foreign direct investors by making it more attractive through opening of other supplementary activities including horticulture and floriculture. Tea estates will have to increasingly adopt multi-commodity approach in order to give them more robustness and sustainability. 																														At the local level, what is required is the implementation of the provisions of all acts and legislative measures, regulated management practices that make workers more productive and forward-looking. Let us not forget that workers grievances substantially contributed to the demand for a Gorkhaland. A similar movement may be on the anvil if the government does not act soon.

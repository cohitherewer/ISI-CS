The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 							 																						COLOUR OF OFFICE																														In life, adversity irons out the rough edges in a person; in politics, the responsibilities of office remove the crude extremism in political parties. Office can said to have tamed the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Vision document 2004 that the BJP has put out reveals that the party is much mellowed and is more conscious of the onus of governance and development. Gone is the stridency against the minorities and the shrill cry to establish a Hindu rashtra in India. The aim to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya has not been jettisoned but it is now predicated on dialogue and a negotiated settlement. The temple is no longer high on the partys list of priorities. Almost imperceptibly, the BJP has moved to occupy the middle ground of Indian politics. From the high ideological plane of Hindutva, it has descended to the ground realities of development, governance and pragmatism. This shift may be driven by the compulsions of coalition politics but that cannot take away from either its importance or its substance. The BJP is not the only political party to have felt the transformative impact of the responsibilities of office. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) experienced it during its long run of power in West Bengal. Ideologues of yesterday are todays advocates of governance. Witness Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mr L.K. Advani.																														The BJP Vision document places economic liberalization and reforms on its list of commitments. This shows very clearly that the BJP has cut off its sangh parivar moorings. It has accepted the tide of globalization and decided to swim with the tide and to use it to Indias own advantage. An inevitable consequence of this is a major shift in the BJPs views regarding the role of the state. The BJP, even till a few years ago, was an advocate of a powerful state, and believed in the state as the central arbiter in the allocation of economic resources and economic power. But in the Vision document, the BJP has withdrawn from its earlier support to the idea of an interventionist state. It now wants the state to be only a facilitator. This might be a far cry from the minimalist state visualized in the gospel according to the Chicago school, but it is certainly a step in that  and right  direction.																														The BJP document also successfully distinguishes itself from the manifesto of its principal rival, the Congress. That manifesto was noteworthy because of its lack of direction and its political vacuity. The BJP has at least spoken of a vision. There might be arguments about the vision but there is no equivocation about where the BJP wants to take India. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee thus passes the first test of leadership. He has put his own identification mark on the BJPs Vision document. He has made it clear that under his helmsmanship, the BJP stands committed to economic reforms which will make India a developed and a powerful nation. The notion of a powerful interventionist state has been sloughed off like last winters skin. One need not be a supporter of the BJP to appreciate the thought and the cleverness that has gone into the making of Vision 2004.

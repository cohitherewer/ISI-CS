The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 							 																						GREEN LIGHT																														More than 50 international pension funds already operate in India and with foreign exchange reserves crossing $117 billion and continuing to climb, additional capital inflows are not the point. California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the United States of America, has recently added India to the list of emerging equity markets it would like to invest in. The other new markets added are Peru and the Philippines. However, China, Thailand, Pakistan or Indonesia are still not on the CalPERS list. CalPERS has assets of more than $166 billion. However, only $2 billion of the portfolio is invested in emerging markets. With 17 countries included in the present approved emerging market list, on an average, India wont receive more than $120 million. Hence, the significance of the CalPERS decision does not lie in numbers, but elsewhere. A positive signal is imparted about Indian corporate governance standards. CalPERS is not a short-term mutual fund and because of its longer time horizon, is more activist on company boards, stock exchanges and market systems. Not only are companies chosen carefully, but they are also continuously monitored, so that shareholder value is maximized. For instance, focus companies chosen by CalPERS go through a screen or monitoring process, with screens on shareholder returns, economic value added and corporate governance. Proxy voting is also extensively used. 																														Pressure by pension funds has led to improved corporate governance standards in the US. Earlier, CalPERS was in the news because of using social and human rights violations as indicators before deciding to enter emerging markets and such social standards can indeed surface as surrogate protectionism. However, in the present case, Indias making the grade is attributed to the recent move to global standards, that is, opting for trade settlements one day after the trade date. Arguably, Indian corporate governance standards are better than those in most parts of the developing world and are also improving. But CalPERS still has reservations about Indias labour practices and the openness of capital markets. The corporate governance certification given is thus not without caveats. It is premature to speculate about the kind of activism CalPERS will be involved in and the specifics of screens or proxy voting are unknown. Nevertheless, the general principle is obvious. If CalPERS increases its Indian exposure, there will be pressure on the Indian companies CalPERS decides to invest in, as well as regulatory structures. But that is in the future. For now, there is some reason to celebrate and use the trigger to attract global capital inflows.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 							 																						A DIFFICULT BALANCE Contrary to expectations, the US is under no obligation to inform India in advance of developments in its relations with other nations, writes Sarmila Bose				 	 Not quite in the big league																														As has become almost routine in recent times, the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, swung by south Asia the other day. In New Delhi he spoke of the promise and potential of a partnership between India and the United States of America. In Islamabad he announced the recognition of Pakistan as a major non-Nato ally. No sooner had the words rolled off his tongue that New Delhi went into the Great Indian Sulk.																														The announcement clearly caught India by surprise, for which it blamed the US (rather than its own intelligence establishment). Shock and disbelief were expressed, not only at the elevation of the status of Pakistan in its alliance with the US, but also at the fact that the US had not informed India in advance of its intention to grant Pakistan major non-Nato ally status. The insinuation was that Powell had somehow deliberately deceived India by not telling New Delhi what he was going to do in Islamabad.																														Official reaction was slow to come  it took the Indian foreign minister, Yashwant Sinha, a couple of days to articulate his disappointment  perhaps because India was too stunned to react any faster, or, as some like to interpret it, because it was a deliberate snub to the worlds sole superpower (by a poor third world country with no other option but to cultivate the worlds sole superpower). The media is full of indignant Indian comment rounding on the Bush administration and predicting dire consequences for Indo-US relations.																														Ordinary Americans would be forgiven for being a tad bewildered by Indias little tantrum at Powells announcement in Islamabad  if they took any notice of these things, which they dont. For contrary to what seems to be Indian expectations, the US is under no obligation to inform India in advance of developments in its relations with other countries. Indeed, such an expectation is quite preposterous. It is a reminder of the delusions of grandeur that India suffered from for decades, when its aspirations for posturing on the world stage remained unrelated to its failure to transform itself into a country with real economic and political muscle.																														Indias ambassador to the US, Lalit Mansingh, speaking at a conference on Indo-US relations at the Sigur Center for Asian Studies at George Washington University, at least has conceded the USs prerogative to decide for itself its relations with its allies. But he too sounded a sour note, voicing Indias disappointment with the Powell announcement and comparing it unfavourably with what was described as the Clinton administrations approach  which of course happened before 9/11 and before the launch of the global war on terror.																														The term major non-Nato ally surfaced about 15 years ago with an addition to the section in US law pertaining to cooperative agreements with allies and initially covered 5 countries. A new section added in 1996 in the Foreign Assistance Act allowed the president to designate more countries as MNNAs. Though inclusion in this club is largely symbolic and does not include the mutual security guarantees of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it has practical advantages in terms of purchase, stockpiling and delivery of defence material, as well as participation in research and development programmes.																														In the scramble that followed the Powell announcement, Indians have latched on to the proposed legislation by a US Congressman that attempts to henceforth limit the granting of MNNA status to democracies only and to those countries that complied fully with US-led efforts to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. In a profound irony, the introduction of this proposal coincided with a Washington ceremony to mark the granting of MNNA status to Kuwait, which had been announced earlier. Other countries on the list of major non-Nato allies include Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt, along with Argentina, Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand.																														Not only would a democracy clause, if meant to keep out Pakistan, lose the US several other key allies whose regimes are even less democratic, but it also reeks of both a juvenile approach to foreign policy and the sort of hypocrisy that lost the US much goodwill in the past. Alliances in the real world are not made on the basis of the internal politics of other countries, but on rational self-interest and common interests. The US faces a formidable threat in the form of multiple groups cutting across national boundaries which seem hellbent on doing absolutely anything to inflict grievous damage on America and Americans. It needs all the help it can get.																														While the problem is global, not everyone is at the frontline of this global war on terror. Not every countrys soldiers are dying in the course of the ongoing battle; nor is every countrys regime daily defying the wrath of extremist militants and dodging assassination attempts for helping America. It is only appropriate that Americans should offer special assistance to the countries that they need the most and that are shouldering the most risk, not only out of gratitude but also in order to forge constructive relationships that reduce the extremist threat for the future. The US has long had a reputation of using and then discarding allies when their short-term usefulness was over. Any step the US takes to build broad-based long-term relationships in hostile parts of the world is a welcome step away from the chronic short-termism that plagued American foreign policy in the past.																														In its hysterical reaction to the announcement of Pakistans MNNA status, India has been contradicting itself in terms of its desired relationship with the US. Advocates of a mature relationship between an emerging India and the US had been calling for an end to the so-called hyphenated relationship between India, Pakistan and the US, in which every American official felt obliged to visit both countries in the same trip and balance whatever he or she said in each capital. It was India which now claimed that it did not want to be bracketed constantly with Pakistan in its relationship with the US. In this view, India, as an over-sized regional power with enormous economic potential, can have a long-term relationship with the US that is independent of regional conflict-resolution issues. It would appear that Powell followed precisely this approach in focusing on Indo-US cooperation while in India and announcing Pakistans MNNA status in Islamabad. Indias shrill reaction reveals its continuing immaturity and demonstrates that the hyphen of the hyphenated relationship remains embedded in the Indian mind more than anywhere else.

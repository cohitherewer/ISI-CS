The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 							 																						DID MAN LAND ON THE MOON?Gouri Chatterjee																					There is a simple view of our trade that we love to propagate. Good journalism is that which gets it right; bad journalism is that which gets it wrong. Bad journalists dont let facts stand in the way of the story; good journalists tell the truth, pure and simple. Bad journalists sensationalize; good journalists stick to the facts. I can see you nodding your heads in vigorous agreement.																					To carry on then, bad journalism was the Indian Express expos, swiftly picked up by the rest of the media, that linked Satyendra Dubeys murder with his complaint to the prime ministers office regarding irregularities in the Golden Quadrilateral highway project. Because the CBI now claims it was a just a case of casual robbery gone awry. 																					What then should a good journalist have done? Buried the news of Satyendra Dubeys murder in some inconspicuous briefs column because there are at least 10 cases of murder and abduction in Bihar every day? Waited patiently till the police came up with some suspects before deciding to publish that explosive story about Dubeys letter to the PMO  even though the wait could have been excruciatingly long? The CBI took up the case only after the stink raised by the press. 																					The trouble with the simple view of journalism is that the truth, as Oscar Wilde noted, is rarely pure and never simple. All the more so since many of the truths we report are things that cannot be proven. Simply because we werent there. Did man land on the moon? A recent programme on Rupert Murdochs Fox News channel seriously questioned Neil Armstrongs 1968 feat. 																					And what if we were present? The world saw the Babri Masjid being razed to the ground in front of L.K. Advani. Has that proved his complicity in that act? 																					The simple truth is that all journalism is good, even if it is mistaken, as long as it is fair. And fair journalism stems from only one consideration: that it is done in the public interest. Even the best journalists must sometimes be free to be wrong.																					Find a new partner																					M.J. Akbar was never afraid to think big. Even then, he must take particular pleasure in seeing his name as the Editor of the Paris-based, New York Times-owned International Herald Tribune, even if it is printed in Hyderabad. So why he expected no one to notice this new addition to his overburdened CV defies logic. 																					If he did, then he cant be surprised at the furore his latest innovation has caused. A foreign paper with a foreign masthead, almost wholly foreign content and a foreign editorial board boldly displayed on the edit page, but owned, printed and published by Indians in India is a strange enough concoction to begin with. At the very least, it flies against the government rule that stipulates syndicated material cannot exceed 7.5 per cent of the total editorial content in a newspaper. 																					Granted that most newspapers would probably be found in violation of this rather ridiculous law, Akbar surely knows that he is unlikely to be persona grata with the new government. In fact, the moves to clip his wings have already begun.																					However it plays out, one thing is more than likely: the Tribs plans to become The Worlds Daily Newspaper will have a big hole when it comes to India unless it finds a new partner in a hurry.																					Bringing up baby																					People walking by news stands may be forgiven for thinking that the most pressing problem in India today is parenting. Rather, New Age Parenting, which is the cover story of both the leading newsmagazines of the country, India Today and Outlook. Of course, its happened before, but thats because the events were so momentous  elections, the Iraq war, and so on. Evidently, the competition has become so keen that it has spilled over into lifestyle subjects like bringing up baby. One thing theyll be happy to know. This week, Time and Newsweek not only share the subject  Ronald Reagan  but exactly the same photograph of the dead president on their covers.

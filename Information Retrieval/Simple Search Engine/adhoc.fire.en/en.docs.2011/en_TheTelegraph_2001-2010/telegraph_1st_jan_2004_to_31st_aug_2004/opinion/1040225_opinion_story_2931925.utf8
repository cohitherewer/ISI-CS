The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 							 																						ONLY A GAME																														It seems axiomatic that the Indian cricketers are going to Pakistan to play cricket. Yet the prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had to repeat this self-evident truth and reiterate that the cricketers were not touring Pakistan for any war. Mr Vajpayee also delinked the cricket tour and the Kashmir issue. All this will sound bizarre to someone ignorant of the state of play between India and Pakistan, and the popular excitement that pursues an Indo-Pak cricket encounter. A cricket match between India and Pakistan has an extra dollop of patriotism added on to the heady concoction that goes by the name of cricket in the sub-continent. War minus the shooting has become a clich to describe sporting encounters, but in the case of an Indo-Pak cricket match, one day or test, the clich acquires an ominous quality. The game becomes a kind of proxy war in which the populace on both sides of the border invests emotions that one associates with battles. It is true that much of the emotion is simulated since they last only the duration of the game, but nonetheless, its very articulation is an index of the charged atmosphere in which the game is played between two countries. All these factors will be multiplied many times over in the forthcoming tour since it comes after a long suspension of cricketing exchanges. Moreover, for good or for bad, this visit of the Indian team to Pakistan is imbued with a certain amount of political significance.																														Everybody, with every valid reason, is seeing this tour as a part of the peace process that Mr Vajpayee has set in motion. But it is important to accept that cricket by itself will achieve very little or nothing in concrete political terms. The significance lies in the gesture. The cricketers go to Pakistan as ambassadors of goodwill. The tour will signify that the two countries are no longer hostile to each other. Thus the success or the failure of the two teams should not be seen at all in political terms. The players should be left alone to play the game. This, in fact, will guarantee that the tour contributes substantively to the peace process. The players are not meeting to fight any kind of war, proxy or real. Mr Vajpayee needs to be lauded for underlining this. But he needs to do a little more than this. He must rein in the troops of the sangh parivar, and ensure that a cricket match between India and Pakistan is not projected as a battle between Hindus and Muslims or between good and evil. Those who know only cricket do not know much about cricket, but for this particular tour, the game needs to be interpreted in the narrowest possible terms.

				 																																																																														 Has LK Advani missed his bus again? No, not the one taking him to a Bharat uday, but to the Bharat pradhan mantris chair? To thousands of his party workers who have been doing the dirty job of threatening cable operators to keep people off the telly and cajoling residents so that they could show their faces to a tired Advani atop his bus, he most certainly has. As usual, it is not their old, gullible leader that they blame, but the wily party gen-sec, Pramod Mahajan, who they think was instrumental in packing the deputy PM off in a bus. The Advani circle is full of stories of how Mahajan is using the PMs name to favour his own people and deprive the deputy PMs supporters of party tickets. After discussing the list of prospective candidates with the party chief, M Venkaiah Naidu, Pramod supposedly takes the list for Baapji or AB Vajpayee to look at in the confines of his bedroom. Mahajan apparently returns, every time unerringly, with a list comprised only of his own people. The excuse is the same each time, PM ne in namon par ungli rakh di hai (The PM has pointed to these names). The exercise having been repeated a number of times, Advanis men are now suspicious, Kisne dekha hai PM ne kispar ungli rakkhi (Whoever has seen the PM pointing at the names?). Seems like Mahajans bus is trundling faster than Advanis.				 																																																																														 In through the outdoor. Once officer on special duty to the Congress president, Vincent George is back with a bang, and much to the glee of the anti-Ambika Soni gang which looks at Georges ouster as having been mainly the handiwork of Soni. The move is also being interpreted as an attempt to woo this lobby led by Arjun Singh. The reverberations seem to be apparent in the return of K Karunakaran and Ashwini Kumar, both high-profile Soni-baiters. What adds colour to the goings-on is the buzz that Sonia undertook the move after receiving information that members of the Soni gang were leaking out confidential information to the PMO and the saffronwallahs. But will George be able to plug the holes?				 																																																																														 Our politicos never tire of giving their own take on Sonia Gandhi and her Cambridge associations. Arun Jaitleys position on the matter recently: Yes, she was at Cambridge the same way I was at the LSE. He explained immediately after that he had gone to visit a BJP-friendly professor there. Should we call that visiting fellowship?				 																																																																														 The announcement of the model code of conduct earlier this month had caught many unawares. The Union minister of state for defence, Chamanlal Gupta, was travelling in a helicopter in Udhampur-Doda, his parliamentary constituency, when the code became operational. Gupta is supposed to have dutifully abandoned his Indian air force chopper and taken a back-breaking journey home. It was a different story with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and daughter, Mehbooba. The mufti was touring the main tourist spots in the state, and continued holding meetings in Baramulla and Srinagar well beyond the 12-noon deadline in their state-supplied aircraft. When questions were raised later in the assembly, Sayeed said with a straight face that he simply did not know he was transgressing the time limit. Convenient, isnt it!				 																																																																														 A million-dollar question is who will be the Congress candidate against AB Vajpayee? Karan Singh has refused to take the plunge a second time. Several names are doing the rounds, including those of Ram Jethmalani and ND Tiwari. But leading the list is Arjun Singh. Obviously, tongues are already wagging. One contention is that it is somebodys brainwork to finish him off. Guess who?				 																																																																														 Abandon ship! The recent switch to the Congress by JK Jain, one-time BJP MP and a hardcore RSS man, has raised many eyebrows, especially since he was a regular in LK Advanis retinue. Jain is not the only case. Earlier, Mohan Guruswamy and Ram Jethmalani, both close to Advani, had similarly betrayed the parivar. Questions are being raised about whether Advani too has a weakness for sycophants and opportunists. And the timing couldnt be more opportune!				 																																																																														 Last time, Govinda had apparently blurted out to the media that he had been paid to campaign for the Congress. Rumours have it that the star has been paid once again this time, but by the saffronwallahs themselves  that is, Ram Naiks arch rivals in Mumbai. And as for our Hero no 1, he doesnt care whose nani it is, so long as he gets paid.				 																																																																														 Its not that the Congress has forgotten its maths altogether. Look at the way it calculated its electoral gains from the first one-day on Pakistani soil. At around 2.17 pm, the Congress SMSs read, Bharat ko jeetne ki sahi aas thi, Rahul aur Priyanka team ke paas thi (India had hopes of winning because Rahul and Priyanka were there with them). The BJP SMS about the victory came much later at 7.45 pm, after the game was over. Meanwhile, between her frequent jumps of joy, Priyanka, sitting at the box of the chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board, was busy ducking questions about whether she was going to contest the forthcoming polls. The game required some finesse because the bouncers came from none other than the former Pakistan skipper, Imran Khan. Her invariable reply was, I havent said so. While most of her interlocutors did not press further, King Khan persisted. The session went on for a while till those present got the impression that she might contest from one of the two seats in UP from where the family had entered the Lok Sabha. Should we thank Imran?

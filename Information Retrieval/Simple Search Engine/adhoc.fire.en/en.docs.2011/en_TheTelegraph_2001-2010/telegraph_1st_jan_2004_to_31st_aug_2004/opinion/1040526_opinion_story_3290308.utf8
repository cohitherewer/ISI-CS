Manmohan Singhs lasting contribution to his adopted home-region would be to end the schizophrenia in the North-east policy, argues Sanjib Baruah The author heads the Centre for Northeast India, South and Southeast Asia in Guwahati and can be contacted at baruahceniseas.org Entry ticketAfter Purna Sangma won the election from Tura, Charles Pyngrope, a minister in Meghalayas Congress-led coalition government, said that the result was a personal victory for Sangma, not for Garo Hills. Pyngropes comments reflect the common sense which many Northeastern politicians have. Whatever your conviction, what ultimately matters is your equation with those in power in New Delhi. It is this common sense that in recent years allowed the Bharatiya Janata Party to make new friends in the region. Those fair weather friends are already showing signs of a change of heart. The BJP in Arunachal Pradesh  that consists almost entirely of Congress and Arunachal Congress politicians who crossed over to the party in 2003  and its allies in Mizoram and Nagaland made a clean sweep in the elections. But the morning after their victory, many of them were focused more on controlling the damage of having backed the wrong horse in Delhi than on celebrating their own victories.Wanting to be on the right side of power is not a trait unique to North-east politicians. But the speed and earnestness with which some of them are trying to politically realign themselves are breathtaking. The phenomenon underscores a dependency syndrome that is related to the north-east states structurally weak position in Indias constitutional architecture. North-easterners always complain that their members of parliament are not effective spokespersons. But the difficulty of representing the interests of small states with one or two-member delegations in a Lok Sabha of 543 members can hardly be exaggerated.Most North-eastern states are special category states that rely almost entirely on Central assistance. Often political equations are critical for getting funds from New Delhi. Nagalands Neiphiu Rio has to now worry about the fate of the Rs 250 crores that Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced as a grant to his state during his visit last October. Other chief ministers currently contemplating the thankless task of downsizing their ministries cannot be blamed for hoping that the political change in New Delhi might give them some extra room to manoeuvre the managing of their states finances that are heavily subsidized by the Centre.It is not only on fiscal issues that the political equation matters. Who is to say, for instance, that the Congress-led government will show the same commitment to the Naga peace process or the Bodo Territorial Council as the BJP-led government? Nagalands Rio and Sansuma Khunguur Bwismuthiary, the MP backed by All Bodo Students Union, have staked much on the continuity of these processes.Nevertheless, Indians can take some pride in the mini states of the North-east and their tribal governing elites. Their significance becomes apparent when one considers them against the plight of tribal peoples in other parts of India and the rest of the world  their systematic marginalization in the process of economic change. Yet there are a number of contradictions inherent in the constitution of these states. First, their complete reliance on New Delhi for their finances gives rise to a dependency syndrome and a culture of fiscal irresponsibility. Second, powerful processes of privatization of community land and of class differentiation in these tribal areas today make an undifferentiated protective discrimination programme for scheduled tribes questionable. Third, there are long-term strains on the protective discrimination regime as a result of demographic changes taking place along with economic development that effect the likelihood of these states remaining predominantly tribal.A charge that one often hears in the North-east is that the region is neglected by New Delhi. The discourse of neglect, however, obscures the serious contradictions that are unfolding on the ground. While the large-scale immigration to the region is often commented upon, much of the attention is usually focused on the so called push factors. This has obscured the role of development itself as a pull factor. The government, through the funds it provides  or does not provide  is the prime mover of this process. Indeed one of the goals of development has been to bring about a transition from shifting cultivation to settled agriculture and from the clan control of land to privatization of land. This has created a social and economic transformation that attract immigrants. On the other hand, as a result of the privatization of clan-held lands there is the emergence of a poorer group of tribal people: former shifting cultivators who are now eking out a living by working as agricultural workers or sharecroppers.In states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram, the protective discrimination regime reserves for SCs the lions share of public employment, business and trade licences, and even the right to seek elected office. There is a de facto regime of two-tiered citizenship. The legislative assemblies of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland have all but one seat reserved for SCs, while in Meghalaya 55 of the 60 seats are reserved for SCs. Yet demographic change  the inevitable result of economic development in a region that has historically been relatively sparsely populated  is putting increasing strain on this arrangement. In order to contain the potential political fall-out of demographic change, the government has, for the moment, frozen the balance of seats reserved for SCs in the state assemblies. It is unlikely that this stopgap measure would withstand the impact of demographic change indefinitely. The implications of making this regime of two-tiered citizenship permanent would be serious. Indias policies on the North-east are schizophrenic. At one level there is talk of facilitating the integration of the region with the dynamic economies of southeast Asia. For that to happen it is said that the barriers to land transfer and internal labour migration might have to go. Yet we continue to rely on policy tools such as the Sixth Schedule and are extending it to new groups that are not isolated. Since apart from the successive generations of non-tribal inhabitants, the economic development of the post-colonial era has attracted many new non-tribal immigrants to the historically tribal areas, extending the Sixth Schedule to newer groups has predictably produced ethnic violence. Indeed arguably, an imperative for ethnic cleansing is built into the policy of extending the Sixth Schedule. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh represents Assam in the Rajya Sabha. Singh has said that the North-east will never be neglected under his watch. But the discourse of neglect can only further indulge the dependency syndrome. Questions of social justice in north-east India are significantly more complex today than what the available policy tools in our repertoire of protective discrimination were originally designed to solve or the discourse of neglect can even begin to capture. We need to look at questions of justice in the region through fresh lenses, taking into account the realities on the ground and stop using the archaic conceptual tools of the colonial policy-maker. Manmohan Singhs lasting contribution to his adopted home region could be a concerted effort to end the schizophrenia in our North-east policy.

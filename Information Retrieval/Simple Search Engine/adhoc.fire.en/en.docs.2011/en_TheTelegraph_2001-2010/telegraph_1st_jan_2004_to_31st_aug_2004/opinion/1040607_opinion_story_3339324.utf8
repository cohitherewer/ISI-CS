The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 07, 2004 							 																						IN THE WINGS																														The insidious danger about bad taste is that people get used to it. The people of India had become used to photographs of the prime minister and his colleagues appearing regularly in government advertisements, without thinking too much about what it said of Indias political culture. By firmly refusing to be featured in government advertisements so soon after becoming prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh has taken an important corrective step. In the first place, it is consistent with the Congresss earlier criticism of the National Democratic Alliance government, that it used more than Rs 200 crore in its Bharat Uday campaign before the Lok Sabha elections. The face of the former prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had become ubiquitous, featured in advertisements in newspapers, magazines and on the television screen. More specifically, Mr Singhs instruction is a sharp reminder of the Bharatiya Janata Partys reliance on Brand Vajpayee, a peculiar sales strategy if the partys criticism of the Congress dynasty was to be taken into account. A prime minister is not an advertisement model. The achievements of any government should ideally be perceived as the outcome of policies and strategies democratically arrived at by a body of representatives given this responsibility by the people.																														There is also the general issue of political culture. Photographs with government advertisements lower the dignity of the ministerial chair. There is an inescapable sense of cheap gimmickry about the practice, it makes the worst use of the propaganda machinery at the service of the government. It may not be unexpected in a political ethos that thrives on the personality cult, as in Tamil Nadu, for example. When the Central government follows the less acceptable practices of a state government, the political culture of the country would seem to be in a sorry state. The Congress itself has not always excelled itself in the realm of political culture. Senior politicians have often engaged in public displays of sycophancy, to cite one of the most frequently repeated criticisms against them. In a way, the BJP has helped to make the decline of political culture obvious by the exhibition its politicians made of themselves, by their arrogance, self-righteousness, collective self-advertisement, reckless distribution of largesse and abusive rhetoric. Political culture in India seemed to have reached its lowest point. That makes it easier for the United Progressive Alliance to reach for a balance. Mr Singhs decision is only the first step. It is to be hoped that the UPA will take some more.

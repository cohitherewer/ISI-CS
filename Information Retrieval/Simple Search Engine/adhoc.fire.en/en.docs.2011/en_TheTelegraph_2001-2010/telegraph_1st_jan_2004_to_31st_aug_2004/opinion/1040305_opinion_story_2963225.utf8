		 Friday, March 05, 2004 							 																						THE ROAD NOT TAKENIndia Tibet amp; China:The Role Nehru Played By Ajay B.Agrawal, N.A. Books International, Rs 295Jawaharlal Nehru was famous for his indecision and vacillation. His ambivalence and inability to face ominous realities for India were most evident in his encounter with the Chinese-cum-Tibetan question. The book deals with the circumstances that finally led to the war of 1962 and the defeat that India suffered. 																														The seeds of Indo-Chinese discord were sown as early as 1914 by the Mc Mahon line which came to determine the border between India and China, but was repudiated by the latter. Meanwhile China kept on claiming that Tibet was a part of it and warned that the Peoples Liberation Army was ready to liberate Tibet.																														Ajay B. Agrawal points up the vague and weak-kneed border policy of Nehru that emboldened the Chinese to make inroads into Indian territory. In fact, Nehru was absolutely incapable of taking on the Chinese challenge at the border. The Chinese had started encroachments in 1954, but Nehru informed the Lok Sabha for the first time only in 1959. It was decided in 1950 to build roads in the border areas, but that did not happen. All the while, before and after the Chinese debacle, Nehru lamented that the border was not approachable due to lack of roads. Meanwhile China was building roads in border areas with an attack in mind.																														The author cites more instances of Nehrus reckless and often irresponsible behaviour. Against Chinese aggression he took the course of least resistance. He accepted the sovereignty of China over Tibet without fuss and was making efforts to assure the world of Chinas peaceful intentions. He deliberately did not allow Tibet to take its case to the world community. He forced the Tibetan delegation to go to China and became a party to the signing of the agreement between China and Tibet. He stood in the way of outside help for Tibet against the Chinese attack.																														In the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, Nehru clung to the delusion that the Chinese would not attack India. At the same time Nehru went on assuring that the country was well prepared to face the Chinese. But the military unpreparedness was woeful, Indian soldiers were too ill-equipped to fight the enemy.																														The height of folly was reached a month before the 1962 war with China. Nehru told Parliament that he had asked the army to evict the Chinese from Thagla when no such thing was done to that effect. 																														According to Agrawal, even the worst from of apartheid practised in South Africa cannot match the Chinese atrocities in Tibet. He suggests that India should recognize the Tibetan Government in exile. The western world should be taken into confidence. Together all should force China to come to some settlement... The tragedy of Tibet calls for all right thinking people to stand by Tibet...and make the situation conducive for all Tibetans to live in their own country in their own way as they always did for ages.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 11, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Flying high				 																																																				Sir  The left has reasons to be sceptical about allowing private investors a 74 per cent stake in the modernization of the Delhi and Mumbai airports (Left nudges govt to tweak airport plan, June 9). The new arrangement will give foreign and private players 49 per cent and 25 per cent stakes respectively and the rest to the Airports Authority of India. This means that the foreign investor will be in a position to wield a lot of clout, especially in employment at these places. Which means there will be little room for labour union rowdyism. Anybody who has been to these two important airports will agree that, at present, they portray a very poor picture of India to foreign investors in the country. Nobody can discount the importance of refurbishing and reorganizing the airports at a time India is emerging as a promising investment destination. If the government has been unsuccessful in upgrading these airports, there can be no harm in handing the task over to those who will do a better job. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sangeeta Jain, Calcutta 
				 																Green signal 				 																																																				Sir  The new railways minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, reminds one of a newly appointed priest in the temple who prays louder than the rest. He wants to add special coaches, laden with vegetables from Bihar, to trains travelling to Delhi and Calcutta (Chug chug turnip train, May 7). Yadav may be trying to trying to help poor vegetable-growers of Bihar, but has he thought of the poor farmers of West Bengal and Delhi who will face competition? 				 																																																				Yadav has been the brain behind the new practice of serving tea in kulhads and food in sal leaves on trains. This is undoubtedly a novel idea, but what about the more pertinent issues like train dacoities, harassment of travellers with valid reservation by daily passengers, dirty toilets and littered compartments, ticketless-travel and nepotism in the awarding of railway contracts? It is all very well to go the green way, but cleanliness on trains has to be addressed too. Train compartments and tracks are littered with waste thrown out of windows. Dustbins are rarely seen in the compartments. As a responsible minister, Yadav should have begun by creating an awareness drive for cleanliness. There is also the question of practicability. For example, it will not be easy for the railway caterers to carry and serve food on sal leaves to so many passengers simultaneously, without making a mess of it. Besides, it is doubtful if sal leaves will convenience travellers who have to balance dal, rice, roti and subzi on these frail plates on a running train. 				 																																																				Laloo Yadav should concentrate on and accord top priority to the major issues concerning rail safety and comfort of passengers instead of diverting public attention by his populist measures.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Laloo Prasad Yadav may have earned the reputation of a corrupt politician. But, one has to admit, he is one of the most innovative railways ministers we have had. The switch to earthen cups and environment-friendly leaf plates on trains stand testimony to his ingenuity. But if he is truly a minister for the whole of India and not just Bihar, as he has claimed, he should have given a thought to the poor and hapless farmers of Andhra Pradesh too. If poor farmers in Bihar are being given a chance to sell their vegetables in other states, why have the farmers from the rest of the country been left out? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The new practice of using earthen cups instead of plastic ones on trains may come as good news to kumhars. But there are other implications of this measure which should not be missed out. The top soil, which is used to make these earthen cups, will be affected. The brick kilns are already causing considerable damage to the soil. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ajay Agrawal, Calcutta

Sir  I was most amused see the picture by Amit Datta on the front page on June 9 which shows tea being served to railway passengers in earthen cups. But instead of the thermos flask on the tray, a mini surahi or earthen container would have been more appropriate. May the thermos flask go the same way as the plastic cups. Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Since Laloo Prasad Yadav took over as the Indian railways minister, six bizarre incidents of crime on train have already occurred within a period of less than 20 days. However, the latest in which two people were killed in their sleep on the Danapur Express is surely the most horrifying (Train assassins draw blood in AC coach, June 10). Crime aboard trains is becoming more and more predictable. This has to stop. Trains are used by all kinds of people belonging to all strata of society. Unless the government assures their security, the Indian railways will become extremely unpopular and suffer losses. Moreover, crime on rail will invariably be seized by the opposition as an election issue. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Bad boys				 																																																				Sir  I cannot agree with N.J. Nanporias view that In a sense, Abu Ghraib was un-American and that such eruptions of sadistic behaviour are rare (Two wrongs do not make a right, June 9). It is not the stress factor, wherever Americans have gone to exercise their supremacy, they have behaved similarly (remember Vietnam?). This time it has become a major issue because information has been revolutionized. Sadistic men always try to derive pleasure at others expense. This is true not only in the army, but also in schools and colleges. The world can never forget Idi Amin or the Latin American dictators, or better still the Nazis. By following their perverse instincts, the so-called civilized Americans have reduced them to barbarians.

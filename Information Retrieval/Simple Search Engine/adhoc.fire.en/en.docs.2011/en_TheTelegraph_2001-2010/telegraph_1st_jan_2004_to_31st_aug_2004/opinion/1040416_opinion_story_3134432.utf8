The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 16, 2004 							 																						A PROBLEM OF PLENTY				 	 No one buys these books																														Nearly half the titles published in English every year ought never to have been published. Poorly researched, shoddily written and edited, badly marketed, they disappear within a few months of publication. Although there are annual post mortems (even half-yearly) and constant monitoring of sales, nearly 50,000 new titles appear in America and Britain alone, to which are added another 20,000 from India, Australia and Africa. From an editorial or economic standpoint, it makes no sense.																														Yet the deluge continues for a variety of reasons. The detection of quality is difficult for those who make a career out of reading and writing a variety of subjects. The evaluation process is quite beyond the intellectual competence of the present clutch of editors in most publishing houses, who have drifted into the job without any particular interest in books or ideas.																														They supplement their meagre understanding by going to experts, but it doesnt help. Most experts are academics who, by and large, dont critically evaluate the work from the three important aspects of language, style and relevance of the subject matter to a specific need. Since in most cases the examiners report is off-the-cuff, some publishers have devised an evaluation sheet with yes/no answers or short answers of 15-20 words. But this method hasnt worked.																														Why has the academic let down the publisher? There are three reasons. One, the academic doesnt trust the publisher (in many cases justifiedly) to respect the confidentiality of his report and keep his identity a secret. Because the academic world is small, such a leakage could ruin the experts relations with his colleagues. So, the expert submits a goody-goody report, suggesting marginal changes and the book goes through.																														Two, the publishers fees are pathetic. Why should the academic waste his time and money on something he gets nothing out of? Three, few academics read outside their area of specialization. 																														Taste, literary discrimination and a passion for the work undertaken are qualities difficult to find. And without them you cannot hope to get the books you want.																														Publishing fashions come and go in cycles: what interests the buyer today may not interest him tomorrow. Also, there are so few retail outlets even in the metros that it would be risky to completely trust a wholesaler or a retailer on how the book would move. Some often refer to libraries as the fallback that can be relied upon to pick up stocks and help recover costs. But libraries  even libraries of central universities and institutions of national importance  are usually starved of funds. In fact, major booksellers no longer supply books to libraries on credit; it is always cash and carry.																														So what can the publisher do? First, build his own in-house intellectual resources, a list of advisers of different specializations who can be trusted upon to give an honest assessment of a work. Above all, cut down the number of titles published, which means stick to quality because only quality sells.						RAVI VYAS

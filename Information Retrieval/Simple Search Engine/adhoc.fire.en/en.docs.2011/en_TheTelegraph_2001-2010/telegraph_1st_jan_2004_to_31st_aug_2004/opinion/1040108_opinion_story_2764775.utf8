The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 							 																						DOFF THE BAGGY CAP																								When Don Bradman was bowled by Hollis for a duck in his last innings, it was said that he had misread the googly because his eyes had misted over after the ovation he had received. No such emotion disturbed Steve Waugh as he played another innings to save his team and his country. Most followers of cricket have probably lost count of the number of such innings that Waugh had played throughout his career. It was entirely fitting therefore that he should bid farewell by playing an innings when his team most needed him to lead from the front. Steve Waugh was never afflicted by nerves on the cricket field. He was a realist who knew what the occasion demanded and tried to deliver. More often than not he did. Waugh, before Sourav Ganguly and his boys as the underdogs stopped the juggernaut, had made the Aussies into an almost unbeatable side. But this status of the Australian side has a long lineage going back to Allan Border and Mark Taylor. That tradition could even be pushed back to the time when the Australian team was captained by Ian and Greg Chappell. Waugh took over the team and pushed up its efficiency a notch or two. He could do this because he had two of the greatest bowlers of modern cricket in his side, Glen McGrath and Shane Warne. Waughs leadership had a no nonsense character. He stood in gully or in the covers and unobtrusively but decisively marshalled his resources. He was not a dazzling captain like Ritchie Benaud but an able one. His batting bore the same characteristics. Except for the hook and the pull, he hardly played any of the fancy shots. He was a powerful player square of the wicket on the off-side. He drove past cover but without any of the flourish normally associated with that most beautiful of cricket shots. Nobody would choose Waugh to entertain as a batsman. But almost everybody would choose him to save ones life.																								Steve Waughs emotions were visible in his activities off the cricket field. He is a human being with compassion and a commitment to help those who are sick, old and underprivileged. This is why Waugh is a hero in Calcutta despite his occasional sparring matches with the local star, Ganguly. Waugh visits Calcutta to be with the needy and the ill. There is no other cricketer in the annals of the noble game who has shown this level of social conscience and commitment. This is what makes Waugh more than just a talented cricketer. Waugh has played his last test innings but he has just begun another in a different kind of match. He has already shown his mettle in this field.

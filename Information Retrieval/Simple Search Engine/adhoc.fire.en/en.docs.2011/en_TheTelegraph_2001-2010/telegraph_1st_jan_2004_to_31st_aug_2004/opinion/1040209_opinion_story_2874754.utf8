The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, February 09, 2004 							 																						HELD IN FEE There is, apparently, a philosophy  behind the fees. The Indian Institutes of Management are  now, quite literally, being made to pay for having come  robustly of age. The Union human resource development minister,  Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, has directed the six IIMs to cut  their annual fees down to Rs 30,000 from Rs 1.5 lakh, from  the 2004-05 session. This happened on the day that the Lok  Sabha was dissolved, with the IIMs only coming to know of  it from the press. The directive comes at the end of a long  struggle of wills between Mr Joshi and the IIMs. At the  heart of this struggle is the issue of these institutions  autonomy, even as Mr Joshis misguided peremptoriness  becomes yet another instance of his ministrys agency  in bringing about the decline of quality higher education  in the country. The IIMs have, of course, been prepared  for this, and their earlier cautiously diplomatic rhetoric  in keeping Mr Joshis meddlesomeness at bay has now  been sharpened into a more concerted and definite resistance.  The chairman of IIM Ahmedabad had earlier declined a large  part of the ministrys annual grant on grounds of social  responsibility. His institute had enough money to  support its own expenditure; so Mr Joshi should spend the  governments money on more essential expenses. That  this was a move to minimize obligations to the ministry  and thereby pre-empt inroads into its academic independence  had occurred to most. Eminent Catholic schools in Calcutta  have done this sort of thing with the West Bengal government  to fend off interference. Mr Joshis directive is, of course,  propped up by a highly selective and ad hoc reading  of the U.R. Rao committee recommendations. Ironically, Mr  Rao is now distancing himself from this particular use of  his own report. He feels that there has been a misapplication  of the letter of his recommendations, while disregarding  the spirit in which they were made. Mr Joshis meddling  with the IIMs goes well beyond the issue of the fees. The  democratization of quality management education must also  include a single national-level entrance examination and  the scrapping of the group discussion assessments (because  they lead to social discrimination). But most damagingly,  he has decided to tinker with the student-teacher ratio,  demanding that the IIMs take in considerably more students.  They might even be asked to cut down on staff and allocate  more work to those who are still on the rolls. Mr Joshis  inability to distinguish between the demands of excellence  and elitist excess comes garbed, therefore, in a rhetoric  of democratic utilitarianism.																														The faculty and students of these distinguished institutes feel that Mr Joshis measures are addressing a problem which simply does not exist. The IIMs remain strictly meritocratic, and nobody who has cleared admissions has been turned away for not being able to afford the fees. By forcing the IIMs to accept Central subsidies, Mr Joshi proves yet again that his own regressive notions of higher education are inimical to the spirit of both autonomy and merit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 							 																						TO BEAT ALL REALITY SHOWS GOURI CHATTERJEE				 	 Unburdened																					When Maninderpal Singh Kohli wants to unburden himself of raping and killing young Hannah Foster, he parks himself in front of a television camera. When kidnappers in Iraq want to get their message across, they shoot home videos, complete with masked men pointing threatening guns at cowering captives and a beheading at times, and courier them to 24-hour Arabic cable networks. 																					Thanks to ever-obliging television channels, murderers and militants have demonstrated unexpected talents in two increasingly similar fields: a Bollywood directors flair for high drama and a news editors nose for news. The Holders of the Black Banner have even dressed their prisoners in the orange hues favoured by the US prison authorities in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. But where does that leave the news channels? At what point can they be said to have become handy tools of crime and war? 																					Kohli and the kidnappers in Iraq appear to understand the compulsions of news channels all too well. The cut-throat competition among television channels worldwide is not only going to ensure these footages are shown, but shown as promptly, and hence as unquestioningly, as possible.																					NDTV is justly proud of beating its rivals by over two hours with its Kohli interview. Television time beats dog years hollow, and even a two-minute lead on any insipid news is something to crow about. To expect, then, NDTV or any channel to stop and probe Kohlis motives for such a public revelation or wait for reactions to put things in perspective is plain silly. Those are luxuries newspapers with their leisurely ways can afford. 																					The restraint shown by the British media in not publicizing Kohlis confession as it might affect the course of justice is highly commendable, but one wonders what would have happened if the British police had behaved as shockingly as the Punjab police. The British press is hardly known as a paragon of responsible journalism. And never before has anyone confessed to rape and murder so openly and so composedly. A reality show to beat all reality shows.																					With abductions, and their accompanying videos, getting to be more and more frequent, there is however more of a debate over their telecast. News channels are trying to exercise more control over how much to show so that they can avoid being used as a propaganda tool by the militants. 																					Some channels, like CNN, have begun muting the voices of the hostage takers; some, like Channel NewsAsia of Singapore, have decided to report on the events but not show the footage at all. Even Arab channels are being more circumspect. Al Arabiya, the Arabic news channel that was first gifted the tape of the kidnapped Indian truck-drivers, reportedly edited out the parts showing the abductors invoking God in their quest to defeat the United States. 																					But it is unlikely that we can ever get off this slippery slope so easily. The Kohlis and the kidnappers of this increasingly manic world have tasted blood. Plug one avenue and they may soon devise something even more outrageous to maintain their access to the airwaves.

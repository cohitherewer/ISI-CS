		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 							 																						LIES DONT WIN																														Regimes change in different ways. What is being played out in Spain is the complicated relationship between global terrorism and local democracy. There is now enough evidence to suggest that a radical Islamist group, which bombed Casablanca last May and has definite links with al Qaida, was behind the Madrid blasts. March 11 is beginning to look like Europes 9/11. But its aftermath could not have been more different. In Spain, it has led to a catastrophic regime change that is more a victory for participatory democracy than the triumph of terror. Spaniards have voted out their conservative prime minister of eight years, Mr Jos Mara Aznar of the Peoples Party, in favour of Mr Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero of the Socialist Party. The Spanish economy had grown by more than 2 per cent last year, and Mr Aznars electoral prospects looked entirely hopeful until the bombs went off in Madrid. Mr Aznars government then went all out to convince its electorate that the culprits were the Basque-separatist ETA, although their style of terror since the early Sixties to the present day has been quite different. Within days, the perception grew that the people of Spain were being deliberately misinformed, since Mr Aznar had everything to gain by blaming the ETA and covering up the role of Islamic terrorism. He was one of the allies of Messrs Bush and Blair in their war against terror, having sent out troops to Iraq. Mr Aznar did not at all want the Madrid tragedy to look like a terrible consequence of that alliance. But blaming the Basques in the face of contrary evidence had precisely that effect. The Spanish people turned out to vote in unprecedented numbers and elected a leader who had never supported the war in Iraq and has promised to withdraw Spanish troops from there. He takes pride in having won without lies.																														This is, perhaps, a brutal lesson for Mr Tony Blair, who has also been plagued by that ugly word and has had reason to ponder the nature of democracy in Britain. But Spain will also change equations within Europe, having moved away from Britain and the United States of America towards France and Germany, leaving Italy and Poland, both of whom have troops in Iraq, to wonder about their own allegiances. Security meetings across Europe are now confronting the implications of a new quality of threat for the European Union. Two full-scale wars and many anti-terrorist operations later, al Qaida seems to be alive and well. But far from being united over this threatening reality, Old Europe seems to be even more sharply at odds with the New Worlds manner of reckoning with it.

				 																																	Ever looked at Walt Disney movies such as Shrek and Lion King and wondered why we didnt have any of our own? Sudhir Tailang will now put all such wonderment to rest. The political cartoonist is currently on a high with the success of his London exhibition on Indian Prime Ministers. But he doesnt want to rest on his laurels. Tailang plans to come up with Indias first full-length animation feature film based on a love story. And as in Hollywood, Indias biggest stars, Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, will lend voice to his drawings. Tailang has also decided to shoot the movie in Hindi-English double format. These days, who doesnt? Mamata Shankar Mamata Shankar				 																																	Twenty-five years is a long time. To most, it calls for some soul-searching. To Mamata Shankar, it calls for the introduction of a new concept. The actor and dancer has combined the two things that she does best to celebrate the silver jubilee of her ballet troupe last week, and in quite a novel way too. In our new ballet drama, we have charted the journey of the modern soul in a world of strife and greed, explains Shankars husband and troupe-member Chandrodoy Ghosh. Humanity has reached a dead end. And it is only through soul-searching that we can reach salvation, explains Ghosh. Thanks for telling us that. Some people just dont understand. Stephen Alter				 																																	 Rivers over, Stephen Alter has now taken to writing about Indian elephants. The author of Sacred Waters has come up with a new book, Elephus Maximas, A Portrait Of The Indian Elephant, to be released in India this month. Alter, who teaches at MIT in the US, grew up in Mussoorie and claims he misses India a lot. But when youre cashing in on memories, it cant be all that bad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 26, 2004 							 																						DOWN THE MIDDLE																														It is tempting to find a symbolic dimension in the split in the Nationalist Congress Party. Both the warring sides have decided that they are the real NCP, that their chief is the real president, and that what the other faction has done is illegal. The pull that tore the young party apart was the alliance game. Mr Sharad Pawars side wants to align with the Congress for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, and Mr P.A. Sangma wants to go over to the National Democratic Alliance with his men. The right alliance has become crucial to vote-winning. Add to that the different demands of different regions and their varying equations with the Centre, and a split such as that in the NCP looks perfectly logical. Mr Sangma and Mr Pawar were thrown together because of their rejection of Ms Sonia Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate from the Congress. Mr Pawars subsequent decision to align with the Congress in order to form the government in Maharashtra took away something from the partys raison detre. Mr Sangma has used this reason for his decision to side with the Bharatiya Janata Party this time, although by forming the North-East Peoples Forum, he also appears to be aspiring to the stature of regional leader, an advantage that Mr Pawar already enjoys.																														Double-billing has become extremely important. Mr V.C. Shukla has abandoned Mr Pawar too, but will not be in Mr Sangmas party either when he throws in his lot with the NDA. Instead he will form his own outfit based in Chhattisgarh. Perhaps he will now be able to get his own back a little, since he had found it very difficult to digest the Congress high commands decision to make Mr Ajit Jogi the chief minister of the newborn Chhattisgarh. The importance of regions has been growing over the last few years: the clout of Mr N. Chandrababu Naidu and Ms J. Jayalalithaa at the Centre, for example, cannot be understood without this. The BJP has used this shrewdly  it was a notable feature of its carefully calibrated campaigns for the recent assembly elections where it won in three states. On the face of it, the split in the NCP looks advantageous for the BJP. But there is still some time to see whether the BJP or the Congress picks up the biggest prizes. And then the electorate can change it all.

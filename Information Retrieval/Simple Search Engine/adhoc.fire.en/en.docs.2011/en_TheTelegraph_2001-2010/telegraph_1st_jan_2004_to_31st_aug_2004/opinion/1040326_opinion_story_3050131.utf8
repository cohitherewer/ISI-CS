James Mill, in his multi-volume History of British India, characterized Indians as being grossly lacking in historical sensibility. In 1857, Marx wrote that India was vegetating in the teeth of time. However, Vinay Lals book argues that this ahistoricity was deliberate  almost a form of principled forgetfulness.																					The disparagement of Western scholars encouraged nineteenth- century Indian intellectuals to attempt to build a history for India. The Puranas and the epics were seen as constituting a rich tradition of historical inquiry and were mined for historical insights.																					With independence, an effort to write Indias history began  by giving primacy to the independence struggle and by portraying India as a nation with a glorious past, as seen in the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan-sponsored History and Culture of the Indian People. 																					From the Seventies onwards, historians appeared to be actively patronized by politicians. Attempts to revise history textbooks for schools, as seen under the first Janata government, set off a furore, with historians ranged on both sides of the political divide.																					The Eighties coincided with the resurgence of communalism  epitomized by the Vishwa Hindu Parishads campaign to revive the Babri Masjid dispute. Interestingly, both sides, whether in defence of or against the mosque, cited history to buttress their arguments. It was around this period that the subaltern school earned India a place in international historiography, for the first time. 																					Despite its yeoman contribution, subaltern history, Lal argues, has become, what he calls, exilic history. History remains a contested site, between the progressive sections and the traditionalists. With its ascendancy in the diaspora, history has also acquired a cyber-identity. Indians in north America have been proponents of the view that the Aryans actually dispersed to western and central Asia from India. This strand of revisionism speaks of the entire edifice of Indo-European studies as an invented tradition and perpetuates another excess by denying the non-Aryan foundation of early Indian civilization.																					Lals book is mainly on Indian historiography. Written engagingly, it raises questions about the seeming ahistoricity of India  how deliberate was this forgetfulness and why? Lal also points out that textbooks are only particular ways of selecting and organizing the vast universe of knowledge. He has a similar point to make about those who would rather confine heritage to the sites of ancient, preservable monuments  Lal feels that it museumizes history, leaving it locked up in a park. Like Ashis Nandy, Lal stresses on the need to look back at the rich traditions of inquiry that already exist in India. But then history and how it is to be taught will always remain a subject of debate in India, just as it is in progressive nations like the United States of America and the United Kingdom.																					Research into history education is a relatively new field, even in the West. History has moved away from the realm of philosophy to involve educational psychologists and academics. Historical thinking requires a different set of skills and may be adduced by adding a narrative structure to history teaching. For example, by allowing students to construct their own knowledge. It is also being realized, that to really think historically is to go against the grain of how we ordinarily think, even though these imbibed ways of thinking may help us. How history is to be written will, it seems, remain forever a dilemma. Lals book, it is hoped, will open a new line of thought in this area.						ANURADHA KUMAR

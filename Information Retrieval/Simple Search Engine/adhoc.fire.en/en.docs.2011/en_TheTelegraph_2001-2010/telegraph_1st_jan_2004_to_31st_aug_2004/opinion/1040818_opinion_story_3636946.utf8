		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 							 																						ACT OF FORCE																														It must be an abnormal situation when a democratic state is perceived as an instrument of force. The continuing violence in Manipur may easily blur the distinction between perception and reality. There is little doubt that the anger against the abuses of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act has spread far and deep among the people. The death of a woman in the armys custody, which has triggered the current spell of violence, raises serious questions about the use of state power. Even if the woman had links with some militant group, as has been alleged, the army needs to answer for the custodial death. Unfortunately, the judicial inquiry into the incident has so far received little support from the local commanders of the army. Such lapses on the part of the state are largely responsible for creating the perception of the army as a force of repression. The fact, however, is that the act has been in force in Manipur, as in some other states in the North-east, to uphold the rule of law in the face of the militants threat to subvert it. The majority of people should actually benefit from the act  if only its provisions were used judiciously. 																														It is not difficult to see why most political parties now want the act to be withdrawn. The swelling of popular sentiments against it has forced their hands. The decision of the chief minister, Mr Okram Ibobi Singh, to withdraw the act from the Imphal municipal area was obviously guided more by this popular feeling than by administrative necessity. Mr Singh cannot have been unaware of the Centres disapproval of his move. But politics is local everywhere. The Centre cannot afford, however, to be guided by political considerations alone in tackling the situation. There is a very real possibility that Manipurs many insurgent groups will exploit the public mood to try and sabotage both democracy and the rule of law in the state. New Delhis strategy to control the situation should have two clear aims. One is to isolate and defeat the militants in their devious games. And the other is to regain the peoples confidence in the states power and sincerity to ensure them a life free from the fear of the militants. Obviously, the political establishment, both in Imphal and New Delhi, has its role in correcting the popular perception of the army. Even a spell of presidents rule may be better than allowing Manipur to plunge completely into chaos.

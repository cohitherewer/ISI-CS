The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 13, 2004 							 																						BOWL																													EM																													OVER In two years, he has gone from the bylanes of Vadodara to blazing his trail on the 22 yards. Today, Irfan Pathan is set to script Indian crickets new success story																														In his swank and capacious hotel room in Calcutta, Irfan Khan Pathan is furiously pacing up and down. As fidgety as a teenager on a first date, the tall cricketer looks an over-the-top version of himself. Kicking at a cardboard box, pumping up the volume on the B4U music channel and playing boyish pranks with a friend over his Panasonic mobile phone  all at the same time.																														This is not the Irfan you see on television. On camera, the 19-year-old is conscious, controlled, almost too wise for his age. Here, the mask is off. And the Baroda boy offers a peep show into what he is really going through. Edgy and hyperactive, he is packing his bags  a neatly folded blue mat used for prayers is kept on the table, Irfan offers namaaz five times a day  when the teenager suddenly mumbles, Kuch yaad nahi aa raha hai. Then comes the confession, Main relax hi to nahin ho pa raha.																														The utterance is understandable; maybe, even predictable. When you know a billion pair of eyes will dissect every move you make in Karachis National Stadium today and in the next six weeks in Pakistan, the pressure of trying too hard to act normal can be asphyxiating.																														After all, barely five months ago, Irfan was playing junior cricket in Pakistan. Then in Australia, when injuries rendered some senior players hors de combat, the Baroda boy got his big chance. 																														He didnt knife through the Kangaroos during the Tests but emerged as Indias top wicket-taker in the one-day series. Irfan, everyone admitted, displayed attitude, spirit, spunk and, most importantly, heart. As L.K. Advani would say, he created a feel-good factor.																														For a variety of reasons, he also hit the headlines. He was reprimanded by the ICC for unsporting conduct, took eager tips from former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, and was at the receiving end of Javed Miandads verbal beamer, Aise cricketer to Pakistan ki galiyon mein milte hain.																														Suddenly, Irfans name was spreading faster than the smell of the attar his father sells from a shop in Vadodaras Jama Masjid.																														But the importance of being Irfan Pathan goes much beyond the game he plays. Brought up in a locality which was under curfew for three months during the 2002 Gujarat killings and which is just three kilometres away from the burnt-down Best Bakery, his accomplishments are as much a matter of community pride as a certificate for the systems fairness.																														His success is a challenge to those who say there is no scope for Muslims in India. It shows if you work hard enough, there is no barrier, says Shahnawaz, who runs an NGO, Helping Hands, in the communally sensitive city. Simply by being what he is and what he has come to symbolise, Irfan matters.																														The last time India played a full cricket series in Pakistan, he was a five-year-old kid either busy throwing stones at mangoes and tamarinds in the neighbourhood trees, or, watching cricket on television somewhere in the mohalla because the family then didnt own a set. With elder brother Yusuf, now a Ranji cricketer, Irfan played in the gullies, even inside the house  a broken blue mirror in their humble one-room shack is still a mute evidence of their indoor cricket days  until both were taken to local coaches, Bashir Sheikh (now late) and Mehndi Sheikh.																														Those were hard times. Even father Mehmood Khans doubling up as the muezzin of the Jama Masjid wasnt enough to take care of their cricket costs. But help came from relatives, coaches and other senior local cricketers. One of Irfans relatives bought him a bat worth Rs 5,000.																														And, despite fiscal pressures, Mehmood purchased a portable black and white television so that his sons could learn from the cricket greats in action.																														Then, one afternoon four years ago, the father discovered that his younger son was destined to succeed. Irfan was hit on the face batting in an under-19 game against Mumbai. He bled profusely, was hurried off the pitch to a nearby clinic and underwent 17 sutures. Most teenagers would have gone home. Irfan went back to the ground and played a match-winning knock. That day, says Mehmood, I knew the boy was something special.																														The boy whizzed into international spotlight last November taking nine wickets for 16 runs, including a hattrick, against Bangladesh in the Asia U-19 championship. Nobody has ever scalped nine victims in any one-day game. But Irfan isnt gushing. At that time I was just doing my job. Later, my coach said, Arre tuney world record banaya, he says.																														The Baroda bowler, who loves gorging on gosht biryani and listening to Sonu Nigam, is showing signs of a thoroughbred in the making. He is quick to grasp anything, says coach Mehndi. Akram, who gave the youngster tips on his wrist action, has affirmed that. That apart, Bruce Reid helped me out with the angle. Kapil Dev spoke to me about his experience in Pakistan and I have drawn on them, says the young bowler. Like an eager blotting paper, Irfan is soaking in everything with the enthusiasm of a child.																														He is dedicated, too. Irfan turned up for the local nets the very next day after returning from the Asia Championship triumph. And, he plans for the future. Guddu (the bowlers pet name) knows that Pakistan pitches will offer little movement off the wicket. So he practised yorkers before leaving, says brother Yusuf.																														As a left-arm seamer, who moves the ball both ways, Irfan has impressed one and all. He has a great match temperament. He should be a long-term India prospect, says former Test cricketer Madan Lal. But it is his correct batting technique during the Australia tour that pleasantly surprised the pundits. If he keeps working at it, the cricketer could be the missing link in the Indian one-day team: a genuine all-rounder.																														There is, however, a huge gap between promise and fulfilment in international cricket. It separates the boys from the men. And, the Pakistan tour will be Irfans sternest test; far tougher than the Class XII examination he is skipping.																														After the Australian tour, the youngster brought home expensive sports shoes for his brother and foreign chocolates for his young sister, Shagufta. He is still gawky and inarticulate. But his six-feet-and-two-inch frame and clean cut features might just help colas and corduroys sell faster in the age of 72 television channels. Sab hoga dheere dheere. Thoda time lagega, par hoga, he says. A successful Pakistan tour can make that happen really fast. Another story of cricket as a vehicle for social mobility would be complete then.																														So when Irfan Khan Pathan tells you with a boyish grin, Hamare liye dua karna, as you take leave, you smile back in empathy. You know a billion others would have done the same.

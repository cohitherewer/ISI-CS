The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 12, 2004 							 																						BRUTALLY POOR																														Anarchists have a vested interest in violence and social unrest. The Maoists who killed 26 policemen in Jharkhand and those who struck in Nepals Pashupatinagar may belong to two different groups, but their brutality springs from the same cynical ideology. Although Maoism is a discredited word even in the Great Helmsmans own country, these groups still swear by the guerrilla tactics canonized by communist leaders of another era, such as Mao Zedong himself and Che Guevara. It is amazing that they still believe that a powerful, modern state can be destabilized by striking at some remote police outpost or killing some unwary policemen. But they have a cynical strategy behind this seemingly preposterous idea. They want to exploit the states reaction to such violence in order to swell their ranks. The recurrence of Maoist violence in Jharkhand exposes serious weaknesses in the states strategy as well. There is little doubt that different Maoist groups in India have close links with their counterparts in Nepal. The fact that New Delhi knows of these dangerous liaisons does not seem to have made any difference to containing the menace. The immediate task before the Centre and the Jharkhand government is to ensure that the rebels cannot disrupt the forthcoming elections in the state. But the real challenge of wiping out the Maoist threat goes beyond the polls. The governments have an obligation to protect the peoples right to live in peace and to ensure the rule of law. 																														It is commonplace to link political extremism to extreme poverty. There is no denying that poverty is endemic in some of the areas in Jharkhand, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa or West Bengal where the Peoples War of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or the Maoist Communist Centre has been active. Much the same is true of the rebel strongholds in Nepals western districts. There is thus much merit in the suggestion by the Union home minister, Mr L.K. Advani, that fighting poverty is as important in tackling the Maoists as strengthening the police force. Also, this is a task that requires all these states to co-ordinate their strategies with New Delhi. It is not enough to ask for additional Central forces. Given the ineptitude of the administration in many states, the Centre must devise better mechanisms to see that the benefits of poverty-alleviation schemes reach the target groups. Obviously, the rebels success in recruiting the poor to their ranks derives largely from the administrations failure to reach out to them. The poor of Jharkhand  as of the other affected states  have been left to the Maoists mercy for far too long.

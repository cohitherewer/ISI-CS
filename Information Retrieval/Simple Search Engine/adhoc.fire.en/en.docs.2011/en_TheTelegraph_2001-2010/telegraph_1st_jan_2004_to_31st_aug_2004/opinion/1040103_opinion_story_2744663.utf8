The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 03, 2004 							 																						NO PERMANENT ENEMIES																								The art of the possible: this is the best known definition of politics. A more cynical view would define politics as the pursuit of interest masquerading as the contest of principles. Both views can draw enough support from the prevailing state of play in Indian politics. The sudden scurry among political parties to form alliances demonstrates that politics has sloughed off ideology. This phenomenon of ideology-neutral politics has been driven by the compulsions of the age of coalitions. The fracturing of the Indian political space has meant that no one party by itself can form a government at the Centre. The National Democratic Alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party was formed to meet a new political contingency. It would be impossible to discern common ideological assumptions underpinning the NDA. It was power or the desire to govern that brought the parties together and have held the coalition together. When it was formed, the NDA was written off as fragile and very few predicted that it would last its full term. The most important factor in the survival and the success of the NDA was the BJPs willingness to set aside its core ideological agenda. The BJP has taken pains not to push Hindutva on the NDA programme. It has emphasized governance, stability and order. It is easy to read this shift in the BJPs priorities as political opportunism. In reality, it is the recognition that good governance has no ideology or is an ideology by itself.																								The change in the BJPs political perspective and objective has created a number of possibilities which can never be explained or understood in terms of an analytical framework that is ideology-centred. Ideology cannot explain a political dialogue between the BJP and Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party. But such a dialogue has moved from the impossible to the possible to actuality. Similarly, in terms of the conventional understanding of Indian politics on the basis of vote bases and ideology, the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party should never come together since both are claimants to the Dalit pie. But a coziness between the Congress and Ms Mayavati is already a part of the art of the possible. It is obvious from political trends that different set of compulsions and priorities are now the determinants of decisions that will make the future of India.																								To disparage this development  as many are prone to do  is to lose touch with reality. The motor of politics, no matter what leftist pundits espouse, has always been power. Political parties are institutional embodiments of the drive to wield authority. The exercise of power has its own demands and they affect political parties in similar ways. In West Bengal, years of being in power and the desire to continue in office has made the left focus on governance instead of ideology. In New Delhi, the BJP has undergone a similar experience. After being out of office since 1996, the Congress is realizing that it cannot cling to outmoded notions and must open itself up to alliances that have no ideological anchors. The nature of politics is changing. Possibilities, previously unimaginable, have opened up and with that the art of handling such possibilities have become more mature and sophisticated.

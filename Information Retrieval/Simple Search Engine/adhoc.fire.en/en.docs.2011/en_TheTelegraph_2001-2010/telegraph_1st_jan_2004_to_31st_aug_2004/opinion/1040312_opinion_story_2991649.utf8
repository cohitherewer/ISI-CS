The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 12, 2004 							 																						GUNS DONT VOTE																														Elections, even if flawed, make infinitely better sense than class war. Communists in India may still split hairs over theories of class, but they too must come to accept elections as the legitimate tool in the pursuit of power. But then anarchists accept nothing that makes sense to others. There is thus nothing unusual about the Maoists attempts to disrupt the coming elections in Jharkhand. They had made similar attempts before and in several other states. The Jharkhand government faces a most crucial test, precisely because the guerrillas of the Peoples War of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or the Maoist Communist Centre would be intent on their evil design. It has no option but to defeat the Maoist challenge and protect the peoples right to choose their representatives. And it must take all steps necessary to ensure that. It would be nave, though, to underplay the Maoist threat. One could lay the blame for it at the governments door, but the fact remains that PW and MCC cadre are active in 17 of the 23 districts in the state. It would be no small task for the government to ensure free and peaceful polls. But failing to do so, however, would mean the governments failure to meet its constitutional obligations. 																														Jharkhand would be justified in asking for New Delhis help. The Maoists in the state are known to work in tandem with their counterparts in adjoining areas of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal. Recent Maoist onslaughts in Koraput in Orissa and in West Midnapore in West Bengal have proved this once again. Paramilitary forces or other reinforcements from the Centre could go some way in strengthening the local police. What is needed more is a strategy to use these forces effectively. Jharkhand should get its act together in consultation with both the Centre and the states. There is much substance in the argument that Jharkhands abject poverty and the administrations inadequate response to it are a major cause for its Maoist problem. Even the Union home minister, Mr L.K. Advani, accepts this as a main reason for political extremism in different parts of the country. It is crucial to reach the fruits of administration to the poorest of people whom the Maoists entice with their gun culture. But it is important also not to miss the cynicism of the outlaws argument. The Maoists seek to create a vicious cycle in which poverty and armed rebellions go hand-in-hand. The system needs to mend its flaws and Jharkhands politicians, their dubious ways. But the rule of the gun can only be a barbarians substitute.

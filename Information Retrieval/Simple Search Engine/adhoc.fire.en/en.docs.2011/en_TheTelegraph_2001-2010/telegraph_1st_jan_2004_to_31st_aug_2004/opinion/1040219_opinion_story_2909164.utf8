The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 							 																						AS IF WE NEEDED THE STAMP OF TIME GOURI CHATTERJEE																					So Time magazine has put the Ambani brothers on the cover. And, going by the way this has made Page 1 news, our colonial minds are thrilled. As if we needed the stamp of Time to tell us the Ambanis had arrived. 																					But catering to national sentiments is precisely what Time is up to. That is its business strategy for its editions outside America, its version of the raging business mantra: Think global, act local. So, at a time when America is the story that is engrossing the world, Time in Asia has its eyes trained on the families that own Asia.																					Time editors in Hong Kong, Time Asias headquarters, must be patting themselves on the back for coming up with a story that can, with quick changes of cover, pander to at least six countries.																					One six-page story on the generational change in Asias business families (the Ambanis bag only one sentence) that provides the excuse for the next ten pages on six richie rich families from six countries (one page for the Ambani brothers) and voil, you have six cover-stories for the price of one. In Japan, the cover will grace the Morita family, in Philippines Henry Sy and his offspring, in India the Ambanis, etc. etc. 																					The question is, does this make for good journalism too? There is absolutely nothing new in the flattering piece on the Ambanis. The only Time story in recent years that anyone remembers is the one on an ailing Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and even Congress supporters say that it was an exercise in poor journalism. Surely, that is not the image that is good for a news magazines business?																					Anything goes																					A presidential hopeful with an intern lurking in the background  the sheer possibility should have made it the biggest story in America. Not true. It didnt even get a mention in important papers like The New York Times and Washington Post, and was given the go-by by many television channels too. The reason: their reporters couldnt confirm the story posted on a website last Thursday. Theres nothing to report  except the existence of an Internet rumour, said one Washington-based reporter.																					It made it to every newspaper in India though. The reason: anything goes in foreign news in India, the more salacious the better. If a news agency has filed it, it is fair game to carry it, just as it is to carry something completely opposite the day after (as we saw in the Kerry affair). 																					If it leaves the reader confused, thats too bad. Its not that the newsroom bosses are wilfully callous. They genuinely believe, notwithstanding their constant bleating about globalization, that our readers have little interest in foreign news (except for Hollywood and war), it doesnt touch their lives and even the election of the US president is too remote to be taken seriously. So no one felt the need to find out, even through the net and if only to put things in perspective, anything about Matt Drudge and his recent campaign against John Kerry, including a charge that Kerry had Botoxed himself to improve his looks. 																					After all, there arent that many readers like Amartya Sen who once decried the sameness and lack of depth of foreign news in Indian papers.																					Starstruck																					Managing competition is never easy, not even when you have the stars on your side. Look at the trouble Zee is having organizing media coverage for its glitzy cinema awards slated to be held in Dubai on February 26. It should have been a breeze, with the media all too happy to give air-time/column-space to an event that entails a foreign junket. But Zees media team is in a tizzy because it cant invite representatives from some of the biggest media houses  either they have their own awards, or they have rival television companies. Times cannot be invited because of Filmfare awards, Indian Express because of Screen Awards, India Today because Aaj Tak is a rival and ABP-Telegraph because of Star News. Last heard, the Zee team is trying to convince itself that small is beautiful  small media houses that is.

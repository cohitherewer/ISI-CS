		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						UNLEARN THE TEXTS Jyoti Punwani																					Is J.S. Rajput going to continue as director of the National Council of Educational Research and Training? That decision will indicate whether the new governments commitment to secularism goes beyond election rhetoric.																					Unlike the Indian Institutes of Management and Indian Institutes of Technology, which have every reason to celebrate Murli Manohar Joshis defeat, students of Central Board of Secondary Education schools and their parents must wait till Rajput is replaced by an appointee as political as Rajput. The new director must be an educationist as committed as Rajput was to his ministers mission  that of wiping out a curriculum which had taken years to evolve. Rajputs replacement must be willing to move heaven and earth to fulfil what must be the new education ministers priority  to bring back the pre-Joshi NCERT texts in time for the new term starting mid-June.																					Its not simply a question of secularism. Those who had gone through the same system a generation ago, as well as those who had seen its products, would point out that the syllabus was reputed to be one of the best in the world. Results of all-India examinations showed that CBSE students outshone those who had studied under the state or other central board syllabi. Thats unlikely to happen if the CBSE continues with the Joshi-Rajput curriculum. Leave aside the rewritten history texts with their references to Mughals as foreign invaders, or the complete exclusion of the bhakti poet Rahim from the class VII Hindi text.																					Missing the point																					Take science and mathematics, the two so crucial in the development of the childs potential to think logically. The new curricula in the subjects is likely to have a dumbing effect on children. The atrocious use of English, unheard of in pre-Joshi texts, can put to shame any state-board text.																					For instance, the new textbook for the 2002-03 class VI, in its chapter on Matter, did not contain the word molecules, but referred to them as particles. Are 11-year-olds not capable of understanding the universally used scientific term? 																					In mathematics for the same year, the chapter on graphs was dropped from class VI textbooks. A page-for-page comparison between the pre- and post-Joshi maths textbooks revealed another queer feature. The authors of the next text had taken the trouble of dropping important sections from each topic, but hadnt bothered to replace the maths exercises at the end of each section. 																					The sums had been reproduced almost number for number with one recurring exception  the brain teaser at the end of each chapter, the one problem aimed at making even maths freaks sit up and think, had been dropped. No wonder that the page on Science- related values, which exhorted students to question and discover, had itself been dropped from the new maths textbook.																					Fractured view																					The content had not merely been reduced, but it was almost incoherent. While the old science textbook devoted entire chapters to Air, Water, Land, the new one combined all these into one chapter on the environment. Consequently, important facts were left out, and different sub-sections put together without any continuity, made comprehension difficult, thereby encouraging students to mug up.																					The same fragmented approach was evident in the new class VII history textbook for 2003-04. The contrast with Romila Thapars texts could not have been greater. Previously, every section had been complete in itself, enabling even the average student to answer questions on his own. Here, students need to have answers dictated to him by teachers, a little from here, a little from there, even after which, a clear picture of the society would still elude him.																					Fortunately, the new government has the time to undo the damage. If it gets cracking now, it can ensure that students going back to school next month have textbooks which respect their intelligence and enable them to understand their past without prejudice.

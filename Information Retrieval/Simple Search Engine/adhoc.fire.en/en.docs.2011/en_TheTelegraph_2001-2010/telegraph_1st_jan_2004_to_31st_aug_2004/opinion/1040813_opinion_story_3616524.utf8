		 Friday, August 13, 2004 							 																						IN CLOSE RANGE																														Anarchists of one country are a threat everywhere  especially to a neighbour. Nepals Maoists have long been a threat to Indias security in a strategically important region. Their politics of violence now threatens Indian business ventures as well in the Himalayan kingdom. There might be just one Indian company among the two dozen threatened with indefinite shutdown by the Maoists. But the disturbing thing is that all the 85 Indian joint ventures in Nepal must also be in the shadow of this threat. The Maoists can now extend to many other Indian firms their argument for making the Indian tobacco manufacturing company part of their hit list  that they exploit the workers and help the business interests of King Gyanendra and his family. It is difficult to see how closing down these units will help workers get their justice. The closure of Indian businesses can only be disastrous for Nepal, which is among the poorest countries in the world. This land-locked country is also largely dependent on Indian land and sea ports for its meagre commerce with the rest of the world. But despite their ideological pretentions, the Maoists have little concern either for the countrys economy or the well-being of the people. 																														It would be wrong, however, to underestimate the threat by arguing that Indian interests are only caught in the crossfire between the Maoists and the government in Kathmandu. The rebels had earlier struck at Indian targets in retaliation for the arrests of their comrades on Indian soil. There is thus a strong case for a greater Indian involvement in Nepals war against the Maoists, not only to secure Indian business interests in that country but also to protect the larger interest of regional security. Even if the Indian role does not mean an interference in Nepals domestic policy, it can serve the interests of both countries in several ways. Kathmandu, too, has to shed its prejudices and take New Delhi into greater confidence.

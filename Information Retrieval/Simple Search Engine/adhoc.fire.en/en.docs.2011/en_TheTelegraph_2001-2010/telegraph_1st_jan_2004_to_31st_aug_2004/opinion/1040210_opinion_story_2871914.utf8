The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Another tea party				 																																																				Sir  Very few people in Calcutta must be aware that a Labour Friends of India exists somewhere in the United Kingdom, let alone the fact that it is interested in looking at womens issues here. But they dont seem to be missing out on much if one considers the itinerary of the 10 Labour women members of parliament from the same body who will be in the city shortly (Blairs babes to hit town for wedding and women, Feb 8). Surely, the delegations fleeting two-day visit to Calcutta cannot possibly give them a serious scope to review the work of British-funded projects in Bengal, especially since the all-important agenda has turned out to be their attending an Indian wedding. Even if one were to ignore that matter, did it not occur to the delegation that field visits connected to the projects would serve their purpose better than a meeting with the chief minister, the governor and other officials? Such meaningless visits by foreign dignitaries do not merit the print space they are given and should be ignored.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Chaitali Chakraborty, Calcutta
				 																Damage undone				 																																																				Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee is right in saying that Rajiv Gandhi had his own vision of a new and emerging India which he could not turn into reality because of the hue and cry raised by the opposition on the Bofors issue during his time in office (The prophet delayed, Feb 8). The allegation has been proved wrong and the media castigated for its role in the controversy (Rap on media for jumping gun, Feb 5). But the past cannot be retrieved. The scandal had cost him dear in his lifetime. The progressive prime minister was hounded out of power. And ever since his death, his widow and family have lived with the blame. The nation should hang its head in shame and those who came to power using the Bofors card should apologize to Sonia Gandhi. 				 																																																				There is no doubt that Bharatiya Janata Party is living off borrowed ideas. Hopefully, the present Congress leadership will be able to hammer this message into the minds of the electorate so that it may refrain from voting for the communally disruptive combine. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is understandable that those who pointed fingers at Rajiv Gandhi over defence deals are not very pleased at his having been cleared of the blame. The Bofors case was among the first major scandals in Indias political history and it was blown out of proportion by Rajiv Gandhis opponents with help from the media. Slogans such as gali gali mein shor hai, Rajiv Gandhi chor hai had changed Indias politics like never before. 				 																																																				V.P. Singh became the prime minister riding on these slogans, and then went on to divide the country along caste lines. The Marxists may now be maintaining a studied silence, but they too had joined the blame game then. Although Rajiv Gandhi had been forced onto the throne by powerbrokers within the Congress, he was an excellent statesman. Too nave to understand the darker side of politics, he was waylaid by his own friends and partymen. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The former prime minister has been exonerated of the Bofors allegation. But why did it take nearly 16 years for the premier investigating agencies of the country, the Central Bureau of Investigation being one of them, to realize that there was not enough evidence to actually hang Rajiv Gandhi (Tried, hanged, found innocent, Feb 5)?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, Gokarna, Murshidabad

				 																																																				Sir  The Delhi high court judgment speaks badly of the credibility of the CBI. But 16 years is enough time to manipulate evidence, destroy documents and bribe witnesses. It will be little wonder if the same method is adopted to protect the politicians in the multi-crore stamp paper scam. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  It is now necessary to charge V.P. Singh  the worst prime minister India has ever had  for filing false charges against Rajiv Gandhi. He should be booked and held responsible for wasting precious resources and funds of the country in the Bofors investigations.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vamana Nair, via email

				 																																																				Sir  With Rajiv Gandhi proven innocent, it is time for Sonia Gandhi to ask her pound of flesh from the ruling party, which has been harassing her over the issue.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The nation deserves a public apology from V.P. Singh. This would do much good to his image and somehow make up for his injustice to Rajiv Gandhi. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul 

				 																																																				Sir  Justice delayed is justice denied. Time consuming and unending trials speak of a fractured judicial system. In India this is nourished by an equally bad investigating process. It is unfortunate that our investigating agencies are influenced by politicians. The CBI head should be chosen by the consensus of the prime minister and the opposition leader along the lines in which the the chief vigilance commissioner is appointed.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The Delhi high court judgment made the day not only for the Nehru-Gandhi family, but also the umpteen corrupt and criminal-minded in India who will now hold their heads high and expect to be set free from the shackles of legal proceedings. February 4, 2004, in fact, should be seen as the day on which the death knell for the judicial system of the country was sounded. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Chakraborty, Belonia, South Tripura

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  The routine honour killings that take place in north India are enough to make every Indian hang his head in shame (Whose honour is it anyway?, Jan 18). While rabid supporters of India Shining boast of Pokhran and the advances made in space and information technology, there exists another India in the villages that sanctifies the killing of the girl child and the murder of lovers who dare defy the societys caste injunctions. It is horrifying to know that 10 per cent of all murders in the so-called modern states of Punjab and Haryana are actually honour killings. Is India still entitled to call itself a civilized nation? Indias race for technological progress is blinding us to the need of extricating its masses from such medieval trappings. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

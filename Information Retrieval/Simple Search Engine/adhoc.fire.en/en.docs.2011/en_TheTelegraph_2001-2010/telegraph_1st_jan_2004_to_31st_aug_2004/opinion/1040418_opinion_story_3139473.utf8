The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 18, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Sonia Gandhi has the instincts of a pen pusher; faced with an emergency she doesnt go out there and mend matters  she writes a memo. She addressed one to party candidates after Ajit Jogis recent accident, asking them not to travel at night. This was very similar to the letter she had written to party leaders after Madhavrao Scindia died in a plane crash, warning them off small aircraft like the one Scindia had been flying in. The problem with most such memos is that they are high on noble intentions, but low on practicality. For example, with temperatures soaring above 40 degree Celsius in most parts of the country, campaigning in the evening makes so much more sense. Given that each constituency has about 2,000 villages that need to be covered in about a fortnight, even the most enterprising candidate cannot hope to cover more than a 100 villages, besides the mandatory urban centres. So what option does the poor, road-weary, aspiring peoples representative have but to travel at night so he can get back home, or at least some place where he can sleep in air-conditioned comfort? After all, he has to gather strength for the gruelling day ahead.				 																																																																														 In filmi parlance it would be called a guest appearance  Jaya Pradas flying visits to Rampur, Uttar Pradesh, where she is the Samajwadi Party candidate for the coming polls. They may vote her to power or they may not  but the actresss presence has caused much excitement. Every lane and bylane in the constituency has been resounding with hit songs featuring the actress  with Mujhe naulakha manga de saiyan deewane, from Sharaabi being the favourite. 				 																																													But Prada is more of the item girl in this contest. The real leading lady in Rampur is the Congress candidate and sitting MP, Begum Noorbano. It is to help Bano, whose son is a minister in Mulayams government, that Amar Singh went to the trouble of airlifting Jaya Prada all the way from Andhra Pradesh  or so it is speculated. And the villain of the story must surely be Salman Khurshid. Apparently, the UP Congress chief has got one of his loyalists, Afroz Ali Khan to contest against Noorbano on a BSP ticket. Unlike Jaya Prada, Afroz is no lightweight. So miffed is Noorbano that she has threatened to play a similar trick on Khurshids wife, who is the Congress candidate from Shahjahanpur. Who is the friend and who is the enemy here?				 																																																																														 The BJP gives the impression of being quite computer savvy. So why is it that when you type in the url, www.bjp.com, you get the Brighton Journal of Philosophy instead of Indias Bharatiya Janata Party?				 																																																																														 Atal Bihari Vajpayee is very touchy about speculations over his health. After all, he may well be on the threshold of yet another five years as PM and any suggestion that he retire is dismissed out of hand. Main abhi chhorne wala nahin hoon, he told a reporter recently. But will he be forced to? 				 																																													At a recent rally at the Gandhi Maidan in Patna, Sushil Modi announced to the audience that Vajpayeeji was at that moment climbing the stairs to address them. But where was he? Fifteen minutes went by, but the restive audience could not see the PM come onto the dais. Presumably, he was still climbing the stairs, or perhaps, his knee had given way on the bottom rung. Then again, at a recent press conference, M Venkaiah Naidu could be seen repeating questions in the PMs ears several times before he got them. Compounded with his other recent gaffes  he referred to his own niece, Karuna Shukla, as Karuna Vajpayee  is there something that his body is telling Vajpayee that he is not willing to listen to?				 																																																																														 In politics, blood is definitely thicker than water. Jyotiraditya Scindia has not liked at all the jibe his party spokesperson, Kapil Sibal, directed at his grandmother, Vijayaraje. The young maharaja has vehemently denied that amma sahib, as the Rajmata was popularly known, was born in Nepal. She was born in Madhya Pradeshs Sagar district, he says. It is good to see someone rising above the party line to defend what he thinks is the truth. But the scion of the Scindia royal family may have a vested interest  after all it is thanks to his familys, and grandmothers, legacy that he is comfortably placed in Guna.				 																																																																														 Yesteryears Dream Girl, and the BJPs Dream Campaigner, Hema Malini, has a simple campaign spiel  narrate the story of her recent hit, Baghban. She starts of by comparing the prime minister to a baghban (a gardener), who looks after every section of society  and then gets around to the real stuff. That takes care of one problem for Malini  what to say to those thousands who throng her meetings in the sweltering heat. 				 																																																																														 That the Congress is its own worst enemy is a theory that has been repeated ad nauseum. The party faces a make-or-break election and there is enough work to occupy the combined energies of all the partymen, but the members of the AICC media department  Jairam Ramesh, Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma, Abhishek Singhvi  have no time left over from fighting each other. At 2 pm, Sibal holds fort, at 4 pm it is either Sharma or Singhvi, and a little later it is Ramesh handing out briefs to the media. Rameshs men can be seen hanging outside the room at 24 Akbar Road to woo journalists to his economics lectures at 99 South Avenue. While Sibal is the most popular among mediapersons (and unpopular for the same reason with his own partymen), Ramesh must be the most unpopular. The media department had the idea of discouraging him by making no arrangements to serve tea at his briefings. But this didnt deter Ramesh who nowadays comes equipped with homemade tea and water and glasses for the reporters. It isnt so easy to keep down a Congressman, after all.

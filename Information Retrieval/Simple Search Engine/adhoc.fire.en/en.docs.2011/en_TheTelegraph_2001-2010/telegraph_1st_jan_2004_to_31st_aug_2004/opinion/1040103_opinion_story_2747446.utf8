 - The modern world is marked by the overlap of traditions  ANDR BTEILLE The author is chancellor, North- eastern  Hill University  Open-ended  Sociology, as the empirical and  systematic study of society and its institutions, is now  widely practised in our universities and independent centres  of research. It entered the university system in India in  the Twenties, barely two or three decades after its adoption  by universities in the West. Its spread in India was at  first slow. The real growth began after independence, and  India now has more sociologists than most countries. At  the same time, the growth has been uneven, partly because  of the pressures of ideology. As a result of the work of several  generations of sociologists, both Indian and foreign, we  now have a fairly detailed knowledge of the social organization  of village, caste and family, although our understanding  of modern institutions remains sketchy and superficial.  Most sociologists would agree in principle that theirs is  a comparative science devoted to the understanding of all  societies, but in practice Indian sociologists have concentrated  almost entirely on the study of their own society. There are both practical and ideological  reasons for the concentration of attention on Indian society  to the exclusion of other societies. As I said, sociology  began to expand in India around the time of independence,  and Indian sociologists felt a special responsibility to  contribute to the understanding of their society at a turning  point in its history. But the neglect of the study of other  societies is detrimental to the long-term growth of sociology  as an intellectual discipline. It tends to make its practitioners  short-sighted and narrow-minded. Our understanding of our  own society gains in richness and depth when we compare  and contrast it with other societies. It is a cause for  worry when virtually every Indian sociologist chooses to  be an Indianist rather than a sociologist. It is natural to expect that the  contributions made by sociology will serve a wider public  purpose. Some believe that a more informed understanding  of how a society works is itself of long-term benefit to  its members. Others would like to take the matter further  and argue for a more direct role for the sociologist in  social and political intervention. Sociologists in India  and other recently independent countries seek a more activist  and interventionist role for themselves than their counterparts  do in countries where the discipline has been established  longer. Sociology has to be distinguished  from ideology. Its main aim is the pursuit of systematic  knowledge whereas the main aim of ideology is the transformation  of society through the pursuit and exercise of power. Of  course, no ideologue would like to act blindly, in ignorance  of the operation of social and political processes. But  in the end, the pursuit of systematic knowledge becomes  subordinated to the pursuit of power. Ideologies make large  promises to their adherents, but they also demand great  sacrifices from them. The most important sacrifice from  the intellectual point of view is the sacrifice of individual  judgment for a larger political cause in the name of a class,  a nation or some other collective entity. Marxism was the pre-eminent ideology  of the 20th century. Its founder was a man of immense knowledge  and analytical skill who set out to discover the laws governing  the economic, political and spiritual processes of life.  If orthodoxy is a key element in any ideology, then Marxs  ideas began to crystallize into an ideology soon after his  death. The success of the Bolshevik Revolution turned the  ideology into an official doctrine with enormous authority  both within and outside the Soviet Union. Individual judgment  yielded to political conformity, and Marxist ideology acted  as a drug on some of the ablest and most acute minds even  when they were outside the reach of the Soviet state. Sociology has had an uneasy relationship  with Marxism since the end of the 19th century. This is  seen most clearly in Russia where Plekhanov, widely regarded  as the father of Russian Marxism, took a hostile attitude  to the work of Mikhailovsky with whom sociology made a beginning  in Russia; later, Lenin made short work of the young Sorokin  who migrated to the United States of America, where he acquired  renown as a sociologist at Harvard. After Marxism became  established as the official doctrine, little room was left  for sociology in the Soviet Union and in countries under  its hegemony. Many persons there felt, perhaps sincerely,  that there was no need for a separate science of society  since all useful knowledge about its nature and operation  had been incorporated in dialectical materialism known to  millions of schoolchildren as Diamat. Marxism is not the only ideology  with which sociology as an empirical and comparative science  has to contend. In many parts of the world, including India,  nationalism has emerged as a more powerful ideological force  than Marxism. In some places and times, Marxism has combined  very effectively with nationalism; in others, it has taken  over some of the ideological spaces vacated by Marxism.  As an ideology, nationalism seeks to develop and promote  a unified and idealized image of the nation, and to direct  inquiries into the past, present and future conditions of  its people in the light of that image. National tradition  assumes increasing importance as a standard of evaluation,  and any kind of social inquiry that questions or disregards  it becomes suspect. Directing sociological inquiry  by the light of national tradition is not a simple matter.  There are several national traditions, each casting its  light in a particular direction. Not only are different  societies heirs to different national traditions, but it  is a mistake to believe that each of them is heir to only  one single or unitary tradition. What is distinctive of  the modern world is not the insulation of different traditions  but their interpenetration. It is this that presents to  the comparative study of societies its most difficult challenge  as well as its most fruitful opportunity. The nationalist who is consistent  in his ideological commitment sets little store by a science  of society that seeks to treat all societies or all social  traditions alike without bias or prejudice. Treating all  societies alike is only an ideal of comparative sociology  which, to be sure, is nowhere fully realized in practice.  It is well known that the discipline has an Eurocentric  bias which goes back to its origins in the 19th century  when most, if not all, sociologists were Europeans. That  bias is less marked today if only because there are now  many non-Western sociologists who study societies throughout  the world in broadly the same sort of way. The Western bias  in contemporary sociology cannot be wished out of existence,  but it is bound to become diluted as more sociologists from  outside the West contribute to the general stock of sociological  concepts, methods and theories. There is by now a large accumulation  of work on Indian society by both Indian and foreign scholars.  It will be futile to turn ones back on this work in the  hope of creating a new and distinct sociology for India  out of ingredients embedded in Indian traditions of thought.  Many Indian sociologists have recommended such a venture  for several decades, but few have worked at it with much  purpose or determination. The nationalist alternative to  sociology has produced very little of substance in any country,  far less by any reasonable standard than the Marxist alternative  to it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 26, 2004 							 																						SECOND STEPToday is the second day of reckoning. The voters of 137 constituencies will decide their fate today. Some of these constituencies are in states that are very large and thus hold the key to the overall composition of the 14th Lok Sabha. Two more days of polling will complete the process of election. This only highlights the enormity of the entire exercise both in terms of geographical and demographical space. The first round of polling was not without bloodshed and death but the scale of the violence was in no way comparable to what used to happen on voting days in large parts of India, say, a decade ago. The cleaning up process begun by that redoubtable chief election commissioner, Mr T.N. Seshan, is not yet complete because violence has not been entirely eradicated, but the process has gathered speed and it is no longer utopian to hope that within the foreseeable future, elections in India will be carried out as they should be in a civilized and mature democracy. The second day of polling will demonstrate if such hopes are grounded in reality or not. It is thus the second day of reckoning in more ways than one.Voters may or may not have a field day during elections but pollsters certainly do. They are busy making surveys and conducting exit polls. Since the polls are extended over a fairly large period of time, they also have an opportunity to test their skills of statistical extrapolation. Psephology, a relatively new field in Indian social science, is thus developing side by side with the maturing of Indian democracy. If Indian democracy is still incomplete and inadequate, as many argue and with some justification, so is the science of psephology. The analysis of the pollsters based on the first round of polling is now available for the public. Their analysis at least explains one thing: why these elections appear to be so lacklustre. It appears that this time round no great issue or personality is moving the voters one way or the other. Arithmetic and chemistry, the two contending forces in previous Indian elections, have given way this time to arithmetic alone. Interest is ruling passions. This may not be an altogether bad tendency in a democracy. Each voter in a mature democratic polity is supposed to choose the candidate who he thinks best represents his interests. This entails calculation and thus ratiocination, the exact opposite happens when voters respond to charisma. An overwhelming verdict is often not the one most mediated by reason.

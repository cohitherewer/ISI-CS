The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 							 																						LETS MEET ON COMMON GROUND Shobita PunjaOur boys have returned from Pakistan, victorious and tired, and the people are gleeful but tired of politicians squeezing political significance out of test matches.																					Wouldnt it be wonderful if the exchanges between the two countries continued? We share so much history and have a common heritage. For the real dialogue between the two cultures began centuries ago. Taxila is in the northwestern part of Pakistan and it stood at the crossroads of three critical trade routes to India, central Asia and west Asia and on to Europe. Ideas, concepts, technologies and innumerable influences were traded here.																					So much to share																					To Taxila came some great historical personalities like Alexander the Great from Macedonia. He arrived in the spring of 326 BC and according to Greek accounts, he asked to meet local sages to understand their worldview. One sage ticked off the conqueror of the Persian Empire and asked him why he had come to a place where he had not been invited. Another complimented him for his vast empire and for his desire to listen to philosophers, and ended by remarking that Alexander was the only philosopher-in-arms he had ever seen.																					After Alexander came the famous Mauryan ruler, Asoka, from his capital of Pataliputra, which now lies in Bihar. He was first sent to Taxila as a prince to look after the north-western frontier of the Mauryan empire. He is remembered in history books for having built roads, like the one that linked his eastern capital to the north-west frontier, and along them, planting trees for shade, with lodges and wells for the comfort of travellers.																					Historians credit him with bringing Buddhism to this beautiful land. Taxila, or Takshashila, was a famous university-town like Nalanda, which attracted scholars from all parts of the Buddhist world, even from as far away as China.																					Long after these great personalities died, the routes of communication between these cultures and disparate communities remained alive and open. Here, in the 3rd century BC, the philosophy of the Buddha came into contact with the Greek and Parthian ideals. Amidst the stupendous stupas of Taxila lies a small museum unique in the world for its rare and priceless collection of Gandharan art, of which Taxila was a centre. Sir John Marshall, the chief archaeologist of Taxila, made the collection in the museum. He wrote, I still remember the thrill I got from these buried citesto find in that far corner of Panjaba bit of Greece itself.																					The museum at Taxila has an extraordinary collection of coins and superb examples of Gandharan art  finely carved images of the Buddha and the Bodhisatvas. The museum at Lahore also has a priceless collection of Gandharan art. One needs to go to Lahore for the cricket, the good food and to see the stone image of the Buddha in which the artist has depicted him in deep meditation, undergoing a rigorous fast that has rendered his bones, muscles and blood vessels visible through his fragile and transparent skin.																					We could have a Gandharan exhibition with the best of our Gandharan collection from the Indian Museum, Calcutta, the National Museum, Delhi, and others. Match for match, both countries could see the best of the common heritage of India and Pakistan.																					Perhaps it is time to show the world that we are conquerors and, like Alexander, we too can listen to philosophers and share our Gandharan art exhibition with the world  in a place where no one would ask, Why have you come when you were not invited?

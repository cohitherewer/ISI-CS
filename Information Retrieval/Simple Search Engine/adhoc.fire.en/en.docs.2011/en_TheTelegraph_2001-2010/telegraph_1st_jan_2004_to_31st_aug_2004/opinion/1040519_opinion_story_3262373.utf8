		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 							 																						LESSONS FROM THE PAST Shobita Punja																					There are many reasons to conserve our built heritage and museums that contain priceless art objects. One of the reasons discussed so far is the need to conserve things with a political significance or an educational relevance in places like St Marys Church in St Georges Fort, Chennai, or the farman in the Bharat Kala Bhavan in Varanasi. Another excellent reason to save our heritage is for its technological significance, because it informs us how problems were dealt with centuries ago, these solutions having some relevance even today.																					One such example comes from Nagaur at the edge of the great Indian Thar desert in Rajasthan. Around the 13th century, Nagaur Fort come into being, replacing an older fourth-century mud fort. The fort became an object of desire for the sultans of Delhi, as it was a gateway to the desert, the spice and pilgrimage route. The Mughal emperor, Akbar, spent a night here and even married two local princesses to further his policy of marriage alliances with Hindu royalty and maintain good relations with the Rathore Rajputs. But in the last two hundred years, as with much of our heritage, the Fort fell to ruin and was filled with debris and, literally, the sands of time.																					But in its heyday, as the fort and the palaces within it grew, the builders attempted some incredible feats. Here on the edge of the Thar desert, where water was scarce, they created a virtual water garden. Historians and archaeologists unearthed several wonders, and Naval Krishna referred to it as the Water Wonderland in the desert.																					What you see today is a different story. Nagaur is a two-hour drive from Jodhpur going in a northeasterly direction, across scrub dry land. The fort protects many palaces and open-arched courtyards. In a few rooms of the palaces, there are painted murals of women frolicking in huge water-ponds amidst lotuses, streams of water flowing through green orchards and flowery gardens, women swimming in pools or sitting in the gardens, swinging on flower-decked swings and enjoying the evening cool. These mural paintings on the palace walls are only a hint of what these masters created. When conservation began under the patronage of the Mehrangarh Museum Trust with a grant from the American Getty Foundation, the excavations revealed astonishing technological innovations.																					Desert bloom																					The fort has a well and a step-well within it. Water from these watersources was channelled through earthen pipes to an underground area where it was purified for drinking. Through the entire fort area, the water was used and reused in a number of ways; for drinking, then for pools, ponds and fountains, and to cool the interiors of palaces on desert-hot days. To ensure that the water remained fresh and well-oxygenated it was filtered through sand, or made to flow over layers of charcoal or lime under the palace floors and courtyards.																					When the water reappeared in a fountain, it was fresh and clear. In some places, neem leaves were added to act as a natural insecticide and in other places, rose petals and even colours gave the spraying fountain a different hue or fragrance.																					Water, as it evaporates, cools the air, and this was used to its maximum benefit in Nagaur. There are palace halls with rippling streams, a water channel and cascading fountains. The water was brought into the palaces through an aqueduct that ran along the top of the walls of the palace complex. It was driven from one place to another by the law of gravity. However, the whole scheme of this water-land in the desert demanded strict supervision of the water levels, the regular maintenance of all the water features, regular cleaning of the ponds and pools to keep the whole system in tip-top shape.																					Today when it appears that whole state governments may be toppled for the lack of proper water-management, Nagaur is still a technological wonder in the desert. Doesnt a place like this need to be conserved and the water-works restored to some sort of working condition, so that all can learn a lesson from this water paradise in the desert?

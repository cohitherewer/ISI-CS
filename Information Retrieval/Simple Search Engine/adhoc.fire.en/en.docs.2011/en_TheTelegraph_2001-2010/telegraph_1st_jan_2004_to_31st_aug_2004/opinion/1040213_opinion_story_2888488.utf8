		 Friday, February 13, 2004 							 																						OF LIVES AND ARCHIVES				 	 A small link AMITAV GHOSH: A CRITICAL COMPANION  Edited by Tabish Khair, Permanent Black, Rs 495 The most valuable piece in this  collection of criticism on Amitav Ghosh is a new essay by  the writer himself. This is on Satyajit Ray, and bears the  hallmarks of Ghoshs best writing. Like Shadow Lines,  it begins with a time, a place and a quiet use of the first  person: In 1989, during my first extended stay in New York,  I was suddenly hit by a wave of Ray nostalgia. It then  grows, naturally and elegantly, into an elaborate web of  memory and desire. There are voices within voices, stories  within stories, cities opening out to other cities, memory  becoming imagination, fuelling, in turn, a desire to know,  to be led, through research and conversation, to the network  of lives and archives that holds the traces of Rays own  time in Manhattan, during the American release of Pather  Panchali in 1958. This is an elegiac tribute to Ray.  But it is also a subtle inscription of the writers own  self within the larger histories and traditions embodied  by Ray: He was a rivet in an unbroken chain of aesthetic  and intellectual effort that stretches back to the mid-nineteenth  century  a chain in which I too am, I hope, a small link.																					But it is unfortunate that a crucial sentence at the end of this essay remains poised between wrong grammar and tautology: This is what the narrative arts do, at their very best: they shape the world as they relate them. What does them refer to here? When the editor quotes this sentence in his preface, them becomes it, which makes more sense. Writer, editor or publisher  who is to blame here?																					The fact that Ghosh straddles anthropology, fiction and travel-writing  his generic and existential elusiveness  is both opportune and problematic for his critics. From Hegel to Dipesh Chakrabarty, from travelling theorists to speechless subalterns, Ghosh may be trusted to have assimilated everybody. So the entire post-colonial, post-structuralist tool-kit of the three worlds  with its hyphens, slashes, round brackets, italics and neologisms  can be applied to his work with impunity. The problem arises when this otherwise impeccably postmodern anthropologists richest novel invokes something as liberal humanist as a final redemptive mystery. How then does one rescue him from the pitfalls of the universal, the essentialist and the transcendent, while remaining true to what he has put on the page, what one cant help responding to with ones human, if not critical, sensibilities? What if the novelist takes the critic to places where the latter fears, or is unable, to tread? (Isnt this what Coetzees eponymous heroine attempts to do, sublimely, in Elizabeth Costello?) Not everybody is able to ponder such academic unease as sensitively and self-reflexively as Jon Mee does in his fine reading of Shadow Lines, perhaps the best essay in this book. Most of the others leave one with a feeling that Ghosh is worth studying only when he is subverting hegemonic discourses, or being absent, silent or different in global theorys transit lounge. The rest is slippage.																					It is interesting to note how a reticent writer like Ghosh can bring out an out-of-control quality in many of his critics, inspiring orgies of display and co-option. Tabish Khair founds his analysis of subaltern agency in The Calcutta Chromosome on a grotesque reduction of Indian society into Babus and Coolies. Leela Gandhi mars her wise account of Ghoshs historiography by a desire to entertain. Rukmini Bhaya Nair glides from millennial doom to elephants, teak, pagodas and all in her breathtakingly superficial piece on The Glass Palace. She writes how Ghosh had disarmingly confessed to her that all he had ever wanted to do was to write and everything else arranged itself around this central and singular focus  language, place, profession, family, travel. But very few critics seem to be, or can afford to be, interested in what this implies.						AVEEK SEN

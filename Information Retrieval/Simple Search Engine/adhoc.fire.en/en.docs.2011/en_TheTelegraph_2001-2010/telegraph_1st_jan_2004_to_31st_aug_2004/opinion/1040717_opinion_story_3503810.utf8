The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 17, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																All dressed up				 																																																				Sir  First it was Mandira Bedi and now it is Shekhar Suman (Shekhar on ESPN to sex up cricket, July 12). Where is cricket commentary heading? If Bedi, in her Extraa Innings, used fashion (remember the noodle straps?) to cover up her poor knowledge of the game, Suman has been roped in to give a touch of desi humour to the game. When we have star commentators and former cricketers like Ian Chappell, Ravi Shastri, Arun Lal and Waqar Younis, do we really need Bedi and Suman to add shimmer to an already glamorous game? What next? Sonali Bendre covering the ICC Super Cup?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Priya Sen, Calcutta
				 																Growing up				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Carparks and leopards (July 3), talks about the flipside of modernity, but doesnt confront the underlying problem. Social scientists, environmentalists and politicians will agree that be it on the Juhu beach or at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park where leopards run amok, the reason behind the dismal condition is uncontrolled population growth. What is being done is too little compared to the magnitude of the problem. If no immediate steps are taken to control the population explosion, the consequences will manifest themselves on a larger scale. Politicians and successive governments have not seriously addressed this problem. And the judiciary, which has issued ultimatums on other issues in the past, has chosen to remain silent on the problem of population growth.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raja Sen, Dhanbad

				 																																																				Sir  The concern shown by members of parliament like Hema Malini and Shabana Azmi over the Juhu beach is laudable (No bhaji on swept-clean Juhu beach, June 30). Having together contributed Rs 3 crore, there is no doubt that their efforts at the clean-up are serious.The beach now looks unkempt and unclean with its numerous bhaji shops, giant-wheels, tents and shanties. Hopefully, the MPs fund will be put to good use and the Mumbai municipal authorities will see to it that the beach looks better. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  A clean Juhu is most welcome, provided it does not cater exclusively to the moneyed. At present, the beach might not look pretty, but at least it provides some entertainment to those who cannot afford to go to parks and food centres that now cost the earth. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.K. Sarkar, Mumbai

				 																Beauty tips				 																																																				Sir  Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahi has had low TRP ratings since its inception, but not many are aware of this, possibly because Sunil Lullas media blitz has managed to make a mockery of the truth. But mediapersons who can be won over with a samosa and a drink do not worry so much as the Jassi concept itself. Jassi has braces and antiquated spectacles (how many grown-up women wear braces anyway?). The actor who plays the part is extraordinarily plain and could have done without these adjuncts. But Lulla has to convince his audience that being ugly also means lack of grooming. But even the ugliest and the poorest have their sense of vanity. Jassi is a monstrosity that is being imposed on us. The character stifles the right of Indian women to become modern independent beings. No wonder the modern Jassi is a caricature, a ridiculous generalization of the vamp played by Rakshanda Khan. Jassi is without doubt a symbol of India wherein criminals are legitimized by having ministerial responsibilities bestowed on them, female infanticide is allowed to be practised freely, and all wrongs rewarded. 				 																																																				As for Yeh! Meri Life Hai, the serial portrays a lady who wants to become a director but cannot pronounce Acting. She calls it Ekting. Regarding the looks of the actor, the less said the better. Why is Lulla fascinated with ugliness? Is it because it comes cheap?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sheuli Bose, Noida

				 																																																				Sir  Why is it necessary for Jassi to become a beautiful woman caked with make-up? Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, and those who love the ugly Jassi have already seen it in her. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Srivastava, Calcutta

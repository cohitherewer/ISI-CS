		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 							 																						OIL SLICK																														Oil is slippery. High oil prices only increase the slipperiness. In India, the problem of high oil prices was escalated by the prevailing high rate of import and excise duties. The government has now taken the decision  long overdue  to slash these duties. Oil refineries will lose around Rs 3,500 crore because of the slash, and the government something to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore in duty collections. But these losses will be offset by the positive impact of the decision on checking inflation. The protectionist duty structure benefits the government at the cost of the consumer. One calculation shows that for $1 rise in global oil price, the government earns Rs 1,500 crore extra. There is reason to believe that even after the duty cuts the government will remain a net gainer. The budget was formulated on the basis of lower oil prices. So the fall in duties should not affect the budget calculations under the head of excise and import duties.																														Even oil refineries should not have reasons to be too unhappy. The chairman of the ONGC maintains that refining margins of Indian oil companies are around $3 per barrel higher than international prices. This would suggest that after a loss of Rs 3,500 crore on account of the duty cuts, there would still be a respectable amount with the oil refineries. Further duty cuts cannot be ruled out if global prices breach the $50 barrier, and there is every possibility of that mark being crossed before the onset of the winter. Thus both in terms of economic logic and of political expediency, a high duty regime on oil does not quite make sense. Mr Manmohan Singhs government has been forced into battle on many fronts. Bringing down inflation is one of the reasons for cutting duties on oil. Climbing oil prices have a cost-push effect on many aspects of the economy. High prices have the inevitable effect of pushing down the governments popularity. Mr Manmohan Singh has not slipped on oil.

		 Friday, August 06, 2004 							 																						POWER PLAY 							 - Master politician with a lust for life				 	 To tell a good storyMY LIFE By Bill Clinton, Rupa, Rs 895The prologue sets the tone when Clinton reminisces, Just out of law school... on a whim I...bought one of those how-to books. It encouraged him to list his chief life- goals. I wanted to be a good man, have a good marriage and children, have good friends, make a successful political life and write a great book. He then ticks off and shows how he kept score. Finally he writes, As for the great book, who knows ? It sure is a good story. My Life is indeed a great story, a pelting, bellicose, evocative tale, a sort of Arkansas log cabin to the White House, lower case. No other book tells us as vividly or fully what it is like to be president of the United States of America for eight years. The last presidential memoirs were by Ulysses S. Grant more than a hundred years back. As for his immediate predecessors, George H. Bush, Reagan, Ford, Carter, Nixon and Lyndon Johnson, none was particularly adept at putting his thoughts on paper. Rhodes scholar and Yale Law school graduate, Bill Clinton certainly is.																														A quintessential political buff, Clinton would be endeared to many readers through the gentle sympathetic treatment of his alcoholic, sometimes abusive stepfather, Roger Clinton, whose name he took and whom he calls Daddy. He fondly recalls the only time Daddy took him to St Louis to see the Cardinals, the only time both of them went into the woods to cut our own Christmas tree and the only time our whole family took an out-of-state vacation together. There were so many things that meant a lot to me but were never to occur again, he laments. There was, however, another person at home he never fails to laud at every opportunity  his angel mother, Virginia Kelley. Childhood was a trauma  but, in a surrealistic way, it was the time he found his calling. As a 10-year-old, I sat on the floor right in front of the TV and watched them [Democratic and Republications conventions] transfixed. It sounds crazy, but I felt right at home in the world of politics and politicians. Perhaps the most significant decision he made early in life was to attend, not the University of Arkansas in his hometown, but Georgetown University in Washington DC. At the former, where he would have surely merited a scholarship, his world would have revolved around football and girls, with booze as a necessary accompaniment. At Georgetown, he soon found his way to Senator J.W. Fulbrights office to be the odd-job man when not attending classes, where he was reading Kant, Hegel, Marx, Joseph Schumpeter and others of that ilk.																														His stint at Oxford, as a Rhodes scholar, was interrupted by the draft, but fortuitously, he did not have to serve in Vietnam. Yale law school, which came thereafter, provided an active political platform and for his meeting with Hillary: One day, when I was sitting at the back of Professor Emersons class I spotted a woman I hadnt seen before. Then one night I was standing at one end of the long narrow Yale Law Library [when] I saw the girl again standing at the other end of the room. For once, she was staring back at me. After a while she closed her book, walked the length of the library, looked me in the eye and said, If you are going to keep staring at me and I am going to keep staring back, we ought at least to know each others names. Mines Hillary Rodham. Whats yours ?																														Clintons baptism in electoral politics was uneventful. He failed in his bid to be a Congressman, but at 32 became the Governor of Arkansas. In all, he was elected to this office five times before successfully running for the presidency twice. The narrative from here onwards has unmistakable flashes of brilliance, as engaging as the roller-coaster ride of eight Clinton years were compelling: from the handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn, high-wire diplomacy in Northern Ireland to the beating back and outsmarting of Newt Gingrichs Republican revolution of 1994. Clinton the author is at his very best when he summarizes the political dilemmas of rivals, foreign leaders or himself with concise acuity. Totally immersed in politics, it is surprising he had time for bedroom sports, extra-marital that is. Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky may have made their conquest, but this does not elevate Clinton to the same league as that of those serious adulterers like JFK and LBJ back in the gleeful days when journalists eyes and lips were sewn shut. He confesses, What I had done with Monica was immoral and foolish. 																														On India, it is obvious that Clinton knew beforehand that Vajpayees government would not sign the test-ban treaty as it stood, but was receptive to the idea of not conducting any further nuclear tests. He was probably at his diplomatic best when he addressed the parliament. I spoke of my respect for Indias democracy, diversity and impressive strides in building a modern economy, frankly discussed our differences over nuclear issues and urged them to reach a peaceful solution to the Kashmir problem. Somewhat to my surprise I got a grand reception. They applauded by slapping the table, demonstrating that the Indians were as eager as I was for our long estrangement to end. 																														Now that the 957th page has been read, what does one think of this man ? Granted, he did not turn out to be a great president, but was a master politician and by a long shot the most intellectually well-equipped occupant of the White House since Thomas Jefferson. And he had an intense lust for life too. It was without question one heck of a ride.						SATRUJIT BANERJEE

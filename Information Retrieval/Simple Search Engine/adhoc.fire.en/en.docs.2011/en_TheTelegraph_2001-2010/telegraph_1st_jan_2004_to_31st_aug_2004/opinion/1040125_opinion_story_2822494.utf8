				 																																																																														 The BJP and NDA are riding high on the feel good factor. But the English term, feel good, means nothing to general voters, especially those in the Hindi belt states who are most likely to get taken in by the hype. If the slogan is to carry any weight with the electorate, then it must be in Hindi,  la garibi hatao. But how do you translate feel good into Hindi, while retaining the felicitous brevity which gives the phrase its punch? The BJPs spin doctors, who quite pride themselves on their proficiency in the rashtra bhasha, went into a huddle. One suggestion by one of them was particularly liked  Jeevan ka sukhad ehsas. Until it was pointed out that the line was inspired by the advertising copy of a brand of condom. You can imagine the red faces of the saffron puritans at the discovery. And so the search continues... 				 																																																																														 ND Tiwari is the rare politician who has no enemies. No, thats no testimony to his ability to win friends and placate enemies. The canny CM of Uttaranchal  a past master in the intricacies of realpolitik  has found a unique way to silence his critics. The moment they open their mouths to criticize, he shuts it by giving them a share in the states bounty. No wonder, Tiwari has an unprecedented nine OSDs attached to his office. Recently a journalist, looking for dirt on the CM, called up Madan Singh Bisht, who had led a revolt against Tiwari. But he found the man was singing a different tune. Tiwari was really the best chief minister there could be, who had recently promised to make him the chairman of a state corporation. But what corporation was this? Bisht wasnt too sure, and didnt really care. Arre koi bhi corporation ho bhai, lalbatti ki gari to milega. Politicians sure have their priorities right.				 																																																																														 Jaswant Singh is generally a fair man, but when he hand-picked Vineeta Rai as revenue secretary in his finance ministry, even his admirers were puzzled. Rai was an IAS officer who had no experience in economics. Singh however was unruffled by all the gossiping about her Rajput connections and stuck to Rai. He was soon disappointed with her poor performance though. But with our bureaucratic structures being the way they are, shunting her out of the his ministry was not as easy as bringing her in. There was even a move to induct her as the new election commissioner now that JM Lyngdoh is retiring. The fact that she would be the first woman EC was supposed to help her candidature. But even that move was put paid to when N Gopalaswamy was drafted in at the last moment. And so the lady remains, much to Singhs discomfiture.				 																																																																														 While on babus, everyone is happy at TS Krishnamurthys becoming CEC, since things had just started to get messy. But what is less known is how JM Lyngdoh forced the governments hands. Last week Lyngdoh began exploring the chances of holding assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh sometime around mid-March. When the BJP got wind of this, it went into a tizzy since this would have pushed back the general elections to after April. An emergency meeting was convened at which it was decided to install Krishnamurthy as heir-apparent, and more important, reduce Lyngdoh to lame-duck status. And alls well that ended well.				 																																																																														 If success be measured by how much your rivals fear you, Arun Jaitleys political stock is soaring. For, the Congress has deputed three of its best in-house legal brains  Kapil Sibal, Salman Khurshid and AM Singhvi  to keep track of the suave and articulate Jaitley, who will be the BJPs spokesperson in this crucial run-up to the elections. The arrangement is that at least one of them will strike back within an hour of Jaitleys opening his mouth. Three against one  the Congress is already on the defensive. 				 																																																																														 Now that they know Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi are primary members of the party, desperate Congressmen are sure they will contest the elections. In fact, in their dreams, they have already assigned them constituencies. For Rahul, they have set aside Phulpur, Jawaharlal Nehrus parliamentary constituency that no Nehru-Gandhi has since contested, except for Vijayalaxmi Pandit. Priyanka gets Rae Bareilly  but naturally  since it was once the turf of her grandmother, Indira. 				 																																													Sonia, of course, may contest from Amethi. Or should she? One section in the Congress wants her to contest some seat down south. Their logic  it doesnt do to pack all the Nehru-Gandhi punch into one state. And two, Amethi is too close to Vajpayees sphere of influence in Lucknow for comfort. It might make the contest into an Atal versus Sonia affair  and no prizes for guessing wholl get the better of that one. Now if only Congressmen stopped dreaming and got on with fighting elections, they might get somewhere.				 																																																																														 There are gracious losers and there are some who just cant seem to get over failure. Digvijay Singh would definitely fall in the first category. Of course, in his case, defeat has been sweetened with the special invitation to join the AICC and the charge of two states. Thus Singh can vent his spleen by merely passing snide remarks about how Uma Bharti is beset with two RSS  one, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the other her two nephews, Rahul and Siddhartha, and her brother, Swamy Prasad Lodhy. But ordinary Congressmen, left high and dry after being in power for a decade, are a frustrated lot. One MP, Babulal Solanki, could recently be heard blaming BR Ambedkar for everything, since it was because of him that the weaker sections had become parasites and so ungrateful. The mahatma too has not come off any better. So far away have present day Congressmen moved from his belief in nonviolence that the police had to be called in to keep peace at recent meetings of the state party unit, which were reduced to a free-for-all with party leaders coming to blows, and hurling shoes and the choicest expletives at each other.

		 Friday, July 23, 2004 							 																						OFF WITH THE RED TAPETwo Score and Ten: My Experiences in Government 
By G.V. Ramakrishna, Academic Foundation, Rs 900In a long and distinguished career as a bureaucrat, G.V. Ramakrishna held many important posts in the ministries of finance, steel, coal and petroleum. He was a member of the Planning Commission, and the first chairman of Sebi and the Disinvestment Commission. Besides, Ramakrishna also held many important diplomatic posts  he was the minister of economic affairs at the Indian embassy in Washington and later was Indias ambassador to the EEC. His experiences in these posts are presented in great detail, interspersed with anecdotes, in this book.																														Ramakrishnas knowledge of the workings of the government, the shenanigans in the capital markets and demands of diplomacy is impressive. But the veteran bureaucrat is saddened at the malaise in public life today. Needless to say, Ramakrishna was known for his integrity, efficiency and independence  a sharp contrast to the modern bureaucrats who utilize government institutions for their personal ends. 																														The author says that it is time to give the highest priority to the basic needs of the people. Like, the worsening water situation, which can be contained by storing rainwater for future use. In this regard, he feels that the Farm Pond scheme, which was implemented in Tamil Nadu in 1988 and led to a 60 per cent increase in farmers income, needs reviving.																														The problems of sanitation, waste disposal and roads in our cities also need to be looked at. Paucity of funds is often cited as an excuse for inaction but an efficient use of resources along with a reduction of corruption can greatly improve the situation, says Ramakrishna. This is not just a matter of morals but one which involves the waste of precious resources which can improve the lot of the poor in India. 																														Corruption is an issue that Ramakrishna deals with extensively. Activism by citizens and transparency in governance may be two antidotes to this problem, according to him. He also talks about the corruption among the senior officials in the government and public sector, among the politicians and ministers who have the fiduciary duty to protect the states resources. The Central Vigilance Commission, writes Ramakrishna sadly, has failed to get rid of this problem. 																														The book also deals with the 1992 security scam, the controversy over the HBJ and Onam pipelines, disinvestment of PSUs, coalition governments, schemes for womens welfare, and so on. 																														In sum, Ramakrishnas message in this book seems to be that the bureaucracy must evolve to meet the changing needs of the government keeping in mind its changing role in the new global order.

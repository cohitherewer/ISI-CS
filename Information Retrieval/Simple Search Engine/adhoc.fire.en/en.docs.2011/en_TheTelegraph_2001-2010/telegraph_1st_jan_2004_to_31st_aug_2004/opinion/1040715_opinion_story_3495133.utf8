The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 							 																						TOO LAID BACK FOR A QUICK DETOXGouri Chatterjee																					There is a lot to be said for inaction (if George Bush had been lazier, the Iraq war may never have happened), but information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddys inaction in detoxifying his ministry is particularly commendable. It marks a stand which is exceedingly rare for a politician of any ilk.																					Reddy has been impressively laid back in the face of stiff assaults from his fellow partymen, left allies and like-minded friends in the media. Even after two months, Deepak Chaurasia, known to be close to the opposition leader, L.K. Advani, is still very much present on DD News, running the show with the team he brought with him from Aaj Tak last November. M.V. Kamath, who used to be a regular contributor to the RSS mouthpiece, Organiser, is still the chairman of Prasar Bharati. The kindest an admirer (from the media) had to say about Reddy, Hes not the man he was eight years ago [when he was I amp;B minister for the first time in the United Front government].																					In his first stint as I amp;B minister, Reddy had tried to do a BBC and free Doordarshan and All India Radio of direct government control by mooting the autonomous Prasar Bharati. Now, he is trying to respect the autonomy that he had so proudly unfurled  much to the chagrin of the same people who had praised him then.																					But then, whoever thought politicians really want an independent DD News that may not rush to record and broadcast their every ribbon-cutting function? And why politicians alone. We all want a media that will echo our likes and dislikes. So soon Chaurasia and his boys will go, a new team will take position, only to be shunted out when the government changes again.																					All that is according to script. What is not is Reddys tardiness in sweeping the stable clean. May be the 62-year-old hasnt quite forgotten the ideals that had once made him want to become a journalist. But by the time he had completed a bachelors degree in journalism from Osmania University in Hyderabad, he was deep into politics.																					Learn to live with it																					Given all this, Ms Singh must be cringing with embarrassment at the sudden attention her latest book, The Discovery of Ancient India, has begun receiving from the mass media. A full-page review in this weeks India Today, the top half of a broadsheet page in Sundays Indian Express, this is not the sort of splash her earlier books had made, and she has authored several including a recent one on ancient Delhi. But then, she has only just become the prime ministers daughter. 																					This is only the beginning. Like it or not, Manmohan Singhs family will have to get used to a lot more than the heightened security measures that have even spread to the unpretentious St Stephens college accommodation of Upinder Singh. The prime ministers family will have to get used to heightened media attention that may be a lot more difficult to live with. The PMs grandson knew what he was talking about when he regretted his grandfathers sudden elevation in life.																					Most powerful																					The last seven days saw Rupert Murdoch emerging at the top of The Guardians annual list of 100 most powerful media personalities of Britain, being ridiculed as the alleged source of his paper New York Posts scoop on Dick Gephardt becoming John Kerrys vice-presidential candidate, and receiving a Michael Moore-like slap-in-the-face in a documentary film entitled Outfoxed: Rupert Murdochs War on Journalism that was shown in New York on Tuesday. Just a routine week for Murdoch, making as much news as he purveys.

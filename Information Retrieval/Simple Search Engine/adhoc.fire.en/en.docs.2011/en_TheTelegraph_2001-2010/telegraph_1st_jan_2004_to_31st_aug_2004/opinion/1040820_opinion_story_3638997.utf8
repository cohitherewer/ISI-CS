		 Friday, August 20, 2004 							 																						A FORGOTTEN HERO				 	 Beacon of light GHAFFAR KHAN NON-VIOLENT BADSHAH  OF THE PAKHTOONS By Rajmohan Gandhi, Penguin, Rs 325 Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also  known as Badshah Khan or Frontier Gandhi, has been largely  forgotten in the annals of Indias freedom movement. Like  the Mahatma, Khan espoused the doctrines of non-violence  and secularism, repudiated the idea of partition and ardently  pleaded for Hindu-Muslim unity. His steadfast devotion to  these principles, led to his incarceration  first at the  hands of the British for 27 years  and then by the Pakistan  government for 15 years. Indias first prime minister, Jawaharlal  Nehru, lauded him highly for so effectively and gallantly  leading the people of the Frontier province in Indias struggle  for freedom.																														Khan shared an affectionate allegiance with the people of this province. They in turn idolized him as their general. Khan believed that the Pathans were a people with their own distinctive culture, civilization, language, literature, art and architecture and should be left to frame their own destiny. The protection of the Pathan identity was the primary reason behind Khan objecting to any compulsory groupingof the North Western Frontier Provinces with Punjab.																														But Khans hopes were dealt a cruel blow by the Congresss eventual capitulation to the Muslim Leagues demand for the creation of Pakistan. He told the Congress working committee: We Pakhtoons stood by you and had undergone great sacrifices for attaining freedom, but you have now deserted us and thrown us to the wolves. However he remained loyal to the party, and was indifferent to the overtures of Jinnah. He also blamed Nehrus acceptance of the Partition plan, on the influence of the Mountbattens had on him, and Nehrus own lust for power. 																														The humanitarian role played by Khans political followers, during the Punjab riots was significant. But for their contribution, more Muslims would have lost their lives and property during those troubled times.																														Khan remained aloof from the Muslim League even after Partition. When Jinnah asked him to join the League, Khan replied that he found it difficult to join an organization whose members had only recently looted the properties of Hindus and Sikhs.																														Addressing the Pakistan constituent assembly, Khan once said, The riots in East Pakistan are the direct outcome of the policy you have been following for the last seven years. You gagged public opinion and imprisoned people...suppressed the legitimate aspirations of the people... and play off one against the other.																														Khans forthrightness, rejection of violence and cooperation with non-muslims made him a shining figure during a dark phase in the nations history.						PIYUS GANGULY

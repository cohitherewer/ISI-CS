The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 							 																						WITH MORE CONCERTED EFFORT 															- Document Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Challenge at hand																														Accord priority to policies and programmes for sex education for young people and adolescent reproductive health services...Implement policies and statements on multi-sectoral responses to HIV/AIDS to complement and strengthen inter-ministerial working groups... 																														Continue to advocate innovative policies and the implementation of existing policies promoting greater gender equality...Draw up policies and potential laws for the protection of people living with HIV/AIDS from discrimination. Other policies and laws are likely to be needed to support people affected by HIV/AIDS, for example, widows, orphaned children, trafficked women, who may lose property, be unable to attend school, or be excluded from certain jobs because of their association with a person or group who is infected.																														Greatly expand business involvement in the arena of HIV/AIDS responses as part of corporate social responsibility, including formulation of business and union policies...Develop comprehensive responses to reduce mobility-related vulnerabilities...Involvement of government sectors dealing with armed personnel, para-military forces, railways, mining, labourer etc. which generate large-scale movement is crucial to sustainable HIV/AIDS prevention and care among mobile populations...																														Regional Agenda: In south Asia, as in many other parts of the world, the underlying factors that make people vulnerable to HIV/AIDS transcend borders. Hence, containing the epidemic within national borders alone is not enough to make the response to the epidemic meaningful. There are also daunting challenges, ranging from acute gender inequality to severe stigma and discrimination of PLWHA, within the region. This collective vulnerability of the region ...calls for integrated, inter-country responses...																														To gainfully use the window of opportunity provided by the seemingly low prevalence rates in the region, the following regional level actions are required: enhance regional cooperation and shared political commitment on HIV/AIDS issues among nations and governments; promote regional networks between civil society partners across south Asia for shared learning, capacity enhancement and the development of a strong, regional, civil society voice; foster sustained, committed leadership in the region to raise concerns regarding HIV in south Asia at regional and global fora; ...develop inter-country dialogue and collaboration between governments to address issues of trans-border concern, such as migration, trafficking and conflict; undertake advocacy to ensure the ratification and implementation of relevant conventions and commitments, as well as develop new commitments through regional fora ... develop regional-level strategies to address the common norms, values and taboos that fuel the epidemic and feed the stigma and discrimination faced by PLWHA and vulnerable groups within the region; share best practices from around the region for learning and scaling up efforts...provide support in enhancing access to treatment through inter-country memorandums of understanding and trade agreements for the supply of cheap generic drugs; and provide support for regional PLWHA networks and fora that will enable HIV positive people across south Asia to develop shared agendas and strategies in order to advocate for the needs and rights of those infected and affected at regional and global levels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 28, 2004  Out and About
				 																																	 Some relationships go beyond time. When she was alive, actress Jennifer Kapoor had wanted tabla maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain to perform with the Prithvi Theatre, of which she was the chief initiator. The concert was never organised during her lifetime. But the Ustad kept his promise and performed at a concert on her birthday, February 28, 1985, after her demise in 1984. For the last 19 years, Hussain has kept his word. Today shall see the tabla wizard and his brothers, Taufique and Fazal do an encore on Jennifers birth anniversary. The brothers will compose their own music during the three-day memorial concert, with a host of other performers, as a tribute. As long as they remember... Vasundhara Das				 																																	 She may have woken up to the moves of disco 20 years too late (although how Time To Disco from the film Kal Ho Naa Ho could be such a raging hit beats everyone), but Vasundhara Das is wasting no time warning people about AIDS. The singer-actress has been roped in by BBC World News Service and Doordarshan for a public interest video on the dreaded disease. Das will be matching vocals with Rajasthans famous folk singers, The Maharaja Band. The lady, who played the lead in Monsoon Wedding, will also shoot for a corresponding video with the band in Jodhpur, over which she is, needless to say, excited. So stay tuned for that message. Coming soon on a TV channel near you.  Hugh Masekela 				 																																	Over 10 years ago, racism ruled South Africa and Hugh Masekela was in exile. Now the famed trumpet player is about to visit India. South Africa has grand plans all over the world to mark 10 years of its first elected multi-party government. In India, the events will begin in April. Before that  for just a little fanfare  Ma-sekela will perform at a concert in Delhi on Wednesday. Roll over, Bryan Adams!

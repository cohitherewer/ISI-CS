The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 12, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Dressed to kill				 																																																				Sir  The West Bengal government, just recovering from a bout of serious accusations against the abysmal medical infrastructure it has nurtured over the years, has been quite vocal about the fact that a makeover is necessary. However, the makeover that the government talked about is turning out to be a literal one (Patients dress code to prevent ward walkouts, Jan 9). Indeed, patients fleeing from hospital wards are a serious and embarrassing problem. But how can enforcing a dress code for them be a solution? Leaving aside the obvious problems of such a cumbersome exercise, what is more important is that this will be nowhere near addressing the larger problems plaguing the government hospitals now. To begin with, the resources that the government has agreed to spend will be more fruitful in training the hospital staff to be more compassionate and professional in doing their job. Recording information about a patient for ready reference is also important. These, together with the proposed counselling, will be more effective than the impractical idea of enforcing a dress code for the patients. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Aniket Mishra, Calcutta
				 																																																				Restricted entry				 																																																				Sir  The new security restrictions in the United States of America, which require all visitors to the country to be finger-printed and photographed, has justifiably caused resentment in many countries. The Brazilian judge who issued a retaliatory order mandating all visiting US citizens to be fingerprinted and photographed has received a lot of popular support (Brazil checks backfire, Jan 7). There is similar outrage in India. But one can understand the Brazilian governments moves to disassociate itself from the order. The countrys economy is poised delicately and it would be foolish to get into a tussle with the US. But citizens of any self-respecting country would hate to be treated so after landing in a foreign country. 				 																																																				Authorities in the US should think of ways to make the programme more heeding of the dignity of the visitors. The Brazilian reaction should tell the US that the new security measures will not solve its problems but complicate it manifold.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitra (Vive la Brasilia, Jan 9) needs to ponder the following points. The Brazilian judge who ordered US visitors to be fingerprinted said that the US decision to fingerprint visitors was equivalent to the worst atrocities committed by the Nazis. In other words, in the wisdom of this judge, asking visitors to be fingerprinted is at the same moral level as murdering over six million people. President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva wins votes with his anti-American sloganeering but, contrary to what Mitra says, he is actually well loved on Wall Street. In fact, Lula has followed economic policies more extremely right wing than even those recommended by the International Monetary Fund. If Mitra has been in Europe in the last ten years, he will know that the countries there are not white countries anymore. Indeed, a great number of Muslim/Arabic/ north-African visitors to the US are, in fact, European citizens.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitra seems unaware that most Americans have welcomed the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology programme. In fact, most rational visitors to the US will very happily submit to being fingerprinted and photographed, since they know that genuine trouble-makers will also have to do the same. At the end of the day, I and ordinary Americans like me will sleep more easily knowing that the immigration department has a more potent tool to trap no-gooders. 				 																																																				Mitra also gives the impression that no person from a few countries  Canada, 25 European countries and Japan  referred to need to go through US-VISIT. In reality, anyone who needs a visa (including workers from those countries and people whose visit would be for more than 90 days) would still need to go through US-VISIT.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Supratim Sanyal, Germantown, Madison

				 																																																				Sir  Every country has the right to take steps to maintain its security. In that regard, the US-VISIT system makes a lot of sense. The records will be part of a database and will not be used for any other purpose. After all, the photographs and fingerprints are meant to secure not only the country but also the people. If a person wishes to enter the US then he must follow the security regulations in that country. There can be no objections on that score.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Clear the road blocks				 																																																				Sir  The Golden Quadrilateral project would be a blessing to West Bengal, where the state would benefit without spending anything from its own coffers (Bengal hits PMs dream highway below the belt, Jan 4). A states progress depends on its infrastructure, and the National Highways Authority of India is doing its best to implement it. And if it is disrupted by locals, it pushes up the project cost. The Central authorities may lose interest as a result. The demand for 15-20 underpasses over and above 20 already approved on the 130 kilometre stretch on the Durgapur highway from Dankuni to Panagarh is politically motivated. These underpasses will become the hunting ground of vagabonds and criminals. The state government should take measures keeping in mind the states larger interests. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The prime ministers dream highway project may well take a backseat in the state for the time being on the Dankuni-Panagarh stretch. The ambitious project needs to be completed fast in order to connect India from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Thus it is time Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee intervened in the matter for the sake of the entire state. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is not surprising that the Golden Quadrilateral project has been waylaid by local problems in West Bengal. What is surprising is that it has progressed so long unhindered.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ranjan Banik, Calcutta

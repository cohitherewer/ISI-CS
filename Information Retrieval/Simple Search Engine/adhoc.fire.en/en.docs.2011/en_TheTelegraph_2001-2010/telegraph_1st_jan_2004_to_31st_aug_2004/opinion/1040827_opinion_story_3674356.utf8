		 Friday, August 27, 2004 							 																						A MAN WHO MEANT BUSINESSFor The Love of India: The Life and Times of Jamshetji Tata By R.M. Lala, Penguin, Rs 395Jamshetji Tata was a remarkable person who captured the attention of post-1900 India. He is regarded by all Indians as the epitome of all that is good about enterpreneurship and industry. The creation of a culture of honest and straightforward business dealings in our country as a means to individual and collective success may be attributed to the outstanding personality that was Tata. But whether the trends set by Tata have actually been absorbed fully in todays business world is, of course, debatable. 																														R.M. Lalas biography of the eminent industrialist,entitled For the Love of India: The Life and Times of Jamshetji Tata, is a reminder of all that Jamshetji stood for. The effort is fairly commendable. The book does not merely track the history of the man, it also enlists important dates and accomplishments, some of which are  Indias first industrialist of note, a philanthropist and the founder of Indias premier institute of education, The Indian Institute of Science. 																														The book gives a feel of the political environment of the times. There are details of negotiations between Jamshetji and Lord Curzon, and the response to swadeshi. An idea of the business conditions of the times can be obtained, as also tales of Jamshetjis fierce battle against unfair trade practices.																														Mahatma Gandhi had called Jamshetji a man of adventure, and the description is borne out in this book. There is much to be learnt from these stories, lessons which continue to be true and applicable even in todays world. 																														Building a successful business and managing it are often a function of how well a businessman aligns with the times. This is embodied in Jamshetjis choice of the Parsi dictum, Humata Hukta, Huvarsta (good thoughts, good words, good deeds), as the guiding principle for his organization. 																														The book also offers a glimpse of the Parsi community, its origins, history and the edge Western education gave it in the British raj. Jamshetjis tale is not merely one of rapid generation of wealth and of the building of a business empire. Rather, it is a tale of a man who had a vision of Indias development and who loved the country and its people. 																														However, it is here that the book falters slightly. It tends towards hagiography in that it dwells a bit too much on Tatas many accomplishments. There is no real comparison here with other businessmen of the times. And practically every novel idea of development is attributed to Jamshetjis vision  ranging from urban development to dairy farming, either as a successful venture or a failed project.

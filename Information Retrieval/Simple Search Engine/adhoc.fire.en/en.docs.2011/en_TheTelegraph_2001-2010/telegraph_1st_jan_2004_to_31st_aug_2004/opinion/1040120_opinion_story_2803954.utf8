		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004  PUBLIC INTEREST AND PERSONAL RIGHTS  - Document  Extracts from the UNDP report HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 Out in the open  Relevance and importance of  human rights to HIV/AIDS: It has been argued that protecting  the rights of those affected and at risk is the best public  health strategy to cope with an epidemic. A rights-based  approach recognizes vulnerability to the epidemic not just  in terms of individual behaviour but also the social, cultural  and economic conditions that lead to this vulnerability.  It also recognizes that the vulnerability of women, children,  migrant workers, men who have sex with men, injecting drug  users and sex workers can be reduced through the protection  of their human rights. It is only when the stigma and discrimination  faced by people living with HIV/AIDS is eliminated, that  they can be empowered to take control of their lives. Protection  of human rights helps to create a supportive environment,  encouraging PLWHA to access the various health and HIV/AIDS-related  social services and...stimulating behaviour change... The international response to  HIV/AIDS has been characterized by two diametrically opposed  public health approaches  the isolationist approach and  the integrationist approach. The isolationist response proposes  three basic strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention: compulsory  and universal HIV screening, the disclosure of the HIV status  of those testing positive and their isolation from larger  society through discriminatory practices. The integrationist  strategy...,proposes voluntary testing following informed  consent, the non-disclosure of a persons treatment of PLWHA  in healthcare, employment and all other facets of life. Integrationist policies were based  on the fundamental human rights of individuals to self-autonomy,  privacy and equality. The basis of this philosophy was that,  in the long term, voluntary testing, confidentiality and  non-discrimination would encourage people to come out and  access health services. This, in turn, would increase the  possibility of bringing about behaviour change and instilling  a sense of personal responsibility through counselling,  thus helping retard the spread of the virus. The integrationist  approach, therefore, sought to battle and reduce stigma  whereas the isolationist approach sought to increase it,  thus pushing the epidemic further underground. Initially, the isolationist response...was  felt to be most appropriate in south Asia... this approach  was given up when it was seen to be violating peoples human  rights and fuelling stigmatization. HIV-related discrimination  first attracted attention in the region when India announced  the testing of foreign students, mainly those of African  origin. This was followed by an announcement that certain  categories of long-term residents also had to be tested  for HIV. Concerns that foreigners might transmit the infection  to the local population prompted the preparation of a draft  bill prohibiting marriage between foreigners and Indian  nationals. Fortunately, the proposed legislation did not  see the light of day. The realization gradually dawned  that the isolation versus integration debate could  not be perceived as an issue of public interest versus individual  rights. It came to be acknowledged that the protection of  the individual was itself in the public interest as it increased  accessibility to services and brought the epidemic into  the open. This enabled concerted and effective public health  intervention that were ultimately beneficial to society  at large. An outstanding example of a successful,  integrationist rights-based approach is that of the STD/HIV  Intervention Project in the red-light area of Sonagachi  in the Indian city of Kolkata. The empowerment of sex workers  in SHIP brought about significant improvements in their  health as evidenced by a drastic decline in STD rates and  the marginal rise in HIV infection. TO BE CONCLUDED

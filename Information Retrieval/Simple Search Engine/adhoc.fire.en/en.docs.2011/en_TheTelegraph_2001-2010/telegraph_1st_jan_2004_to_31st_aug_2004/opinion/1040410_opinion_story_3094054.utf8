		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 							 																						OUR DAILY MANTRAThis Above All / Khushwant Singh				 	 Jungle lore																					I have succeeded in memorizing the lines (I like to show off the little knowledge I have), but I have failed to comprehend their meaning nor understood why Hindus regard it as the mantra of all mantras. To me it appears to be no more than a hymn in praise of the sun. Allama Iqbal in his poem, Aftab, also regarded it as a litany of solar worship. I have two other versions in translation. The first is by V.N. Datta. The second by Nafay Kamail Rudaulvi. Before their versions I reproduce the original;Om Bhur Bhuvah Svah, Tat Savitur VerenyamBhargo Devasy Dimahi, Dhiyo Yonah Pracho DayatDatta translates the lines as follows:O Lord, who pervades the earth,The intermediate world and the world of life,We mediate on the supreme lightOf the illumining Sun-god,That he may impel our mind.																					Rudaulvi, who is himself a poet of some calibre, translated the same lines in more poetic words:																					O Lord, the soul of this beautiful world and the founder of day and nightYou are the creator of the universe and the provider for all The Moon, the Sun are there due to you and help creationThe life and death is subject to your existence																					You are the noor that is everywhereThe heart beats and all breathe with your permissionPlease have mercy in the name of that noorThe knowledge and Aql get the right intellectual orientation																					Can any reader tell me why this mantra is looked upon as the most potent?																					Close encounters with the king																					Many years ago, I happened to be in the Nagerhole wildlife sanctuary. I drove through the early part of the night, hoping to catch a glimpse of a tiger or two and other beasts of the jungle. All I saw was a herd of elephants, a few gaur and lots of cheetal deer. My disappointment was compensated by running into Vivek Sinha and his wife. Vivek, who retired as additional secretary, had made his home in evergreen Bangalore, which is close to a few wildlife sanctuaries and rich with bird life. Viveks passion in life is to shoot wildlife with his camera. 																					Three years ago, his The Tiger is a Gentleman was published. I was enchanted by his pictures and encounters he had with those ferocious rulers of the jungle. Recently, he has come out with another book, The Vanishing Tiger: Wild Tigers, Co-predators and Prey Species. As the title claims, besides tigers it has photographs of leopards, hyenas, wild dogs, foxes, varieties of deer, a python and lots of birds. The pictures are spectacular and show animals and birds living in total freedom in their habitats. I havent seen any better.																					In the covering letter Vivek Sinha sent me, he included a few couplets in Urdu composed by him.The first two capture his philosophy of life pretty well:Dozakh-o-Jannat kay chakkar mein nahin phanstaaYeh mahaz Sheikh-o- Birahman kee rozee kay zareeye hainPasey-marg kaun jaaney kya hota hai,Zindgi jeeta hoon, maaloom hai kya hota haiI do not entangle myself in the maze of heaven or hell,They are items preachers of Islam and Hinduism sell.Who knows where we go after we are dead?I live my life to the full, I know what it is, I live it well.																					In his second composition, Vivek Sinha spells out another aspect of his falsafa (philosophy):Gunahgaar hoon to apna hoon;Kisee aur ka naheen;Rahta hoon sadaakat sayPar kisee khauf say nahi																					I am a sinner; my sins be on my head																					I do not sin against anyone else;																					I live in peace with myself.																					I do not live in dread.																					Lighter side of saffron																					You  got it wrong How they talk to Muslims, Messers Vajpayee, AdvaniWe will mend our ways, vote for us; see,																					We are friendly with Pak																					But they forget when they talkThat Indian Muslims are Indian, not Pakistani.																					The Saffron Bandwagon:Why such crowding after BJP bandwagon rides?Is there some ulterior motive that guides?																					The reason is obviousIntentions, though dubious It is the bread thats buttered on both sides.																					Hefty Heptullah:Najma Heptullah is making statements braveStrange are the ways the politicians behave 																					Or is it no more strange																					That genes too undergo changeMaulana Azad must be turning in his grave.

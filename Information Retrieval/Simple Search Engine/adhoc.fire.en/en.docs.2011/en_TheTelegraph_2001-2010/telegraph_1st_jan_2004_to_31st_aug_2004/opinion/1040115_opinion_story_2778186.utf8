The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 15, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Nowhere to save face				 																																																				Sir  The British prime minister, Tony Blair, impresses no one with righteous statements about how, in principle, a minister found lying should resign (Blair to quit if Hutton holds him guilty, Jan 12). In fact, given his complicity in George W. Bushs sham Iraq war, Blair would be better off not putting his foot in his mouth with such statements. Blair might feel that given his present position, between a rock and a hard place, a resignation would be a face-saver  especially if the Hutton enquiry into the suicide of David Kelly concludes that he had been deliberately exaggerating the threat from Iraqs weapons of mass destruction. Blair is an old political hand, and chances are that he might find a ploy to save face even if the proof tilts against him. But there is no reason to be floored by this sudden honesty; one only needs to recall the many occasions he has stood by Bush, mouthing lies to the world about the goings-on in Iraq. The two looked like cats who had just swallowed all the cream. For Blair, a resignation would be small penance. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Rajat Banerjee, Calcutta
				 																Too much generosity				 																																																				Sir  The recent populist announcements of the finance minister, Jaswant Singh, just before the schedule of the general elections was finalized, are a master move that may work in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The sops being given away may add to the general euphoria about the economy, but it will surely lead to a loss in revenues. The government, however, has clarified that it has enough funds to balance its accounts (Feel great: A Rs 8000-cr poll splurge, Jan 9). 				 																																																				Singhs proposals are being termed a mini budget but their effect, in terms of what is being given away as concessions in direct and indirect taxes, will be anything but mini. Also, since these proposals cover a significant area of the budgeting exercise, this years actual budget may be delayed. It remains to be seen whether these proposals will hasten growth, as Singh has intended. But the former finance minister, Manmohan Singh, has been right to say cynically that if the BJP intended to give relief to the common man, why had it not done so earlier?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Jaswant Singhs mini budget, which gives maxi gifts to citizens, clearly shows that the government has stashed away a large cache by taking more and giving away less in taxes. It can now afford some largesse. State governments too project themselves as being severely short of cash, but who knows whether that is the reality. The sops will ensure more money is in circulation  a better idea than excess money lying idle with the government.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The BJPs sudden doling out of sops is akin to the extra effort a student puts in just before an important examination. The editorial, Improvident (Jan 9), makes a mountain out of a molehill by fixing on only one proposal  a social security scheme for workers in the unorganized sector  in order to criticize the entire exercise. 				 																																																				Five decades of Congress rule only managed to improve the lives of employees in the organized sector  a small fraction of the workforce. During the reign of the Congress, could workers in the unorganized sector dream of pension, medical benefits and so on? The finance ministers mini budget, with its many gifts for the middle class, should be welcomed. If the opposition has problems, it can always announce that it will scrap the announced measures if it comes to power. But does it have the guts to do so?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  The National Democratic Alliance looks all set to win the general elections this year, riding piggyback on the concessions granted by Jaswant Singh. All Indians should take the maximum advantage of these sops. For it goes without saying that once the NDA comes back to power, these concessions will be taken back.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In his recent announcements, Jaswant Singh could have made tax laws simpler by mandating one set of TDS forms for all types of income. Also, there should be a flat 10 per cent TDS rate, instead of the current range from 5.25 to 21 per cent. There should also be one date for filing returns, say April 30. The idea should be to make the system, which is so complicated at present that one needs the help of tax consultants, simple enough for tax-payers to follow themselves. 				 																																																				Also, with the foreign exchange reserves being in a comfortable position now, the government should eliminate customs duty on goods not produced in the country in order to stop smuggling. As such, mobile phone handsets, life-saving drugs and such like which carry a low duty now, can be totally exempted from all taxes. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

				 																Dubious honour				 																																																				Sir  A.B. Vajpayee must be lauded for refusing the honorary doctorate the MS University of Vadodara wanted to confer on him (Vajpayee refuses varsity honour, Jan 3). At least we have one politician who does not hanker after such honours. But the question is, should universities be allowed to bestow such honours of their own, especially for political reasons? 				 																																																				There must be a minimum set of qualifications necessary for giving doctorates. And these should be adhered to so that education is not transformed into a dirty playground of politicians. Vajpayee has shown the way. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sayan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Patna Universitys proposal to confer a doctorate on Laloo Prasad Yadav makes a mockery of a respected academic degree (Varsity high honour for Laloo, Dec 22). It goes without saying that Yadav is unworthy of the honour. Besides, what impact will it have on students who put in years of backbreaking research for their PhD? Have things come to such a dreadful pass now that the lathi, with which Yadav rules Bihar, has more influence than the pen?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Noorus Saba, Burdwan

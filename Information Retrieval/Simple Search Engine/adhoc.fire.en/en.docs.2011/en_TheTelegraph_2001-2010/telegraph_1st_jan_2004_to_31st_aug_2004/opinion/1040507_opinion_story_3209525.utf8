		 Friday, May 07, 2004 							 																						BIRTH OF A NEW WORK ETHICNeha Sahay																					A week off for Labour Day seems perfectly in keeping with the Marxist philosophy which must prevail in the worlds most populous Workers Paradise. But the only worker whose face made front-page news on May 1 was Fandilinaer. Part of a dance ensemble, Fandilinaer was among 1,004 Model Workers, none of whom were presumably photogenic enough to grace the front page of Chinas main paper.																					Another of the 1,004 who made headlines was Bao Xianfeng, a migrant worker who became the first and only one to be awarded the 2004 National Labour Medal, the countrys highest honour for a Chinese worker. Like 99 million of his compatriots, Bao came from the countryside to the city to find work and is now group leader in a construction company.																					Among the winners were 18 employees of private enterprises, another first. Normally, Chinas private sector accounts for just 3 or 4 medal winners, most of them managers. This year, 6 of the 18 were actually frontline workers.																					Apart from these two whose names made it to the press, workers were conspicuous by their absence from all news connected to the Labour Day holidays which last until May 7. Presumably, they must have formed part of the 90 million Chinese who were expected to travel across the country during this week. For this Socialist country now has a new definition of worker, spelt out at last years International Labour Day function, which includes entrepreneurs, managers, professionals and intellectuals. Accordingly, last years Beijing Labour Medal was awarded to an American, Richard Carpenter, general manager of Procter amp; Gamble Technologies (Beijing) Co., by the deputy head of the capitals trade union federation, who commended not only Carpenters contribution to the Chinese economy, but also his concern for his workers.																					Time to splurge																					Shanghais Movers and Shakers, Couples rush to marry during May holidays and Most HK hotels booked out were the headlines that set the mood for this Golden Week. Like the two other annual Golden Weeks  one during the Lunar New Year (which falls in January or February) and the other during the National Day Holiday (starting October 1)  the practice of giving 7 days off at a time is aimed not at giving the working class a much-needed rest, but at getting the newly-rich Chinese to part with their money, be it on travel, food or shopping. Indeed, the over-worked employees of the travel, hotel/restaurant/retail and recreation sectors, get no day off during these weeks.																					Nor do they get over time or a bonus linked to the profits earned by their bosses at this time. All transport fares are up by 10 to 25 per cent, and bus operators this time were warned not to indulge in under-cutting by lowering prices. Even supermarkets raised their prices on food items like chocolates by as much as 50 per cent.																					But this deterred only a few. Every day, more and more names are added to the list of countries where individual Chinese are allowed to travel for pleasure. The universally favoured tourist spots in Asia are now hot on the list of Chinas Movers and Shakers too.																					But the favourite destination of the Mainland Chinese seems to be Hong Kong. While the world laps up cheap but near-perfect Chinese counterfeits, wealthy Chinese professionals and businessmen flock to HK for the Real Thing. Spending tens of thousands of HK dollars (the exchange rate to the rupee, Rs 6, is almost the same as for the yuan) on His and Hers Longine and Cartier watches, Pierre Cardin and Armani clothes or platinum and diamond jewellery (gold is so old-fashioned), is normal. Hong Kong shop-owners point out that Mainlanders spend more per day than an average Western tourist. Even within China, hot shopping-cum-entertainment destinations like Shenzen, which is being developed into a Mainland replica of HK, see Chinese tourists spending 1,662 yuan per day to the foreigners 804 yuan. In Shenzen, a newly-opened five-star hotel offered its superior room for 588 yuan a night to celebrate Labour Day.																					In China, the average monthly salary of the person to whom Labour Day is dedicated is 500-800 yuan.

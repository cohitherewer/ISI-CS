 - Document  Extracts from the UNDP report HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 Safer behaviours  Sri Lanka, like India, has adopted  a population and reproductive health policy. However, the  Sri Lankan policy has specific provisions about adolescents.  The strategies include the following: Providing adequate information  on population, family life including ethical human behaviour,  sexuality, and drug abuse in school curricula at the appropriate  levels; strengthening youth-worker education by including  information about drug abuse and sex-related problems at  vocational training centres, institutions of higher learning,  work places, and free trade zones; encouraging counselling  on drug and substance abuse, human sexuality, and psycho-social  problems, especially by NGOs...and the national youth services  council; promoting informed constructive media coverage  of youth-related social problems; and promoting productive  employment opportunities for youth... Many Nepalese adolescents are  aware of HIV/AIDS and the means of transmission and prevention,  indicating active campaigns to reach youth and adults with  basic messages. Young people in Nepal are, in general, sexually  active in their teenage years, according to survey findings.  However, without extensive health services targeted towards  adolescents, to complement awareness and information, the  vulnerability to HIV could be significant. Migrant and mobile populations:  Mobility and migration is often a survival imperative in  south Asia, as abject poverty and lack of employment opportunities  at home compel people to migrate. Although there has been  little research on the impact of intra-and inter-country  migration on the spread of HIV, and it would be wrong to  label migrant and mobile populations as being a source of  infection, the fact remains that this group is vulnerable  to HIV...HIV prevention efforts focusing exclusively or  extensively on especially vulnerable people might worsen  the stigmatization of some groups. Vulnerable and bridge  populations such as sex workers, migrant workers and long  distance truckers struggle to survive within a hostile social  structure that shapes their behaviour and that of the authorities  who interact with them. Sex workers might require a large  number of clients to earn a livelihood and do not have the  ability to negotiate safer sex and better payment.  For mobile populations, long absences  from the home environment, housing in single-sex hostels,  lack of access to sexually transmitted infection treatment,  the use of alcohol or drugs in order to belong to the  peer group and harassment or indifference from service providers  are all factors over which they have no control. The prevention  approaches of many HIV programmes in south Asia assume that  raising awareness about HIV and providing condoms or clean  needles will enable people to switch to safer behaviours.  Given the situational nature of risk, however, it is clear  that people are more likely to adopt-and sustain-safer behaviours  when the underlying risk situation is simultaneously made  safer... The challenge, then, is to bring  about societal changes to reduce HIV risk among highly vulnerable  populations and lessen the social stigma surrounding them.  This entails the inculcation of caring social attitudes,  improving the availability, accessibility and sensitivity  of HIV services and introducing legal and regulatory measures  that can protect these groups. Vulnerable groups may then  feel encouraged to avail of healthcare services and support  mechanisms offered by governments and NGOs. The usage of  non-judgmental language in expanded media coverage of the  epidemic, for instance, can help transform negative attitudes  to people in risk situations. TO BE CONCLUDED

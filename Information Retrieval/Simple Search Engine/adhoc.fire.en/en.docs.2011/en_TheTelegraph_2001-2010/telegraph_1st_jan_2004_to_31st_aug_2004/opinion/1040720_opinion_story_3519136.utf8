The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 							 																						TIME TO GET TOGETHERMore constructive consultation among states will foster regional growth and help them resist over-centralization, writes Barun De				 	 Hand in hand																														The market is often assumed to be the sole determinant of national choices. However, it is not an undifferentiated unit. Every national economy has multiple levels with regional and class components. These levels specifically indicate ways for managing investment baskets and forms of revenue extraction. They require different approaches to problems of effective governance and welfare. Examples are the multiple specificities of certain major Indian regions. Those in which modern capitalist development  as distinct from earlier Asian feudal or despotic growth  originated, are the three hinterlands of the East India Companys port towns and headquarters, now called Chennai, Calcutta and Mumbai. Three others are the central uplands  known in British Indian geography as Deccan, Gondwana, and Chota Nagpur  till the northern outliers of the Vindhyas; the upper Gangetic heartland of Malwa, the less-desert part of Rajasthan and eastern and northern Punjab; and, finally, the arid tract from Kutch and the Thar to westernmost cis-Sutlej Punjab. The socio-economic potential of each require recognition of their diversity for unified planning.																														Calcuttas hinterland stretched till the early 20th century, from Visakhapatnam in northern Andhra to Chittagong, now in Bangladesh, along the Bay of Bengals shallow headwaters into which pour the silted sludge of the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Mahanadi river systems. This made the Bay increasingly inhospitable in the late 20th century  the age of containerized shipping transportation  for anything larger than small motor vessels. 																														From each estuarial tract, stretch northwards on either side, narrow coastal strips backed by hill ranges in western Orissa, Jharkhand and the north-east hill states. The main agrarian block is Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. Paddy and legumes as well as other fruits from the soil were always the core of subsistence of this region. In the last two centuries, peripheral mineral extraction also developed with great plantation industries  indigo that died out by the 19th century, and then tea  in the northern high ranges and foothills.																														An agrarian and peripherally extractive economy, controlled by an increasingly impoverished rentier class, which was dependent on state capital regulation and in recent years on subsidies for sick industries, had its heyday a hundred years ago. Latter-day British Indian imperialism, sick of bhadralok politics, shifted its capital to New Delhi. Protests were assuaged by a new Bengal, a linguistic province that broke the essential business and managing agency unity of Calcuttas hinterland, which included Telegus, Oriyas, tribals, Biharis and Assamese as well as Bengalis. The collapse of the managing agency system and then the de-colonization policy produced further built-in depressors that still persist. One has only to look at what are now called heritage buildings and monuments, to see the grim ruins of the urban culture of the Bay of Bengal hinterland. This is as true of the Waltair railway settlement (older than Vizag port) Cuttack, old Ranchi, Patna, Malda and Burdwan or of the Brahmaputra valley towns.																														Panchayats may have brought social stability and considerably empowered West Bengals rural sector but the surplus profits from agriculture have not multiplied into productive industrial investment. Without such feedback, genuine accumulation of capital is impossible. The entire regions political culture, dominated by a rainbow of parties, has one common point. It is not dynamic. This creeping paralysis is historical in its tangled roots.																														History can be defied. This is possible only if a sufficiently critical mass of people develop cultural initiative and the political will  and not just political rhetoric  to change. Since independence, the slow-paced Parsi compradors of Bombay were radically transformed into the modern Maratha hustle and Gujarati entrepreneurial people of Sharad Pawars, or the Ambanis, Mumbai. Refugees from Punjab and the North-west Frontier provinces transformed the Delhi metropolitan sub-region into a thriving state. Transformation has taken place in the once easygoing feudal Bangalore and Hyderabad. The point is to spark endogenous creativity and capacity to develop better working conditions and job satisfaction  as distinct from IT loops redistributing existing capital within a slowly expanding circle of consumers, or from simple building booms to accommodate normal urban population growth. This can come by generating radical improvements in traditional industries.																														Transportation across the hinterland and out of it (and that includes revitalization of the ports), improvement and overhaul of the steel manufacture on the Bengal-Bihar-Orissa borders, plans for bringing tea production in northern Assam and Bengal back to prosperity  all these require much more coordination among neighbouring states. The business prospects of the region cannot be determined by Calcutta alone, nor by New Delhi, which has a range of other considerations to satisfy. The present conjuncture of coalition politics may be a better opportunity for constructive intermediate regional consultation, than a welter of controversy and adversarial counter-charges across parties.																														Narrow state-based political choices would be disastrous from the regional point of view. That would take us back to the self-interested pettiness by which the National Democratic Alliance hived off the Hajipur segment of the railways, or it would take us forward to the Jharkhand demand for shifting Coal Indias office to Ranchi. These give no real impetus to socio-economic growth. Only political propaganda gets leeway. Leaders, not only of parties, but also of chambers and confederations of commerce and industry, and of the intelligentsia must get together and work out a regionally composite view. This will pack more punch in negotiations with financial authorities. It will offer more profit than packages for small segments, each a linguistic state. This is what all of them in this region, except for West Bengal, are: West Bengal has been able to transcend linguistic chauvinism and accept other language cultures such as Urdu, Hindi or Nepali.																														In each of the six regions that we started with, the business system and its leadership have come to represent the real leaders, power centres, social patronage of the arts and financing of initiative. Politicians of all parties, with only a few honourable exceptions, have become the butt of buffoonery for television shows such as The Great Indian Tamasha. Independent initiatives are necessary in the public interest to create clearer alternative social choices for the moribund eastern Indian regional culture and for its more vital future.																														Only its territory does not define a hinterland. The electorate has given a mandate for the politics of national coalition. It is time for thinkers, entrepreneurs and politicians, middle class or worker, to accept regional realities, intermediate between their own state and the nation. Congress chief ministers in West Bengal and Bihar half a century ago had sought a regional merger of the two states. This sort of mechanical union is not what is being pleaded for. All one is looking for is more clout for inter-state consensus, based on a mood of common understanding and activism for the economic and social necessities of region-specific difference.																														A realistic use of the coalition model at the intermediate level would also give people much more leverage vis--vis over-centralization from the capital city.

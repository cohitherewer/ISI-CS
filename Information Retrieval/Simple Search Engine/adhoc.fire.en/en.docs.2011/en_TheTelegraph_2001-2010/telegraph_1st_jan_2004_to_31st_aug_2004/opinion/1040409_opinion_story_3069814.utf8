		 Friday, April 09, 2004 							 																						FAMILIAR VOICE 							 - Now you know how fiction is written Embarrassing indulgenceThe Opposite of Fate By Amy Tan Flamingo, HarperCollins,  pound;8.99
The book jacket informs me that Cosmopolitan is happy with Amy Tans new and first collection of non-fiction. Amy Tan is definitely a guru on life, love and imagination, declares Cosmo. Armed with this knowledge, I open this four-hundred page tome at random. It falls open, quite promisingly, at page 269: What the Library Means to Me. My father takes me to the library every two weeks, and I check five or six books each time. These books seem to open many windows in my little room. I can see many wonderful things outside, wrote an eight-year-old Amy Tan as a third-grader at Matanzas School, Santa Rosa, in California, where she grew up.																														So far, promising. We learn that as she grew up, it was a combination of fate and faith  as well as their opposites  that led Tan to continue her love affair with books. At college, even after being enrolled as pre-med, she became an English major. Later she abandoned the pursuit of a doctorate in linguistics  and with it, her parents dream that she would become a doctor of some sort. 																														Years later, she was to discover that she had passed literary milestones: her books were now listed as required reading in many schools, under the rubric of Multicultural Literature. And yes, she was now a part of the Cliffs Notes, Your key to the classics, as she tells us at some length. Why, then, she wonders, did she continue to be labelled an immigrant writer, and why did her books generally get sent only to Asian-American reviewers?																														In this collection of musings entitled The Opposite of Fate, Amy Tan writes about the process of writing, and what it has meant to her. She also writes about the influence of her mother on her, and about her own other-worldly experiences.																														I am usually wary of collections of musings, as they tend to be uneven assortments of previously-published and very slight pieces put together with a few new offerings. This collection is no exception. For me, Tan is at her best when she is not being the Chinese-American version of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. She is witty and wry when she writes about Hollywood (Oliver Stonehappens to look exactly like Oliver Stone) and her literary hero, Nabokov (It is likely Nabokov and I might have crossed paths). An email written to friends after returning from a dramatic rescue off Tahoe, entitled My Hair, My Face, My Nails, ends with a smile: Now you know how fiction is written.																														In a disturbing piece about the murder of a very close friend, she displays a rare vulnerability as she describes the effect of the loss. About her own illness, she is candid and philosophical. She writes in the last essay in this collection, which is also the title essay of this volume, about being diagnosed with the tick-borne Lyme disease: Writing comes with great effort. I have to think harder. But then again, the world is now a more difficult place for all of us. We all have to think harder.																														One of the more dramatic moments she describes is when, after a heated argument, her mother slammed the door shut, latched it, then locked it with a key. I saw the flash of a meat cleaver just before she pushed me to the wall and brought the blades edge to within an inch of my throat. Her eyes were like a wild animals.																														And yet, given the directness of her non-fictional voice as against the oblique possibilities of fiction, we learn little about this complex relationship between mother and daughter, even though we see it over and over again as we turn the pages. At times, therefore, the relationship, relentlessly described and analysed, becomes quite tiresome. There is only so much that one can take of wordplays on fate and faith. 																														A majority of the elements of her life that Tan touches upon here have appeared in one form or the other in her bestselling novels. Most annoying are the cheery, lightweight pieces dashed off for Seventeen and Ladies Home Journal: these may have been better off buried between those glossy pages. As for the long, rambling account of dressing in a dominatrix costume and performing with the Rock Bottom Remainders  its an embarrassing indulgence. 																														It is this unevenness of tone that prevents The Opposite of Fate from being a memorable book. Amy Tans voice may still be that of a beloved guru, but its time she drew up a new lesson plan.

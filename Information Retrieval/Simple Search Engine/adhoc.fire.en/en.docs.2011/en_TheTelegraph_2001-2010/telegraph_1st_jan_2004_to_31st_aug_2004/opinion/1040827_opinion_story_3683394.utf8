		 Friday, August 27, 2004 							 																						STRAINS FROM A DISTANCEThe real delights of MUSIC MAKERS: LIVING LEGENDS OF INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC (Rupa, Rs 995) by Ashok Roy are the interviews. Kishen Maharaj recounts how, in his youthful exuberance, he asked for a motorbike when King Hari Singh of Kashi wanted to reward him for his sangat with Siddheshwari Devi. His wish was promptly granted. The mood portraits of the artists are in colour, while those from the album are in sepia. The picture of the Dagar dynasty sitting in riyaz in the verandah of a raj mansion conjures up images of a tradition of Indian classical music which seems strangely distant today. The reason, as Bhimsen Joshi puts it, is that very few are able to touch you here [the heart]. This is not for the library, but certainly a book that the lover of Indian classical music would love to keep on his coffee table.

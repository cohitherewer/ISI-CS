The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 							 																						GIVE A BREAK																														The building a liberalized economic regime in India is often interrupted by the intrusion of the state. In a market economy, the states role is minimal; the state only secures certain enabling conditions. All economic decisions are left to the market and to the entrepreneurs reading of the market. Thus how much advertising should be allowed on television channels cannot be within the purview of the state or any other body created or appointed by the state. The move afoot to regulate the maximum advertising time per hour is bizarre and completely unacceptable. There can be no logic behind the proposal, even though its intentions are noble. The aim is to provide maximum viewing time for those who watch television. But it is difficult to comprehend why a regulatory body should regulate this aspect of the business. If a particular channel wants to drown its programmes in advertisement breaks, it should be left free to do so and then face the reaction from its viewers. Television channels providing too many commercial breaks will find themselves losing viewers faster than they had bargained for. If, on the other hand, they do not lose viewers, they should be left free to run their business in the way they want to. The ratio between advertisements and programmes should be left to the discretion of the entrepreneur and to his drive for profits in a market environment. This ratio should not be dictated even though such a quaint practice does exist in some countries.																														A parallel can easily be drawn from the prevailing situation in the print media. Newspapers and magazines also have to strike a balance between advertisements and editorial content. Too little of the former makes for bad business and too little of the latter makes for a bad newspaper. One leads to declining revenues and the other to declining readership and ultimately to loss of revenue as well. But this balance is decided by each newspaper/magazine in its own way and in fact can vary from day to day or season to season. The ratio between edit and ad that is considered viable is something that is decided internally within a newspaper/magazine. No external government body or agency dictates or regulates this. There is no reason why a similar situation should not be allowed for television, which, like newspapers/magazines, is also in the news and entertainment business. The attempt on the part of the state to spread its tentacles into realms outside its remit is a throwback to an antiquated socialist way of doing things. The state should mind its own business, which does not include business.

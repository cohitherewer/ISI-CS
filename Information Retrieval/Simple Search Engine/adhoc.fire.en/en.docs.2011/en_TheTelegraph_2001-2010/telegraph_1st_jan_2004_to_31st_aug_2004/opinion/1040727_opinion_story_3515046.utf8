Mulayam Yadav is attempting to make a transition from a troublemaker to a member of the new governing elite, writes Mahesh Rangarajan The author is a political analyst and an independent researcher Smooth operatorMost reportage on Uttar Pradesh takes a close look at the constant shifts in political alignment. But the key may well lie elsewhere. For the better part of two decades, the state has not been in the limelight for any innovations in economic policy. But that picture is changing and changing fast.Since the creation of wealth and the exercise of power are closely inter-related, the changes deserve a closer look. All the more so because of the consequences they have for the fortunes of Mulayam Singh Yadav and his now marginalized Samajwadi Party.The middle of July saw the overhaul of the two largest national parties, each with an eye on Uttar Pradesh. The Congress has inducted key leaders from the upper caste and religious minorities into important positions in its working committee. Mayavati may also have noted the absence of any Dalit from UP in the Congress line-up. The Bharatiya Janata Party has replaced the outspoken backward class leader, Vinay Katiyar, as state party president with a Brahmin  Kesri Tripathi. But shifts in the energy and sugar policy may turn out to be more important. The former has been well publicized. Reliance Energy has entered into an agreement to set up a 3,750 MW gas-fired power plant at Charkhi Dadri  a stones throw away from Delhi. Once the plant is commissioned, it would be a key player in the northern grid. It would certainly be a supplier to the parts of Delhi where Reliance is the distributor. The capitals residents are aware of a marked difference in billing cycles since power distribution was privatized by the first Sheila Dikshit government. Yet the key lay in the entry of private players into power production. While the Delhi government had problems locating land and finalizing the deal, UP took the lead.What is significant is that the huge north Indian state, with a population base larger than that of Pakistan, has not commissioned any major power plant since 1989. No party, once in office, has been able to alter the power situation. Without a steady growth in power production, UP would be left behind by more dynamic neighbours like Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan.While the Reliance group is the subject of much study and reportage, the transformation in Mulayam Yadav since his return to office is more striking. After all, the former wrestler cut his political teeth as a close associate of Charan Singh, an inveterate foe of big business, and a farmers champion. By contrast, the swearing-in ceremony of Mulayam Yadav in 2003 had Anil Ambani and Parameshwar Godrej as invitees. Soon after, the new incumbent was flown to Sahara city at Lucknows outskirts in a helicopter, and in an interview to an in-house channel, talked of the struggles of the youth, workers and farmers. But last year, he had to face a different challenge. The question has been to show that he can modernize the state by drawing in private capital. So, even though he travelled to New Delhi to ask for a new Rs 18,000 crore special package for his state, his actions show he is looking elsewhere. Since the Mathura refinery in the Seventies and the Indo Gulf fertilizers in the Eighties, the state has had little to show by way of major investment outside the western districts that are part of the National capital region. Mulayam Yadav hails from western UP, but he is the weakest here. The sugar industry policy on the anvil falls in place only in connection with this region. A new policy on investments in sugar mills gives new investors an edge over older ones and an opening they have lacked for a long time. The state government is willing to offer substantial incentives to an investor who rakes in Rs 400 crore into the sector and starts production by end of March, 2007.There is a host of ways in which this suits the present dispensation in Lucknow. Most of the new plants planned are in the west. Further, the farmers will have a greater choice of sugar mills. The new investors will eat into the base of the older sugar mills, mostly members of the Indian Sugar Mills Association. These could include old established houses such as the Birlas and the Shrirams. One larger outcome would be that the Bajaj Hindustan Lever group would become the number one sugar refiner in the country. What is critical is that an old socialist leader and Lohiaite is now learning to play off different industrial interests against one another in a bid to revive his states economy. Much of the publicity on UP focuses on Amar Singhs ties with the Sahara group. The page three presses take up the theme of Amitabh Bachchan as brand ambassador. But the real story taking shape is a different one.For decades, the socialists in north India have practised a distinct kind of politics based on class envy. The most successful among them is Laloo Prasad Yadav, associated with cultural empowerment and assertion but not with any serious development agenda. Uttar Pradesh is better placed than Bihar in terms of its geography and its more developed western half. But it is significant that unlike his previous stints in office in 1989-91 and 1993-95, Mulayam Yadavs focus is on economics. Caste and community divides have not vanished but the interplay with economics is producing a different situation in public life. If the present projects achieve their full potential, the state would be the powerhouse of the northern grid and the largest centre of sugar-refining in the country. This would dramatically change its standing in the new economic order. But there are still problems for the chief minister and his flock. The inclusion of Raja Bhaiya in the cabinet is a sign that in the countryside, the ministry belongs to one of the dominant landed communities. A little-noticed fact of the recent general election was that Mayavatis vote share has topped the 25 per cent mark and there is growing evidence of bonhomie between her and the Congress. But the political economy of UP is undergoing a change. For the first time since the N.D. Tiwari ministry in the Eighties, there is a concerted push to enable, if not create, the artifices of economic growth. Given the states critical role in the Indian polity, this is a development that will be keenly watched. Mulayam Yadav is attempting a transition from being a troublemaker to a full-fledged member of a new governing elite, equally at ease with the captains of industry as he is with his own mass base. Where that takes him in national politics will be a question for the future. But what this shows us is that even for a Lohiaite socialist, political economy is the key to politics.

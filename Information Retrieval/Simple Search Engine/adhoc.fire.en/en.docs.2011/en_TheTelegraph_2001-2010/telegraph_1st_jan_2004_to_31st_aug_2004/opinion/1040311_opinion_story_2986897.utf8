The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 							 																						PROXY WAR WITH WILLOW Gouri Chatterjee																					Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani may well be sincere in not wanting the Togadias of his world to mess up his third yatra. Communal tensions do not go well with a Shining India. But then, he had never openly wished the communal tensions that accompanied his earlier two yatras.																					This time the situation is even more fraught, what with India and Pakistan once again eyeball to eyeball and that too on a cricket field next door. Nothing could be more flammable, especially with the media building up the imminent Indo-Pak series as another dharmyuddh. Just take a closer look at the newspapers. 																					The media was bitterly blamed for raising the pitch to an excessively feverish level after the last such encounter in the subcontinent, specifically in Calcutta in 1999, ended in disaster. The media treated the whole exercise as war by another means and inflamed passions, the argument ran. 																					Maybe. But to expect the media to behave responsibly in this emotionally-charged atmosphere is to expect dogs to not run after moving cars. Its not just that readers and viewers lap up such jingoistic coverage, it is also the only subject that finds journalists as united as their readers and/or viewers, i.e. fully behind our boys. 																					So the deputy PM, a cricket enthusiast himself, may have more than one reason for wishing Ganguly and his team well. Or, maybe not? Only a communal conflagration will earn him and his yatra some media attention amidst the coming cricket madness.																					Times are a-changing																					A rose by any other name etc. is all very well but there has to be a limit to everything. Try this out. Go to one of the bigger newspaper vendors, say the ones who spread their wares at Esplanade or on Old Court House Street, and ask for a Navbharat Times. You will promptly get the same old Hindi paper but with a masthead in English that reads The Times of India. Nowhere is the name Navbharat Times even mentioned.																					Only in Delhi is Navbharat Times still called what it is. Elsewhere, it is this strange concoction of a Hindi paper with an English name.																					The objective, apparently, is to tot up more readers for The Times of India, thanks to the way newspaper readership surveys are conducted. Surveyors usually show various mastheads to representative groups of readers to ask whether they have read any of them. So now, even Navbharat Times readers will count as readers of The Times of India.																					What this means for Navbharat Times is anybodys guess. The Times bosses have never shown any partiality towards their mother tongue. Rather, one of the earliest decisions of the current dispensation was to close down Hindi magazines like Dharmyug. It may soon be the turn of one of the most respected newspapers in Hindi.																					Ironically, the Hindi media, not just television but newspapers too, have grown phenomenally in recent years. One newspaper, 8 states, 279 districts, 24 editions  that is Dainik Jagran at its launch in Ludhiana in January. A more recent entrant, Dainik Bhaskar, has 20 editions in 8 states and is starting its 21st this month. 																					But unlike in films, in newspapers numbers do not necessarily translate into big money. Advertising revenue is still skewed heavily in favour of the English language and the Times bosses are never shy to acknowledge the bottom line comes uppermost with them.																					Easier prey																					More young Americans get their news, especially presidential campaign news, from The Daily Show, a satirical news programme on television (shown in India on CNN). In India, in contrast, the attempts to inject humour into news television have been one big flop. Aaj Tak tried with Jaaved Jaffrey, Zee with Jaspal Bhatti and NDTV with puppets in Double Take (Gustaki Maaf in Hindi). The latter is the best of the lot but thats not saying much. One reason for the success of The Daily Show is said to be its skewering of news people, not just newsmakers. The Indian programmes havent dared do that. Its so much easier to take on the politicians.

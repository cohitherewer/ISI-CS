		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 							 																						FULFILLING THE BASIC NEEDS						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the assessment at the 27th session of the Committee on World Food Security, 2001				 	 Food for all																														The document begins with a review of the current situation with respect to the food and nutrition status in the developing world. The change in the prevalence and numbers of undernourished, by sub-region, since 1979-81 is briefly discussed, after which these are compared for the two most recent three-year periods, that is 1995-97 and 1996-98. These latter two periods reflect the situation at the time of, and just after, the World Food Summit.																														Except for two sub-regions, there was an increase in absolute numbers in seven sub-regions, and surges in prevalence as well as absolute numbers of those suffering from chronic hunger in three sub-regions. Data for other indicators of food consumption, health and nutrition status for the same two periods show that there was a serious deterioration in the diversity of the diet  an indicator closely associated with food security status  in a number of sub-Saharan African countries. This is also the only region where life expectancy appeared to be declining, despite a slight improvement in the under-five mortality rate...																														Of the 35 countries facing food emergencies this year, 16 are found in sub-Saharan Africa. But the gravest problems persist in Afghanistan, Mongolia and Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, due to drought and extremely cold and harsh winters in all three countries, compounded by continuing civil strife in Afghanistan.																														Next, future prospects for availability, access and safety of food are commented upon, with the latest available information. Overall, indications are of a somewhat tighter supply situation for the cereal-importing countries during the 2000-01 season, tempered by further stock drawdowns and relatively weak market prices. The outlook for economic growth is generally good, with per capita income growth in the developing regions expected to grow by between 6 per cent in the East Asia region and 1.5 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. Whether these rates can still be achieved in the face of global economic retrenchment, and how such growth is distributed will be critical to reducing undernourishment... 																														In the final part, two special issues are discussed. First, the reason for discarding the ratio of end-of-season cereal stocks to global utilization is explained. Finally, a proposal for the balance of the core indicators to be used in future assessment documents is recommended for adoption by the Committee.																														Food and nutrition: 																														A. Current Situation: The Committee, at its twenty-sixth session in September 2000, endorsed a list of seven indicators for global monitoring of food security outcomes in the domain of food consumption, health and nutrition statuses. Available information on each developing country/country in transition is reported...for six indicators  percentage of population undernourished, average per person dietary energy supply; share of cereals, roots and tubers in total DES; life expectancy at birth; under five mortality; and proportion of children under five that are underweight. Data on percentage of adults with body mass index is scant and therefore not presented... 																														Over the seventeen-year period from 1979-81 to the immediate post WFS period (1996-98) there has been an 11 percentage point decline in the prevalence of undernourishment in the developing world. This is a significant reduction by any standard. In terms of sub-regions, the best performers were East Asia, southeast Asia, South Asia, South America, North Africa and West Africa. The Caribbean, Near East, Central Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa actually experienced an increase in the prevalence of undernourishment. The other sub-regions had little or no change in their levels. TO BE CONCLUDED

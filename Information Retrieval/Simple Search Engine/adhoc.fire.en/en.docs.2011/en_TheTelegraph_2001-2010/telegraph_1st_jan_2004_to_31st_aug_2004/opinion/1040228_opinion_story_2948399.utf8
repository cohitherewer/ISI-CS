		 Saturday, February 28, 2004 							 																						SCARECROWS AND FUNDOOSThis above all / Khushwant Singh				 	 Keki Daruwalla: gentle humour																					The first thing that occurred to me as I picked up The Scarecrow and the Ghost by Keki Daruwalla was to find an Indian word for scarecrow. I could not think of one; I asked members of my family. No one had a clue. I asked Abid Saeed Khan who owns a large mango orchard. It took him some time to come out with a tentative bijka; but I will ring you up when I get back to Bugrasi. I asked my cook and bearer, both Garhwalis. Pootna, they said. I rang up Sheela Reddy, whose father has a vineyard near Hyderabad. She did not know of its Telugu equivalent. She asked her Malayali husband, Madhavan, who is an eminent novelist. Nokkukithi, which means poke the beholders eye, he said. Lastly, my secretary Lachhmandass rang me up from his house to say that he had been able to lay hands on the Chambers English-Hindi dictionary which has words for Scarecrow: bijookha, kak bhigora, howaa, joojoo, aati durbal vyakti. It all went to show how little most of us know of what must be the commonest sight in the countryside.																					Back now to Daruwallas poems on the scarecrow. They were written for children; they can be read with equal profit by adults. They introduce the reader to the world of nature; they are witty and they have a few well-aimed digs at fundoos. And beautifully illustrated by Pulak Biswas. The tone is set by the opening stanza:In morning dew the Scarecrow combs his hair.In morning light the Scarecrow looks so spry,																					you know hes had a good nights sleep																					Hes now in a fitter state to spyon shouting monkeys and the porcupine.																					He gets to see everything all the time,																					except his shadow which lazes about																					till the evening snuffs the fellow out.Whether he sees the seasons come and go																					is a thing you and I may never know.																					But busy as he is he keeps an eye																					on all the bird traffic passing by.																					Daruwalla gives a gentle prod in the ribs to the ex-prime minister, Vishwanath Pratap Singh:																					The night owl was so bitter																					his tongue developed a blister.He took his complaint against the herons																					to the Prime Minister.																					But V.P. Singh,though he spoke the same langauge,																					and was a man of the masses																					returned the application,																					saying I only deal																					with the backward classes.																					This one is aimed at Balasaheb Thackery, fhrer of the Shiv Sena:																					When the women saw the trishulresting on the Scarecrows shoulder next morning																					they started worshipping him.																					The childless among them																					even asked him for a boon.																					(boons are always easy to ask for 																					and difficult to bestow).																					And the Shiv Sainiks thought																					he was an avatar of Shiva;																					(they have been confusing Shiva																					with Shivaji for quite some time).																					And when the kar sewaks saw the trident																					they said to the Scarecrow																					Chalo, let us go to Ayodhya!																					Weddings are for other people																					Self-imposed sanyas has its advantages as well as its short-comings. The greatest advantage is that you opt out of the rat-race and become a spectator, a tamashbeen, you keep yourself informed through newspapers and the TV, and say to yourself: Thank god, I am out of all this! On the other hand, you also miss out on events which can bring cheer to your lonely life. 																					A long time ago I stopped going to wedding receptions as I found them a waste of precious time. People stopped inviting me, thinking I had developed a swollen head and should be left to stew in my own juice. I got an invitation to the wedding of my brothers grandson: mehendi, sangeet, anand karaj, doli  every event accompanied by music, band-baaja, singing, bhangra dancing and feasting. I get on very well with my brother and did not want to offend him. Of the many events, I chose to make a brief appearance at the sangeet-cum-luncheon which happened to be in my nieces garden, in the block of flats across the road. Sounds of music and the beat of bhangra drums came wafting across from 11 am. I hobbled over at 3 pm. The singing and dancing were over, the guests were tucking into tandoori delicacies and downing glasses of Champagne and French wines. 																					It was a happy scene with ladies dressed in their fineries, boys dressed as princes and little girls in bridal attire running round. A singer and her party of dancers sat quietly on a platform. She had been singing and her male ensemble dancing for over two hours and were taking a well-deserved break. I was escorted to a chair. The singer sensed that being the oldest, I was some kind of patriarch of the family and came to me. What should I sing for you? she asked and offered a choice of a dozen folk songs. The only one that came to my mind was an old time favourite Saaree raat teyra taknee-a-rah, taarian ton pucch chaan vey  all night I await your coming; ask the stars, my beloved moon.																					This was Neelam Sharma of Chandigarh who has made a name for herself as a singer of folk songs and as a play-back singer  a TV and radio star. She has become a much-sought-after entertainer at social functions. She has a modest school education. She is self-taught and sings in many Indian languages. She is the mother of two children, but looks a lot younger than her years. She is easy on the eye; her melodious voice rang in my ears for many days and nights.																					Pulling a fast one																					Banta Singh was the biggest braggart in the town, and very shrewd and quickwitted where his interests were concerned. He once boasted that he was the best swordsman in the world, and offered to compete against all comers for a sizeable purse. The people in the town, fed-up of Banta Singhs boasts, decided to teach him a lesson by asking two of the most famous swordsmen in Punjab to test Banta Singhs claim on an appointed day, in the presence of a large audience. The first swordsman drew his sword. It flashed in the light, and the audience gasped to see a fly, neatly sliced in half, lying on the plate. The second swordsmans sword flashed in arcs. The audience was wonderstruck to see a fly, neatly quartered, lying on the plate.																					Banta Singhs sword now swept a dazzling arc. And the fly flew away!																					The great Banta Singh missed, roared the audience!																					My friends retorted Banta Singh, bowing to the audience, while pocketing the large purse.																					The fly  he lives. Yes, he does not know it yet, but he will never father another fly!																					(Contributed by Sukhjit Singh, Kapurthala)

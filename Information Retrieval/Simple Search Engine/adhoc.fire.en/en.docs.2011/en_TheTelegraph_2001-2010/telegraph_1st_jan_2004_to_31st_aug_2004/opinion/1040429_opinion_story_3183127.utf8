The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 							 																						A FRACTURED POLITYTwenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan				 	 Star attraction																														Atal Bihari Vajpayee has made a last ditch appeal to the electorate not to vote for the unprincipled smaller parties. Vote for us or vote for the Congress but do not vote for these siddhantheen (unprincipled) smaller parties, he said. And yet Vajpayee says there are no major differences between him and Mulayam Singh Yadavs essentially caste-based Samajwadi Party. The Bharatiya Janata Party president, M. Venkaiah Naidu, says no one would be untouchable in the post-poll scenario  principles be damned. It would be too simple to say that this contradiction betrays an overwhelming desire for power. 																														Indian politics itself has come unhinged over time and once again a fractured mandate seems imminent. No one party can form a government at the Centre without the help of these smaller unprincipled parties. 																														The Indian polity throws up fractured verdicts not because there are too many unprincipled caste, and ethnicity-based parties but because the Indian electorate itself is fractured as never before. There is no unifying political principle that is bigger than the issues that divide it today. 																														Political promises that used to rally people together  Garibi hatao; Roti, kapra aur makaan and so on  have proved to be vacuous. Other emotional issues that tend to unite communities, thankfully, do not take place regularly or cannot be engineered on a large scale (for example, a war or a stand-off with Pakistan; officially sponsored communal rioting, as in Gujarat). The Babri Masjid, after all, can only be demolished once. The days of the big-ticket parties based on democracy, socialism and now, it would seem, even on Hindutva, are on the wane. The BJP, which used to collect bricks for constructing a temple, has been pushed to promise the construction of roads, water-supply schemes and electricity plants by the people. In this general election, the BJP has had to abandon its Hindutva ideology for the promise of a shining India. Even that does not seem to have worked.The fact is that these big issue parties have neither delivered on their ideological promise nor on development.																														The electorate has also changed over time. The middle class has expanded, spreading even outside the big metros. The middle class does not care who rules and is willing to accept mutual accommodation from the rulers. They are happy when the prices of computers, air-conditioners and luxury cars go down and the sensex goes up.																														With the growth of consumerism and the access to international goods for the middle and the richer classes, political apathy among them has also increased. They could not care a damn if diesel, kerosene, medicine, bicycle and rickshaw prices go up. These goods are either not in their consumption basket or are marginal to it. 																														These dominant consumer classes want a de-ideologization of politics. They want a consensus on all issues that concern their ability to earn and to consume. This might explain why, in this election campaign, ideology has not been important for parties like the BJP and the Congress. Neither India Shining nor the Atal factor, nor even Congress ka haath sabke saath (Congress stands for everyone) constitute an ideological statement. 																														In the rest of the country  mofussil, rural and peripheral India  people have been left out of the great celebration of consumerism. They lack the ability to partake of the feast. These are the people who have taken shelter behind politics based on identity and ethnicity. The northern Indian states, the most fractured along caste lines, have seen little development. The land reforms in these states were limited to the intermediate castes getting some land. The most-backward castes got nothing. Although north Indians lived under the delusion of running the country through leaders from the region  Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Govind Ballabh Pant, Lal Bahadur Shastri  these leaders did little for them. 																														Even today, the educational opportunities for the masses are limited in the north Indian countryside and children are increasingly getting cut off from the English language, the gateway to modern science and technology. Students graduating from the mofussil schools and colleges of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand are today largely unemployable. It is not surprising, therefore, that narrow identities have taken over, and where that has not happened, these youngsters have joined the Maoist movement. The Naxalite movement is dead in Naxalbari but a Peoples War goes on in Bihar and Jharkhand.																														This war is for a legitimate share of development. The big-issue political parties of yore have not delivered, so people are looking for other ways. If they cant snatch their due, they will seek it through blackmailing the Centre or through patronage networks spawned by identity and ethnicity-based parties. There is no other choice before the marginalized. 																														A divided electorate has meant the necessity of coalition governments at the Centre. In the days of the big-ticket parties, the party structure allowed for mediation between the different interest groups within the party. Once these interest groups moved out and formed themselves into political entities based on caste or regionalism, such mediation necessarily had to be done after the elections through coalitions for governance. 																														The process of coalition government formation at New Delhi legitimized the identity-based parties both in the states and at the Centre. Their presence at the Centre allowed them to leverage their interests. So while the Telugu Desam Party did not formally join the last Vajpayee government, N. Chandrababu Naidu became notorious for squeezing whatever benefits he could from the Centre and whenever he could do so. Every political crisis was an opportunity for him to blackmail the Centre. 																														It is this reason  the desire to leverage their presence at the Centre  which compels the regional parties in power in Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu or even in Indias North-east to strike deals with the coalition at New Delhi. Nothing else explains the toppling of a majority government in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the sole opposition legislator managed to do this overnight by forging close links with the Centre. 																														However, this is not the only way identity and ethnicity-based parties have tried for a share of the development cake. Job reservation in the state apparatus is also crucial to this. The implementation of the Mandal Commission report was an attempt to correct the imbalance. 																														It is this asymmetry that is often reflected in the identity- and ethnicity-based parties indulging in large-scale tinkering with the civil services and the police once they assume power. What else are Mayavati, Laloo Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav as chief ministers famous for but ordering the large-scale transfers of district magistrates, superintendents of police or even police inspectors whom they find inconvenient? This is also why Chandrababu Naidu could not see beyond appointing his Kamma caste-brothers to every nominated post in the state and at the Centre. 																														The fractures in the electorate will not heal in the short run. Only a less uneven development can do that. The first indications of that healing will come when the parties of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Laloo Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan and Mayavati start breaking up and coalescing into centrist parties different from the Congress and the BJP, which, in their present form, have become irrelevant to this process.

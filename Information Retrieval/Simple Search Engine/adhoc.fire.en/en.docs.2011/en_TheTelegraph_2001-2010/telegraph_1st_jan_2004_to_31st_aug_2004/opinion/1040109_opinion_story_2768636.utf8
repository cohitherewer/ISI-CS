The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 09, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Cruelty killed the cats				 																																																				Sir  Communists everywhere have a miserable animal rights record whether it is jackals in Salt Lake or civet cats in China (China culls civet cats to check Sars spread, Jan 7). The civet cats in China are facing the fate of the students in Tiananmen Square, even though the former never asked for democracy. Once they culled urban domestic dogs and ate them up. Sparrows, in the early days of the revolution, met with the same fate. Whatever the reason for doing so, the annihilation of a species raises some very serious moral and ethical issues. And the logic of culling civet cats remains dubious since no international laboratory of repute has yet confirmed the connection between SARS and civet cats. Civet cats are not farm animals, so they cannot be treated at par with the cattle in the West who are regularly culled for suspected mad cow infection. But even if a connection had been established, wiser and more humane ways must be found to tackle the situation. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Tapan Pal, Batanagar
				 																Tentative peace				 																																																				Sir  It was sad to see Atal Bihari Vajpayee aiding Pervez Musharrafs latest publicity campaign in Islamabad. His cover blown by Irans revelation that Pakistan supplied it with contraband nuclear technologies, Musharraf had found himself cornered with the fear of George W. Bush finally pulling the plug on him. The insincere calls for love and peace with India were meant to whitewash his record. As soon as the heat is off him, Musharraf will be sending terrorists to Kashmir. What will Vajpayee do then?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dev Gupta, via email

				 																																																				Sir  One fails to understand how a solution to the Jammu and Kashmir problem can be reached especially in view of the fact that a large part of it is under the occupation of China? Jammu and Kashmir is the core issue of any India-Pakistan peace talks. No amount of golf our ambassador plays with Pervez Musharraf or goodwill visits by K.P. Nayar and company, will diffuse Indo-Pak tension unless a solution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue is found first. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manish Chowdhary, Moscow 

				 																																																				Sir  Sweet talk will not work. India should adopt an aggressive attitude in the talks with Pakistan. It should remind that country that Kashmir became a part of India as per the British parliaments resolution that rulers of territories would decide on the merger with India or Pakistan. Kashmir became part of India when Maharaja Hari Singh opted for India just as Sindh became part of Pakistan because the nawab signed in favour of that country, despite the sizeable Hindu population there. Also the United Nations resolution on Kashmir states that first the Pakistani forces have to vacate Pak-occupied-Kashmir before any plebiscite is held.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The resumption of air links, the ongoing dialogue process on the sidelines of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation summit have raised hopes that peace will not be held hostage to the terrorists violence. The people of Kashmir have lived under the shadow of the gun for so long that their yearning for normalcy is understandable. But the peace process between India and Pakistan cannot be a one-way affair. India needs to be on its guard because the recent militant attack in Jammu proves Pakistans doublespeak on the issue. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The restoration of rail, road and air links between India and Pakistan is all very well, but security arrangements should also be tightened to leave no scope for the militants to do mischief. Also, transport links should not be cut off after sporadic acts of terror by militant groups as it leads to bitterness among ordinary people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manzar Imam, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  It is almost impossible to think of peace between India and Pakistan. How can one expect Pakistan to put Kashmir on the backburner? It will never let go of something that has become its life blood. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Kumar Vidhyarthi, Muzaffar Nagar

				 																																																				Sir  What led to the renewed efforts for peace is not important, the success of the peace process is. The declaration of a ceasefire along the line of control was a significant initiative on Pakistans part, but will it stand in the long run? Experience shows that it makes sense to look beyond the obvious in Pakistans moves.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The United Nations has always underestimated Pakistans nuclear potential. Pakistan may be a tiny country but it is completely unreliable, as far as nuclear weapons is concerned. Even while imposing sanctions, the UN was careful to treat Pakistan and India as equals. The same is the attitude of the United States of America. This attitude of the US has not only nurtured Pakistans malice for India, but it has also hampered Indo-US ties. The US should realize that if an army general could topple the democratically-elected prime minister, there is no reason why the same shouldnt happen to Pervez Musharraf. The UN should inspect Pakistans nuclear establishments and seize warheads, if any, thereby helping to establish a terror-free south Asia.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hemant Krishna V., Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf could hardly have solved a fifty-year problem in a fifty-minute meeting. But if Vajpayee does manage to pull off the impossible, he will take his place beside M.K. Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and the other great sons of India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In the euphoria over history being made, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf should realize that personal ego can easily sabotage their best intentions. 				 																																																				Vajpayee is much more confident now then he was at the Agra summit, given the BJP victory in the three states, and this helped him in the negotiations with Pakistan. But it is sad that between the Agra and Islamabad summits, so many more lives were lost in Jammu and Kashmir, and crores spent in mobilizing troops along the borders. 				 																																																				For the people of India, the stakes of Indo-Pak peace settlements are higher than the petty rivalries and ego clashes in the BJP camp. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai

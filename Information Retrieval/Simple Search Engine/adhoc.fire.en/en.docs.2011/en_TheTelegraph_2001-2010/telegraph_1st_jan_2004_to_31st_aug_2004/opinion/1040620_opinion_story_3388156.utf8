The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 20, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Catch them young				 																																																				Sir  J. Jayalalithaas no-fail policy in primary schools may bring cheer to students, but not educationists (Jaya scraps junior school exams, June 18). After all, Amma has not suggested an alternative criterion for assessment. The measure was ostensibly introduced to stem drop-out rates. But doing away with exams will not bring students back to schools, nor will bicycles to girls. For the main problems  poverty, poor quality of primary education and so on  remain unresolved. Jayalalithaas sops have to do with her politics. But has she forgotten that these kids are too young to vote?

				 																Better pill				 																																																				Sir  I strongly resent the dubbing of homoeopathic and ayurvedic practitioners as quacks (Quack quack goes Bengal, June 7th). Were it not for the untiring efforts of the practitioners of alternative medicine, the people of rural and semi-urban areas in India would have been worse off than now. 				 																																																				A quack is someone who promises cure in exchange of money, and ends up damaging the health of the patient. In my belief, the practitioners of allopathic medicine, who mostly cater to the urban population, match this definition better. They experiment with patients health, often prescribe them unnecessary drugs to promote products of medicine companies. Most of these doctors try for postings in urban and metropolitan areas so that they can earn more money through private practice and their lucrative association with pharmaceutical companies. Allopaths admit that chronic diseases cannot be cured with medicine, which is probably why patients so commonly die of multi-organ failure. The real cause behind such deaths is often the lack of proper treatment.				 																																																				Compare this record with that of homoeopaths, who, according to a survey of the governments health department, are doing a good job in rural areas. In fact, the government should encourage professionally qualified homoeopaths and ayurveds to treat more patients. Indias eminent presidents and prime ministers have often opted for homoeopathic and ayurvedic medicine. There is no reason to suspect that the ordinary people will not gain from such treatment. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jagannath Chatterjee, Bhubaneswar 

				 																																																				Sir  The decision of the West Bengal government to summon homoeopathic and ayurvedic practitioners to take care of the primary health centres of the state is not a bad idea. This may not be regarded as a desirable option in other states or in other countries, but in West Bengal, where the rural poor can only afford cheap medication, switching to homoeopathy or ayurveda is more practical than depending on expensive allopathy. Given that one may find the HIV virus in blood used for transfusion or chalk dust in capsules, homoeopathic medicines provide a healthy option to patients since they have a lower chance of being contaminated. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The ratio of physicians  of both homoeopathic and allopathic streams of medicine  to the vast population of the country is alarming. Most poor and middle class families are deprived of basic medical care because of the absurd preference for good doctors, their exorbitant fees, the cost of medicines and the phenomenal charges of the pathological tests prescribed. Homoeopathys increasing popularity can be traced to its low-cost factor. Moreover, homoeopaths treating a substantial number in different parts of the country, are trained people who have obtained medical certificates or diplomas from private institutions. They have also gathered sufficient experience in their line of treatment. Today, the government itself is encouraging private institutions to conduct different courses of medical studies. By awarding them a registered medical practitioner certificate through the Homoeopathic Medical Council, the government can give due recognition to their knowledge and experience. That will also help them serve the people better as patients would then have more confidence in their abilities. Yours faithfully, 
Shyamal K. Dutta, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 							 																						JOBS COMFORT																														All elected governments live in fear of unemployment and the social unrest that is an inevitable function of an increasing number of jobless people. Jobs for the boys is thus always a vote-winning slogan. The new legislation by the senate of the United States of America that makes illegal outsourcing or offshoring of federal government work by contractors is a clear case of an attempt to protect the US job market. The obvious targets are the Indian information technology sector and business process outsourcing industries. There is the growing fear within the US that cheap labour available outside the US is posing a threat to US workers. Similar protests and allegations have been heard from Great Britain and Europe. The British government and the European Union may not be averse to emulating the precedent created by the US senate. It is true that both in the US and in Europe, there is more private IT business compared to government business, but the latter cannot be written off as being entirely inconsequential. It is reasonable to surmise that over time, the governments share in the total IT business will be on the rise. Thus, the US senate legislation is an ill omen with even more dangerous portents. Another way of looking at the issue is to see it as only a temporary blip caused by the exigencies of an election year.																														The Indian IT industries cannot afford to ignore the threat. It is true, as Nasscom has pointed out, that there is no immediate threat to India since only two per cent of exports by Indian IT companies to the US goes to work for the federal government. But the situation cannot be seen by the industry and the government only in terms of the immediate and the short term. The challenge posed by the legislation has to be met at a deeper and a more long-term level. One way out is for Indian IT companies, cash-rich as they are, to acquire US and European companies. The Indian IT sector is strong enough now to act rather than merely react. Such companies will be able to reduce cost and thus offer cheaper prices. They will be able to do this even without offshoring. US companies will thus be given a run for their money.																														The contradictions embedded in the position of the US need to be debated. The US cannot be an advocate of free trade and globalization, and at the same time be a protectionist as far as its labour market is concerned. Globalization does not refer only to the globalization of capital but also to that of labour. Indeed, the two are related since the global sway of capital can only be complete if it can produce where the cost of production is cheapest. Capital cannot be restricted by national or electoral considerations. As economists belonging to the Chicago school have argued, the very term, unemployment, is irrelevant in an economy run by the market. There are jobs for everybody if everybody is willing to accept jobs at a wage that the market is willing to offer. If the US believes in globalization, it should not perceive any threats, but an election year engenders populism. This is as true for India as for the US.

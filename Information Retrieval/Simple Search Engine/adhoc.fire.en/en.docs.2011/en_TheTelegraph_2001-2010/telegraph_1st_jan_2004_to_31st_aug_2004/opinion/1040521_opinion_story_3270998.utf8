The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 21, 2004 							 																						IN SHOCK																														Ms J. Jayalalithaa is losing her touch. She is quite well-known for changing her tune when it suits her  her quick turnabout from withdrawing support to the Bharatiya Janata Party to full-throated support for it being just one example  and for going unblinkingly back on her word, but she always did it with imperturbable brazenness. That brazenness seems a little dented. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams non-performance in the Lok Sabha elections has obviously shaken her, and she has gone for an indiscriminate withdrawal of all her policies in Tamil Nadu barely a week after the results. While her retreat on some fronts may augur well, the hurried decision to arrange for free electricity to farmers, for example, suggests an unashamed bid to ensure votes in the coming assembly elections that says little for thought or planning behind any of her moves, past or present. The ban on conversions was a policy that cost her dear this time. She had originally implemented it to show how close she was growing to the BJP. The anti-conversion law was not only contrary to a constitutional right, for practical purposes it alienated her from both the Christians and the Dalits, especially since the latter felt that their only weapon to fight the oppressive casteism in the state was being taken away from them. The withdrawal of this, as well as of the cases of defamation and privilege against organs of the media, are positive moves in every way. Freedom of speech is as fundamental a right as the right to practise the religion of choice. The chief minister has also lifted the income ceiling on beneficiaries under the public distribution scheme, extended the free bus pass to students, and withdrawn the cases against government employees who had gone on strike.																														In appearing to be consistent in her rollbacks, Ms Jayalalithaa has exposed an alarming degree of inconsistency. Free power for farmers and hut-dwellers means a heavy subsidy, and this cannot be done thoughtlessly, if it can be done at all. Nothing has been said about water shortage. The free pardon to government employees erases important issues of responsibility and rights and the specifics of the episode that led to the charges against them, while it pushes out of sight the debate over the legitimacy of the Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act. Similarly, discussions about the use and abuse of the Prevention of Terrorism Act have been glossed over, in spite of the urgency of the Vaiko question. For Ms Jayalalithaa, thinking is unimportant, all that is necessary is to hold on to power.

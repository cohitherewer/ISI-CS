The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A dogs life				 																																																				 Sir  The Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve seems to have become the fiefdom of some members of the Valmik Thapar clan (Bonfire party in tiger hub, Feb 9). How else does one explain the party in the fringes of the sanctuary? Jaisal Singh, however, does not surprise, related though he is to the noted tiger conservationist. Despite the best efforts of animal activists and the medias attempts to create public awareness, the average urban Indian, much like Singh, remains blissfully unaware of the plight of our environment and its species. Disturbing animals in the zoo, watching them perform in circus and street shows or running over street dogs and cats are common occurrences. Our love for animals are limited to caring for pets and organizing coffee table discussions. The decision to free Singh on bail also highlights the gaping holes in our laws. In addition, it proves that sporting a famous connection, however distant, is the surest way to redeem a sin in India.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Amit Basu, Calcutta
				 																Guilt complex				 																																																				Sir  Pervez Musharraf has mastered the art of converting adversity to advantage (Pervez pardons scientist, Feb 6). Pakistans nuclear power has always been known as an Islamic bomb, which clearly meant that it was intended to benefit Islamic countries. Thus there is no reason to disbelieve that Iran and Libya were supplied with nuclear technology with the consent of the Pakistan government. If North Korea received the same benefit, it was in exchange of missile technology. So much for Pakistans commitment to nuclear nonproliferation.				 																																																				It goes without saying that the persecution and pardon of Abdul Qadeer Khan was a sham. Khan could not have lifted a finger without the knowledge of the Pakistani intelligence agencies given that he was under constant surveillance because of his position. But a scapegoat had to be found to escape possible American sanctions on Pakistan and Musharraf found a convenient one in Khan. The pardon followed because the case could not have been allowed to drag to court where the nuclear scientist could have spilled the beans. So a solution was found. Khan was made to acknowledge his guilt and a pardon granted in a hurry without a murmur of protest from a nation which still believes him to be its hero. Kudos to Musharraf. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir The people of Pakistan, and the whole world, are intelligent enough to understand how the United States of America has sensationalized the Abdul Qadeer Khan episode (Sleuths in race to shut nuke supermarket, Feb 7). The clandestine nuclear exchange operation could not have gone on without the complicity of the earlier US administration. Attempts to sell nuclear technology for profit have been openly reported by world media. So the current revelations are hardly startling. Pakistanis will have nothing but sympathy for Khan for having to shoulder the full responsibility of this fiasco, although many others played an equally important role.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  The public apology and reprieve given to Abdul Qadeer Khan makes it seem that the scientist is the only player involved in the transfer of nuclear technology outside Pakistan. It is common sense that the matter cannot be as simple as that. Had it been so, Pakistan would have allowed the United Nations to inspect its installations or handed over documents for its perusal. But Pervez Musharraf has not only declined to do so, he has even insisted on Pakistans rights to secrecy given its sovereign status. Pakistan will thus continue to remain a danger to the world.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Kumar Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar

				 																																																				Sir  Although Pervez Musharrafs decision to restrict foreign interference in the internal affairs of his country on the grounds of sovereignty is correct, the general should remember that powerful individuals like him and Abdul Qadeer Khan also need to be more responsible.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aiyushman Dutta, Guwahati

				 																																																				Sir  Despite the evidence, the US will continue to overlook Pervez Musharrafs involvement in nuclear proliferation. The US has earlier overlooked its own intelligence on the issue of missile proliferation. It had also closed its eyes to Pakistans covert support to the taliban. The Pakistan president will be pardoned as it is in the USs own interests to keep the general and his country happy. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The Pakistan president, Pervez Musharraf, acted justly. Abdul Qadeer Khan is a national hero. Although he has been found guilty, a trial or conviction would not have been possible because the population would have turned mutinous against Musharraf. Even if one were to believe that Khan is singularly responsible for the transfer of nuclear technology to foreign nations, Musharraf, as the president of the country cannot escape responsibility for the fiasco only because the transactions took place prior to his coming to office. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																Justice undone				 																																																				Sir  In its attempts to empower women, the judiciary often misses the obvious (Kumble wife wins daughter custody battle, Feb 1). The custody of the little girl, Aaruni, has been given to the mother without a thought for the sentiments of the child. Her legal custody has been given to Anil Kumbles wife, Chethana, simply because she happens to be her biological mother. But the father has taken care of her for the time the mother set up her new home and family. If the educational performance of the child is anything to go by, he has performed his duties well.				 																																																				The judiciary thinks girls of a particular age require maternal care. Does this mean that paternal care is dispensable and disposable? The ruling sets a very bad precedent as it will encourage women to be promiscuous, and mothers irresponsible.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

				 																																																				Sir After performing well against the mighty Australians, Anil Kumble has fought the court battle for his wife as valiantly. A true sportsman both on the field and out of it.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

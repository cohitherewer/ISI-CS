		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 							 																						NOT BY GUNS ALONE																														Winning the peoples confidence can be more difficult for a government than winning a battle against rebels. That seems to have been the problem for successive governments in Nepal in their battles against the Maoists. If the people suffered enormous losses and hardships because of the Maoist rebellion, they had little faith in the governments sincerity to tackle the problems that help the rebels dubious cause. King Gyanendras seven-point programme to address the peoples grievances and thereby wean them away from the Maoists influence is, therefore, a step that was long overdue. It is an admission of the fact that guns alone may not win the battle. The kings package promises peace and security, national unity, a corruption-free administration and a popular government elected through fair elections. It should be cause for hope in a country that desperately needs all these, and more, to escape chaos and anarchy. But it is up to the kings men in the government to implement the package of promises. And the peoples experience with promises by past governments has not been particularly happy. In its 13-year tryst with multi-party democracy, Nepal has seen the collapse of nearly as many governments, all of which made promises and failed to keep them. But King Gyanendras package has a significance unmatched by any previous official pronouncements. It is almost a blueprint for rescuing Nepal from its present confusion. The future of not only the countrys political process, but also its peace and security, may largely depend on it. 																														Implementing the kings programme will both supplement and give credence to the governments battle against the Maoists. It is no secret that many people joined the rebels fold not out of love for their ideology but because of their despair and desperation with a corrupt and unfair system. But that does not reduce in any way the importance of weeding out the Maoist challenge. The visit of the Nepalese crown prince, Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev, to India could be a signal of the anxiety shared by both countries about the Maoist threat. New Delhi and Kathmandu have much to gain by joining hands in this fight because the Nepalese rebels have links with Indian groups, and also regularly take shelter in India. The arrest of a senior leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) at Chennai airport recently underscored this problem once again. Other Maoist leaders from Nepal have been held in West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. However, there seems to be a hiatus between the two countries over some sensitive issues, particularly the role of some other countries, in Nepals internal affairs. It is not uncommon for neighbours to have differing perceptions on bilateral or regional issues. But the Maoist menace should be a common concern.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 09, 2004 							 																						TRULY RURAL																								Populism, like old habits, dies hard. That perhaps explains why Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went one step forward and two steps back on his proposal to levy some rural taxes. His new approaches to policy-making and governance make the retreat look particularly illogical. The case for the rural taxes made ample economic sense. He wanted the panchayats to impose the taxes on villagers using panchayat land for tending their livestock. The simple argument was that the local government, as the panchayats are at the village level, needed funds to deliver its services to the people. The old system and its votaries insisted that the funds would perennially come from the rural development agencies in New Delhi or Calcutta. This absurd system ignored the fact that the Union or the state government raised its own funds for rural schemes by taxing people who had nothing to do with these or the panchayats services. On the contrary, the villagers who got the benefits of the panchayati raj paid nothing to earn them. The chief ministers new policies suggested that he had seen through the bad logic of the socialist baggage and was determined to get rid of it. The taxes which his government allowed the panchayats to impose  for motor vehicles using village roads or for the common shed for village livestock, for example  were steps in the right direction that helped the rural bodies to raise their own revenue. In fact, proper decentralization of power demands that the panchayats themselves, rather than Writers Buildings, decide on the rural taxes.																								The problem is that political parties habitually see panchayats not so much as the local government as bases for the politics of power. Mr Bhattacharjees own party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has long led the way in this. The Trinamool Congress leader, Ms Mamata Banerjee, and the leaders of the CPI(M)s partners in the Left Front who oppose the rural taxes, do so for the sake of the same populist politics that the Marxists themselves had played out to retain their rural vote-bank. The coming Lok Sabha elections have clearly spurred all of them into returning to vote-bank politics. Apart from the Centres directives on panchayat finances, basic economic arguments leave Mr Bhattacharjee with few options other than going ahead with the taxes. Obviously, the taxation has to take into account the individual villagers ability to pay. But the sooner he succeeds in persuading the parties and panchayats that the days of free meals are truly over, the better for the villagers economic prospects. By withholding the taxes, he has surrendered to bad politics and worse economic logic.

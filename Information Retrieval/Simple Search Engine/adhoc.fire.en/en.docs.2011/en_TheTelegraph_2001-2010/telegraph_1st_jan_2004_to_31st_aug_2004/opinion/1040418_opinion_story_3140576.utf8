 							 - Naidus courtship of World Bank is now his curseChief minister Chandrababu Naidu may have placed Andhra Pradesh on the world map. But his re-election is threatened by that old spectre: Telengana separatism. Sarmila Bose reports from the state Rise and Fall: Activists burn an effigy of Chandrababu Naidu in protest against the hike in power tariffs in the state (AFP)																														The self-styled CEO of Andhra Pradesh had just finished his phone out programme telecast live daily in which dozens of unsuspecting citizens find themselves accosted by their chief minister at 7.30 in the morning to discuss issues and their duties in a democracy. As we met face to face I extended my hand automatically. Chandrababu Naidu spoke courteously, but did not accept my proffered hand.																														You fool, said my friends when I told them about this seeming rebuff, in an otherwise impressive performance both on his live television show and in an informal exchange with journalists afterwards. This is Andhra Pradesh, not America. You expected the man to hold a womans hand in public, that too with cameras rolling?																														At the private interview the next day, therefore, I was going to stick to a demure namaskar, but this time, Naidu himself extended his hand for a cordial handshake. Much relieved, I wondered to what extent the dissonance between Naidu, the 21st-century leader with a global vision, and the realities of his state might prove to be his undoing. 																														For the man who has redefined political leadership in India in terms of governance and modernity, and single-handedly catapulted his state from relative obscurity in India to the world map, finds himself seriously threatened by some very old-style politics  sentimental Telengana separatism spiced with a liberal dose of reckless populism.																														Separatism is offered by K. Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), former legislator of the Telugu Desam party (TDP) and Naidus close associate for 17 years, who recently quit to form the Telengana Rashtriya Samiti (TRS). Having done very well in local elections, he has allied with the Congress to put up a united front against the TDP. The Congress is happily promising free power, though Sonia Gandhi failed to mention either Telengana or free power in her joint public meetings with the TRS!																														In Jedcherla village in Telengana, the field was aflame with the shocking pink banners of the TRS. As KCR laid into Naidu in the name of Telengana, every inch of space was taken. A large proportion of the audience was women, many adorned in Lambada tribal ornaments. Outside the field people were standing on roofs, sitting on trees. The applause was spontaneous and every hand went up in support for Telengana.																														The emotional appeal of Telengana nationalism cuts across party lines and has a long and painful history. The creation of Andhra Pradesh spearheaded the reorganisation of Indian states along linguistic lines. The emotion then was Telugu nationalism. When Nehru was unwilling to create linguistic states, Potti Sriramulu fasted to death in 1952 for the Telugu cause. 																														His death sparked widespread unrest and Nehru made an about-turn and announced the creation of Andhra. Telugu-speaking areas of the Madras Presidency  coastal Andhra and Rayalseema  were separated to form a new state in 1953. In 1956, the Telugu area of Hyderabad state  Telengana  was added to form the present Andhra Pradesh.																														Yet, by the late Sixties, Telengana separatism was vocal and violent. M. Chenna Reddy left the Congress to form the Telengana Praja Samiti. But all the major parties opposed the idea of a separate Telengana at that time. After a while Chenna Reddy returned to the Congress. Telengana Rashtriya Samiti chief K. chandrasekhar rao How times have changed. T. Gangadhar, Congress leader in Miryalguda in Telengana said that he had supported vishal Andhra as a young man, but now his dil yearned for a separate state. Abdus Salam, busily selling filtered water to the parched population of Nalgonda, had also joined the Telengana movement in his youth  though he seemed unsure about the TRS. In Karimnagar, where KCR is standing for Lok Sabha, an establishment insider said that the youth were all for Telengana. Rural people were moved simply by the sentiment of Telengana. This election, he said, would be no cake-walk for Naidu.																														Still, Chandrababu Naidu seems unflappable. Tall, well-built and immaculately dressed in a beige shirt and pressed trousers, he literally towered above party members and assorted visitors. Few politicians around the world would be able to handle a daily live telecast with random phone-calls to constituents with the ease, confidence and sense of humour of the CEO of Andhra Pradesh. He just never lost his cool.																														He changed into a bright yellow shirt  TDP party colours  for the days campaign. His face was leaner than photographs suggest, and the slightly intense gaze of his public appearance now seemed gentler. I asked how his politics of governance and modernity could ever win against populist nationalistic emotion. 																														Emotion, sentiment  these are temporary phenomena, he replied calmly. Ultimately people will apply their judgment and choose with wisdom. Ironically, the Telugu Desam too came riding an emotional and chauvinistic wave when it was launched by his father-in-law, .T. Rama Rao, to counter the Congress more than two decades ago.																														Naidu did not discount the sentiment for Telengana, admitting that there was a problem created by politicians who were telling people that if they got a separate state it would solve all their problems. But he thought the infighting in TRS and Congress and the character of some of their leaders had reduced their appeal.																														I had asked TRS leader KCR if he thought the creation of Andhra Pradesh along linguistic lines was a mistake. It was not just a mistake, KCR replied, it was a historical blunder. He cited the disparity between Telengana and the two other regions of the state, at the time of the merger to the present day. Would this not be solved through good governance? 																														The very mention of governance set KCR off on a tirade on the Naidu government  of which he had been a senior member till denied a ministry. He listed the states woes: no water, no rural work, farmers committing suicide, Naxalites on the rampage. 																														But why use the weapon of emotion against the argument for governance? I dont think that the development of Telengana can be realised without a separate state, said Rao.																														Naidu dismisses KCRs charge with a wry smile, He was with us for 17 years, during which time he did not think that the creation of Andhra Pradesh was a mistake. In Siddipet, where KCR is standing for the Assembly in addition to the Lok Sabha at Karimnagar, Dr Shankar Rao, a local physician, was also unsure of the new Telengana movement, despite turning out to be a cousin of the TRS leader. The sentiment was certainly there, he said, but would it bring development? KCR would win Siddipet  but that was because of the work he had done as TDP legislator. Dr Rao wasnt sure how many others he could pull through. Even if he did well, he had candidates in only 42 of the 107 Assembly seats in Telengana. The Congress and Left parties had the rest. There just werent enough seats riding on the one-point programme of a separate state. 																														But even on governance, Naidu is in some trouble. Having started his reform programme to deal with the fiscal mess created by .T. Rama Raos regime, he has widely overshot fiscal deficit targets set during his pioneering state-level partnership with the World Bank. He admitted that the deficit and debt numbers look bad, but argued that he is spending the money to create productive assets, which will yield long-term dividends. 																														Naidus successful courtship of the World Bank has curiously combined two ideologies against him. As the SP of Karimnagar, Praveen Kumar, confirmed, the Naxalites have targeted only the TDP-BJP, as they consider Naidu the number one agent of the World Bank in the state. This has led to the TDP charging that the TRS are hand-in-glove with the extremists. 																														Water scarcity may sink the CEO too. After six years of drought, four of which are considered severe, the state is desperate for water. Still, we have provided drinking water, said Naidu. It is irrigation and cultivation that is in crisis. 																														The chief ministers complaints about the Almatti project in Karnataka, which has allegedly deprived Andhra Pradesh of the Krishnas surplus water, is echoed by all sections of the population. The old agreement on water-sharing expired three years ago. Naidu hoped a new committee would resolve the problem. 																														I asked Naidu why he had failed to wrest a deal in Delhi on water, a major problem for him, when he had won so many other concessions for Andhra Pradesh using his special leverage. Look, this is a sensitive issue, a states issue, he said. Karnataka, the upper-riparian state, is creating a lot of problems, not only with us, but also with Tamil Nadu. It has to be handled appropriately to find a solution. 																														Though Naidus opponents are trying to make the most of the water crisis, none has a credible solution to offer. Well shut off Krishna waters to the rest of the state, threatened KCR at a public meeting. Well stop the water supply to Hyderabad that goes through our area, thundered a Congress leader in Miryalguda. Let Hyderabad get water from the Godavari. 																														Voters were far more sensible. No one blamed the government for the lack of water  not even farmers in Guntur who had been unable to grow anything at all for two years. Everyone pointed to the sky  no rain, no water. I hope there will be rains this year, said Naidu. Unfortunately for him, by then the elections will be over. 																														Curiously, there seems to be no backlash in coastal Andhra, the TDP stronghold, to the new Telengana movement. In Guntur, a coastal Andhra district adjoining Telengana, Rajbhaskar Reddy of Panditiwaripalyam village reflected a widespread mood when he said, It makes no difference whether they stay or go. If the other regions dont care about Telengana separatism, TDP cannot hope to gain additional votes there on the reverse emotion of Telugu solidarity. 																														The separation of Telengana would also undermine Naidus leverage in Delhi and any national ambitions. You are right, he said. With our 42 seats we can negotiate more funds. If we are divided we will lose influence. In reality, losing Telengana would cost him much more than ceding some territory. It would reduce Andhras clout in national politics. 																														While his strong leadership had served his state well, was it not a problem that the states development was so dependent on one person? To make the first impact we need strong leadership, said Naidu, Then we will create a system to take things forward. Other countries have done this  Mahathir in Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore. He added the barb, West Bengal is different. There the party is cadre-based and have not allowed people to think (tapping his forehead). They have not done any development. 																														Naidus role models  Mahathir and Lee Kuan Yew  remained at the helm for decades. Neither had to negotiate a minefield like the Indian electoral system. TDP and Congress both have substantial votes in Andhra Pradesh. In 1999 the TDP scored 3 per cent more in the state elections, but an extra 4 per cent of the BJP ensured a commanding lead. Whether the TRS can deliver the same for the Congress is the great unknown.

		 Sunday, January 11, 2004 							 																						THE FUTURE AS ENGLISH Now that Bengal has found it self-defeating  to deny the history of the British raj, it would be fruitful  to regard the era as a past that opens up to a future space.
 The greatest contribution of  British rule to India was the English language. Dyed-in-the  -wool anti-imperialists and the opponents of English in  West Bengal will strongly disagree with this but their rantings  will not take away from the truth of the statement. The  importance of English does not lie merely in the fact that  it opened up young Bengali minds in the 19th century to  English literature but also that it was India and Bengals  window to the world. A group of misdirected leftists who  overlaid their communism with a strong dose of Bengali jingoism  decided to turn away the state from the benefits of Anglophone  education. The result has been the alienation of a generation  of Bengalis whose knowledge of English is woefully inadequate,  if not entirely absent. This generation is thus lost in  a globalized world in which English is the lingua franca.  They thus have no access to a range of opportunities that  are now on offer to persons with a reasonable facility and  familiarity with the English language. The Left Front government  under Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is now doing a 180-degree  turn and reintroducing English in class one. This is perhaps  a backhanded acknowledgment on Mr Bhattacharjees part that  British rule had at least one positive impact on the cultural  life of India and Bengal.																								Bengal was the first to experience the impact of British rule, both in its destructive and its constructive aspects. It was in Calcutta that the British experiment with Anglophone education began and it was here that it took root. Some of the great achievements of the 19th century  social reform, the emergence of the novel as a literary form, the standardization of the Bengali language and so on  were products of the rich Indo-British encounter. Even in the second half of the 20th century, a major cultural figure, Satyajit Ray, saw himself as a representative of that same cultural tradition. It was entirely fitting that the last living true Englishman of the fin de sicle was a Bengali, Nirad C. Chaudhuri.																								The names of Ray and Chaudhuri have been deliberately chosen since both of them were educated in conventional Bengali-medium schools where English was taught with great competence from the primary level. As a result, they became equally proficient in both English and Bengali and had their sensibilities moulded by Indian and European culture. They were proud inheritors of two cultures. Most educated Bengalis have aspired to that same inheritance. It should be ironic to the comrades of today that their ideological forefathers could learn about communism because they knew English.																								It is impossible to deny history. It has been tried elsewhere, most notably in Stalins Russia. Such attempts invariably fail. In West Bengal too, the project to deny the history of the British raj has been self-defeating and has to be fielded now on the rebound. Bengals ties with Britain are poised for a rejuvenation. It is time to accept that the raj is more than a relic. It is a past that opens up to a future space.

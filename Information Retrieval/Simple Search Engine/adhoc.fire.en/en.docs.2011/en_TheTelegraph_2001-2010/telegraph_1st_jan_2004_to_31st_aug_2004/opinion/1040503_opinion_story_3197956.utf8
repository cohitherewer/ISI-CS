		 Monday, May 03, 2004 							 																						STATES INTERESTS																														A marriage between royalty and democracy is by definition an incompatible one. Britain is unique in that it has overcome this incompatibility through a system of conventions which are honoured rather than breached. One such convention is the steadfast refusal of lords to vote because they look after the interests of the crown. Indias constitution-makers borrowed from the Westminster model, quite overlooking the fact that Indians, new to democracy, would not have the same respect for conventions as Britons. One result of following the British model was the creation of the upper house in imitation of the House of Lords. However, as independent India was born as a proud republic, the upper house was created to represent the interests of the states. The name Rajya Sabha clearly indicates this. By this move, the founding fathers derived a concept from the constitution of the United States of America where the Senate, with two members from each state and with enormous powers, epitomizes the forces of federalism within the US polity. The upper house in India is elected through a complicated system of proportional representation of the numbers in the legislatures and enjoys no substantial powers. But it can actually veto anything that has been passed in the lower house by the elected representatives of the people.																														The Rajya Sabha is thus fraught with anomalies. One of these has been brought to the notice of the Supreme Court by the eminent journalist, Mr Kuldip Nayyar, himself a former member of the Rajya Sabha. Mr Nayyar has rightly pointed out that political parties are electing persons to the Rajya Sabha who do not actually belong to the state that they are supposed to represent. He challenged the 2003 amendment to the Representation of the People Act which had dispensed with the requirement of domicile for candidates coming up for election to the Rajya Sabha. In other words  and this is the nub of Mr Nayyars contention  the Rajya Sabha is no longer genuinely representing the interests of the states. It has become a convenient avenue for electing persons who cannot win an election to the Lok Sabha. Mr Nayyars views are now being treated as a public interest litigation before the apex court. But the views also offer an opportunity to revisit the very idea of an upper house and the power that it should enjoy. There are good grounds for arguing that the Rajya Sabha, instead of remaining a ceremonial ornament, can be endowed with substantive powers and be made into an institution that really speaks for the states. This might serve to counteract the centralizing tendencies at play within the Indian state.

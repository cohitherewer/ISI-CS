		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 							 																						THERE IS POISON IN OUR BLOOD						DOCUMENT From Compromising Our Children: a WWF-UK Chemicals and Health Campaign Briefing, June 2004 				 	 Death spray																														It has been found that there is a significant relationship between thyroid hormone levels in the blood of grey seal weaned pups and juveniles, and poly-brominated diphenyl ether levels in their blubbers.																														The increasing levels of these chemicals found in humans and wildlife underline the concerns regarding the reported effects on brain function and thyroid hormone action. Studies in Sweden showed that the sum of PBDE concentrations in breast milk increased 57-fold between 1972 and 1997...Reports of work carried out at Lancaster University suggest much higher levels may be found in the United Kingdom...																														Many pesticides have also been associated with effects on brain function and with thyroid disruption. The pesticides which are particularly under the spotlight with regard to neurotoxic effects include the organophosphates, DDT, pyrethroids and paraquat. A study in Mexico has shown startling effects in children believed to be exposed to high levels of pesticides...A range of symptoms was seen, including poor hand and eye coordination, diminished memory, decreased physical stamina and decreased ability to draw a person, which is used as a non-verbal measure of cognitive ability .																														Altered masculine and feminine behaviour: In addition to compromising childrens ability to process information, chemicals may be affecting the developing nervous system in other ways. As well as affecting intelligence, it seems that dioxins and polychlorinate biphenyls are also tampering with the male and female behaviour patterns of children. Such effects might be due to the ability of PCBs and dioxins to disrupt the sex hormones...																														In Europe, researchers studying Dutch children exposed to background levels of pollution found that the effects of prenatal exposure to PCBs were different for boys and girls. In boys, higher prenatal PCB levels were related to less masculinized play, whereas in girls, higher exposure was linked with more masculinized play. On the other hand, higher prenatal dioxin exposure was associated with more feminized play in boys as well as girls...These effects are alarming and warrant more research to verify and understand the full implications.																														BisphenolA is also known to have oestrogen mimicking properties, and as such is a hormone-disrupting chemical. In addition to effects on the uterus in animals, it is reported to cause reduced nursing behaviour, more masculinized play behaviour in females and increased aggression in males, and to abolish the sex differences in open-field behaviour.																														Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Scientists now suspect that man-made chemicals may be contributing to a range of learning disabilities, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADHD manifests itself as several symptoms including problems with paying attention and difficulty in controlling impulsive behaviour. It has been suggested that although many factors are liable to be implicated in causing ADHD, neurotoxic chemicals may also contribute to its incidence. This is particularly worrying because the disorder...is estimated to affect around one in 20 children in the United States of America, and in a significant number of individuals, some symptoms may persist into adolescence and adulthood. 																														The European Commission has registered its concern, and has warned that the occurrence of developmental disabilities, such as learning disabilities, intellectual retardation and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is certainly large enough to constitute a significant public health problem.

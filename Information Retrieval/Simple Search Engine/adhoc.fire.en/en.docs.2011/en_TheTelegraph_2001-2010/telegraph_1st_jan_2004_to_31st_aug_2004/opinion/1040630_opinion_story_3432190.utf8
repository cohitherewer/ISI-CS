The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 							 																						THOU SHALT NOT SEE																														The psychology of censorship is murky. In matters of sex, the pronouncements of the censor board sometimes sound like expressions of a peculiar form of state-sponsored pathology. For makers and watchers of films, this could be an offensive and humiliating experience. It could make adult citizens feel like errant children with dirty minds and ungovernable bodies. The censor board in Calcutta has referred Mr Subrata Sens latest film to the chairman of the board, Mr Anupam Kher. It has found the film detrimental to Bengali culture. The film shows a woman having sex outside marriage. The publicity so far has been suggestive, but quite innocuous, and it has been given out by one of the lead actors that there are two bedroom scenes, but these are arty enough not to cause offence. Bengali culture, and its exquisite refinements of intellect and feeling, are a matter of both pride and anxiety to its custodians, who must have strange and vivid notions of the moral susceptibilities of the adult Bengali. Mr Sens film was going to have an adult rating anyway. But even adults have to be protected from the shaming and corrupting effects of certain forms of sexual misconduct. In such a moral climate, even an adulterous kiss  as in Satyajit Rays Ghare Baire, made in the mid-Eighties  becomes, and remains, a momentous event. (Of comparable import must have been the discovery of a condom in the prayer-hall in Santiniketan.)																														Mr Sen is a newer Bengali  his previous film had flirted with lesbianism. Perhaps the censor board, like the Indian legal system, cannot imagine such a thing as that, and allowed the film to be shown uncut. It is also unfortunate that mature Bengalis have now been forced to defend Mr Sens film  as they all must  even before they have had a chance to find out whether it is aesthetically worth defending at all. Perhaps this might prove to be a good thing, after all, for the director and the producer. But all this apart, censorship remains a mystery to most people. What exactly goes on in the minds and bodies of the censors as they sit in the dark and watch something before they decide that it cannot be shown to other adults like them?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 							 																						ON THE BRINK																														The big picture is very grim. And India, quite at the heart of this grimness, is still trying to look away. The International AIDS Conference at Bangkok has again caught the Union health minister defensively attempting to set his countrys record straight  as if HIV/AIDS is more a matter of pride than of prevention. Richard Gere thinks that India is in the cusp of horrors beyond imagination. But the health secretary insists that things are not yet out of control, and, mindful of Geres spiritual inclinations, advocates a Buddhist middle path. But this absurd point is sharply contradicted by an Indian funds administrator, for whom the epidemic in India appears to be moving relentlessly towards tipping point. This split between the governmental and non-governmental views of the crisis is telling. The new government has emphasized the acceleration of AIDS control in its common minimum programme, and allocated a rather measly Rs 259 crore in its budget for achieving zero-level growth of HIV/AIDS. But this has to come with a clear-sighted understanding, first, of the importance of political leadership in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, and second, of the far-from-simple role of the state in changing the larger social attitudes within which people encounter HIV/AIDS in India.																														The Bangkok conference has revived the condom-use versus abstinence debate over the prevention of HIV/AIDS. With the Bush administration trying to push abstinence  requiring a third of all prevention funds to go to abstinence until marriage programmes  this has become a highly politicized issue. India will have to think this through very clearly. The damaging legacy of sexual prudery bequeathed by Ms Sushma Swaraj has to be negated effectively, before the right kind of awareness can be fostered and sustained. Any programme premised on denial and repression is bound to fail. It is the duty of the state to inform citizens about safer sex, and not to sermonize on monogamy and fidelity. The government must also make up its mind about homosexuality, and stop dilly-dallying over article 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Men in India, as anywhere else in the world, often choose to have sex with other men. Anal sex between men is a high-risk activity, and some of these men also have sex with, or are married to, women. These are important facts in the Indian AIDS epidemiology, and decriminalizing homosexuality is a crucial step towards reckoning with them in a realistic and civilized way. 																														But HIV/AIDS is not just about sex. India cannot afford to forget about intravenous drug-users and infected blood. Here again, criminalizing drug addicts will hardly help. With around 5.1 million people living with HIV in India  the largest number of people infected outside South Africa  a lot of aid is now pouring into the country. The proper management of this money, and ensuring everybodys access to the medical services it makes possible, are what could prevent India from tipping over towards the terrible crisis that now grips sub-Saharan Africa.

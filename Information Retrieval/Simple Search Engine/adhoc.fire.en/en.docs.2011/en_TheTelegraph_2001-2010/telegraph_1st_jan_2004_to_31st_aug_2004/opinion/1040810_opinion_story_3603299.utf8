		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004  RURAL BENGALS PUZZLE 
 - Villages consume very little although they are producing  more  OMKAR GOSWAMI There is a long-standing belief  in West Bengal that agrarian reforms  which began with  Operation Barga in the late Seventies  have raised agricultural  productivity and rural incomes. The political adjunct of  this economic tenet is that so long as agrarian Bengal does  well, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will continue  to sweep the rural constituencies one election after the  other.  That there has been a statistically  significant increase in agricultural productivity between  the Seventies and the Nineties is well established. A recent  example is the work of Abhijit Banerji of the Massachussetts  Institute of Technology and his co-authors. They not only  demonstrate that agricultural productivity in West Bengal  has increased more than in agronomically similar tracts  of land in neighbouring Bangladesh, but also show that the  differential has much to do with agrarian reforms.  Broad macroeconomic evidence also  suggests a steady increase in income from agriculture. In  1993-94, West Bengals GDP from agriculture at constant  prices was Rs 14,816 crore. By 2000-01, it was up to Rs  18,177 crore  an impressive growth of 23 per cent in six  years. These numbers are corroborated by evidence on how  the state has become a cereal and vegetable granary of India.  For instance, in 2001-02, West Bengal accounted for almost  8 per cent of Indias total foodgrain production  something  that would have been impossible to imagine two decades ago. In a milieu of such impressive  growth in agricultural productivity and farm incomes, one  would ordinarily expect an equally remarkable increase in  rural consumption. This is where one gets totally perplexed,  and let me explain why. Every year, the National Sample  Survey conducts extensive field surveys on consumer expenditure  of rural and urban households throughout all states and  Union territories. We, at CERG Advisory, have the entire  data-set from the beginning of reforms up to 2001-02. And  the evidence indicates that rural consumption in West Bengal  ranks among some of the worst-off states in the country. As the graphic shows, rural West  Bengal was not wealthy by any stretch of imagination in  1991: the average consumption of rural households was 5.3  per cent less than the all-India figure. If agricultural  productivity and rural income grew faster in West Bengal  in the Nineties than the national average, then it stands  to reason that rural household consumption in the state  would have been closer to, or higher than, the all-India  mean.  Unfortunately, that is not the  case. As the NSS survey for 2001-02 shows, rural household  consumption in West Bengal was 9.6 per cent worse than the  national average. Thats a significantly poorer performance  than in 1991. Therefore, despite the alleged growth in agricultural  productivity and output, rural households in West Bengal  seem to be relatively worse off than before. The story is similar when rural  consumption is broken down to its constituent elements.  The following is such an account for 2001-02. Consumption of food items as a  whole  households in rural West Bengal were 4.1 per cent  below the national average. Consumption of milk, eggs, meat,  fish, vegetables and fruits (a sign of transition to greater  prosperity)  2.5 per cent below the all-India average. Clothing  10.1 per cent less. Medical expenditure  6.8 per  cent less. For non-food items in the aggregate   20.7 per cent less than the all-India mean. The only silver lining is expenditure  on education. In 2001-02, the average rural family in West  Bengal spent 4.5 per cent more on educating its children  than the all-India mean. However, at less than Rs 83 per  year, that does not translate to much. The NSS evidence suggests a couple  of things that the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee,  might wish to consider. First, it shouldnt be a sign of  consolation that household consumption in interior West  Bengal is marginally higher than rural Andhra Pradesh or  Tamil Nadu. For one, these two southern states, while worse  than West Bengal, have improved their relative position  over the decade. In contrast, West Bengals position has  worsened. For another, it doesnt speak well of a state  that lays claim to agrarian dynamism where its rural households  consume only 4.3 per cent more than the average rural family  in Bihar, 4.6 per cent above Madhya Pradesh and 8.8 per  cent more than that abysmally poor state called Orissa.  Being clustered with the poor is not something to be proud  of. Therefore, it is worth checking  why the growth in agricultural productivity is not translating  to proportionately higher rural consumption expenditure.  It cant be explained away by claiming that West Bengal  enjoys significantly lower prices of goods and services  compared to other states. Clearly, there is a disjunction  somewhere, and it needs to be carefully investigated.  I have a tentative hypothesis.  While Bengal agriculture has certainly done well, the same  cannot be said about the growth of rural, non-agricultural  industries. And since almost half the rural population earn  their livelihood outside agriculture, the increase in agricultural  output hasnt translated to similar overall consumption  growth.  Second, and this is my perennial  theme about West Bengal, the government has to do everything  in its powers to bring in significant private investment  in food processing. It is a shame that a state so blessed  with vegetable and foodgrain cultivation should have so  little investment in rural-based food processing units.  To me, that is investment priority number one. For there  may lie the salvation of rural Bengal.The author is the founder of CERG Advisory, a company specializing in corporate and economic advisory services.

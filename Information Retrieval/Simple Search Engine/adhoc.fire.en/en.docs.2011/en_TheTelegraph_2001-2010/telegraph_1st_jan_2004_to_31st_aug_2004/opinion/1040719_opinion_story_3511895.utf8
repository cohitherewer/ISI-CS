The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 19, 2004 							 																						NO LESSON LEARNT 																														Saraswati English Medium School in Kumbakonam is not the first instance in this country of what adult corruption, greed and callousness can do to children. Yet it happened, because it is the essence of callousness not to bother. An overcrowded school, with the primary section housed under a thatched roof, one narrow staircase, and no fire-fighting equipment while the midday meal is regularly cooked in the downstairs kitchen, was waiting for an accident. It is not enough to ask how the extension into the second block with the thatched roof and the kitchen was permitted, how a school building with one exit could be allowed to exist, how it is that fire-fighting equipment is not mandatory, but also how it was that the licence for the school was renewed this January. But the questions come late for the parents who have lost their children. The suspension of the chief education officer of Thanjavur and of three other officials of the education department, arrests of the owner of the school, his wife and the headmistress are all the right actions  at the wrong time. For these actions to be exemplary, so that children do not die like this again, it will not be enough to pursue the matter till those found culpable are punished, but it will also be necessary to inspect and monitor all the schools in the state, perhaps in every state. This is the real question: are the state education departments going to take on this last task?																														There is another question, as urgent. Who are the people that work in schools? Lessons, punctuality and meals are not the only things that teachers, kitchen staff and watchmen are responsible for, they are accountable for the safety and welfare of the children under their charge. When kitchen staff forget to warn the school of a fire they cannot control  it will still be asked how the fire happened in the first place  and most teachers run away, it is clear that they were unfit for their work. A watchman who shuts one of the two accesses to the single staircase clearly has no qualifications for his job at all. Fire disasters are common in India, and Tamil Nadu has been particularly prone to them in recent times. That is why the death of the children in Kumbakonam is doubly unforgiveable. There is no need to recall fire tragedies in marriage halls or mental hospitals to point to the callousness and ignorance of Indian society. If any lesson had been taken from the terrible fire at the school prize distribution ceremony in Haryana in 1995, in which 400 people died, may be the children of Saraswati English Medium School would have lived.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, February 16, 2004 							 																						UNCIVIL FUSS																														In India the free lunch was never a myth, as all politicians, some bureaucrats, and a great many policemen will declare proudly. The pride is the crucial element: the number of free lunches  or rides, or holidays, or air conditioners, or whatever else  is the exact measure of the power being wielded. Such a measure can only be touted, or if not touted, taken for granted, in a country where there is no notion of scrupulosity about the use of other peoples money, where perquisites, official and unofficial, make up the very warp and woof of existence. So one more incident in the same vein is a mere drop in the ocean of corruption. Poor Mr Rajiv Pratap Rudy, the smart young Union civil aviation minister, did not believe that there was anything wrong in asking the Airports Authority of India to pay for his New Years eve holiday with his family in a five-star hotel in Goa. In many ways, he was more forthright than his predecessors and some of his contemporaries, most of whom like to conceal their high living behind pious spartan facades. The public unknowingly pays for many sins and many pleasures, so Mr Rudy could not have known that everyone would decide to go to town on this one. That he has paid up is an indicator of his obvious embarrassment.																														Mr Rudys timing was wrong. The Bharatiya Janata Party is busy showing off its delight that elections are close. Mr Rudys party has pulled out all the stops to convince the country that India is shining. Although it is not harping too much on its clean image  its batch of scandals makes it too like its rivals for that  there is no doubt that moral superiority is very much a part of the BJPs elevating rhetoric. The Goa mess is a bit of a hiccough, although there is no reason to think that it is a serious one. Riding high on the discovery of a rivals scandal is always a foolish thing to do in India, as the Congress has found repeatedly to its cost. The ethos of political life ensures that such corruption is the rule rather than the exception, no one can begin throwing the stones. Besides, election results have shown in recent times that dishonesty or corruption is not an electoral issue. Other interests are at work in the voting process, that concern efficiency or group advantage rather than personal or party honesty. It is not merely that people no longer expect politicians to be honest, it is simply that they do not expect anybody to be honest, including themselves, because the system encourages ill-gotten gains. It is this inner erosion of social values that must be addressed. Unfortunately, to do that, Indian leaders will have to attend to their own moral hygiene first.

		 Friday, March 12, 2004 							 																						NIGHTINGALE ODE 							 - Voice of a woman				 	 Tradition and modernityA LIFE in music By T.J.S. George, HarperCollins, Rs 495Who am I, a mere Prime Minister, before a Queen of Songs? was how Jawaharlal Nehru addressed the celebrated singer, M.S. Subbulakshmi, on several occasions. The compliment not only reflected the prime ministers elegant facility with words, but also captured the iconic status that M.S. Subbulakshmis life and music had come to embody by the first half of the 20th century. It is the making and unravelling of the MS legend that forms the subject matter of T. Georges book. Using a variety of sources and rare personal interviews, he offers us a compelling and eminently readable account that locates the artist and more importantly, her husband, Sadasivam, in the larger social context of 20th-century Madras.																														Born in a community of traditional practitioners of dance and music, reclaimed by nationalists as a reconstituted subject, sculpted carefully to become the emblem of the countrys artistic and spiritual tradition, the life and labours of the celebrated singer encapsulate both the complexity of the social transformation of the performing arts in modern India and as the construction of an expressive legacy to suit the needs of the modern elite in south India. Sadasivam played a singular role in the process, thereby assuring for his wife an unprecedented place in the countrys cultural landscape. The book is thus as much about him and his concerns as it is about his creation of the MS phenomenon.																														Born in Madurai on September 16, 1916, Subbulakshmi received her early training from her mother, Shanmukavadivu, who by all accounts was an ambitious and discerning mother. Realizing that her youngest daughter was blessed with a naturally gifted voice, she promoted her quite unabashedly in concerts and talent-spotting contests with the result that by the tender age of ten, the child had already cut two discs. By 13, MS was touring and singing at concerts outside Madurai and as far as Ramnad and Travancore, and by 15, she made her appearance in Madras city, accompanying her mother in the Madras Music Academy, which in 1932 was rapidly emerging as the single most important patron of the arts in a new setting. The decision to move into the city had momentous consequences, for it was here that MS chanced to meet the young Congress activist, Sadasivam  an encounter that altered both their lives profoundly. For the young and budding singer, the meeting held promises of a new life experience; for Sadasivam, the meeting inflamed his ambitions of launching her as a star. In fact, the confidence in his protgs potential never flagged, and even if it changed direction and dimension in the coming decades, it was simply the most pressing compulsion that drove his life. The result was the creation of an icon, whose brand of music corresponded closely to the newly-honed sensibilities of the Brahmin elite in Madras city.																														The growing attachment between the young MS and the eccentric Sadasivam, his efforts to promote her as a singing star, and the circumstances in which the couple married were, in themselves, stranger than fiction. The marriage represented a microcosm of the changing social world in South India and particularly of the social transformation that Chennai was undergoing in the wake of major advances in publishing and the burgeoning interest in dramatic productions and film-making. The decision to leave Madurai for Madras to follow up opportunities that Sadasivam promised alienated MS permanently from her family, and things came to such a pass that she was abducted by her family members only to be rescued in true filmi style by actors dressed up as cops. The tie with Madurai was permanently severed and what followed was a brief, but spectacularly successful, tryst with films like Sevasadanam and Shakuntala that demonstrated her singing prowess, if not her histrionic talents.																														However, it was not Sadasivams intentions to confine his nightingale within the cage of commercial cinema. In 1940, he took the momentous decision of marrying her and set out not only to ensure that she fitted into the Brahmin establishment but also to turn her, and her lifestyle and art, into key markers of Brahmin sensibility. This was done through the fashioning of a particular style of devotional music that suited the expressive needs of the Brahmin community in the city. The rendering of Sanskrit hymns that became an integral part of the quotidian listening schedule of middleclass Brahmin homes as well as temples, the projection of a certain concert etiquette and persona that emphasized, above all, the singers subjective absorption with personal devotion, the stress on charity concerts all served to make the singer the ultimate cultural ambassador and a role model for middle-class South Indians in the Fifties and Sixties.																														But where did this leave MS as a singer and a creative artist? It is here that the book slips up, for we have very little sense of how MS thought of her pursuit as an artist, how she interacted with eminent musicians of her time (like Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer), and how she reconciled herself with the construction of a particular brand that her music and her concert-style represented. The MS phenomenon was, after all, one strand in a complex process of transformation that marked the musical tradition in South India as it was reinvented and relocated in a modern context. What gave MS the edge and what gave her mentor the efficacy in orchestrating a social and artistic template are issues that the work does not suggest, much less reveal. The success was to do with the imperatives of cultural nationalism, as it was to do with identity issues for the Brahmin community at an intangible, psychological level.						LAKSHMI SUBRAMANIAN

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 							 																						OVER THE RAINBOW																														Globalization has had many prophets, from Karl Marx to John Lennon, before the Chicago school and the Bretton Woods institutions became the targets of radical wrath. The anti-globalizers who gathered in Mumbai to attend the World Social Forum tend to forget that the effectiveness the forum is dependent on globalization, the globalization of protest. The dream of one world  be it the world of protest, the world of revolution or the world of capital  is practically concomitant with the rise of powerful nation states. Capital, like revolution, cannot become hegemonic in a confined space. This insight comes, of course, from Karl Marx. He wanted the world to be united under the banner of the proletarian revolution for the working class. The current doctrine of globalization sees the unification under the sway of capital. The radical critique of this approach is that social issues get swept under the carpet of free trade and a globalized market. Globalization, the argument runs, is biased in favour of the rich  the rich individuals and the rich countries. Globalization increases discrimination and enhances inequalities. Critics of globalization completely pooh-pooh the notion of the trickle-down effect which will eliminate inequalities. In an ideal world, globalization would, indeed, be concerned with poverty eradication and related social issues. In the absence of that utopia, more and more proponents of globalization are arguing for a balance between the creation of wealth and a more equitable distribution of global resources. Those who attack globalizers reject it altogether and deny that it has beneficial aspects. The fallout is a shadow over reason which sees conspiracy at every corner in the same manner as a previous generation saw reds under beds.																														In the meeting in Mumbai, the point has been made by Ms Aruna Roy, the Magsaysay award winner, that in the contemporary world political parties no longer concern themselves with social issues. Political parties are concerned with state power. Social issues are addressed by non-governmental organizations. The point is important because it indicates a certain fundamental convergence between the critics of globalization and its advocates. Globalization, in so far that it has a political agenda, visualizes a world where there is no state, or a state with a minimalist role. NGOs through their activities are also reducing the space that the state seeks to dominate. Moreover, neither globalizers nor NGOs are upholders of nation states and their boundaries.																														If the real threat to globalization comes from those who have no social conscience, the threat to its critics come from those who think it chic to be protestors. Humankind has dreamt of an ideal and egalitarian world since its fall from innocence in the Garden of Eden. There exists no blueprint for this but what is clear is that the world will not be changed through forms of extremism and self-indulgence. Neither will untrammelled greed make for a better world.0

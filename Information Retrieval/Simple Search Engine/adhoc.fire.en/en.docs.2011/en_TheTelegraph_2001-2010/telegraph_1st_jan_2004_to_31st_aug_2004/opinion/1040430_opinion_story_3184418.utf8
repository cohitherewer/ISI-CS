		 Friday, April 30, 2004 							 																						ON A SLIPPERY SURFACEKashmir 1947: The origins of a dispute By Prem Shankar Jha, Oxford, Rs 395Kashmir remains the bone of contention between India and Pakistan even today. While Indian scholars blame Pakistan for challenging Indias authority in Kashmir, the Pakistanis blame the Congress leadership and Louis Mountbatten for grabbing Kashmir. Prem Shankar Jhas book attempts to reconstruct the chain of events in the days following Partition																														Scholars have portrayed the former maharajah of Kashmir, Hari Singh, as an indecisive, vain man who could not decide whether to join India or Pakistan. Jha shows that this portrait of the maharajah was far from the truth. In fact, it was to Singhs credit that despite the Muslim Leagues promise that it would allow him to continue as constitutional monarch, he decided not to join Pakistan. This was because Singh feared for the future of his non-Muslim subjects  the Hindus in Jammu and Buddhists in Ladakh. He had seen how the League, by fanning communal passions, had destroyed the secular government of the Khan brothers in the North West Frontier Province, leading to the eviction of the Punjabis from the area. 																														But Singhs emissaries to New Delhi were cold shouldered by Jawaharlal Nehru, who argued that Kashmir could merge with India only if Sheikh Abdullah was released from prison and allowed to form the government. For Jha, Nehrus move was not only an expression of his idealism but was also based on realpolitik. Nehru knew the limitations of Indias hold over Kashmir. Abdullahs supporters, the proponents of a secular Kashmiriyat identity, were dominant in the valley, while the League had support in west Kashmir. Hence, Nehru stopped the advance of the Indian army after gaining control over central Kashmir, knowing full well that the populace of west Kashmir could never be controlled peacefully.																														The League, which wanted a separate Muslim-majority state, did not want to lose any part of Kashmir. The Pakistan government too feared that if India gained control over Kashmir, it would allow Delhi to stoke the separatist demands of Pakhtunistan. The British foreign office also worked under the same rationale when it decided to support Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.																														Jhas book is based on painstaking research of official documents. But his portrayal of Nehru as an astute statesman is questionable. For Nehrus going to the United Nations with the Kashmir issue proved to be a disaster for India in the long run.																														Jha defends Nehru by saying that he failed to understand that it was power politics, not morality, which guided the United Nations. He shows how the Indian prime minister was led up the garden path by the wily Mountbatten. But doesnt Nehrus misreading of the UN intentions speaks poorly of his political acumen?						KAUSHIK ROY

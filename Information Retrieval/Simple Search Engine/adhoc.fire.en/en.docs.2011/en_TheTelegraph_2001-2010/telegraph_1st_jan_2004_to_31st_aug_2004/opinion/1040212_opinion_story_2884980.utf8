		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 							 																						FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Vulnerable to infection Towards gender justice and  empowerment: Over the last two decades, responses to  issues related to gender and HIV have been intensified to  address the problem multi-sectorally...Issues such as mother-to-child  transmission, access to treatment, access to more information  and legal rights have been taken up at various levels...While  gender is the underlying issue inevitably addressed by most  of these interventions, a specific analysis of gender-centred  responses is necessary...																														 One area in which limited progress has been made is the violence against women, especially by men. From public beatings and executions (Afghanistan), to trafficking in young women...to domestic violence (in all the countries), women are regularly sexually intimidated and sexually abused. In Bangladesh, as in other countries, male authority over womens sexuality is socially accepted and reflected in violent behaviour within marriage....Violence also is expressed in less direct ways, such as denying women and adolescent girls adequate and appropriate information about reproductive tract infections and sexually transmitted infections, about the female condom, or about risks of HIV infection. 																														The association of commercial sex workers with HIV transmission, without reference to the reasons why women are involved in sex work, contains built-in biases and contributes to further discrimination in providing them with various services. For women and girls from low-income groups, the violence of sexual exploitation is a real or potential outcome of struggling to survive in difficult economic circumstances...The result of inequitable gender relations is higher risk of HIV transmission, for women and men, and countries as a whole...																														The prevention, care and support needs of men and women are different, not just because of their physiology but more importantly in the context of gender roles and relations. Programmes that foster the development of women-controlled prevention technologies is one such example. Providing women with female condoms and microbicides are gender-sensitive efforts which need more encouragement in the region.																														On the other hand, there are also programmes that have recognized the unique vulnerabilities that men are faced with. The Healthy Highways project in India was one such effort to reduce the vulnerability of truck drivers, crew members and their paid sexual partners to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS... 																														A multi sectoral response is the need of the hour...Coercive programmes and policies not only violate individual rights but invariably do not elicit the desired results. There is need to provide greater access for women and girls to productive resources such as education, employment, legal assistance, dispel the culture of silence and shame that surrounds sexuality, and protect girls and boys from adverse effects of gender stereotyping.																														Much of the analysis and description of HIV and women is couched in the language of vulnerability, which is not an operationally useful concept if the reality of womens lives has to be changed. Focussing on those issues that disempower women runs the risk of diverting attention away from those areas of womens lives where they are capable of ordering the world differently... 																														It has been argued that if the conditions of womens lives are to be changed in ways that will make a fundamental difference to the global experience of HIV/AIDS, it would be desirable to learn from policy areas where outcomes are clearly beneficial and apply these to the global response to HIV. The population policy in parts of south Asia has been cited as a good example of this... TO BE CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 27, 2004 							 																						ACID HEALING																														The simplest of ministrations could be fatal in West Bengals hospitals. Mr Premananda Hazra was recovering in Howrah General Hospital from transfusion after severe injuries. He asked the nurse for a glass of water, and was given some acid instead, which he drank and fell seriously ill again. The bad faith  of humanly inconceivable proportions  involved in such an act has rightly been seen as a gross violation of human rights. The state human rights commission has asked the superintendent to file a report within a month. An inquiry committee has been formed, but there has been an attempt to allege that Mr Hazra had deliberately put acid in his drinking water, with the help of cleaning staff, because he wanted to commit suicide. 																														The hellishness of it all has another side to it. That the patients family should be protesting against this, with the help of the SHRC, is entirely admirable. The severity of the action taken against such an offence should be absolute. But the cadre of a political party taking it upon themselves to whip up aggression around such an event only enhances its violation of civilized norms. This hooliganism had been taken to its limits at a Salt Lake hospital, where party cadre arrived in droves, shouting slogans, to avenge the death of a patient, five days earlier, whose uncle happened to be the Trinamool Congress legislator, Mr Jyotipriya Mallick. Mr Mallicks men vandalized the premises and bashed up the chief executive officer in order to get the medical records out. Partisan menace regularly disrupts the running of Bengals government as well as private hospitals. Inhuman callousness and corruption in the hospitals (although not in the Salt Lake incident) and entirely illegal and violent means of expressing grievances are therefore two sides of the same coin. This ensures that every standard of efficiency, accountability, legality and humanity is undermined with impunity in these hospitals.

		 Monday, March 08, 2004 							 																						SEEKING THE RIGHT INFORMATION 															- Document Excerpts from Sexuality, abortion and the media: a review of adolescent concerns by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Fatal ignorance																														Where do adolescents get information on contraception? Various studies and anecdotal data indicate it is usually through the media and from each other. Very few get information from parents or medical professionals. Sex education is still not in the curriculum in a user-friendly way. In the home, schools, and colleges, parents and teachers are shy and reluctant to talk about the subject in a manner that can help young people develop a healthy sexuality. The task then, seems to fall on the media.																														In the urban settlement of Tigri, movies including blue films are one of the sources of information about sexual behaviour...stimulation and arousal. Here, movies not only give adolescents the language to communicate with the opposite sex, but also provide the role models and the situation. Both boys and girls mention specific movie stars  actors that girls admire and talk about and correspondingly the heroines that excite the hearts and minds of young boys... 																														Traditionally, in Hindi movies, censors have discouraged kissing and overtly sexual scenes. But there is a trend towards more sexually explicit films...Boys admitted that they learned about sexual acts from the films. Girls at Tigri also watch blue films. Girls said they had watched parts of the films because their brothers or fathers brought the videos home.																														Boys and girls get their ideas about sex and sexuality from television and films. While some may not have TV, they have access to it. Video cassette recorders are fairly common in the area and the rental shops do a brisk business...																														Although the power of TV and movies is sometimes overestimated, carefully designed information strategies using TV can be constructed to educate young people about safer, healthier sexual relations. (Sodhi, 1998)																														Certainly young people are not learning about sex in schools. Globally, the main focus of sex education in schools is split between sexually transmitted infections and biological facts about reproduction. It changes across generations  younger people are more likely to have learned about STIs than those who are older. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) claim they did not receive sex education in the classroom. Sixty per cent people in India have probably not learned about sex in school. (Global Sex Survey, Durex, 2002)																														In India there is no consensus about when young people should be told about sex and sexuality. When should adolescents have sex? Should they wait till the right person comes along, wait till they marry or what?																														The average age of marriage for girls and young women is 15, and there is consensus in the medical and reproductive health community that it is too young an age for her to carry a pregnancy to term. 																														And, what happens if young women are single and choose to marry, if at all, later? Should they not have sex at all? Would the same be expected of young men? Young women and men are socialized early that women should be virgins and men should have experience.																														The US based Sexuality Information and Education council has developed sex education guidelines, which could be useful in the Indian context. They suggest beginning early, when children are in primary school, and continuing through adolescence. Teachers need to be trained, and programmes should involve the community, parents, administrators, and religious leaders. 																														The curriculum should include information on human development, reproductive anatomy, relationships, personal skills, sexual behaviour and health, and gender roles. (Finger, 2000) TO BE CONCLUDED

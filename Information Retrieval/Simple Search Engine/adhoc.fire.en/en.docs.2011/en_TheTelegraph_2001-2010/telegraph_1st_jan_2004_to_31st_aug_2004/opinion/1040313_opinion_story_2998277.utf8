 Its payback time. New York resident Salman Rushdie found a friend in PEN, the international writers organisation, during his days of exile following the fatwa. Now, the author is in charge of the outfit. Rushdie has been named the president of the PEN American Centre. And while hes happy to put something back in, hes taking his new job seriously, as always. The Satanic Verses author said he aims to focus on concerns within the United States: Weve spent a lot of time highlighting abuses from all over the world, and now I think its appropriate to look at whats going on in this country. We wonder where all the American authors have vanished. Surely they dont need an Indian now to tell the world their dark secrets?  Brinda KaratMarxists of the world, rejoice  you have nothing to lose but your dress-circle audiences. Now that stars joining politics is pass, some of the leading members of the CPI(M) are gingerly stepping into the tinsel world. Brinda Karat, a central committee member and the general secretary of the partys womens front, is essaying a role in a feature film being made by her niece. The film, starring Konkona Sen Sharma, is the story of a young girl who is adopted as a baby after the 1984 anti-Sikh violence and comes back to India to look for her lost family. Karat is Sen Sharmas mother in the film, which also has a small role played by Karats comrade-in-arms, Suhasini Ali. Another party old-timer, Kitty Ramdas, is acting in a film directed by former television-man, Sashi Kumar. Kumars film, too, is set against a backdrop of communal violence. Is cinema the new opiate of the masses? Anoushka ShankarAll her cousins dance. Now Anoushka Shankar does, too. The star sitarist makes her screen debut next month in a cameo appearance in Pamela Rooks Dance Like A Man. The film, based on Mahesh Dattanis eponymous play, has a lot of Bharatnatyam in it. Rooks has put Anoushkas brush with the dance till the age of 12 to good use. Now thats an alternative career. At least, shes not riding her fathers chariot to glory this time. No escape 				 																																	 Run, hide, but you cant escape him. Hes coming to a city near you. Enrique Iglesias, ex-current-ex (!) beau of Anna Kournikova, and self-proclaimed singer, has decided to croon in Mumbai and Bangalore this April. Iglesias will be in India to promote his latest album Seven, which is named after his attempts at music.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Anything but green				 																																																				Sir  Manab Mukherjee, Bengals green minister, is right when he says that administrative initiatives alone will not be enough to deal with plastic pollution unless the attitude of the people changes (Plastic banished from babudom, March 5). But the deeper implications of the statement have clearly escaped him. The attitude of those in the administration needs to change as much as that of the people. Did our administrators and other pen-pushing babus in government offices care for the earlier ban on plastic use? So why blame the people? When no concerted effort is being made to enforce the existing laws, Mukherjees grand show of banning plastic carry bags, cups and containers of a certain size from all state government offices makes little sense. Moreover, why does Mukherjee suffer from the illusion that his selective ban will be able to instil some green sense in a secretariat that believes mowing down trees is the only way to make way for progress?

				 																Lost case				 																																																				Sir  Come election time, politicians in India do not hesitate to throw their morals to the winds. Take the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha and senior Congress leader, Najma Heptullah, for example. While indicating her likely choice of party through her adulation for the prime minister, Heptullah also gave her reason for a possible desertion  humiliation by the Congress president (Sangh sweeter to secular Arif, Feb 25). But there can be no doubt that Heptullah has been given her share by the Congress, under whose aegis she made it to Parliament twice and also came to head innumerable councils and delegations. Instead of rushing to another party, veteran politicians like her should wait and watch and then decide which party could bring them more power and respect.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Kumar Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar

				 																																																				Sir  Najma Heptullah is capable of creating enough trouble for the Congress given that she is a well-known face because of her oratory skills and the office she held. Her fondness for the Bharatiya Janata Party or Atal Bihari Vajpayee is not new. The change in her attitude has been apparent from the way this deputy chairman of the upper house has often treated Congress members of the Rajya Sabha. Rumours of her liaising with the saffron brotherhood now appear to have had some substance in them, after all.				 																																																				If the BJP succeeds in roping in enough minority leaders, it might be able to overwrite its anti-minority image and undercut the Congresss advantage in the minority question. This, coupled with the feel good factor, will deal a further blow to any chance the Congress may have about riding on an anti-incumbency wave. There has already been doubts expressed about Sonia Gandhis ability to keep her flock together. If Heptullah leaves the party, she will have hammered another nail into the Congress coffin. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  In the last quarter of a century, there is nothing Najma Heptullah has done for the country, the party or her own community that merits mention. She has cashed in on her lineage, called her party leader names and discriminated against her own partymen in the Rajya Sabha. Yet on her own, she probably wouldnt even win a municipal election. Having used the Congress card for the past 25 years, it is unethical for her to jump the bandwagon now. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Perhaps there is nothing unusual about filmstars joining politics, but the current influx does surprise. Actors and actresses of yesteryear, who have contributed little to the country, now hog the headlines, getting all the publicity they so sorely missed all these years. As usual, it is again time for the man on the street to get conned.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul 

				 																																																				Sir  The media have been reporting the defection of at least one politician to the BJP or the induction of a celebrity into the party almost everyday. It seems that people are in a hurry to be on the winning side of the game. What is amusing is that quite a few political stalwarts like Digvijay Singh, who are shy of shedding their political identities, have been prodding their relatives to join the BJP. This is, presumably, to keep a working relationship with the party in case it returns to power with a landslide majority. Most politicians in India possess enormous wealth and large business interests that are difficult to protect without political muscle. But the BJP needs to be careful about welcoming these fair-weather birds.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

				 																																																				Sir  Given the state of our political system, the Election Commission and the law courts should have seized the opportunity to once again delineate the minimum criteria for all candidates contesting the Lok Sabha elections. Among other things, the two most important are a minimum educational background and a stipulated age limit. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manu Kumar, via email 

				 																																																				Sir  Bhupen Hazarikas joining the BJP has caused an uproar, and quite unnecessarily (Wrong tune, March 5). The leadership of a country is directly related to the political consciousness of its citizens. The leaders we get are manifestations of our own collective will. A stalwart in his own right, Hazarika has chosen the right medium to effect the much-needed change in Indian society  a political party that occupies the centrestage today, a party that has achieved a number of things and continues to dream. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Denver, US				 																Type face				 																																																				Sir  Why is Koel Mullicks photograph published so frequently in The Telegraph? She was on the February 25 edition, playing cricket on bandh day. Earlier, there was a photograph of her shopping for Christmas. I dont find any reason to give her so much prominence. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The report, SMS split (Feb 16), in Fine print was published again, word for word, two days later in the same column, under the head, Message madness. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Siben Talukdar, Calcutta

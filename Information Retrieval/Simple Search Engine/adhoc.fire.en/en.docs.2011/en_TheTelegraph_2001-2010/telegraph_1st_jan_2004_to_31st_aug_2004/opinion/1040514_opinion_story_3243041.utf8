		 Friday, May 14, 2004 							 																						TERROR CASTS A LONG SHADOW				 	 Direct line of fireThe Afghan War and its Geopolitical Implications for India 
Edited by Salman Haidar, Manohar, Rs 425																					The American invasion of Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, symbolizes two developments in the international arena. One, the rise of the United States of America as the supreme power in a unipolar world. Two, the coming of age of trans-national terrorism. This volume analyzes the impact of the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom on Afghanistans neighbouring countries.																					Salman Haidars introduction fails to locate the essays within a larger framework. He merely gives short paraphrases of the articles. J.N. Dixit, a retired foreign secretary, provides an account of the political events in Afghanistan in the last three decades.																					Kanti Bajpai, in a thought-provoking essay, shows that for Washington, Pakistan is more valuable than India. Both India and Pakistan offered their soil for the US to launch its crusade against the taliban. The US chose Pakistan. This is because, Pakistan offers the shortest route to Afghanistan from an entry point through the Indian Ocean. Also, American military officials are used to working with the Pakistanis. Again the support of Islamic Pakistan helped to legitimize the Western-Christian offensive against the axis of evil centred round the mullahs and masjids. 																					Besides fighting terrorism, the US is also interested in establishing a permanent presence in central Asia with an eye on the areas oil and natural gas resources. Nimmi Kurian writes that at present, the US imports 52 per cent of its petroleum needs. In 2020, the oil imports are expected to rise to 66 per cent. The Persian Gulf region accounts for 18 per cent of the USs oil needs. For strategic purposes, the US is unwilling to depend solely on the Gulf region. After the Gulf region, central Asia is believed to have the largest reserves of oil and natural gas. Most of the oil is in Kazakhstan, while the gas is in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. The US is planning a pipeline from central Asia through Afghanistan and Pakistan, to exploit these reserves.																					Gulshan Dietl asserts that though a pipeline from central Asia to Iran would be most economical, the US does not favour it because in the American strategic paradigm, Iran is a reactionary state. By keeping Iran out of the pipeline politics, the US hopes to contain Teheran. 																					While the American presence in central Asia is expanding, that of Russia is contracting. Hari Vasudevans essay charts the trajectory of Vladimir Putins foreign policy vis--vis Afghanistan in particular, and central Asia, in general. Tapping into Russian sources (a rarity for Indian scholars), Vasudevan shows that superficially, it seems Russia is withdrawing from central Asia. The Americans have negotiated leases with the former Soviet republics in central Asia. This enables Pentagon to station troops and aircraft in the region. 																					Thus far, Putin has not objected to this. He is concentrating on Chechnya and knows that the central Asian game is not worth the candle. In other words, intervening in central Asia might land the US in a financial and political quagmire.																					The study of current affairs runs the risk of being hijacked by retired bureaucrats just as military history has become the sinecure of retired army officials. Barring a few essays by academics like Bajpai and Vasudevan, most of the articles in this book by ex-government officials are bland. In sum, this book is of limited importance for understanding the American intervention in Afghanistan. The New Great Game in central Asia is more about geo-economics than it is about geopolitics. 						KAUSHIK ROY

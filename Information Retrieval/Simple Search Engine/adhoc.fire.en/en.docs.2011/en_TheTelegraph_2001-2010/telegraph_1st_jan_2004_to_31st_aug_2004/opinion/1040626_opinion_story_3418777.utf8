The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 26, 2004  HANGING IN THERE 
His grandfather dispatched 20 people a day. Nata Mullick hasnt pulled off the job in more than a decade. And with a stay order on his latest assignment, Bengals only executioner may just have to hang up his nooseFor a man on the death row, a reprieve  even of a few days  can be the beginning of a lifetime. For the man getting ready to tighten the noose, it can be the end  of his own moment in the sun. So, quite like the President of India, Nata Mullick  Bengals only hangman  is waiting for a message from the home ministry. The execution of Dhananjay Chatterjee  convicted 13 years ago for the murder and rape of a Calcutta teenager  has been temporarily stayed. If the death sentence is commuted, Chatterjee will live to see another day. If, on the other hand, theres a nod from New Delhi, Nata Mullick will be paid Rs 10,000. Nata was really looking forward to some work, after more than a decades dry spell. His last assignment was a twin execution in 1991. But the nature of his work meant that Nata couldnt really express open anguish at not having enough to do. And though he did tell the press recently that there should be two executions a year, Nata has always stressed that he doesnt really like to hang people. The only real punishment for heinous crimes such as murder, rape and bride-burning is death, he has said. But I dont like to hang people I wish they wouldnt do things so bad that they have to be hanged. To the press  which has been following the 84-year-old hangman around ever since it was announced that Chatterjee would be hanged in the early hours of Friday  Nata is good copy. And for Nata, the press is useful  for it knows how to make a fuss. Each time he has carried out an execution in the past  a total of 24 so far  Nata has managed to generate a great deal of excitement. The media has gone to town with his story and photographs. Nata, in turn, has added colour to a story  narrating in detail how a noose is balmed with ghee and bananas. And telling the reporters how his helpers tied up a convicts hands and feet and gagged him before covering his head with a black cap as he performed the more difficult task of tightening the noose around his neck. Nata likes the limelight. But the past week has been particularly hectic for him. The press has been popping up at his doorstep  and sometimes crossing that boundary, uninvited  morning, noon and night.Yeh journalist logon neh hamara jina haraam kar diya, he says with mock anger. They have been landing up even before I get out of bed, photographing me brushing my teeth and rinsing out my mouth. How will such pictures benefit anyone? Will it do the country any good? Still, the press does him some good, for it is said that Nata never forgets to demand his pound of flesh  a bottle of English whisky  for his part in the show. Urban folklore has it that the bigger the bottle, the more eloquent Nata waxes. But Nata  a third-generation hangman  loves to talk about his past. His grandfather, Mishrilal, migrated to Calcutta from Bihar in the 19th century, and made his home on a plot of land near Tollygunge, when it was still a jungle. Mishrilal learnt all about execution from a hangman living in the neighbouring dom para.Those were good days for a hangman  with 10 to 20 executions a day. Natas grandfather had been asked to hang Khudiram Bose, but had refused to do so. Natas father, on the other hand, was tricked into hanging Surya Sen, because he was not told the identity of the man about to be executed. Nata was just starting out then, as a boy of 16 or 17, helping his father who ended up conducting 600 hangings in 50 years.Nata still lives on this ancestral property, now part of a slum on K.P. Roy Road. His potbelly, visible from under a thin, white half-sleeved kurta, protrudes from over the top of his dhoti. When the news of the temporary stay on the execution comes in, his whisky-yellow eyes flash with anger behind the thick lenses of his tortoise-shell glasses. If a criminal such as this man goes scot-free, he shouts, brandishing a fist in mid-air, then capital punishment should be abolished. Nata, truly, doesnt have much cause for anger. Because Chatterjees execution was last stayed because of the hangman himself. In June, 1994, Chatterjees hanging couldnt be carried out because Nata had a few demands. He wanted an identity card and his fees to be raised to Rs 10,000 per hanging. This time, too, the government announced the date of the execution only after meeting Natas new demand  that his grandson, Prabhat, be provided with a job.But Natas best-laid plans, like those of mice and men, have gone astray. Dhananjay Chatterjees gain will be Nata Mullicks loss. And his loss, the hangmans gain.

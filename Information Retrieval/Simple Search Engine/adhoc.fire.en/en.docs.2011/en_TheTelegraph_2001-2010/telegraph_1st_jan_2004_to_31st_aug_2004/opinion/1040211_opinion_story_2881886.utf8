		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 							 																						SECRET AGENT																														The recent disclosure about Pakistans nuclear behaviour is likely to further damage the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The growing evidence of Islamabads role in nuclear proliferation will also further erode the countrys credibility in the international community. It has now been established, beyond doubt, that the father of Pakistans nuclear programme, Mr Abdul Qadeer Khan, was directly involved in proliferating nuclear technology to countries like Iran, Libya and North Korea. These are countries that the United States of America and its allies have viewed as rogues and, in fact, Iran and North Korea were described by Mr George W. Bush as being part of an axis of evil. The evidence of Mr Khans complicity has been gathered systematically over the past few months by the US government.																														Detailed evidence included information regarding Mr Khans visits to many of these countries, his meetings with nuclear black-marketeers and even details of financial transactions. The evidence was so over-whelming that Mr Pervez Musharraf had no choice but to confront Mr Khan and his associates. Reports indicate that Mr Khan has accepted full responsibility for the nuclear proliferation. Given the almost legendary status that Mr Khan occupies in Pakistan, it is not surprising that Mr Musharraf has pardoned him. There are, however, several disturbing aspects of the episode that require sustained attention. Most important, it is unlikely that Mr Khan could have proliferated nuclear technology without the knowledge of Pakistans army. As is well known, Pakistans nuclear assets are under the control of the military, and it seems improbable that the nuclear scientist could have acted alone. If indeed Pakistans army was involved, and Mr Khans confession is a way of shifting attention away from the military, it should make the international community even more concerned about Islamabads nuclear weapons. In any case, there are likely to be many apprehensions about the safety and security of Pakistans nuclear programme as a consequence of this episode. Moreover, the cavalier attitude displayed by those in charge of Pakistans nuclear technology is likely to suggest that this is not a state that can be trusted with weapons of mass destruction. And even while the US and its allies may, at present, have geo-strategic reasons to not target Mr Musharraf and the army regime, a long-term international strategy to deal with Pakistans nuclear assets will need to be carefully worked out. 																														India cannot and should not remain a silent spectator to these events. As a first step, concrete bilateral measures to prevent the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons must be quickly worked out. Proposals to set up a nuclear-risk reduction centre in south Asia must be translated into reality. As is obvious, the International Atomic Energy Agency was not able to prevent the transfer of technology to states that had signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Clearly, the time has come to reconstruct the regime, given the realities of contemporary international relations.

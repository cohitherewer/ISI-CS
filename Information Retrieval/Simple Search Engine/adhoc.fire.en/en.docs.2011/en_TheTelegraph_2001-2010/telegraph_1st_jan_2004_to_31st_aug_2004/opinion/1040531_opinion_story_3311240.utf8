The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 31, 2004 							 																						TOGETHER AT LAST																														Karnataka now has a government, and two unusually restive partners may make the states first coalition government quite a memorable one. The Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) were rivals in the polls and still feel uncomfortable together. But not tying up would allow the Bharatiya Janata Party to take over, with a far more willing Janata Dal (United) on its side. But the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) had sticking points from which they would not budge. For a fortnight, leaders in both parties, including Ms Sonia Gandhi and Mr H.D. Deve Gowda, persuaded and cajoled, and the partnership was ultimately founded on a win some, lose some basis. Mr Siddaramaiah of the Janata Dal (S) did accept the deputy chief ministers post, although he had been determined not to be led by a Congress chief minister. But Mr S.M. Krishna had to go, to give place to Mr Dharam Singh, more favoured by the Janata Dal (S) as chief minister. The knife-edge distribution of posts and prestige harks back to the intense confabulations of the past fortnight. The Janata Dal (S) gets the speakers chair and some of the most weighty portfolios: finance, home, revenue, water resources and irrigation. There is no way, it seems, that the party will allow the Congress to get into the big-brother syndrome.																														There are two ways in which this initial tension can be perceived. The hard tussle for positions within the coalition, the intense sense of self-importance of both parties, and the feeling that such a coalition has been forced upon the respective partners only because of the BJP bogey, may not augur too well for the future. Even the inevitable teething troubles may prove too much for the still fragile partnership. At the same time, the two parties have managed, with a little help from friends, to sink their differences and work out a viable governing machine. The Congress, for example, has done quite a lot to accommodate the wishes and preferences of its new partner. Some of the old loyalists of Mr Krishna, accused by the Janata Dal (S) of corruption, have been left out of the government. On the other hand, Mr Siddaramaiah has let himself be persuaded into the deputy chief ministers chair. No doubt there are some very hard places to be crossed. The leaders will have to deal with problems among the party cadre, who have been used to regarding one another as rivals. But if the desire to keep the BJP out remains the common minimum programme, the coalition might actually work.

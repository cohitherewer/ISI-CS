The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 23, 2004 							 																						DONT BE RULED BY EMOTIONS SUSAMA AGARWALAAn acceptable criterion for the death penalty seems to be whether a case is one of the rarest of the rare. Yet today, three such cases immediately jump to our public consciousness: four adivasis are to be hanged for a political murder of an upper caste man; Bapi Sens murderers, who were given life imprisonment instead of capital punishment solely because of their young age, and, of course, Dhananjoy.																					The rape and murder of a young girl is horrific, unforgivable even, but certainly not the rarest of rare cases. Nor is it so heinous that our scholars, who regularly oppose the death penalty, should make an exception here. Rape, child rape, is much more common than ever reported. It is even uncommon for a female raped by an outsider to complain, and reporting is much rarer in the more common phenomenon of rape by close friends or family members. One must also recognize that many girls, often new born, are killed every year. Dhananjoys crime is appalling, yes, but not rare. A young, innocent life was lost 14 years ago. But does it mean that another life should be lost as well? 																					Justice is not a matter of tit for tat. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, that is how society worked in the dark ages. The introduction of a formal legal system, courts, neutral third parties, victim protection and prisoners rights should have brought us forward from the age of lynching and public stonings. One may even hope that today, with so much leftist rhetoric and human rights discussions, we may attempt to put ourselves in a criminals shoes, perhaps even go so far as to see that all of us, even criminals, are victims of poor judgment and circumstance. (This does not imply forgiveness, just a change of perspective.) Instead, we are still willing to take a life for a life.																					Blind rage																					Crimes much more grotesque than Dhananjoys occur regularly. Wives are beaten and raped for years before being killed or driven to death. Politicians employ hoodlums to rape and kill busloads of people. And Im not even considering the planned wars and genocides by various states.																					We must admit that one of the main accomplishments of our complicated, civilized legal system is to attempt to rank the severity of various crimes, and impose a neutrality to the judgment process, an order and rationality to our rage, instead of letting it be ruled by our primal emotions. Yet in Dhananjoys case, the word on the street is Let Dhananjoy hang as a lesson to future rapists and killers. (Alas, it has been proven again and again that the death penalty does not act as a deterrent to crime.) 																					This sentiment distracts us from the real question. Why is justice so rarely served in cases like these? Why are perpetrators so rarely caught and punished so that our anger remains bottled up, so that we are overzealous to punish the few convictions we get? Who bears responsibility for this tragic state of affairs, our leaders or Dhananjoy?																					Nor does this scapegoatism provide relief for the family of the victim. (In this case, they have not offered any statement other than to be left in peace.) At most, this attitude provides an outlet for public rage. But when we have elevated crimes of this sort from crimes against the victim to crimes against the state in our courts, do we not also have a duty to raise our reactions from that of angry neighbours to that of a rational, neutral civil society? Can we impose our personal anger on behalf of all victims, and claim that everyone shares our thirst for revenge? When our thinkers and leaders cry out for blood in the name of all women of the land, I hang my head in shame. They did not ask me. I believe that there is a less vocal minority who stand with me. Speaking only for this rape survivor, I do not want Dhananjoys death. I hope there are others like me who realize that killing our rapists will not, cannot, wipe away our daily struggle.																					If we permit our emotions to take too strong a role in our decisions regarding others lives, how different are we from the killer who murders out of blind rage? And if we are willing to hang such a person, should we not also hang ourselves?

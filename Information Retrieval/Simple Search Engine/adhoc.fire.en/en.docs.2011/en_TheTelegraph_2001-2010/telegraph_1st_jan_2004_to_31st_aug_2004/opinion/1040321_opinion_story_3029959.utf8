The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, March 21, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Spot the real war hero				 																																																				Sir  Strange as it may sound, a former GI is more likely to oppose his countrys war plans around the world than patriotic Americans. So no surprises that John Kerry, a decorated Vietnam war veteran and Democrat candidate against George Bush, has been voting against Bushs various weapons programmes. When it comes to war, a decorated veteran is expected to know a little more than one who left no stone unturned to avoid being drafted for war duty. Americans have had no problems electing Bill Clinton, whose opposition to the Vietnam war was no secret. They are likely to have even less problems with Kerrys opposition to Bushs phoney war.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sankar Roy, Calcutta
				 																Fair play				 																																																				Sir  The media are fond of sensationalizing issues, and the Vrindavan widows is one of them (Widows weeds, March 14). Urbanites will forget Kusum Ansals book, The Widow of Vrindavan, in no time. But the trend that once produced the Vrindavan widows  the preference to marry off daughters to much older men  still exists today. The resultant incompatibility is reflected not only in the couples daily existence  an older man being no match for his much younger wife physically  but also in their later lives. An older husband is likely to die long before his wife. Besides, female life expectancy is higher than male. In India, 1999 figures show life expectancy is 60 years for males and 61 for females. Which means more widows at any time than widowers. 				 																																																				The problem is undoubtedly a reflection of societys inherent gender bias  patriarchys game plan to deprive the bahu from taking part in the more cerebral matters of the household. But times are changing. If a person were now to choose a partner of the same age, both would benefit in the long run. The plus points of such marriages need to be impressed upon Indian males. First, in todays nuclear families, one cannot fall back upon the advice of and experience of the elders. A wife who is of the same age or is older, given her maturity and pragmatism, could become a perfect adviser. Besides, the importance of the camaraderie that develops between partners of the same age cannot be over-emphasized. Sex between same-age partners is fun, not an obligation. Second, the metro-sexual man is not the traditional breadwinner. With a lower sperm count than his forefathers, and a badly designed body with increased risks to killer diseases, he has reasons to feel insecure. An older wife could provide a sense of security to these men. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

				 																																																				Sir  It is at times incomprehensible why such a fuss is be made over Womens Day when we profess equality of the sexes? Why do we give priority to women when we strive for equality? Why not have an International Mens Day as well?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, The straight and narrow (Feb 29), rightly questions the dubious impact of public interest litigations on the functioning of a liberal democratic system. But it is not just people filing PILs without a locus standi who are proving to be disruptive. The judiciary itself sometimes plays a curious role through its creative interpretations of the law of the land. Ever since the apex court demanded a more sensitive judiciary for women, courts in West Bengal have taken the lead in all matters female. Men are being jailed if they break off relationships, even forced to marry women they dont really want. Recently, there was an order for a Hindu marriage in the month of kartik, inauspicious if one goes strictly by Hindu customs. The groom complied just to get out of jail. Yet there are hardly any pronouncements when rulings on bandhs and other disruptive activities by organized groups are violated. Shouldnt there be a sustainable morality? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sandeep Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is a great relief that India has started production of female condoms. But if lower- and middle-class males cannot afford condoms at Rs 5, how can females of the same class afford condoms at Rs 45? Condoms should be made cost-effective.Yours faithfully, 
Madhabi D. Ghosh, Calcutta

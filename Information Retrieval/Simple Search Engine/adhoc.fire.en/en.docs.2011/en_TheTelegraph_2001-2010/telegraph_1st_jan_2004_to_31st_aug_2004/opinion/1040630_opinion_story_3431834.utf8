The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 							 																						TWO TO TANGO																														There is no known temperature at which a diplomatic freeze begins to thaw. Thus it would have been naive to expect a quick breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations in the dialogue between the foreign secretaries of the two countries. But there is enough evidence to suggest that both sides are now committed to move things further along the path to normalcy. The foundation of this dialogue between the two mandarins is, of course, the compromise worked out earlier this year by Mr Pervez Musharraf and Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The new Congress-led government has made no attempts to renege on the deal made by the previous prime minister. There were two aspects to that deal. One, India had agreed to discuss the issue of Jammu and Kashmir seriously and substantively. Thus Pakistans grievance that New Delhi does not address the issue of Jammu and Kashmir seriously would be accommodated. Second, Pakistan would not hold the process of normalization hostage to the resolution of the Kashmir issue. In keeping with this arrangement, the two foreign secretaries, Mr Shashank and Mr Riaz Khokhar, held a detailed exchange of views on Jammu and Kashmir and agreed to continue to sustain the serious dialogue to find a peaceful and negotiated final settlement to the issue. In parallel, the process of trust, confidence and normalization has also been accelerated. As a consequence of this, the consulates at Karachi and Mumbai will be re-opened and apprehended fishermen, in the custody of India and Pakistan, will be released. In addition, steps will be initiated for an early release of civilian prisoners. 																														The two foreign secretaries also approved the recommendations of the committee of experts, which had met earlier this month, and agreed on a variety of nuclear-related risk reduction measures. Finally, the foreign secretaries have agreed that meetings on the remaining subjects of the composite dialogue would take place in July-August this year. This will include talks on resolving disputes over the Siachen glacier, the Sir Creek maritime boundary and the Tulbul navigation project. All this, of course, does not amount to a road map for peace. That will require greater effort and much more compromise. But there seems to be a common understanding in New Delhi and Islamabad on the steps essential to create an atmosphere in which India and Pakistan can, at the very least, behave like normal neighbours. 																														Much in the future, of course, will depend on the situation on the ground, especially in Jammu and Kashmir. The text of the joint statement issued by the foreign secretaries recalls the assurance given by Pakistan that it will not allow territory under its control to be used for perpetuating terrorism against India. However, of late, there has been an escalation of violence in Jammu and Kashmir. It remains to be seen if the progress made during the recent talks can continue if violence increases in the next few weeks. There is, no doubt, however, that the meeting of the foreign secretaries marks a step forward in the bilateral relationship.

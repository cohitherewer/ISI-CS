The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 24, 2004 							 																						OUT OF TUNE																														After the drama comes the return to reality. The abdication of Ms Sonia Gandhi and the subsequent elevation of Mr Manmohan Singh as prime minister had taken Indian politics to ethereal heights far away from the shoddy politics of compromise. The descent to ground level has been swift and not entirely unexpected. Mr Singhs ministry reflects the pulls and pressures of coalition politics. This is par for the course since Mr Singh is the prime minister not of a Congress government but of a Congress-led United Progressive Alliance. What is unexpected and somewhat shocking is the fact that the ministry includes persons against whom there are criminal cases pending. There are at least two persons among the 68 who were sworn in who have actually lost the elections. Mr Singh and Ms Sonia Gandhi will find it difficult to explain these two features to their conscience. Even tortuous logic will not absolve them of making ministers out of men who have been rejected by the electorate. Ministries have been given out as prizes and rewards of loyalty: prizes for Congressmen and rewards for the allies. Old warhorses like Mr Arjun Singh and Mr Natwar Singh have had ministries pinned on their loyal epaulettes, and allies like Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav have been given cabinet berths as rewards for staying loyal to the alliance.																														What is surprising is the complete absence of any new faces and of any discernible direction in the choice of ministers. When the late Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister, he brought in men like Mr Arun Singh who were new but their entry suggested a particular orientation that the new leader wanted to give to governance and to politics. Mr Singhs band of ministers is as bereft of new faces as it is devoid of any direction. The immediate conclusion from the list of ministers is that the old guard of the Congress has returned. This may not be the impression that Mr Singh would have liked to have created at the best of times. He must be aware that he is the maker of the most important turn in Indian politics, which took it away from well-trodden paths and conventional forms of policy formulation. He owes it to himself and to his admirers to again give a new direction to the polity and the economy at this very critical juncture. Unfortunately, his choice of ministers does not quite suggest this. But maybe his policies will augur better.

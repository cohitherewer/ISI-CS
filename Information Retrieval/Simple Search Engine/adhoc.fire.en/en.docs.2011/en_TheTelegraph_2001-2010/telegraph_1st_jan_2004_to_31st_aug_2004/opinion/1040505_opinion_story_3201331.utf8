The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The real Chatterjee				 																																																				Sir  Moushumi Chatterjee, former actress and currently Congress candidate from Calcutta Northeast, may have changed her name (formerly Indira Chatterjee) through an affidavit. Unfortunately, a change in the physical persona cannot be made as easily  take her LOreal lips, 1000-watts smile, venomous tongue (May 3). How exactly does she hope to become a popular leader if she displays her irascibility so openly? The star apparently gets livid at the very sight of rivals hoardings, mouths inanities at party workers if they helpfully try to fix her campaign route and stops at nothing short of threatening with dire consequences a minion who does his duty by holding a flag behind her head. Her appalling behaviour testifies to the fact that she has none of the qualities needed in a mass leader, least of all patience and the willingness to evolve out of her star status. Chatterjees could be a classic example of how one queers ones own pitch in politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Debashish Dutta, Kharagpur
				 																Into Europes bosom				 																																																				Sir  Srinjay Chakravarti has exposed some of the glitches in the workings of the European Union in his article, Strains in the Union (April 19). However, contrary to his apprehensions, the EUs survival is not at stake. The philosophy behind the formation of the EU was to create another global power bloc, next only to the United States of America and much to the discomfort of the latter. The blame for fanning a number of the EUs problems falls on the USs strongest European ally, Britain. It is common knowledge that the greater the EUs internal contradictions, the better for America. 				 																																																				To propel the EU on its well-defined tracks, Germany, France and Spain need to play a more decisive role. It would be worthwhile for Brussels to consider co-opting Russia as an ex-officio EU member.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The report, EU to lift booze bars (April 3), made interesting reading. It has been widely acknowledged that development and trade are facilitated by the free movement of goods. In the increasingly globalized world, restrictions on the movement of goods only hinder the development process. 				 																																																				The report also exposes the hypocrisy of the policy-makers in India, which supposedly abides by the principles of global trade. While the sovereign countries comprising the EU can introduce revolutionary changes in their tax laws to ensure free movement of liquor and thereby reinforce peoples freedom to choose, India seems to continue believing in restrictive and prohibitive legislation. For example, one is not allowed to take liquor outside Goa. India needs to adopt a more liberal trade policy and bring down such restrictions.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  May 1, popularly celebrated as Labour Day, has sounded the death knell for communism. The borders of the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now extend to Russia and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has made no noises about this. Eight out of the ten new partners of the EU are former communist states or former Soviet satellites. They have willingly joined the free market economy, having waited for many years before being admitted to the privileged Union. Russia is itself transforming into a fast-developing market economy. The other bastion of communism, China, has adapted to a market economy at such a pace that it has surpassed all other developing economies in Asia. This brilliant example notwithstanding, there are many communists in India who still prefer to keep their eyes shut to the fast- changing world. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Gone missing				 																																																				Sir  One thing is clear from this years general elections. The voters identity cards have not served their purpose. Innumerable voters have found their names missing from the electoral rolls. This is unfortunate, especially since the people are so earnestly desirous of exercising their franchise and political leaders keep insisting that they do so. Why then are they being deprived of their right to vote?				 																																																				The Election Commission may consider making one database of the voters cards that have already been issued and one for the current electoral rolls. The voters base should ideally be a subset of the latter. This will make updating the voters lists easier by way of comparison between the two. Arrangements should be made to issue identity cards to voters added to the list without delay.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  On April 26, my elderly parents, my wife and I travelled all the way from Mira Road, Thane, to Malad (East) to cast our votes. After reaching the polling booth, we found that our names were not on the list. On enquiry, we were asked to fill a form and submit it along with relevant documents like ration card and voters identity card, so that our names could be included in the next general elections. We have been residing in Mumbai for the past 45 years and it is surprising to see that our names were missing from the voters list despite the requisite proof of identity.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Routine upset				 																																																				Sir  I am appalled at the decision of the Calcutta University to postpone the Part-II examinations scheduled for May 3 to May 25. Do the authorities, both the education department or the state government itself, bother about students? The holiday on May 3 was declared in the middle of the university examinations. No one spared a thought for the students taking the exam. The dates were announced nearly three months before the exams began. And now they are changed merely three days before the exam. Students are expected to grin and bear the inconvenience caused them by politicians and the university authorities. But who gives the latter the right to upset the routine?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Harmanpreet Kaur, Calcutta

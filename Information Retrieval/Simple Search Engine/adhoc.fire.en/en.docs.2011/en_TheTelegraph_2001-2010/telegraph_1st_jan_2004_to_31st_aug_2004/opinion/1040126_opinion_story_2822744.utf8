The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Deeper motives in store				 																																																				Sir  The sudden arousal of George W. Bushs interest in the Indian electoral process appears more funny than intriguing (Sinha ballot tips for Bush, Jan 22). But the news report need not have gone into the speculation that the American president was perhaps reminded of how polling officials were unable to conduct free and fair elections when he became president. It is common knowledge now that Bush, or rather his election managers, had taken special care to rig the polls in Florida, to the extent of eliminating from the electoral rolls the names of well-known Democrat supporters, including large sections of the coloured community in the state. And there is certainly no reason to goad over the fact that Bush suddenly had so much time for our visiting minister. That does not necessarily mean that India now has a very special place in the White House. This attention was glaringly absent when much more vital and well-known issues needed discussion. Politicians like Bush do not make such moves without an agenda at the back of their mind. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, B.R. Ghosh, Calcutta																															
Foul play

				 																																																				Sir  The recent case of alleged rape of a South African delegate at the World Social Forum by a fellow delegate from the same country raises several questions (Rape charge shadow on global meet, Jan 20). From what one gathers from the reports, the womans version is inconsistent. She could well have been trying to blackmail and defame the accused who is a judge by profession. She had volunteered to go and have drinks with the accused late in the night and in his room too. If there had been an attempt to rape her, did she not shout for help? The theory of consensual sex gains more weight from the fact that there appears to have been no resistance on her part, given the absence of scratches or marks of violence. Being the mother of two children does not necessarily immunize one against sexual temptations. If it were rape, she must have realized it only after the act. 				 																																																				Interestingly, she had the condom they had used with her. Further, the lawyer of the accused, C.S. Irani, has revealed that the woman had asked a favour of the judge and was refused help (Rape row, Jan 21). The womans husband has also hurried to forgive her; the public show of magnanimity makes one instantly uncomfortable. Moreover, an activist of Winnie Mandelas stature would not have flown in from South Africa to stand by the judge, had she not been absolutely confident about the judges character and reputation. The Colaba police should not have rashly arrested the judge. 				 																																																				Of course, now that the woman has unconditionally withdrawn all charges, the questions can be laid to rest.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The anti-globalization brigade, consisting mostly of failed revolutionaries, celebrities who are past their prime and a few attention-seekers, is a queer group. They assemble in dubiously funded carnivals ostensibly to protest against globalization, and after a hard days work, have sex in five-star hotel rooms, which is later reported as rape. The manner in which Winnie Mandela flew across half the world to stand by the accused shouldnt be read too much into (Winnie wades in to stand by judge in rape row, Jan 21). She has a criminal record herself. The way in which she dared to comment on a sub-judice matter outside the Colaba police station is tantamount to influencing an independent judiciary. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  In the case of alleged rape of a delegate at the WSF in Mumbai by her fellow delegate, there appears to be a lot of loose ends in the string of accusations made by the woman. For one, she had agreed to go to the judges room late in the night after he invited her for drinks. Isnt it too much of a coincidence that she carried condoms in her bag (which she claimed to do always being an AIDS activist), and offered it to her assaulter too? All these point to consensual sex. It needs to be examined whether she has been framing the judge. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  It is a rather sad state of affairs that unfair discrimination between the sexes still prevails in our country. In an incident where two adults were involved, why did the Mumbai police choose to be harsher on the judge even while the allegations made against him were yet to be proved? It was seen during the first few days that the name of the accused was kept officially confidential. What purpose was that supposed to serve, when he was already being given the rough end of the stick? 				 																																																				What about the fact that the woman went along with the man till a certain amount of foreplay, according to her own admission? Why was it that her version was still thought to be more credible than the mans? However, Winnie Mandelas decision to fly all the way from South Africa to stand by the judge was moving, given her social and political stature.

				 																Carry on corruptly				 																																																				Sir  The election of Ashoke Yadav, who has been absconding for weeks after being booked by the railway police under the National Security Act for the alleged molestation of women members of a Jammu-based cultural troupe on the Himgiri Express on December 23, as the chairman of the Patna Water Board is another glaring instance of the deteriorating law-and-order situation in Bihar (Train tease pockets civic body hot seat, Jan 22). The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, Laloo Prasad Yadav, may have directed the police to take action against him, but Ashoke Yadavs election to the corporation body speaks volumes of the way criminals continue to be patronized in Bihar. Laloo Yadav himself walked away scot-free in the fodder scam, and installed his wife, a political novice, as the puppet chief minister of the state. 				 																																																				The many dubious ways in which government funds are utilized in Bihar is an open secret. The Union government has not been able to do a thing about the rising graph of crime and corruption in the state. It could consider stopping all financial help to the state as the last option. This may be too much to ask now that elections are round the corner. Bihar still stands as the shameless bearer of the examples that should never be allowed in a democracy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  What is wrong with Ashoke Yadavs being elected to the post of the chairman of the Patna Water Board? Going by the rule, no man is guilty till proved so by the courts of law. Besides, such incidents are hardly new to Bihar, from where hardened criminals have been elected to Parliament while serving their prison terms. Ashoke Yadav was apparently absconding all this while, but that did not come in the way of his election. This cannot be possible unless he enjoys political patronage. Existing laws need to be amended to make it mandatory for a candidate to be physically present in order to get elected to any governmental post. The onus has to be on the appointing/selection body to see to it that these rules are not flouted. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

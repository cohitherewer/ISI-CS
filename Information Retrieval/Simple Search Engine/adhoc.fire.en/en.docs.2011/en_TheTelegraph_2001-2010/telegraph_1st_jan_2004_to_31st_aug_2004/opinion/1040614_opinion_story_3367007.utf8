The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 14, 2004 							 																						WRONG TO STARVE																														The very poor have a unique ability to slip through the development net. But they occasionally erupt into the notice of the administration by dying, which is really not a nice thing to do. They may die of known or unknown diseases or by suicide, or may even claim to be dying of the most embarrassing affliction of all  starvation. Five villagers in Amlashole village in the Belpahari block of western Midnapore have thrown the government of West Bengal into a tizzy by dying off over the last three months. This is really the symptom of an acute deprivation that affects the whole area, not just the one village. The indigenous Sabars and Lodhas were never rich, but recent changes in their regular sources of income have denuded them of all resources. The recent incursion of extremist groups such as Peoples War into the area has led to police raids and arrests. So the villagers do not dare go into the forests for timber, the sale of which used to sustain them somewhat. The other source of income for about four months was the kendu leaf. With new restrictions on the small buyers who paid a fairly good sum for a bundle, the villagers have no one to sell the leaves to.																														It must be asked how whole communities could have been left to fend for themselves on such uncertain resources in the first place. There are enough funds from the Centre for the purpose of development and employment generation in these specific areas. Much of these funds lie unspent. Administrators are suddenly puzzled over why people who should be benefiting from programmes like the Antyodaya Yojana are missing from the below-the-poverty-line list. But the victims must be punished for having shown up the dark spots in the administrations blithe unconcern. The officials who were compelled to rush to the village at the chief ministers request for a report have been busy trying to prove that the people died of diseases and not of starvation. They find it impossible to link lack of food to lowered immunity and low vitality, and would rather jump at tuberculosis and dysentery as the immediate causes of death, while rebuking the villagers for not going to the hospital 28 kilometres away. The fact that the men are too weak to work, and can manage a days labour only with three days rest, prompts them to say that even a days load of timber will get them Rs 100. They cannot possibly be starving, they even have goats. While the administration finds out what went wrong, it could embark on two long-term projects. One, to see that development and infrastructure-building are not ad hoc promises, and two, that its officials are trained in humility and humanity.

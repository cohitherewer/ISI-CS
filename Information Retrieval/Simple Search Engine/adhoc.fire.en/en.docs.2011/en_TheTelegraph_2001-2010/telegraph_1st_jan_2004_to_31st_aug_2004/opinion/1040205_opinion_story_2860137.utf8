		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 							 																						DRUG COCKTAILS THAT CURE 															- Document Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Beyond reach																														The way forward, treatment, care and support: The mainstay of efforts to respond to the epidemic in south Asia at the present time consists of public education, voluntary counselling and testing, condom promotion and the treatment of sexually-transmitted infections and opportunistic infections. However, in the absence of a vaccine or a cure for HIV infection, the need for taking up access to treatment as an integral part of the common agenda for human development and HIV prevention is increasingly being recognized. Access to treatment comprises several elements, including the quality and scope of healthcare infrastructure and equipment, the availability of trained medical personnel and...high quality affordable medicines. 																														Significant strides have been made over the last decade in developing a range of anti-retroviral drugs to control HIV infection and this has made an enormous difference to the way HIV/ AIDS is treated. However, the high cost of these drugs makes access to them a major problem in developing countries, including those in the south Asian region. Till December 2002, only 4 per cent of the 1 million people who needed therapy had access to highly active anti-retroviral therapy. The situation is likely to get exacerbated with the coming into effect of the trade related intellectual property rights agreement. This will require countries to legislate strict patent laws, which will only further restrict the availability of drugs and make them more expensive. 																														There is also concern over the effectiveness of ARV treatment without adequate supervision or health infrastructure. Fears of drug resistance fuelled these concerns and led to questions regarding whether ARV treatment was an appropriate policy response in poor countries.																														Effective responses, attempting synergies and building capacities: The UN Declaration of Commitment endorses HIV prevention and care as being at the core of the larger response to the epidemic. This suggests that the detection and treatment of HIV infection and associated opportunistic diseases is important. The increasing availability of ARV drugs also makes it clear that it would be unethical to withhold lifesaving therapy. Most important, the declaration endorses the commitment of countries to come to terms with the issue of providing HIV treatment.																														ARV drugs are not a cure for HIV infection. Improving access to anti-retroviral therapy and care for HIV infection and AIDS needs to be logically integrated with HIV prevention programmes. Offering a mix of voluntary counselling and testing, ART and treatment for opportunistic illnesses will be a stepping stone to expanding prevention efforts, as this larger gamut of services will cover a larger number of those infected and those at risk. 																														Developing countries on the threshold of ART need to ensure that their prevention programmes do not get isolated from care programmes. In some developed countries, the gains of ART in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality is being neutralized by stable or even increasing rates of HIV transmission. 																														In addition, treatment for HIV needs to be utilized as an additional impetus for upgrading sustainable health delivery in toto, rather than being seen as an extra burden on the health budget.																														The WHO commission on Macroeconomics and Health calculated that an outlay of $66 billion per year on healthcare and services in developing countries would save about eight million lives a year by preventing or treating diseases such as HIV/ AIDS, malaria and TB. The resultant economic benefits of sustaining the health of the working population and lowering future medical costs were estimated to touch $ 360 billion a year by 2020. TO BE CONCLUDED

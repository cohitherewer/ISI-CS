		 Monday, May 31, 2004 							 																						OF DISCIPLINE AND PUNISHMENT						DOCUMENT From the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949				 	 Basic rights																														Article 97: Prisoners of war shall not in any case be transferred to penitentiary establishments (prisons, penitentiaries, convict prisons) to undergo disciplinary punishment therein.																														All premises in which disciplinary punishments are undergone shall conform to the sanitary requirements set forth in Article 25. A prisoner of war undergoing punishment shall be enabled to keep himself in a state of cleanliness, in conformity with Article 29.																														Officers and persons of equivalent status shall not be lodged in the same quarters as non-commissioned officers or men. Women prisoners of war undergoing disciplinary punishment shall be confined in separate quarters from male prisoners of war and shall be under the immediate supervision of women.																														Article 98: A prisoner of war undergoing confinement as a disciplinary punishment, shall continue to enjoy the benefits of the provisions of this Convention except in so far as these are necessarily rendered inapplicable by the mere fact that he is confined. In no case may he be deprived of the benefits of the provisions of Article 78 and Article 126. A prisoner of war awarded disciplinary punishment may not be deprived of the prerogatives attached to his rank. 																														Prisoners of war awarded disciplinary punishment shall be allowed to exercise and to stay in the open air at least two hours daily. They shall be allowed, on their request, to be present at the daily medical inspections. They shall receive the attention which their state of health requires and, if necessary, shall be removed to the camp infirmary or to a hospital.																														They shall have permission to read and write, likewise to send and receive letters. Parcels and remittances of money however, may be withheld from them until the completion of the punishment; they shall meanwhile be entrusted to the prisoners representative,who will hand over to the infirmary the perishable goods contained in such parcels.																														Judicial Proceedings 																														Article 99: No prisoner of war may be tried or sentenced for an act which is not forbidden by the law of the detaining power or by international law, in force at the time the said act was committed. No moral or physical coercion may be exerted on a prisoner of war in order to induce him to admit himself guilty of the act of which he is accused.																														No prisoner of war may be convicted without having had an opportunity to present his defence and the assistance of a qualified advocate or counsel.																														Article 100: Prisoners of war and the protecting powers shall be informed as soon as possible of the offences which are punishable by the death sentence under the laws of the detaining power.																														Other offences shall not thereafter be made punishable by the death penalty without the concurrence of the power on which the prisoners of war depend.																														The death sentence cannot be pronounced on a prisoner of war unless the attention of the court has, in accordance with Article 87, second paragraph, been particularly called to the fact that since the accused is not a national of the detaining power, he is not bound to it by any duty of allegiance, and that he is in its power as the result of circumstances independent of his own will.																														Article 101: If the death penalty is pronounced on a prisoner of war, the sentence shall not be executed before the expiration of a period of at least six months from the date when the protecting power receives, at an indicated address, the detailed communication provided for in Article 107.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 							 																						NOT SO GOOD NOW																														In the economic domain, the debate between India Shining (the government) and India Whining (the opposition) is fundamentally about the state of agriculture and employment generation. With 70 per cent of the Indian population in rural areas, agriculture and employment generation problems are related. The organized sector accounts for a workforce of only 30 million. While public sector employment is shrinking and private sector organized employment growth has failed to compensate for feel good to be broad-based, the discourse has to be about the 394 million who work in the unorganized sector. The planning commission has now produced a figure that 8.4 million jobs were created in 2001. This is based on thin samples of the National Sample Survey and is unreliable. Large samples of the NSS in 1993-94 and 1999-2000 show that employment generation has indeed slackened, especially in agriculture, and the tenth plan target of 10 million new jobs every year has failed to materialize. That apart, gross domestic product growth of 8 per cent a year will be elusive unless agriculture and allied sectors grow at 4 per cent on a sustained basis. By any criterion, the state of agriculture today is worse than what it was in the mid-Eighties. Profitability has been squeezed, diversification stopped and public investments, extension services and regulatory structures have collapsed. Farmers have been exposed to risk, consequent to diversification and commercialization, without necessary risk-mitigation instruments having developed. Nor has the agriculture credit problem been resolved, notwithstanding kisan credit cards and injunctions that 18 per cent of net credit should be directed towards agriculture. In fact, the figure is more like 12 per cent. 																														In all fairness, many agriculture reform problems are state subjects. And the two other governments in the Nineties (the Congress and the United Front) made as much of a mess of agricultural policy, equating it with a food-grain policy and pampering richer farmers with input subsidies and hikes in procurement prices for rice and wheat. No government in the Nineties has succeeded in reforming government finances and increasing public investment in rural infrastructure, such as irrigation. However, since the National Democratic Alliance government is the incumbent one, blaming the Congress or the United Front for similar laxity is neither here nor there. 																														It was the NDA government that prepared a reform agenda under the chairmanship of Mr Sharad Joshi, other than several other recommendations collated while drafting the tenth plan. Why have these not been implemented? Is it because Union ministers for agriculture typically do not understand agriculture and when they do, they are promptly shunted out? Is it because major NDA allies and large farmer lobbies in Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and western Uttar Pradesh need pampering? Whatever be the answer, if two-thirds of India is not feeling that good, the NDA only has itself to blame. Rural India also votes, usually, more than urban India does.

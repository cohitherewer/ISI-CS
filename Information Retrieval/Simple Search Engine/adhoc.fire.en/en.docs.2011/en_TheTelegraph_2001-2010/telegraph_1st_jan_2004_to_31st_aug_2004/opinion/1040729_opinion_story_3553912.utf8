The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 							 																						MORE CIVIL																														It is difficult to appear transparent without actually being so. Bureaucrats have always presented the appearance of transparency, declaring their assets every year  in sealed covers to be kept strictly in the confidence of the vigilance department. Evidently, the 11-member P.C. Hota committee feels that this is not enough. It did not need recent Central Bureau of Investigation raids to uncover stashed-away wealth in respectable bureaucratic closets to prove that even transparency can be an illusion. The anatomy of any major scandal, for example the fodder scandal, shows up the intricate network of bureaucratic involvement. This is not to deny the service its share of upright public servants. But the system that made the annual declaration of assets a routine, secure in its aura of confidentiality, is premised on an uprightness that is proving to be illusory. Besides, now there is less scope for bureaucrats to guard the sacredness of their confidential outpourings into sealed covers every year. Politicians running for elections have had to declare their assets publicly this time. Other public servants would be hard put to find reasons not to do so.																														Recommending measures to uncover wealth disproportionate to income may turn out to be just one among others in the Hota committee report to be submitted soon. A deeply embedded power structure such as the bureaucracy enjoys a certain freedom from accountability to the public. This is both inevitable and inappropriate. Members of the public are usually defeated by the bewildering mass of papers and files that any bureaucratic process in India generates, and are often awed by the intricacies of bureaucratic systems and the impenetrability of the mystery that surrounds any bureaucratic ritual. It would seem that the Hota committee has accountability in mind, and transparency is a part of that. Performance-based evaluation is one of the recommendations being expected. This in itself would be sufficient to tighten the system, in which promotion too is part of the routine. Nothing could be healthier for the service if bureaucrats were to be evaluated every five years, if their annual confidential records were made out so as to reflect performance, and performance judged in terms of the benefits of their schemes. There is also the possibility that the Hota committee would recommend a simplification of the process of bringing errant officers to justice. Such accountability would instil far greater confidence among members of the public. But most reassuring, perhaps, would be the promise of efficiency that a sharper monitoring process would hold forth.

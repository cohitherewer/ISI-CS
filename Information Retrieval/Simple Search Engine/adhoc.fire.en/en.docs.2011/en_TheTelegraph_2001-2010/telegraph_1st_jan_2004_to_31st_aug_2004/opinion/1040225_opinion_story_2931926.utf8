The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 							 																						PECULIARLY IDIOTICMani Talk / Mani Shankar Aiyar				 	 In the company of friends																														The disinvestment minister, Arun Shourie, first described the report of the comptroller and auditor general on his disinvestment of certain government-owned hotels as idiotic; then, on making a late discovery that constitutional authorities should not be addressed by ministers of the government as if they are hate-objects in Indian Express editorials, apologized and termed the CAGs adverse findings as peculiar. Idiotic-peculiar perfectly sums up not only Shouries flip-flops but, more generally, the shifting sands of the Bharatiya Janata Partys unprincipled, inconsistent politics.																														It was idiotic of Shourie to have carried on a vicious tirade with no evidence whatsoever against Reliance when Ramnath Goenka decided to side with the Wadias against the Ambanis in their inert-corporate war. It was peculiar of Shourie to then abjectly apologize when, on becoming a minister, he discovered that the BJP was in hock to its benefactors.																														It was idiotic of Shourie to target Rajiv Gandhi on Bofors without a scintilla of evidence when he was editor, The Indian Express; peculiar, on the Delhi high court pronouncing that there is not a scintilla of evidence, not to apologize to a dead Rajiv in the manner in which he has bent his knees before the living Ambanis.																														It was idiotic of Shourie to claim that the public sector must be privatized because it runs at a loss; peculiar, then, to privatize only those units of the public sector that run at a profit.																														It was idiotic of Shourie to insist on negotiating strategic sales of PSUs with a small coterie of fat cats; peculiar, then, to discover  and that too just on the eve of elections  the obvious alternative route of disinvestment by sales to ordinary investors through the primary capital market.																														It was idiotic of Shourie to stall initial public offerings in the primary market when this might have galvanized the stagnant secondary stock market; peculiar, then, on the eve of elections, to feed the feel-good factor with a flood of public sector IPOs when the secondary stock market is dizzily spiralling upwards.																														It was idiotic of Atal Bihari Vajpayee to strut around saying he would never talk to the man who had engineered a military coup against his Lahore friend, Nawaz Sharif; peculiar, then, to embrace the same man when Pervez Musharraf still remains army chief-CEO-president-Bossman.																														It was peculiar of the prime minister to invite Musharraf to Agra; idiotic of him to then boast that he had returned the Pak president to Pakistan empty handed and hang-dog (munh latkaye hue aur khaali haath).																														It was idiotic of the prime minister to repeatedly insist that there would be no dialogue with Pakistan until cross-border terrorism was ended and the infrastructure of terrorism dismantled; peculiar of him to then beg Musharraf to keep going the pretence of a dialogue commencing at least till the elections are behind us.																														It was peculiar of the prime minister to invite Bill Clinton to speak in Central Hall; idiotic not to have vigorously protested when Clinton abused our hospitality to describe Kashmir as a disputed territory.																														It was idiotic of Vajpayee to say he would talk to the Kashmir militants beyond the framework of the Constitution; peculiar, then, to not even open a dialogue with them till elections were round the corner.																														On the other hand, it was peculiar of Vajpayee to call Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim to talk to them in New Delhi on the eve of the Nagaland elections; idiotic, then, to not talk to them again once the Nagaland elections were over.																														It was peculiar of the deputy prime minister to describe the terrorist attack on Parliament and Akshardam as Pakistan-inspired; idiotic of him to then not produce the evidence which would convince either the courts or international opinion.																														It was peculiar of the prime minister to advise Narendra Modi, of all people, to run Gujarat as a dharma raj; idiotic then to praise Modi for his adharma raj. It was idiotic of the deputy prime minster to offer a white paper on the Inter-Services Intelligences activities; peculiar of him to then fail to deliver over the next five long years.																														It was peculiar to send Pakistan a list of 20 most wanted Indians; idiotic to fall all over them when not even one has been handed over. 																														It was peculiar of Jaswant Singh to drag us into Americas war on terrorism; idiotic to personally escort the talibans best Pakistani friends to Kandahar.																														It was peculiar of Jaswant Singh to have personally drafted the Lahore Declaration instead of leaving such babugiri to his babus; idiotic to have forgotten to mention cross-border terrorism in the declaration as finally adopted.																														It was peculiar of George Fernandes to declare China potential enemy no 1; idiotic of him, as defence minister, to describe the threat from Pakistan as a myth that has been exploded (introduction to the 1999 Penguin edition of D.R. Mankekars The Guilty Men of 1962).																														It was peculiar to mobilize our army on the front; idiotic to leave them there for ten long months, only to bring them back again.																														It was peculiar of George Fernandes to declare that he would return to the cabinet only after his name was cleared in the tehelka affair; idiotic of the prime minister to take him back when the mans name remains blackened with the disgrace of it all.																														It was peculiar of Yashwant Sinha to sit on his haunches as crores of possibly illegitimate money poured into our stock market from Mauritius; idiotic of him to have not taken up his Mauritian counterparts offer to discuss with India matters of recent concern.																														It was idiotic of Yashwant Sinha to have not chased UTI to save unit holders interest as the Sensex sank from 6,000 to 3,000 in three months; idiotic to have not followed up the UTI chairmans resignation with the finance ministers head.																														It was peculiar of Pramod Mahajan to have not insisted on telecom operators meeting their solemn contractual licence fee obligations; idiotic to have deprived the county of close to Rs 200,000 crore by allowing the operators to transfer to revenue sharing.																														It was peculiar of Ram Naik, of all persons, to claim that he would run a clean ministry of petroleum and natural gas; idiotic to have let him off the hook on the petrol pumps scandal.																														In the light of all this, it would be peculiar to not vote for the Congress-led alliance in the next elections; idiotic to vote this venal lot back to power!

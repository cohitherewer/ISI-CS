The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, August 07, 2004 							 																						BEAUTY AND THE BASICS																														A living thing is also a changing thing. But Calcuttas post-colonial life will have to be marked by a balance between change and continuity. A city exists as much in space as in shared visual memory  and any aesthetic of urban development must respect this. Even something as cosmetic as renaming the streets of Calcutta in order to rewrite its imperial past is a kind of violence, however banal, to this human relationship with time that is essential to the experience of living in a city. Historical scruple and a sense of what might loosely be called beauty must go together in any attempt at modernizing a city with a past. On neither count is the building of an annexe to the Victoria Memorial at all justifiable. For more than ninety years, the Memorial has stood alone in its much beleaguered and abused island of green. Juxtaposing this singularity with a piece of modern architecture would be taking a very grave and expensive risk. White marble is a durable material, and once built, it would be disastrously impossible to wish the annexe away  as so much in the new Calcutta cannot now be wished away.																														When the architect, Ieoh Ming Pei, designed the glass pyramid for the Cour Napolon of the Louvre in the early Eighties, the furious controversy that broke out could only be resolved through the creation of a public consensus. Peis model was first exhibited at the Palais de lElyse, and then a life-size simulation of the pyramid was built and placed at the site before the final approval was given. So, whether or not the annexe is to be built on the Memorial grounds should not be simply a matter of disagreement between the chief minister and the governor, but ought to be motivated by a far more inclusive notion of public opinion and citizenship.																														Buildings and structures of much historical significance and architectural beauty lie in ruins everywhere in Calcutta. Mansions, warehouses, theatres, libraries, cinema-halls, restaurants, churches, parks and ghats are waiting to be taken up and converted into useful and attractive spaces that may be robustly integrated with the existing life and culture of the city, without taking unseemly aesthetic risks. Urban growth is also creating new spaces  underneath the new fly-overs, for instance  that demand new forms of civic inventiveness. The money and political will being channelled into the annexe project could actually be used better on what already lies about in uncivilized dereliction all over the city and its suburbs. Restoration and conservation might, in the end, have more to do with urban modernity than the building of shopping malls and white-marble annexes. Ensuring that all public buildings and spaces of the city are accessible to handicapped citizens might make it more of a global city than a cafeteria on every street-corner. Beauty and the basics are far more important for Calcutta than unthinking trendiness.

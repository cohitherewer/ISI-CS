		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 							 																						SAND, SUN AND SAFETY SHOBITA PUNJA																					When I returned from Phuket, Thailand, last week, I fell into a deep depression just wondering how long we will take to get our country cleaned. Phuket, a popular sun-and-sand destination for the world, has beautiful clean beaches and the sea is clear and shimmering turquoise. The Thai government seems to have realized that to get tourists and foreign exchange, the country has to be clean. Who wants to come to a littered and smelly beach? They also have friendly custom officers and tourist police who guide and direct visitors right from the airport to their destination. The beaches are safe and visitors return each year for more beauty and sunshine.																					I was in Hyderabad the week before and was pleasantly surprised to see that when our southern state was dashing towards a hi-tech lifestyle, it actually instituted a tourist-police programme. I saw a group of young schoolteachers on a heritage tour with a local NGO early one morning. Although the traffic was gentle, as the group moved from one building to another in the heart of the old city of Hyderabad, they were accompanied and protected by a very friendly group of tourist police. 																					Tourist police																					The heritage walkers had informed the Hyderabad tourist police the day before about the walk, and a group of young men turned up. Each tourist cop wore a pinafore over his uniform with Tourist Police written on it in bright colours . They greeted the group of Indian teachers and asked about the places they would be visiting. Then they formed a barricade so that the teachers could cross the road with ease, they shooed away the hawkers at the old Mecca Masjid and then joined the group for a cup of tea at the end of the tour. 																					A very clever programme was done years ago at the Bharatpur bird sanctuary when rickshawwallas were trained to be bird-watchers and tourist guides. Every visitor to this bird paradise and World Heritage site has to travel in the national park in a rickshaw, as cars and motorized vehicle disturb the birds and pollute the already fragile environment. So groups of tourists hire a rickshaw, and their guide not only takes them around but also explains to them what they are seeing and how to look out for the lovely feathered visitors we get here from as far away as Siberia, Europe and China.																					Moving guides																					We could easily offer short-term courses to taxi-drivers and rickshaw-pullers, who could assist by giving good and correct advice and information to tourists. Harassment of visitors is perhaps the most distressing of all experiences at tourist sites. It does not matter if you are black or white, a foreign or domestic tourist; the pestering and stalking can be unnerving. Many tourists have complained that they fear going to the temple at Puri because of the pandas who dont leave you alone, or to Benaras where they are harassed and embarrassed if they do not perform some puja, and to the Taj Mahal because there are too many young men hustling to get your attention to take you to a shop to buy crafts items at hundred times the actual cost.																					But we have serious problems the other way too  not Indian harassment and cheating of tourists, but foreign tourists exploiting the natural trust of Indians. We have news of drug-trafficking at popular hippy tourist heritage sites like Hampi and Pushkar. The new racket of paedophiles sexually assaulting young children on the beaches of Goa has brought new fears and pressures on residents from exploitation by visitors. 																					These are not good signs. If we want to protect our heritage sites and ensure that they are seen by the world as places of dignity and beauty, we have to remove the filth and provide equal and fair protection to our people as well as our visitors.

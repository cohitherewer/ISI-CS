		 Friday, July 30, 2004 							 																						FORCED TO WED																														Savings are no longer buried under the ground. That is because banks are perceived to be safe, apart from the fact that bank deposits also fetch small returns. Historically, banks did fail and as some recent instances from developed countries illustrate, continue to do so. However, bank failures are rarer and this is ascribed to greater and improved regulatory control by Central banks. Indeed, the bedrock of the financial system is trust and the name of Global Trust Bank itself includes this word. This is small consolation to the eight lakh depositors who parked their funds with GTB and the limited deposit insurance of 1 lakh hardly counts. Indeed, GTB was not perceived to be a small or a localized bank like Nedungadi Bank or Madhavpura Bank. Its promoters were professionals, it had 40 per cent public equity and this included equity ploughed in by foreign and domestic institutional investors. If GTB fails, there are systemic reform issues that transcend the fact of its failing. Has the Reserve Bank of India performed its regulatory functions satisfactorily? There are three components of this question. First, are the regulatory norms adequate? After the GTB episode, the RBI has tightened its regulatory requirements, such as on diversified shareholding. This would not have prevented the GTB occurrence, since GTB was already fairly diversified.																														Second, were existing norms enforced? Clearly not. GTB lent for stock market operations. As early as 2002, GTBs net worth was eroded and non-performing assets mounted. Capital adequacy was far below the indicated 8 per cent. Yet, not only was no action taken, but GTB also continued to receive certificates from the RBI, despite falsification of accounts having been established. There remains the question of whether the RBI was, and ever is, allowed to function autonomously and whether unwarranted political interference was brought to bear on it. Third, was information about GTBs rating made publicly available to depositors, so that they could have taken their funds elsewhere? The answer is in the negative. Without the regulator providing free flow of information, competition cannot flourish. The RBI has therefore erred and through the subsequent knee-jerk reaction, after action was taken against GTB, compounded the problem further. There is no commercial justification for the merger of GTB with the Oriental Bank of Commerce, post facto justifications about the OBC wishing to penetrate the South are hardly convincing. The OBCs shareholders have not been consulted, GTBs books of accounts not scrutinized, and nothing is known about a share swap agreement. Public sector banks continue to be at the mercy of the finance ministrys dictates and this shotgun wedding is not the only instance of such a forced merger.

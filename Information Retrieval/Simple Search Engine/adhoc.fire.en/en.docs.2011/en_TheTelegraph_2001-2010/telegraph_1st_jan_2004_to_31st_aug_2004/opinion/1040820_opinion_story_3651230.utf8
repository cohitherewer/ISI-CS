		 Friday, August 20, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																We serve a ferocious master Apon Katha: My story (Tara,  5.99) by Abanindranath Tagore is Rimi B. Chatterjees  excellent translation of a memoir by Rabindranaths nephew,  a brilliant and avant-garde painter, writer and aesthete.  Chatterjees English conveys the fineness and whimsicality  of Abanindranths Bengali, making this delightful, but elegiac  little book an important literary work and historical document.  Tapati Guha Thakurtas foreword sketches out the nationalist  and cultural contexts, while the translators note lucidly  lays out her working principles.  Collected poems: 1954-2004  (Penguin, Rs 395) by Dom Moraes is a testimony  to the acuteness of the poets self-criticism  my facility  was my own worst enemy. Inspired by the Auden generation,  Moraess poetry is close to the spirit of Spenders verse   technically accomplished, intelligent, enjoyable, but  somehow a minor voice that falls short of the abiding brilliance  of Auden or Macneice: Travel with me on the long road/  into loneliness, where the hours/ offer pardons to those  still afraid. There is the Auden music in these lines,  but without the rich difficulty of Audens early English  phase. Yet there is ample evidence, in this collection,  of the sincerity of Moraess apprenticeship to poetry: We  serve a ferocious master. Heat and dust (John  Murray, Rs 200) by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala is the  reprint of a rather enjoyable and photogenic piece of postcolonial  Orientalism, first published in 1975, and then filmed by  Ivory and Merchant in the early Eighties. The Jhabvala-Ivory-Merchant  versions of Indias colonial past, and of the resurgences  of that past in the lives of a more modern generation, have  a certain sepia-saccharine charm, more cinematic than literary.  Here, the Forsterian Olivia  beautiful, bored and married  to a civil servant  outrages smalltown Satipur society  by eloping with an Indian prince. Half a century later,  Olivias step-granddaughter goes back to the eponymous heat  and dust of the bazaars to fathom the mystery of  Olivias scandal. What was she like? How did she live?  Looking around her house above X, it strikes me that perhaps  she did not live very differently from the way she had done  in Satipur, and might have done in London.

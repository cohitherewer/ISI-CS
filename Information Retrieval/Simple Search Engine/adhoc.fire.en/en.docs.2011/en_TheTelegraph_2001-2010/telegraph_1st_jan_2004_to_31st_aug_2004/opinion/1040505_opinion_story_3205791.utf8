		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 							 																						POWER PERFECT																														Images, more than words, capture the horrors of war. The war in Vietnam was frozen for eternity in the famous picture of a running child in flames. Likewise, the enduring image of the Iraq war will not be Mr Saddam Hussein emerging from a hole or his statue being pulled down in Baghdad but the photograph of a mass of live human bodies set up as a pyramid while a soldier of the conquering army stands by with a smile on his face. The bodies are those of Iraqi prisoners held in Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. It is evident from the photographs that have been flashed on television screens across the world and printed in all major newspapers, that prisoners there have been brutally tortured and humiliated. This is, of course, in violation of all international conventions that govern the conduct of war in the modern world. The photographs have held the world in shock and disgust since the torture has been perpetuated by an army that conquered Iraq on the pretext of freeing the people of Iraq from tyranny. The liberators have now become the oppressors. Torture has replaced tyranny. The official position of the United States of America, that the torture was perpetrated by individuals and not by the army, is risible but for the fact that it tries to cover up a heinous act. There are other bits of evidence to suggest that the torture of Iraqi prisoners is by no means uncommon. It would also not be unfair to conclude that the upper echelons of the US army have conveniently turned a blind eye to the prevalence of torture.																														Torture is the most obvious show of power. Power manifests itself through torture by inscribing itself on the body of the victim. Torture underlines the utter helplessness of the victim. Prisoners of a conquered people are thus the perfect targets of torture. For a long time, it was propagated that systems of torture existed only in those societies and cultures which were untouched by democratic and liberal values. The barbaric Orient engaged in torture, the civilized West did not. The reality of modern warfare has dispelled such myths. The most sophisticated systems of torture and surveillance have been evolved in the modern and liberal regimes of power. The pictures from Iraq provide only another instance of the general points being made here. They also underline the almost serial character of US hypocrisy in the conduct of the Iraq war. It began with the fabrication of evidence about the weapons of mass destruction and it ends with incontrovertible proof that the show of power by the liberators is no different from the modes deployed by the tyrant the US forces dislodged.

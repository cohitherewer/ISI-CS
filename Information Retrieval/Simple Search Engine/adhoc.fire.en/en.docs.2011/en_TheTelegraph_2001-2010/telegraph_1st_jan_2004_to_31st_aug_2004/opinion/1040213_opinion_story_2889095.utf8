		 Friday, February 13, 2004 							 																						WITHOUT A KEY																														Locking children up in a trunk for three hours is not, fortunately, the normal mode of punishment in primary schools. But that is as far as such an observation can be taken. The incident that took place in the school in Chhota Khajuria in Mogra, Hooghly, has too many disturbing dimensions to be dismissed as just an exceptional act. A teacher, Mr Chandan Ghosh, locked up two boys from Class I in a trunk for playing pranks. He then left for home. The boys were rescued by other teachers after three hours, reportedly unconscious. What is most obvious here is the complete callousness of the teacher towards his students and the peculiar cruelty in the nature of the punishment inflicted. It is not clear what kind of prank could have merited such a form of disciplining, because children normally tend to be mischievous and disruptive. Disciplining the young requires special skills, training and a certain attitude. It is quite obvious that schoolteachers like Mr Ghosh have either not benefited from the requisite training or are able to evade the reputedly strict requirements for appointment.																														The last is, of course, the key to the other aspects in this episode. Mr Ghosh, about whose action even the headmaster remained silent for a while, is an influential local leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). After the discovery, villagers held a demonstration before the school, demanding the teachers removal. They expressed the fear that being a CPI(M) leader, the gentleman would get away with it. The Hooghly district primary school committee, though, has suspended the teacher and ordered an inquiry through its disciplinary committee. But behind all this lies another, perhaps far more serious, aspect of the incident. Mr Ghoshs act and callousness were no doubt extreme, but such barbarism towards children is only possible in a society that habitually treats its young with cruelty and indifference. It is not even necessary to go into the staggering statistics of child labour in this country, it is quite enough to observe how the young who serve in roadside tea stalls or sweep the floors at home are treated. The divisions bred through generations by caste barriers, by differences in status in a feudal dispensation and by poverty manifest themselves most brutally in Indian societys attitude to children. It is not merely punishments and coercion, even in the home, that make this obvious, but also the callousness towards the health and education of less privileged children. Where the concept of childrens rights sounds like a fairy-tale, ogres who lock up children in trunks are only to be expected.

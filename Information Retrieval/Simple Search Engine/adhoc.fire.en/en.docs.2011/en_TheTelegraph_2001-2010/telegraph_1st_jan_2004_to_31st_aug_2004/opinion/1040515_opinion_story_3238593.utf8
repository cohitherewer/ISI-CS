The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 15, 2004  Out and About
				 																																	Raghu Rai isnt one of those who look at old pictures to relive memories. He tells new stories through them. The ace photographer will come out with three books by the end of 2004. The first, to commemorate the 20th year of Indira Gandhis assassination, will be published by Roli Books and will feature rare photographs of the late Prime Minister. Rai also plans to re-release his acclaimed book on Mother Teresa all over the world and another book on his best photographs of India in a book titled, unimaginatively, India. And he claims to be very happy with the way his book on Indira is shaping up. Obviously, especially now that we know whos going to rule at the Centre. Farah Khan				 																It doesnt rain, it pours. And Farah Khan has just been at the receiving end of a downpour of accolades. The choreographer-turned-director couldnt have spent enough time wallowing in the success of Main Hoon Na when she received another laurel of sorts. Her choreography in Bombay Dreams, now showing in New York, has earned her a nomination for the prestigious Tony Award, the Oscars for theatre. Farah is the first Indian in 58 years to have received such a nomination. And this, after the American critics had run the musical down to rubble. Guess its time to disco for our twinkle-toed lady. Astad Deboo				 																																	You can always be a dancer with a difference and go places these days. Astad Deboo is a case in point. He has been hired by a Sydney-based company to choreograph a presentation of Shakespeares The Tempest. I will work with the dancers for a month before the play opens in August, Deboo gushes. Quite a storm!

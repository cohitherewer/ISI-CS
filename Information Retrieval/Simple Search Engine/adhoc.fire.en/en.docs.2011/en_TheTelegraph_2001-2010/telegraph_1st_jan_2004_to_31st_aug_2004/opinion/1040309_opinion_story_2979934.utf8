		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 							 																						THE DARK SIDE OF MORALITY 															- DOCUMENT Excerpts from Sexuality, abortion and the media: a review of adolescent concerns by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 In denial mode																														Notions of preparedness for sexual intercourse also vary. The Durex survey shows that more than a third (36 per cent) respondents had sex for the first time because they were ready for it and it felt right. Four in 10 people in India did not have sex until they were married. A 14-year-old in Delhi says 18 is a good age to consider having sex, as he would be ready for it. And he would use a condom.																														In presenting reproductive health topics, morality and style become an issue. Nitina, a first year college student in Delhi says, I feel sick every time I read one of the cover articles about all the diseases you get from sex. I am just at the start of my life and want to enjoy relationships with lots of men. Someday I want to get married and have kids. It scares me to think that I could get some disease that will effect my body in the future, but that doesnt mean I am supposed to be suspicious of every new man when we make love. (Rashtriya Sahara. 1998)																														Is this deliberate? Does the media or family life education curricula present the darker side of sex? Do adults do this because they are afraid of young people experimenting with sexuality? Are adults using the HIV/AIDS issue as a tool keeping young people in line? Are they forcing their ideology and morality on youth? It would seem so.																														A senior Union cabinet minister once informed an international meet on HIV/AIDS that India will never face an AIDS-related crisis. We are a moral nation and dont have things like this. The things like this included among other things, homosexual, premarital and extra-marital sexual relations.																														At an Asia-Pacific workshop organized by the ministry of youth affairs and sports and the Asia Centre, the Union minister, Vikram Verma, highlighted the problems being faced by adolescents. He named the gradual breakdown of the joint family system, a consumerist culture, lifestyle influences of the West, peer pressure and, explosion of the electronic media (Chandigarh Tribune, Online Edition, November 12, 2002).																														And most recently, Murli Manohar Joshi, the Union minister of human resource development, in response to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates offer of US $100 million for HIV/AIDS in India, said Gates was overdoing it. Asked if Gates had created a scare by announcing the funds, Joshi said, I will not say he has created a scare because Indians are not scared. It is not in our temperament. (Anand, 2002).																														Many politicians and bureaucrats, old and young, wise and ignorant, seem to be in denial of the adolescent issues facing the nation. There is a view that India is an ancient (true), moral (untrue), impressionable (not true) culture, that cannot deal with the winds of change. Blaming the media, the West and consumerism is a convenient escape.																														In any country, little happens without policy initiatives. In India, the issue of teenage sexuality and reproductive health is a very recent one. To appreciate how it became a category on its own requires a brief historical tour.																														In 1952, India launched the Family Planning programme, with the goal of offering information and services to encourage couples to have smaller families. In 1976 and 1977, statements on a National Population Policy and a Family Welfare Programme were tabled in Parliament but never discussed or adopted. It was not till the year 2000 that a Population Policy was adopted (National Population Policy, 2000). TO BE CONCLUDED

		 Saturday, February 21, 2004 							 																						IN HOLIDAY HUMOURThe decision to withdraw homework after years of overwork suggests the lack of any well-thought-out policy regarding the education of childrenAn overdose of sympathy may not always be the best medicine. The Central Board of Secondary Education has suddenly  or perhaps with some kindly deliberation  asked its affiliated schools to free students in classes I and II of all homework. In itself, it sounds a marvellous plan. Seven or eight-year-old children need as much play as study, and find it painful to be tied down to the desk at home after school. The casualties are not just healthy playfulness, but sometimes the development of other talents as well. There would be grounds for hope if it were possible to believe that the CBSE authorities are making this a part of larger changes. Many over-anxious parents would remember a childhood when homework was a daily ritual, yet a ritual that was structured into the family routine, fun to escape perhaps, but not particularly burdensome. The structuring of a childs time included games, together with the practice of paying attention, of learning musical notes as well as letters and numbers. 																														The overloading of the school syllabus is a recent development. Add to it the burgeoning population, necessitating rigid selection procedures at the lowest levels in schools, and the change in the concept of homework becomes inevitable. Parental ambition and insecurity in a crowded world of accelerating competition have demolished childhood. In this context, the CBSEs decision signifies an oscillation between two extremes  either overwork or no work. What is alarming in this apparently child-friendly move is a kind of thoughtlessness, the complete absence of a policy based on the needs of minds being initiated constructively into the learning process. Both extremes are equally deadening. As some teachers and the West Bengal school education minister have pointed out, lighter homework is certainly desirable, but no homework at all would be damaging to different segments of children in different ways.																														It is not as if the CBSEs proposal is not feasible. But making it truly constructive would demand a complete make-over of present systems of teaching and testing, a different approach to classwork among teachers who would need guidance for their reorientation. There is no sign yet that the CBSE is nurturing such plans. There is also a peculiar inattention to everyday realities. There is no guarantee, for example, that the time created by an absence of homework would not be filled up by private tuition. Greater freedom for little children is a laudable ideal, but only when created in the right way and for the right reasons. A culture that has never distinguished itself by its sensitiveness to childrens rights and needs is unlikely to find either. Closing schools at twelve on Fridays so that the minority community can go to prayer and vote for the incumbent chief minister is not only not the right reason, it also gives the worst possible message about the practice of education. This decision by Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav is typical of a general attitude in which children come last. Perhaps children should be asked what they find more terrifying, being beaten with sticks and locked up in trunks  or homework.

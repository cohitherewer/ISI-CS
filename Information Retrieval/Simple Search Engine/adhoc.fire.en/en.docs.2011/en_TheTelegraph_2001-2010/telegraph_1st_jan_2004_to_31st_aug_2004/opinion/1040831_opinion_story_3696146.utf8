The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 							 																						FIRM STEP																														Revival demands some bloodshed. Mr A.K. Antony can be in no doubt of that, now that he has had to resign from the chief ministers chair. Even his reputation as the upright and incorruptible politician did not help, after the debacle of the Congress in Kerala in the Lok Sabha elections. It is accountability  results, in other words  that the rejuvenated Congress is interested in. Not being able to contain factional conflict within the party in the state is a mark of incompetence in a chief minister. Far from being able to contain intra-party rivalry, Mr Antony had become one of the participants in an ugly internal power game in which his opponent was the powerful and disgruntled senior leader, Mr K. Karunakaran. For some time, the Congress high command lent support to Mr Antony when the factionalism intensified last year with Mr Karunakaran fielding a rebel candidate for the Rajya Sabha elections. Although it was Mr Antony who saw to it that things did not develop towards Mr Karunakarans exit from the party, subsequent events saw him immersed in politicking over power bases. The list of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections created widespread discontent among partymen, many of whom felt that the seats had been distributed between Mr Antonys followers and those of Mr Karunakaran. Leaders like Mr K.P. Unnikrishnan spoke up against the damage to the democratic fabric of the party and the necessity of its revival if the Congress were to survive in Kerala.																														Firefighting by Mr Ahmad Patel, appointed for the job by Ms Sonia Gandhi, seemed to have had little effect on the increasing disaffection and multiplication of power centres within the party. The last straw was the report in June, which gave a very negative picture of Mr Antonys functioning and of the situation in which the Congress was in the state. For Ms Gandhi, this was enough. The Congress is back in New Delhi after a long time, albeit at the head of a coalition, and its priority is not only to stay in place but also to increase its gains. Although the Congress is the overwhelming majority in the Kerala assembly, it managed to score an incredible defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. This is something the Congress cannot afford, and obviously will not brook. With Mr Antonys resignation, the party high command has sent an unmistakable message about its proactive stance in the matter of accountability.

		 Monday, April 12, 2004 							 																						LACKING THE RIGHT VISION In obfuscating Hindutva and harping on good governance, the BJP is overlooking the need to reinvent its ideology, writes N.J. Nanporia				 	 Road to nowhere																														Few will quarrel with L.K. Advanis view that good governance has no relation to ideology, provided it is understood that by ideology he means what is nowadays vaguely known as Hindutva. Beyond such ad hoc labels as positive secularism, Hindu revivalism, Indianness, integral humanism, cultural Hinduism, and, most confusingly, wholeness between man and the ecosystem, Hindutva has been left undefined. What is apparent in these attempts at definition is a desperation, an acknowledgment that Hindutva is something which can be more felt than pinned down.																														So we have Atal Bihari Vajpayee telling us that Ayodhya was an expression of the national sentiment which has become narrow and has lost its inclusive character because of the unfortunate demolition of the disputed mosque. We have also had the Vishwa Hindu Parishad stating that Advani does not know about Hindutva. Clearly, this was an open invitation for anyone interested to inject into Hindutva any meaning that suited ones convenience. Both the opponents and advocates of Hindutva have done precisely that.																														Vajpayee has assured us that he disapproves of militant Hinduism, adding that the type of Hindutva being propagated now is wrong. This was vaguely identified as soft Hindutva whereas Narendra Modis version in Gujarat was categorized as hard. During the raj nothing caused more unease among the British than equally vague notions of Hindu nationalism. Over the years, this came to be looked upon as one inspired by communalism and religious intolerance. No surprise then that the state department of the United States of America has spoken disapprovingly of the institutionalization of Hindutva. Yet, as nearly always, the Americans have got it wrong. But the point is that Hindutva has not been given a coherent framework. 																														Currently, on the eve of the elections, this undefined Hindutva has once again been diluted, as Advani put it, and placed on the backburner in favour of the newly-discovered concept of good governance. But in downsizing a Hindutva which cannot be reconciled with modernity and good governance, isnt the Bharatiya Janata Party in danger of discarding ideology altogether? M. Venkaiah Naidu had argued that to the BJP, Hindutva has so far been a matter of arousing emotions and harnessing them to gather votes for the party. This cynical view of Hindutva is an indication that the party could find itself in an ideological vacuum. 																														Yet the BJP was once known as the party with a difference. Its possession of a collection of beliefs, even if undefined, gave it an identity which could be downplayed or rigorously interpreted to meet the needs of the 21st century. The BJP seemingly has opted for the first and ignored the relationship between ideology and development. In minimizing Hindutva today, the BJP is overlooking the need to re-invent it. So we have Arun Jaitley saying, We are sitting on the Hindutva agenda  we dont have to play it.																														The current idea now seems to be that Hindutva, as a means of arousing emotions, will be switched on or off according to tactical electoral needs. Some inkling that this isnt quite right has persuaded the party and sangh leaders to dither between two sets of assertions. In the first, there is a re-emphasis on the need to shed the anti-minority image, to speak in moderate voices and to project inclusiveness. In the second, there is a rather defensive insistence that the party remains loyal to the current version of Hindutva with such matters as the Ram temple, a uniform civil code, Article 370 and cow slaughter.																														The first has the unmistakable odour of ad hocism. The second is no doubt intended to reassure the hardliners while introducing all the uncertainties associated with the word vision as opposed to agenda. Genuine inclusiveness, however, cannot be achieved by temporary assertions. It will be credible only if included in a well-defined Hindutva, which sets aside emotions. 																														Advani has called on his party colleagues never to feel ashamed or speak apologetically about our ideology. But what ideology is he talking about? Surely not the muddled ideology which even its advocates have been unable to explain? Or even a vision that makes no immediate and awkward demands on the new party. Advani came near to explaining the spirit of a new ideology when he declared: The idea of making India a developed nation and a superpower is a highly powerful one, capable of touching the patriotic chord in every Indian, regardless of caste, creed, region, religion, gender or class. It will unleash the constructive energies of a billion people and place them in the service of the Big Idea. Well said, but the old Hindutva has to be restructured, not just marginalized, in favour of the concept or good governance. 																														The BJP was once believed to have a hidden agenda. When it became visible, it had in it the seeds of Moditva, that was no more than a virulent reaction to minorityism. The energizing version of Hindtuva has yet to emerge. The partys greatest asset is that it is ideology-conscious. But it needs more constructive thinking at the highest level. In a sense, Advanis ongoing yatra is an admission that the party needs a regularization of its ideology, which, if done, will ensure good governance as a sustained achievement. 																														But a yatra, however well intentioned, is not a substitute for what it implies or projects. At present, the party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are in the grip of the dream of coming to power with an absolute majority. And it is to realize this dream that ideology has been down-played and the good governance concept elevated to the status of a near-exclusive concern. But the link between a restructured Hindutva and development is essential. 																														Advani has posed two alternatives for the party to choose from. One is to limit our objectives as an ideological party. The other is to aspire to become a ruling party in India by diluting ideology and promoting inclusiveness. If by ideology he refers to the current state of Hindutva, he is right in dismissing the first course, and wrong in assuring that any dilution of it will lead to inclusiveness.																														What is most urgently needed is to look afresh at Hindutva, not as a defensive ploy, a vote-getting gimmick, a source of emotions or a minority-wooing mechanism, but as an intellectual discipline. That can be done by placing Hindutva in contrast with the conventional props of political respectability like democracy, secularism and socialism. Not that these have no point. Rather that they will acquire more substance if fortified with ideology. 																														Murli Manohar Joshi is not everyones favourite person. Yet he struck a refreshingly independent note when he said that Hindutva will continue to play a role, but it will be a presentation of Hindutva for the 21st century. Such a presentation calls for a rethink, but there are no signs of this. Which is why it is difficult to judge where the BJP is headed. The BJP is unique in that it already has the makings of an appropriate ideology which is not derived from an alien source. 																														There is no doubt that good governance is a desirable thing but it is a standard textbook recommendation. Only a newly authorized Hindutva can prevent the shine the party talks about from fading away.

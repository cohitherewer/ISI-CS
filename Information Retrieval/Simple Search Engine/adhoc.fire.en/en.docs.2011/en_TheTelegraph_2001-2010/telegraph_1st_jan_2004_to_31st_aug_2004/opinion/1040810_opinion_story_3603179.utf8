The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 							 																						FREE FANTASIA																														The relationship between pornography and freedom is far from simple. The Marquis de Sade wrote his most famous books in the Bastille. Indulging in, representing and acting out fantasies are three distinct erotic activities. Each requires its own kind of freedom, and therefore meets with its own form of repression. Salman Rushdie is perhaps referring to the first two when he makes the point that a free and civilized society should be judged by its willingness to accept pornography. Indians who value adulthood in broadly democratic terms will agree. Ms Sushma Swaraj, and the censor boards continuing paranoia about sex, will have taught them to value such freedoms. But Rushdies comment is directed at a particular kind of society, policed by religious fundamentalism, in which the sexes are kept strictly segregated. Gore Vidals endorsement of Rushdies view is also in the context of modern American puritanism, especially its Republican variety. Globalization and the internet have taken the politics of pornography beyond a critique of exploitation to the question of pleasure in a free market. The crackdown now is on child pornography, which demands more absolute limits to human freedom.																														Yet, even in a free and civilized society, which accepts pornography in a mature way, there could be other corruptions of the imagination, morality and senses. The global media have now created for the eye a form of desire that breeds its own sense of surfeit. To be able to imagine, execute and behold increasingly extreme forms of suffering surely constitutes the new pornography of the contemporary world. Most news-sites continue to register the highest number of hits for pages showing the Abu Ghraib pictures. Beheading videos are just as popular. Charred babies, weeping parents and death-row convicts, Maninder Kohlis wife and Dhananjoy Chatterjees parents are the staples of todays journalism. And it would be nave and evasive to claim that these images are viewed purely out of the hearts endless capacity for empathy. What is the nature of the appalled gaze that seeks out the Abu Ghraib images? By what appetite is it compelled? Extremity  like Sades prolific imaginings in the Bastille  is a kind of theatre. Boredom, and the limits of what the body can bear, made Sade draw the curtain. But this new theatre of cruelty does indeed exist in a freer world.

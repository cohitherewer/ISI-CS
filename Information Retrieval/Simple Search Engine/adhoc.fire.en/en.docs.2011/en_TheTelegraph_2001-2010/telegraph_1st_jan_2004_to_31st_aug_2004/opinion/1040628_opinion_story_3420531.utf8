The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 28, 2004 							 																						RIGHT NOISES																														The prime minister carries heavy baggage. First there is the historical heritage of the Congress, its secularism and its socialism. Then there is the unexpected revival of the Congress in the elections just past, which carries a mandate, however it may be read. And there is the critical support of the communist parties to the government, and its conditionalities which are embodied in the common minimum programme. But the prime minister is not just a common carrier. He is an administrator of unmatched experience and an economist of no mean repute. He has to come out of the rags in which history, party and alliance have clothed him, and show his true colours. This does not have to be done overnight; and it does not all have to be done explicitly. But if the prime minister, on his own initiative, addresses the nation, the expectation is not illegitimate that he would reveal himself, however slightly, that the speech would bear his stamp, and that he would lead.																														It is in light of such an expectation that Mr Manmohan Singhs first speech to the nation disappointed. It repeated in the same words and longer sentences what we have been inured to by the CMP. Concern with income distribution, stress on sectional interests, priority to agriculture, and the ritual mention of the countries that matter to us  none of these things was of out of place; but their sum did not add up to a scintillating speech. The real Manmohan Singh did peep out once in a while out of this high-level fog. When he stressed the reform of government, when he recalled Indias past as a trading nation, when he referred to the Bharatiya Janata Partys misbehaviour in parliament, he was obviously speaking from the heart. But it was a heart well protected by red tape. This is not to say that the prime minister should not explain the governments policies to the people and to the world at large. He had a distinguished precedent there in Jawaharlal Nehru. But Nehru explained his policies to the common people in the simplest possible words; his speeches would even today serve as a model for what Mr Singh was trying to say. 																														But it would be even better if he saved his words for what only he can convey, and concentrated on what he wants his prime ministership to be remembered by. The United Progressive Alliances message is wellknown by now; little can be added to it. But if the government goes about its policy objectives in the well-worn GoI manner, it is not going to achieve much in five years. The way of governing has to change. This was the prime ministers key message. He should now set himself to putting flesh on this skeleton; he should spell out his programme for administrative reform. It will require much working through, much consultation, much persuasion, and much enthusiasm. It is towards generating that popular upsurge for a different kind of government that the prime minister should direct his words. If he does it right, he will truly wake the people up.

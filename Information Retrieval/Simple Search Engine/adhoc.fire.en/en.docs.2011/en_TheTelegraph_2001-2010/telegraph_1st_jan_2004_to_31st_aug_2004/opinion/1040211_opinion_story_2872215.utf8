		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 							 																						FRAGILE EVEN WHEN STABLE SHOBITA PUNJA Natural disasters like earthquakes, fires and floods, hurricanes and storms cause unprecedented damage to life and cultural property. But there is a slower, quieter, almost imperceptible, death that occurs each hour, every hour, gradually, slowly but relentlessly.																					A building is stable as long as it stands resisting the wonderful forces of natural gravity that likes to pull everything within its reach toward itself. A building that has weakened over time will succumb to the powers of gravity if it is not reinforced in time. The danger of earthquakes and other such natural disasters is that it leaves buildings and historic monuments more fragile and susceptible to the forces of gravity that will eventually bring the building down. If nothing is done to prevent the inevitable more damage will occur and this can hurt lives.																					The fabric of the building or the natural material with which it is made also has its own characteristic way of behaving. Sandstone is a sedimentary rock that is very porous and will absorb water quickly and soon looks stained as microscopic living organisms begin to live on it, like fungus and algae and others. Wind and water and fire and the elements corrode and damage fragile building materials in different ways and the role of the conservation architect is to detect the problem unique to the fabric of the building before conservation work can begin. It is a curious combination of science and the chemist, the geologist and the historian and conservator who together have to establish the health of the historic building to determine what is wrong and why the fabric is deteriorating faster than usual. For conservation is the conscious action that is taken to prevent decay.																					Fragrance of the air																					Air that carries millions of particles of dust and microscopic forms of life can wear out the strongest buildings and forts. The golden fort of Jaisalmer set in the desert is constantly lashed by sand-filled breezes. The air and sandstorms act like sandpaper wearing away the fabric of the Jaisalmer golden yellow sandstone. Strong winds laden with salt and sea water have washed away images and figurines in the temples of Mahabalipuram built 1300 years ago.																					Polluted air spewing out of refineries and industries that do not follow environmental controls are seriously harmful as the air corrodes the buildings and affects metal elements. Such treacherous industrial chemical pollutants mix with rain water to form dangerous acid rain that corrodes delicate stones like marble. This was the case put forward against the iron foundries and the fossil fuel refineries of Mathura and Agra when damage was seen in the yellowing of the marble of the Taj Mahal.																					Delicate grave stones in the Calcutta English Cemetery show the result of years of climatic wear and tear  constant exposure to the elements have wiped away tears and faces, flowers and details of sculptures that once commemorated the dead.																					In tropical climates like ours the effect of the weather, the winds and rain, take their toll each year on our building s and national treasures. The only option is to see that our cities and countryside are kept pollution free. As pollutants harm human and animal life so they do our heritage. We need to look at our heritage and the monuments in our city as indicators of the health and the quality of air we breathe. What is the colour of the Victoria Memorial? Has anyone noticed whether it is turning a different colour? If you no longer see butterflies in your city then the air is polluted and not fit to breathe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 10, 2004 							 																						WHO STOLE THEIR SHINE? REENA SEN																					As the country goes to the polls, we the citizens wait with mixed feelings for the results to be declared. India is shining, or so we hear, and a new dawn is waiting to rise over the horizon. What will the new dawn bring? Good news for sure for Indias middle classes who will have more options to access even more exclusive private schools and hospitals, buy even bigger televisions, microwaves and washing machines, ride even more luxurious cars and keep up with the desi equivalent of the Joneses.																					What about the others? Those neither rich enough to access private schools,colleges and hospitals, nor influential enough to pull strings to access what the state has to offer? Like the Dutta family and what it faces today on the eve of the elections, even as loudspeakers blare out promises, promises and more promises.																					Dinesh Dutta, thirty-eight years of age, is the driver of an auto-rickshaw. He was proud, hard-working and undefeated, even when his only daughter was diagnosed with a lifelong, severe disability. His wife, equally resilient, complemented the family income by selling snacks, and together they provided a happy, if simple home for their two children. His daughter attended a special school and the whole family was involved in facilitating her learning, and collectively celebrating her progress. Till the day Dutta was diagnosed with severe renal failure, with both kidneys irretrievably damaged. Survival meant being tied to a dialysis machine till such time as a kidney transplant could be attempted.																					Nightmare tale																					Then began the nightmare. The auto rickshaw sat idle. The snacks could not be prepared as all the energies of Duttas wife were focused on looking after her gravely sick husband and her daughter. No readily available finances, no savings, no access, no godfathers, no friendly party-member, no daily earnings. 																					She ran from pillar to post trying to find out what dialysis implied in terms of money. Cant say, she was perfunctorily informed. A free bed, then? she pleaded. Sorry, none available, theres a long queue. Speak to a higher authority. Why information about costs of treatment were withheld remains a mystery. 																					However, thanks to contacts with doctors, professionals from her daughters school were able to obtain some idea of the costs. These were staggeringly high for a poor family. There were suggestions that Dutta appeal in writing to high authorities for a free bed and subsidized treatment. This was done. Except, with elections coming, there is no one available in our peoples government, everyone is out campaigning. Finally, friends and well-wishers raised funds for the first dialysis to be completed successfully.																					Learning to look away																					What next? Who will help the Dutta family to survive? Is Duttas survival going to be dependent on charity alone or on contacts in high places? Surely it is not unreasonable to expect a communist government to provide health services more accessible to the have-nots. The truth is that far from being accessible, the system evades those who need it most. Additionally, petty officialdom poses such insurmountable barriers and rations out information in such tiny, resentful dozes that people have to beg and grovel  and pay  to obtain their most basic human rights.																					Will things change? No one has the answer. Once the elections are over and the country faces yet another bout of sanctimonious outpourings of our newly elected representatives, we  and the Duttas  shall see. There are readers who will cite the fact that there are masses of people who are facing situations similar to the Duttas and will question what makes their stories newsworthy. After all, this story is just one of many to which we, the privileged middle classes, generally respond by hiding behind a thick hide of indifference and selective blindness. As long as the elections ensure that we and ours are looked after, as long as our needs are met and our lives get brighter and better, we are sated. 																					India is shining  for whom? As long as it shines for you and I, does it matter? Do we really care?

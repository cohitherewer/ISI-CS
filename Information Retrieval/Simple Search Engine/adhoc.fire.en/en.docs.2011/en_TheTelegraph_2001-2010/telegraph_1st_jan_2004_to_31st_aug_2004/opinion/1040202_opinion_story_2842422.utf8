The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, February 02, 2004 							 																						TOUCH AND GO																														Age and seniority are no reasons not to want more. So Mr K. Karunakaran has not hesitated to throw down the gauntlet in Kerala, just when the major rivals are mustering troops to get ready for the Lok Sabha elections. According to Mr Karunakaran, either the Congress accepts all the demands he has made, or he quits to form a new party named after Indira Gandhi. According to the Congress, this is unfortunate, since the high command has granted almost everything Mr Karunakaran has asked for. But of course, it has not granted him what he possibly wants most  it is not ready to wrest the chief ministers chair from Mr A.K. Antony and hand it to Mr Karunakaran instead. In spite of the appearances of a do-or-die battle, Mr Karunakaran seems to be doing a delicate balancing trick. His son, Mr K. Muraleedharan, the state Congress chief, is repeatedly assuring the high command of his unswerving loyalty. Interestingly, his fathers threat of parting ways has led to him being inducted as the states twenty-first minister.																														Mr Karunakaran has enough on his side to be tempted to drive a hard bargain. He has been associated with the party throughout his life, is a member of the Lok Sabha and a permanent invitee to the Congress working committee, with an old and devoted following. The Congress would not like to have its votes divided, and like still less the ill-feeling the senior mans exit would generate. At the same time, the party is no longer willing to be conciliatory over Mr Karunakarans open and continued criticism of both the state and central units. Both sides are waiting for the other to jump, because an understanding still seems possible. This is the reason the chief minister, Mr Antony, has cited for his own soft tone towards his rival: unity in the party is above all. It is also not absolutely certain how far Mr Karunakarans threat is a realistic one. Times have changed, and not many would like to leave seats in the legislature for the sake of loyalty. Outside of the Congress in Kerala, Congressmen would find it tough to find solid ground without being important community leaders as well. Nor are all of his followers in the party equally supportive of Mr Karunakarans move. Quite a few of them were disappointed at his announcement that he would be forming the new party within a week. Besides, the conditions of the new anti-defection law may cramp his style. There is quite a lot hanging in the balance. That Mr Karunakaran is still willing and able to play suggests that to be chief minister again, especially by depriving a rival, may be worth a hard bargain even in the waning years.

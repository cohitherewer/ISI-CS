The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 30, 2004 							 																						DIPLOMATIC CORE																														Tact is the middle name of diplomacy. Diplomats are known for never showing their hands and their emotions. But there are times when the cultivated stiff upper lip curls in disapproval. Hell hath no fury than a diplomat on the rampage. Mr Tony Blair, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, is feeling the wrath of not one diplomat but of many. A group of 50 former British ambassadors and high commissioners have attacked, through an open letter, Mr Blairs west Asia policy. The immediate trigger for the strongly-worded letter is the press conference in Washington in which Messrs Bush and Blair reaffirmed the policy. The statement condemns the Anglo-American policy towards Iraq and also Mr George W. Bushs policy on Israel. The latter was declared as one-sided and illegal. The quondam diplomats could not accept Mr Blairs consistent tailing of the United States of America so far as west Asia was concerned. The statement is both high-powered and unique. Among the signatories are British diplomats who were heads of some of the most important chanceries of the world. The power and legitimacy of the statement grow out of the status the signatories enjoyed as members of an elite service. It is unique because it is the first time in the long history of British diplomacy that former officers have taken such precipitate action.																														The protest  there is no other word to describe the diplomats letter  is bound to give Mr Blair a few butterflies in his stomach. He is not exactly on the top of the popularity charts in Britain. This, however, is an attack from within the hallowed portals of Whitehall. The former diplomats feel that by mindlessly following Washington, Britain has seriously compromised its foreign policy and its image. The policies are fruitless and were doomed to failure from the very beginning. It has become clear to most people that the Anglo-US forces have failed to win the peace in Iraq. What is more, all plans for a larger west Asian peace are now in tatters. It is also obvious that Israel pays scant regard to international conventions. All these have caused serious concern to the diplomats who feel that the foreign policy to which they devoted their careers has now been equated with kowtowing to Washington. Messrs Bush and Blair have been somewhat nonchalant about the protests and criticism that their policies have engendered. Former British diplomats have spoken. Even if their critique falls on Mr Blairs deaf ears, it will show that diplomats, even in retirement, value their dignity.

		 Friday, July 09, 2004 							 																						PAPA, DONT PREACHCutting Corners / Ashok Mitra Lined up in defence of anothers interests 																														The legend lives on. As news of the death, while fighting in the cause of Greek liberation, of George Gordon, Lord Byron, the early nineteenth-century British poet and debauch, reached his long-suffering wife, the bemused lady is said to have exclaimed: I really cannot determine whether he was or was not an actor. Cannot one make about the same kind of statement regarding the so-called science of economics, a knowledge of which is generally considered to be the most precious of intellectual equipment performing public persons must possess? Despite its celebrity status, can economics be taken seriously?																														Take the three major dogmas of economics that poorer nations round the world have constantly dinned into their ears by governments of the industrially-advanced countries, collectively known as the G-7: (a) stay away, for dear life, from fiscal deficits; (b) shun deficits in balance of payments, and (c) do not ever tolerate any subsidy activity, that is, sale of a commodity or a service at below the cost of its production.																														In a manner of speaking, all three precepts grew out of the early Calvinist principle embodied in the ancient adage: never a lender or a borrower be, always live within your means. Private wisdom is projected into the moral code to be adhered to in the public domain. A government can have its expenditure exceeding its income, either by borrowing or by printing notes. To print notes is to add to the supply of purchasing power relative to the supply of goods and services in the economy and thereby to raise prices, which in turn affects adversely the living conditions of the majority of the people. Financing extra spending by borrowing shifts the burden of national housekeeping to the future generation, who will have to pay back what the government currently contracts as loan.																														Deficits in the balance of payments are disapproved of for a similar reason. They allow citizens of the country to enjoy a standard of living which they are not entitled to, but which they enjoy because of the generosity of foreigners. Such generosity is however only of a superficial nature. In the long run, the nation will have to repay the foreigners in full for the goods and services they allow the citizenry of the country running its balance of payments deficits to enjoy for the present. Again, it is a case of shifting the burden, initially to foreigners and subsequently to the future generation.																														Subsidies are decried on the basis of the same puritan notion. Subsidies imply that you are using a good or a service without paying its full cost; you are in fact cheating the person who has produced or sold it to you. A regime of subsidies reduces the section of the community enjoying the benefit of such subsidies into irresponsible creatures, who assume that they can live in an ambience of free luncheons forever. That is claimed to be contrary to the rationality of economic calculations: somebody, somewhere has to bear the burden of the subsidies. It is supposedly in the nature of subsidies that those who put in honest labour suffer, while some malingerers keep having a good time at the expense of others.																														Whether the original adage on which these conservative economic tenets are based is at present comprehensively shop-soiled or not can be debated at length. And, who knows, perhaps the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the US administration are one hundred per cent well-meaning when they advise the poorer countries to observe these tenets. The problem though arises because the US government itself has been the most consistent infringer of these economic rules. The United States of America has been indulging in huge fiscal deficits for decades on end; nobody dares question its conduct. The same country has had, year after year, over the past three decades or thereabouts, record deficits in its balance of payments; no international financial agency has dared to tick it off. Finally, while the US administration most vigorously opposes the practice of subsidies for both inputs and outputs in poorer countries, it could nonetheless not care less for all foreign criticism and has continued to offer billions and billions of dollars of subsidies to its own farming community.																														A major reason for the Americans not being taken seriously in the international sphere is this contrariness between what they preach and what they do. A kind of reaction has set in, and, in the process, a feeling is growing that what really matters is a roster of behavioural code which judges the merit of issues by the criterion of national self-interest alone. After all, the recovery of the Western nations from the global depression of the Thirties was on account of large-scale fiscal deficits experimented with by the national governments, a practice which was also key to the economic rehabilitation of several war-ravaged countries following World War II. A persistence of balance of payments deficits for more than half a century has not adversely affected the well-being of American citizens. As for subsidies, it is not just the US department of agriculture; the US defence apparatus too illustrates the hypocrisy of preaching against the supposed sin.																														Pray, why are the American president and his near ones so desperately anxious to enlist the assistance of soldiers from other countries to safeguard their imperial rule in Iraq? The obvious first answer is to lessen the danger of loss of American lives caused by Iraqi resistance. Iraq will remain in the possession of the US, but for ensuring that possession, let the lives of other peoples be sacrificed, and not those of Americans. This is however not the only reasoning at work for seeking foreign troops. If you rent military personnel who belong to a regular foreign army, you save the cost of training such personnel. They come to you in ready-to-deploy condition and there is no cost involved for training them on the part of the US military establishment. This is another way of saying that the US administration wants the pacification of Iraq to be a subsidized activity, to be subsidized by the foreign powers whose trained forces Uncle Sam wants to make use of, but for whose training he does not want to pay.																														Till now, only crony governments, such as those of South Korea, Thailand and Croatia, have fallen victim to American cajoling; none others have agreed to supply combat-ready troops for Iraq. The American strategy planners are not disappointed. They are going round the continents and advertising for private armed contingents from various countries to come and play a role in mounting guard over the Iraqis. These private contingents are a mixed bag. They consist, for instance, of dismissed personnel who were in the service of Augusto Pinochets dictatorial regime in Chile, of French Foreign Legion-type irregulars whom the apartheid-loving rulers in South Africa had once deployed to annihilate black resistance groups and who are now engaged from time to time by trans-national corporations to suppress native aspirants of economic freedom in mineral-rich west African republics, and of now-on-the-loose veterans who perpetrated the Kosovo massacres. If rumour is to be given some credence, mafia groups from Sicily and other parts of south Italy, desperate to don the mantle of respectability, have also come forward to help the Americans. It is a motley crowd, with little that is common amongst them, save the fact that they all offer the services of military personnel for whom the US will have not spent any money for further training. These trained killers therefore come as a package of subsidies.																														The US establishment at least takes economic precepts with a pinch of salt; it can do so, it is the head boy.

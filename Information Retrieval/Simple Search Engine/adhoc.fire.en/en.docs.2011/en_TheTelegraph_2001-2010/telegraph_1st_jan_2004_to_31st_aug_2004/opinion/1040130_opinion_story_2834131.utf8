		 Friday, January 30, 2004 							 																						WONDER YEARS 							 - A patchwork of stumbles and achievements				 	 Unfinished business John F. Kennedy: An Unfinished  Life 1917-1963 By Robert Dallek, Penguin,  18 So many biographies have been  written of John Fitzgerald Kennedy (Jack), the charismatic  35th president of the United States of America, that students  of recent political history may rightfully ask if there  was really a need for another one. A good number of the  previously published chronicles are compellingly fawning  while others are tawdry exposs of his not-so-secret extramarital  affairs. This one, by the Boston University history professor  Robert Dallek, falls into neither of these categories. With  help from new material unearthed with the Freedom of Information  Act releases and the Kennedy Library, Dallek has proffered  arguably the most unbiased, certainly the most compelling  of all biographies of the youngest elected and the first  Roman Catholic president of the US.																														Joe, Jacks father, was grooming his eldest son, Joe Jr, for the highest political office in the land. An outstanding sportsman, in high school and at Harvard, the gregarious Joe Jr meticulously cultivated all the bigwigs of the Democratic Party under his fathers expert guidance. It seemed just a matter of time before he would throw in the dice. Jack, on the other hand, suffered from a litany of diseases throughout his school and Harvard years. Frail and dogged by mysterious illnesses throughout his young life, Jack was understandably bullied by his older brother. When World War II intervened, Joe Jr opted for the elite air force while Jack joined the less glamorous navy, in large measure to avoid comparison with his older brother.																														Shortly into the war, Jack, commanding a torpedo boat, rammed into a Japanese destroyer in the Pacific theatre. While floating on the wreckage, he ensured the safe return of every crew member and overnight became a decorated war hero. In an interesting analysis, Dallek surmises that a major reason behind Joe Jrs volunteering for a dangerous flying mission behind German lines, which cost him his life, was his natural competition with his now-more-famous brother. Joe was devastated and now looked upon Jack as the logical torch-bearer. A Congressman in 1947, at 30, Jack won an unlikely victory over the redoubtable incumbent, the Boston Brahmin, Henry Cabot Lodge, in 1952 for the senate seat. Campaign contribution rules were thrown out of the window, and Joes immense wealth was in full display. The large Roman Catholic and Jewish population voted solidly for JFK to see him through.																														In an amusing aside which will warm the cockles of our chief election commissioners heart, Dallek writes, Jack found...his fellow senators were cautious, self-serving and unheroic, more often than not a captive of one special interest or another. Just three months into his term, Jack told a journalist, Ive often thought that the country would be better off if Senators and Pages traded jobs. After a year in the senate, when someone asked Jack, Whats it like to be a United States senator? he said after a moment, Its the most corrupting job in the world. He saw senators all too ready to cut deals and court campaign contributors to ensure their political futures. The senate chaplain was asked , Do you pray for the senators ? No, he replied, I look at the senators and I pray for the country.																														Jacks narrow victory, popular vote-wise, over Nixon for the presidency in 1960, shocked the bigwigs of the Democratic Party who felt a landslide was in store, but as Dallek points out, Forty three years after the election it may be difficult to imagine the importance of something that no longer seems significant, it was the first time a candidate had won the presidency with a minority of Protestant votes.																														Kennedys inaugural address, of course, remains one of the great speeches of American presidency. At the height of the Cold War he declared, Man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life...Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.																														Dallek cites a plethora of major medical treatments Kennedy undertook for Addisons disease (characterized by progressive anaemia, low blood pressure and great weakness that required daily infusions of cortisones), stomach/colon and prostate problems, high fevers, occasional dehydration, abscesses  the list is endless  and rightly concludes that far from preventing Jack to do his job effectively, they are an indication of his determination and strength of character.																														Kennedys presidency can best be summed up by the subtitle of the book, an unfinished life, tragically curtailed, culminating in an unfinished presidency. His tentative forays supporting the civil rights movement necessitating sending federal guards to George Wallaces Alabama, effectively confronting segregation, his reluctance to widen the Laos-Vietnam excursions, his solidarity with the West Berliners with vintage Ich bin ein Berliner, the Cuban missile crisis resulting in his much publicized confrontation with the bullying Khrushchev finally leading to the test ban treaty at the height of the Cold War, will remain benchmarks in American history. Dallek is right on target when he states, Most historians are willing to acknowledge that Kennedy was at the very least an above-average president... [his tenure] is better understood as a patchwork of stumbles and significant achievements. 																														No biography of Kennedy can be considered complete without the authors take on the might have beens. Dallek writes, Even acknowledging missed opportunities and false steps, it must be acknowledged that the Kennedy thousand days spoke to the countrys better angels, inspired visions of a less divisive nation and world.

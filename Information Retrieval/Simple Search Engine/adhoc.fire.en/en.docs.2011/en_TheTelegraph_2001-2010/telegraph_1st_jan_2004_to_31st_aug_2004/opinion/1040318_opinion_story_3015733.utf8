		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 							 																						WHY MAKE THE THIRD CHOICE 															- Document Excerpts from Negative Choice: sex determination and sex selective abortion in India by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Misdirected strategy																														The two-child norm and sex selection: in India, over the last three decades (1966-96), the family planning programme pursued a targeted approach where the Central government gave states numeric targets for method-specific contraceptive acceptors. These targets were based on estimates to attain replacement levels of fertility that in turn would lead to population stabilization. In terms of strategy, undue emphasis was placed on the use of terminal methods, which resulted in a bias towards female sterilization. However, during the Nineties, the government of India decided to reorient the programme based on data that showed that contraceptive prevalence as well as decline in birth rates were both stagnating. In 1996, the adoption of a target-free approach marked a significant shift in programme orientation. The reorientation programme encompassed an expanded reproductive and child health approach.																														Despite these progressive trends at the national level, shortly after the announcement of a national population policy, a number of states formulated their own population policies. These emphasized both the achievement of a two-child norm as an important goal and advocated the use of incentives and disincentives to achieve it																														It is important to note that during the past two decades, the average family size has been declining. This has been a result of voluntary acceptance of smaller families by couples, in response to a number of economic and social changes, and partly due to the governments efforts to hasten the transition through the family planning programme.																														However...a small family norm is not necessarily accompanied by a preference for a fewer number of sons. Son-preference continues to be a significant determinant in family-building strategies. The national family health survey showed that at...the all-India level, 83 per cent of married woman in the age group 15-49 with two sons and 76 per cent with one son said they did not want any more children. On the other hand, significantly fewer women, 47 per cent, with two daughters said they did not want more childrenThis trend currently appears to be strongest in families that already have two children. This is attributed to the fact that the current total fertility rate for India is about three. And as a large population of women wish to stop childbearing after having three children, a strong sex preference, mainly for sons, clearly determines the third birth order. 																														It is also worth highlighting that son preference and abortion can be linked in two distinct ways. First, through the specific use of sex determination and sex selective abortion to identify and eliminate female foetuses and the second is abortion...The use of coercive measures in implementing population policies, particularly undue emphasis on the use of terminal methods, can easily lead to an intensifying trend towards SD and SSA.																														...It is worth noting that pre-natal diagnostic technology became available in India at least a decade prior to the Forum against Sex Determination and Sex Pre-Selection campaign. During its introduction (1974), the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, initiated a clinical trial on the efficacy and acceptability of the available procedure, amniocentesis. It was found that almost 90 per cent of those who were part of the trial aborted the foetus if the procedure revealed the sex of the child to be female. Womens groups in Delhi were rightly concerned about this finding and immediately launched a protest to demand a ban on the use of these technologies...  TO BE CONCLUDED

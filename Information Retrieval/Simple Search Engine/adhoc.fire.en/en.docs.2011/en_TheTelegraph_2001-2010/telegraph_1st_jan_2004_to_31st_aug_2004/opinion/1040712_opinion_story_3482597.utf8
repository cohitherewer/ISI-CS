		 Monday, July 12, 2004 							 																						THE BIGGEST KILLER OF THEM ALL						DOCUMENT From the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention by the WHO, Geneva 2004				 	 Fatal ride																														Every day around the world, almost 16,000 people die from all types of injuries. Injuries represent 12 per cent of the global burden of disease, the third most important cause of overall mortality and the main cause of death among 140-year-olds. The category of injuries worldwide is dominated by those incurred in road crashes. According to the World Health Organisation data, deaths from road traffic injuries account for around 25 per cent of all deaths from injury.																														Estimates of the annual number of road deaths vary, as a result of the limitations of injury data collection and analysis, problems of underreporting and differences in interpretation. The figure ranges from around 750,000 (probably an underestimate, since it is made on the basis of 1998 data) to 1,183,492 annually  representing over 3,000 lives lost daily. Around 85 per cent of all global road deaths, 90 per cent of the disability-adjusted life years lost due to crashes, and 96 per cent of all children killed worldwide as a result of road traffic injuries occur in low-income and middle-income countries. 																														Over 50 per cent of the deaths are among young adults in the age range of 1544 years. Among both children aged 514 years, and young people aged 1529 years, road traffic injuries are the second-leading cause of death worldwide.																														The fundamentals: In low-income countries and regions  in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America  the majority of road deaths are among pedestrians, passengers, cyclists, users of motorized two-wheelers, and occupants of buses and minibuses . The leading casualties in most high-income countries, on the other hand, are among the occupants of cars. 																														However, when it comes to comparative fatality rates (deaths for any measure of exposure) for all users in the traffic system, these regional differences disappear. Nearly everywhere, the risk of dying in a road crash is far higher for vulnerable road users  pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists  than for car occupants .																														The road traffic death toll represents only the tip of the iceberg of the total waste of human and societal resources from road injuries. The WHO estimates that, worldwide, between 20 million and 50 million people are injured or disabled each year in road traffic crashes (the reason for the wide range of this estimate being the considerable, known underreporting of casualties) .																														Using epidemiological evidences from national studies, a conservative estimate can be obtained of the ratios between road deaths, injuries requiring hospital treatment, and minor injuries, as being 1:15:70 in most countries.																														In many low-income and middle-income countries, the burden of traffic-related injuries is such that they represent between 30 per cent and 86 per cent of all trauma admissions. While a decrease in deaths due to road traffic crashes of some 30 per cent is forecast in high-income countries, current and projected trends in low-income and middle-income countries foreshadow a huge escalation in global road crash mortality between 2000 and 2020. 																														Furthermore, on current trends, by 2020, road crash injury is likely to be the third leading cause of disability-adjusted life years loss. TO BE CONCLUDED

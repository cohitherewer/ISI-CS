		 Friday, February 13, 2004 							 																						THE WAY THE WHEEL WAS SPUN THE MAKING AND UNMAKING OF AN  INDUSTRIAL WORKING CLASS By Jan Breman, Oxford, Rs  595 Although the rich tradition of  textile production in Gujarat goes back to the pre-colonial  period, the full-fledged textile industry started to take  shape only in the mid-19th century. As manual spinning and  weaving yielded place to a multi-tier production mechanism,  a rapidly teeming workforce emerged with a newly acquired  social identity. Ahmedabad, hailed by the British as the  Manchester of India, was soon dotted with scores of textile  mills. The laying of the railway lines in 1864 connecting  Ahmedabad to Bombay triggered a boom in the textile industry  in western India. This received a further boost in the swadeshi  movement in the first decade of the 20th century. In the  meantime, however, the Ahmedabad Millowners Association  was formed in 1891, mainly to defend producers interests  against the colonial administration. Later, the AMA began  to function chiefly to harness the volatile, and occasionally  violent, workforce.																														The task which Jan Breman sets himself in this book is to trace the genealogy and organization of this workforce and to delineate its dispersion following heavy retrenchment and mill closures from 1970 onwards. Breman, through his extensive fieldwork, attempts to show how the conversion of mill-workers to casual workers in the newly spruced-up city of Ahmedabad in the late Eighties not only pushed them down to the lowest echelon of urban economy but dented their sense of morality and dignity. The dramatic change in the modus vivendi of these workers weakened their workplace camaraderie, while primordial ties based on religion and caste began to re-assert themselves. The upshot is, as Breman explains, that they fell easy prey to majoritarian politics in trying to usurp lost social space. The Gujarat pogrom in the recent past is a case in point.																														The book traces the evolution of Ahmedabads textile workers from a scattered unit into a well-knit army struggling for emancipation primarily from the tyrannical mukadam or jobbers, and secondarily, from oppressive and dehumanizing labour conditions. The formation of the Swadeshi Mitra Mandal in 1906, and ten years later, the Majoor Mitra Mandal, were in response to social and medical needs of the workers. These took the shape of a sustained movement once M.K. Gandhi stepped into the scene. It was under his leadership that the Textile Labour Association was set up in 1920, soon launching a dharma yuddh (righteous struggle) with the AMA. 																														Understandably, Breman devotes much of his attention in the first part to the assessment of Gandhi as a trade union leader and the growth of factionalism within TLA. In the second part, he investigates the real motive behind the governments liberalization policies and their dreadful outcomes, debunking the myth of accelerated decrease in the incidence of poverty and dismissing the possibility of a social safety net to protect casual workers. The only bright spot in all this is the Self Employed Womens Association, a one-time wing of the TLA, now an independent operator. SEWA stands as proof of the many injustices committed by the labour organizations, ostensibly formed to fight injustice and exploitation.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

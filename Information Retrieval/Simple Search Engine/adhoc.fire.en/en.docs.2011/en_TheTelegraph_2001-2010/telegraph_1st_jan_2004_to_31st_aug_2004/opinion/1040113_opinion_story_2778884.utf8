		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 INDIA SHINING  OR INDIA DIMMING?
 Mani Talk Mani / Shankar Aiyar				 	 Tweedledee and tweedledum																								Explosive growth! Eight per cent growth! India Shining! Thats one quarters performance, buddy. We hit 7.7 per cent back in 1996-97, the last year of Manmohanomics. In the last six years, average growth has sunk to below six per cent, lower than in the last six years of the Eighties, let alone the first six years of the Nineties. Alas, its India Dimming!																								Eight per cent growth! Never before reached by the Indian economy! India Shining!																								Nonsense. Under Rajiv Gandhi, the economy grew at 10.87 per cent in 1988-89. At best, this years annual growth will top 7 per cent. Well, it topped 7 per cent three years running from 1994-95 to 1995-96 to 1996-97. In five of the last six years, weve grown at five to six per cent. And in two, weve dropped to below 5 per cent: 4.4 per cent in 2000-2001 and even lower to 4.3 per cent in 2002-2003. Alas, its India Dimming!																								Agricultures booming! The kisan never had it so good! India Shining!																								Why not ask the kisan? Or better still the minister of finance? For Jaswant Singhs official mid-year review of the economy shows that in this blessed monsoon year, the kharif output of foodgrains is lower than two years ago. The rabi predictions are no better. For the first time since the first five-year plan, population growth is outstripping the growth rate of foodgrains. Alas, its India Dimming!																								Oilseeds zooming! India Shining!																								Over the Eighties, oilseeds output was doubled from 9 million tonnes to 18 million tonnes. So, edible oil imports, which at the beginning of the Eighties were the second biggest import after crude oil, dropped so fast that under the 1991-96 Congress regime, India became a net exporter of edible oils. Under this NDA lot, edible oil imports have zoomed to $ 2,000 million. Almost all soya oil processing plants in the country have closed down. Oilseeds output has stagnated. At best, this years bumper crop will be a whisker higher than fifteen years ago. Oilseeds are the commercial crop of Indias poorest dryland farmers. Theyve not had it so bad in decades. Alas, its India Dimming!																								Kisan credit cards! India Shining! No, kisan credit cards are not the poor mans Visa. Yes, several lakh kisan credit cards have been issued. But Indias kisans number 60 crore. Not even one in a thousand kisans has ever seen a kisan credit card, let alone used one. But all know cooperative and rural bank credit. The law says 18 per cent of all bank credit must go to the kisan. That norm was at the heart of garibi hatao. In the last six years, bank credit to agriculture has never exceeded 12 per cent. Alas, its India Dimming!																								Rs 50,000 crore fund for credit to the kisan! India Shining!																								Never, since before the first plan, has public investment in agriculture been as shamefully low as in the last six years. Now that they are on the edge of being voted out, they announce a media-driven scheme of Rs 50,000 crore! Where were they all these six years? Oh, I see, busy losing Rs 100,000 crore of unreturned loans from public sector banks to private corporate fat cats (not to mention another Rs 100,000 crore of unpaid taxes)! Yeah, distracts attention from the kisan. We know that there is absolutely no money in the kitty. But it will not be necessary to produce the money  or admit they dont have it  till after the elections. So, this is the right moment to announce a bonanza for credit-starved kisans. It is an announcement Gandhiji would have called a post-dated cheque on a failing bank. Alas, its India Dimming!																								Agri-business! Land to the corporates! India Shining!																								It was once land to the landless. Nearly 50 crore kisans own an acre or less. Most khet mazdoors own nothing. It is they who need land. But it is being given to suited and booted city gents to drive the kisan off his do bigha zamin! Alas, its India Dimming!																								Sensex tops 6,000! India Shining! Will you never learn? The stock market boom of 1991-92 ended in the Harshad Mehta bust of 1992. The stock market boom of 1999-2001 ended in the two-year long 2001-2003 Ketan Parekh bust-up. This boom also bears no relation to reality. It is secondary market speculation, casino profits, driven by Rs 33,000 crore of mutual funds investment and Rs 50,000 crore of foreign money on the make. They mint their thousands of crores when they buy. And they mint even more thousands of crores when they sell. The primary market, where real investment takes place, has seen only 15 new issues in 2003, mobilizing a derisory Rs 2,000 crore. Dont be stupid. Dont lose your hard-earned savings in the next stock market bust. That bust will come. For, alas, its India Dimming!																								Berozgari hatao! One crore jobs a year! India Shining!																								Not since pre-independence India has net employment grown so slowly. Read the governments own Economic Survey 2002-2003 and the results of the latest 57th round of governments National Sample Survey Organization. While VRS, lay-offs and disinvestment are slashing jobs in government and the public sector, employment in the organized private sector grew last year  says the governments Economic Survey  by all of 0.1 per cent! Agriculture, we have seen, is stagnating. Handlooms, the second largest employer after agriculture, is shutting down. 																								For 20,000 vacancies of khalasis announced in 2003 by Indian Railways, there were 55 lakh applicants  including doctors, engineers and MBAs. The prime minister is plain lying when he claims 84 lakh job-creation in 2002-2003. That is the gross figure. The net figure, that is jobs created versus jobs lost, is a measly 30 lakh in a country where 1.5 crore new entrants come on the job market every year. Official government statistics. Employment growth under this Mehmood and Tun Tun team of Yashwant-Jaswant has been one-third of what it was under the Hindu rate of growth a quarter century ago. Alas, its India Dimming!																								Yes, it is India Shining for about 3 million Indians of the Reliance/CII kind. And yes, there is a little light for the 200 million-strong middle class. But for 800 million of the poor and near-poor, it is, alas, India Dimming!																								BJP ka haath poonjipatiyon ke saath!																								Congress ka haath garibon ke saath!

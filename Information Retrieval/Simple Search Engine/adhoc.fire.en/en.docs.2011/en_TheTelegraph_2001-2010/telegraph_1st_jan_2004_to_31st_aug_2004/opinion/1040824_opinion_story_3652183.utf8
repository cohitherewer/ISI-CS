The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Positively low				 																																																				Sir  Pratima Kumari has denied the charge that she used steroids to improve her performance (Pratima finger on coach plot, Aug 21). But the weightlifters denials sound about as convincing as Indias chances of striking gold at the Olympics. She says her coach, Leonid Taranenko, hatched a conspiracy against her. But why would Taranenko do that, when a good showing by Kumari would help his own career? Kumaris allegation that she was given injections for a back pain, and not traction, is neither here nor there. Surely, she could have refused the treatment, especially when it was against her wishes? Indian sports officials have also done very little to stem the rot. Remember last years national games where 22 athletes tested positive? The officials should know that no probe committee can undo the damage done to the nations image at the Olympics.

				 																Art therapy				 																																																				Sir  The two significant findings of the World Bank study on HIV/AIDS in India are that HIV is increasing at an alarming rate, and that condoms, not anti-retroviral therapy, are the most effective way to prevent its spread among high-risk groups (Condoms only hope in HIV war, Aug 14). 				 																																																				It has never been claimed that ART drugs hold the key to arresting Indias rising HIV population, except in so far as they reduce the chances of transmission from an HIV-infected mother to her baby during pregnancy or breast-feeding. The governments demand that the supply of ART drugs be increased to all AIDS patients in India is premised on the fact that these medicines prolong a patients healthy life if used properly. Also, if generic varieties of ART drugs, manufactured and sold at a reasonable prices by Indian companies, are made available to poor AIDS patients in African countries and the Caribbean, then why should poor patients in India be deprived?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Moni Nag, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The World Bank findings on HIV/AIDS do not come as a surprise. But the study overlooks a crucial aspect  a lack of awareness among the people of the true nature of the disease and its modes of transmission. Sadly, a large number of Indian doctors too share this ignorance. This has resulted in the indiscriminate use of ART on patients through the unstructured treatment. A study conducted in Mumbai has found out that as many as 12,000 Indians are on ART, which does not conform to WHO norms. 				 																																																				ART limits the growth of HIV and can only help those already infected with the virus. It has absolutely no role in arresting the spread of the virus among risk groups, although in cases of definite exposure to HIV, like an accidental prick from a contaminated needle, these drugs may be used to stop the spread of the virus, post exposure. Indian doctors need to follow WHO guidelines or those provided by the Centre for Disease Control for initiating and continuing ART to treat the HIV-infected. These depend on the patients viral status and CD4+ cell count, as also his clinical status. ART use will also vary for children, adults and pregnant women. ART may cause more harm than good unless it is appropriately used. Unfortunately, updating the knowledge of doctors has never been mandatory in India. There is no denying that creating public awareness about AIDS in India largely depends on the doctors and social workers. If the latter are ignorant, what can be expected from the masses?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Prying eyes				 																																																				Sir  No capital punishment has received as much publicity as Dhananjoy Chatterjees. But the media has commercialized a tragic incident. The grief-stricken Chatterjee family was hounded out and so were the Parekhs who were forced to go into hiding to escape the media glare. I am sure TV serials and films will be made about the entire story.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The explicit details of the last hours of Dhananjoy before the hanging, and more so, the hanging itself, seemed like a throwback to the medieval times, when people used to derive a kind of sadistic pleasure in watching a hungry beast devour a convict in full public view. Though only 12 people witnessed the final act of justice on August 14, many others were forced to become indirect viewers of the hanging, thanks to the media coverage. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soumyadip Pal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  One wonders whether anyone, be he a supporter or opponent of Dhananjoys hanging, really wished to know details of what the condemned man ate or did not eat on the last day of his life. A mans execution is not a spectator sport, and it is a pity The Telegraph chose to make it one.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir  For the past few months, the media have been bombarding us with the debate over whether capital punishment is right. Why did they never give us the relevant facts and figures of the case on which the questionable verdict was based, until just before the hanging? These would have significantly affected the public opinion and maybe the presidential decision (since even the president is reported to have collected and studied news-paper cuttings before making his decision). 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

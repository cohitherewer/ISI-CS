		 Friday, March 26, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Bleeding out of definitionThe fruit of stone (Vintage,  3.95) by Mark Spragg is a compelling Jules et Jim story set in a Wyoming ranch. McEban, a rancher, has loved Gretchen Reilly all his life; and all his life Benett, Gretchens husband, has been his best friend. When Gretchen leaves Bennett, the two men follow her trail on a strange, fateful journey across Wyoming to Nebraska. The prose is self-consciously sinewy, a mix of Steinbeck and Lawrence: Woody yips and bounces on his front legs, and they look at him. He blocks the bedroom doorway and is anxious for his days labour. His tongue lolls from his muzzle, his brindled body bleeding out of definition in the still-dark hallway.Plagiarised and communalised: more on the NCERT Textbooks (SAHMAT, Rs 80) is an excellent compilation of articles, editorials and reports on the gross violation of scholarly norms by the NCERT in its new history text books. Lifting chunks out of an American author and the ideological distortion of facts are scrupulously documented and analyzed. The purpose is to show how a major component of the present regimes agenda to communalise education has been its assault on history through the instrumentality of the various organizations which are controlled by the Union government. The Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust has also made a similar collection on the Archaeological Society of India.The natural death handbook (Rider,  12.99) edited by S. Wienrich and J. Speyer advises on the practical needs of those dying at home, on how to organize inexpensive yet very personal funerals and on the grieving process itself. It is written sensitively, but without squeamishness, although the extensive directories of natural burial grounds and mail-order biodegradable coffins are meant for the American reader. A useful book, and grimly riveting in patches.Under a cloud: life in cherrapunji, the wettest place on earth (Penguin, Rs 250) by Binoo K. John is a readable little book, the fruit of research and travel. John focuses on Cherrapunji and the nearby village of Mawsynram, and weaves together the past and the present to evoke not only a place, but also a varied human community and its ways of life. Cherrapunjis chequered history is one of 19th-century evangelists and proselytization, the beginnings of education, the earthquake of 1897 and struggles with the colonizers. I have tried to unveil the phenomenon of the rains, writes John, and take the narrative a little beyond just monsoon gazing.

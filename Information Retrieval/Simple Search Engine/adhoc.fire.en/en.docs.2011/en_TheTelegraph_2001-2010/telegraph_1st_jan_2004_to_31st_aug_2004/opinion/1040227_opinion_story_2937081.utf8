		 Friday, February 27, 2004 							 																						OLD WINE IN A NEW BOTTLEUrdu Texts and Contexts: The Selected Essays of C.M. Naim Permanent Black, Rs 495Urdu literature is fascinating as it represents life in general and it also depicts the composite culture of India in a manner unmatched in other literary traditions. C.M. Naims book  a collection of some thirteen essays  offers a closer look at Urdu poetry. The author, an academic by profession, has other publications on the same subject. The present work may interest students of Urdu as well as lay readers, but its appeal to the connoisseurs of Urdu literature would be limited.																														The book is divided into two parts  chapters dealing with poems and those referring to other related subjects. Those on Urdu poetry may assist readers who have little or no knowledge about this genre. The art of the Urdu marsiay, homosexuality in Urdu verse, Rekhti, the works of Iqbal and other poets, and ghazals are likely to give readers a taste of the richness and diversity of Urdu poetry. 																														The chapters on other aspects of this rich tradition offer useful information. There are two essays on Ghalib, one of the greatest figures in Urdu poetry. In one of them, the author translates some love poems of Ghalib word for word. Nothing substantial comes out from these translations as his manner of detailed explication is very familiar to the followers of Urdu poetry. 																														There are certain topics that might interest those who are uninitiated in Urdu literature, and are eager to know more about its history, especially poetry. Certain sections of the book look at mushairas or poetical symposiums, classical literary pieces that won accolades during the British rule, the patronage of Urdu poetry in Mughal courts down to the English, and how the war between India and Pakistan contributed significantly in the output of Urdu literature. One particular chapter provides a general outline on Urdu novel writing, including Nazir Ahmeds unforgettable novels and characters. 																														The book  really an assortment of articles written on different occasions  suffers from numerous limitations. It fails to offer new insights on a subject that has been researched and written on exhaustively. Some topics  like the jokes of Birbal  are out of place. Also, literary elements like drama and criticism have been left outside the purview of the book. The discussion on novels seems incidental. Modern novels or short stories could have been included to enhance the appeal of the book. 																														Naims language also seems disconcerting at times. It is difficult to understand why he titles a chapter, A shamelessly revisionist look or pseudo-dramatic to illustrate some of Iqbals poems which are neither dramatic nor pseudo. The analyses offered do not add much substance to literary criticism. But it may hold some interest for those readers who want to find out more about this versatile literary genre.

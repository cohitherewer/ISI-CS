The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 06, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																For their eyes only				 																																																				Sir  Seema Goswami, like the foreign buyers and fashion-world people of the West she interviews, seems to be in perennial wonder at why Indians are not exploring the Indian market enough (Another designer leap, to Big Apple, May 4). She should know why. Most of the socialites in India wouldnt be seen dead in a Western wear designed by an Indian. They go desi only during shaadis or when similar rituals demand it. That is the time for heavy, gold-bordered, Swarovski crystal-sequinned lehengas to flourish. Some Indian designers cater to this seasonal demand. But for the more ambitious ones like Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Rina Dhaka or Ritu Beri, the West is still the ultimate destination to showcase their talent. It is also by looking through the eyes of the West that Indians here get ready to acknowledge their contribution. If Western buyers hadnt come to India Fashion Week, do you think Mukherjee would have earned as many kudos as he is doing now?Yours faithfully, 
J. Acharya, CalcuttaOn Modis trailSir  The Bilkis Bano case does not shock me, nor the horrifying and shameful acts of the Gujarat state machinery to suppress the truth. The Supreme Courts bashing of Narendra Modi and his government also does not make me glad. My emotions, or the lack of them can probably be explained by the sad plight of the victims of previous riots, say the Bombay riots of 1992-93, which was also a state-sponsored genocide. The Srikrishna commission had clearly pointed a finger at the Shiv Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, for his involvement in the riots. Yet, have the victims got justice? It is disheartening to see that perpetrators of heinous crimes are elected with a thumping majority. And now a man like Modi is campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party to boost the partys performance. Isnt our society sick? Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Return of the native (May 1), is apprehensive about Narendra Modi using the anti-Muslim card in Uttar Pradesh. Subsequent events have shown Modi zealously guarding against the use of such rhetoric. His basic thrust is now anti-Congress, or anti-Sonia Gandhi. But why is Modi made into such a villain? Has no politician before ever used anti-Muslim propaganda to gain popularity? Have the minority community leaders never used anti-Hindu sentiments to consolidate their support? Much is made of the violence in Gujarat. But a pogrom in history has always claimed far more lives than the death toll in Gujarat. Millions were exterminated in Poland and Cambodia. Compared to these figures, the Gujarat statistics is puny. It was Modi who quelled the riots with an iron hand. Had he not done so, the figures would have been truly shocking.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  In this general election, it is not difficult to make a political choice. On the one hand is the Congress which has always considered people from all religions, castes and classes. The Congress has not deviated from its fundamental political ideology for over a century. In contrast, the saffron parivar has changed its stance at the drop of a hat. It has thrived on hatred, revenge and unforgiveness in the name of religion. Yet Hinduism forbids all of these. The choice is simple. The Hindutva forces have to be kept at bay. For their mascot, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is no statesman. He is the mukhota for the Modis and Togadias. For those who believe that Muslim votes have to be washed in gangajal, and test their vision through a carnage like that in Gujarat, cannot be allowed get back power for another term.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I do not believe in exit polls, nor in any single party. All that matters to me is efficient work after the elections. Which is why Indians have no right to spoil the good work Atal Bihari Vajpayee is doing for the nation. Even if the feel good factor is discounted, we cannot forget that India achieved world standards in several of the industries during his tenure. Look at the way stock markets are crashing merely at the mention of the BJP not getting another term. What the BJP could do, perhaps, is drop worthless politicians like Narendra Modi, Uma Bharti and so on who create insurmountable image problems for the party. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The only Hindu of Hindustan, Narendra Modi, has hit the scorching political battlefield Uttar Pradesh in its last phase (Atal woos minorities, Modi follows, April 30). Often hailed as an anti-Muslim politician, Modi is trying to undo the strong anti-minority image of the party. With the elections reaching the close, Modis incessant campaigns in several constituencies of UP, Karnataka and Maharashtra are final touches to the well-crafted policy of the party which, though in power, takes nothing for granted. The propaganda from the communal man himself follows numerous other programmes of the party like India Shining, good governance and so on. It will be interesting to learn from the results to be announced in two weeks time whether Modis magic was able to work outside his Gujarat.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																The unprintable				 																																																				Sir  Gouri Chatterjees weekly column, Via Media is a treat given its wide coverage of issues and wit. Perhaps it could turn its focus to journalistic values in the Indian media. Despite the growing popularity of tele-journalism, the print media continues to register impressive growth. Daily newspaper circulation is now approaching the 60 million mark. But this should not blind us to the fact that 500 million Indian adults do not read any newspaper. 				 																																																				Improved technology, growth of literacy and purchasing power, and aggressive marketing have contributed to the buoyant situation. The seamier side of this growth is the way it has affected the core values of journalism. Pressures generated by competing business groups and political ambition distort such values. News and analysis are manipulated and opinion created to suit the owners financial and political interests. No mainstream newspaper establishment is immune to such practices. The developments pose a danger to socially responsible journalism which rests on the telling of truth in a fearless manner. Can the Indian media claim that there has been no deviance from the principle?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

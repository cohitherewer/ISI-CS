		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 							 																						FISH CURE OR FAITH HEALING? Parimal Bhattacharya																					In an unusual move, the Andhra Pradesh high court has directed the state government to make scientific tests of a miracle medicine that was freely distributed to about one lakh people on a single day in Hyderabad. Popularly known as chapa mundu, the secret potion is administered in live fish that patients suffering from asthma and other bronchial ailments must swallow. Whether popular superstition or a yet-to-be-classified medicinal herb, the ritual has been going on for a long time and people come to Hyderabad for it from far off places every year. The high court directive is unusual in the sense that neither was there any report of food poisoning or other ill effects of the potion, nor was it a case of fleecing gullible people. The judiciary was merely acting on a petition moved by the Rationalists Association of Hyderabad.																					In effect, it is a case of modern science and the state taking on primitive black-magic. Since the days when Western science and rationalism touched our land, riding piggyback on colonialism, state intervention in traditional beliefs and practices has been cautious. One might recall the social reform movements against sati and child marriage, and how the colonial government was forced to make laws against them. But generally, the British rulers were not keen to interfere in traditional non-scientific customs and rituals, not for deference to the colonized, but because it lay outside their imperial agenda.																					State action																					Five decades after independence and despite Jawaharlal Nehrus vision of a scientific temper reigning over our national consciousness, the belief in so-called primitive faiths and practices has not declined. Far from it. Growing communal and caste divisions have ensured the continuance of a cultural belief that may be deemed retrogressive by Western rationalists. Insecurity and loss of identity in urban areas have sown new myths and thrown up new models of mass hysteria like the one about Ganesha sipping milk.																					The role of the state in such matters has generally been passive, or even collusive. On rare occasions when the state did intervene, the results have been counterproductive. 																					A few years ago, when a mysterious and elusive monkey man was stalking the outskirts of Delhi, attacking and terrorizing people, the city police tried to curb the menace by taking out night patrols and announcing rewards. The whole farce later turned out to be a product of mob delusion. 																					The second example is from West Bengal. About two decades ago, when a popular godman died, his followers refused to cremate his body in the hope that their guru would come back to life. A large police force was pressed into service to combat the frenzied devotees and cremate the body. On both occasions, the intervention of the state administration had helped fan mob hysteria.																					Irrational at heart																					Dealing with a bunch of tricksters out to fool gullible masses is one thing very different from taking on the collective faith of one lakh people. Whenever the state posits itself against faiths or rituals that it considers unscientific or retrogressive, it gives them a sort of legitimacy by opposition which strengthens the resolve of the believers. The recurrence of this pattern indicate a truth about our civil society: after more than two centuries in this subcontinent, the modern nation-state and the Western scientific rationalism it espouses, continue to exist at the periphery of peoples cultural consciousness. 																					The failure of the state to eradicate irrational, non-scientific beliefs is exemplified in the outbreak of mythic, shamanistic rituals and devil worships in Russian cities after the collapse of Soviet Union. And as for the Western capitalist states, among the people who thronged the cyber city for a dose of chapa mundu were a number of sahibs and memsahibs.																					The Rationalists Association of Hyderabad would do well to remember this and mobilize demand for a speciality hospital for asthma and bronchial ailments, rather than press for a ban on a strange folk medicine.

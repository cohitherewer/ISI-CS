The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 09, 2004 							 																						DANGER SIGNALS																														The seriousness of the inflation figures is a matter of conjecture. However, there is no conjecture in the government having been caught with egg on its face. Barely 24 hours after the government assuaged fears on inflation, the point-to-point wholesale price index touched a two-year high of a 7.51 per cent increase. This is for the week ending July 24, and does not include the hike in oil product prices announced later in July. Nor does it take into account subsequent increases in the prices of steel and polyester. Therefore, in later weeks, the WPI increase may well touch 8 per cent. That government credibility has taken a hit is evident from the crash in prices of government securities and in the slide of the rupee against the dollar. There is indeed a seasonal element to inflation, and price increases are high at this time of the year. If one decomposes the present increase in inflation, the bulk of the increase is because of the rise in the prices of primary food articles and metallic minerals. The former is indeed related to the lacklustre monsoon. Contrary to what optimistic government economists argue, it may be premature to conclude that the monsoon has revived. Indeed, independent analysts have scaled down real growth in gross domestic product to the 6 to 6.5 per cent range. 																														There is also the matter of global oil prices. Both Brent oil and New York light sweet crude prices have shot up to historic highs, driven by fears of supply disruptions because of the financial crisis which the Russian oil giant, Yukos, has encountered. The Yukos effect may be transitory, but global oil prices are unlikely to drop dramatically, even if Opec expands production. Some cushioning of the domestic price hike is possible if import duties are slashed, but that has revenue implications, and the rupee depreciation compounds the inflation problem. Not just on reduced growth and higher inflation, but also elsewhere, the United Progressive Alliance government seems to have encountered bad luck. The rupee is depreciating and foreign capital inflows are down. While this is partly attributable to bad luck, so far, the government has not done much to inspire confidence. If nothing else, the finance ministers deficit projections are certain to go for a six, notwithstanding the fact that high inflation is good for revenue. But high inflation is bad politically, and the annualized trend rate is inching dangerously close to 6 per cent.

		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 							 																						LEAVE THEM TO IT																														Autonomy is most keenly valued when it is in eclipse. The Indian Institutes of Management have had to expend a great deal of intellectual energy contending with the shadow of Mr Murli Manohar Joshi. So has anybody remotely concerned with the importance of freedom and quality in education. What was at stake behind Mr Joshis bullying the IIMs into a drastic fee-cut was nothing less fundamental than the question of autonomy and fiscal responsibility  their right to govern their own considerable financial resources to maintain academic excellence. Mr Arjun Singh, the new human resource development minister, seems to have put an end to such apprehensions. He has now met the IIM directors to assure them that he believes in their complete autonomy, and that he would safeguard this valuable quality and help the IIMs adopt a graded fee structure, which would accommodate students of merit irrespective of their economic status. This is as it should have been. Such proven and financially self-sufficient institutions as the IIMs should be left to run their own shows. The government, or any political party, should have nothing to do with any aspect of their internal administration or pedagogy. Even supporting them financially does not, in any way, empower the government to meddle with the actual content and process of higher education.																														Yet, the very idea of the HRD ministry safeguarding the IIMs autonomy, of Mr Singh helping, through dialogue, the adoption of a graded fee structure could qualify somewhat this feeling of relief. Even the most benevolent of paternalisms is a form of control, and assistance has to work very hard not to become intervention. Throwing out Mr Joshis idea of a drastic fee-cut, and putting in its place another model for the IIMs to work towards might, in turn, raise questions about the disinterestedness of Mr Singhs detoxification drive. The IIMs themselves are perfectly capable of undoing the damage done by Mr Joshis authoritarianism. To let them do so would be the best way in which Mr Singh can show his understanding of and respect for the notion of what he calls complete autonomy. The operative word here is complete, which is, in a sense, a more difficult word for governments to swallow than the word, autonomy, when it comes to education and culture. And, in this respect, saffron is not the only offending hue. Already the left has shown concern over their share in the detoxification project with respect to the contents of school textbooks. There is a risk again that the notion of complete autonomy may get compromised here.

		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																When did it all begin?				 																																																				Sir  Ashok V. Desai traces the first impact of globalization on India back to 1865 (India in 1865, Aug 17). In a frivolous vein, the first impact possibly took place earlier  in the 1830s. The first steward of the Bengal Club had set up a plant to make ice and obtained a contract to supply ice to the club. He was forced out of business soon by cheap imports from Boston. This is mentioned in the 150-year commemorative volume of the club. And on a serious note, there are shards of china stored in the state archaeological museum at Behala dating from early sultanate times, found in the ruins of Gaur in present-day Malda. The shards carry inscriptions in a proto-Bengali script. Proof positive that the Chinese had already started to become proactive in customizing their wares to suit local tastes. Perhaps an early example of the marketing maxim: Think global, act local.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Partho Datta, Calcutta 
				 																Puzzle behind the smile				 																																																				Sir  In the report, Cracked: Mystery of Mona Lisa (Aug 2), Bruce Johnston talks about Giuseppe Pallantis theory about the identity of the woman who was the inspiration behind Leonardo da Vincis Mona Lisa. I do not agree with Pallantis theory that it is the portrait of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. I have also written to Pallanti saying this. 				 																																																				First, if it is the portrait of Francescos wife, it is surprising that she does not wear a wedding ring. Second, Francesco was a devout follower of Fra Savonarola who once burned paintings along with other vanities. It is difficult to imagine the follower of such a man commissioning the portrait of his wife. Third, there is no mention of the painting in any record during Da Vincis stay in Florence between 1500 and 1506, when it would have been painted according to Pallanti. This would be very unusual for such a famous painting. Fourth, if the husband commissioned the portrait, how did it get into the possession of Francis I, the French king, as soon as it was completed? 				 																																																				Fifth, as recorded by Antonio de Beatis in his Travel Diary, Da Vinci himself told Cardinal Luigi of Arragon when he visited him in France on October 10, 1517 that the portrait was commissioned by Giuliano de Medici. The cardinal and Giuliano were close friends and he would have understood whose portrait it was. It could not certainly have been that of a Florentine housewife. Sixth, Da Vinci was fond of using nicknames. He called his disciple, Caprotti, Salai, or devil. It is possible that the painter and his disciples referred to the portrait as Gioconda, or the smiling lady, by which name it has always been known in France. It was Georgio Vasari who first said in 1550 that it was Mona Lisa. He had never seen the painting and had never visited France where the painting was when he wrote Da Vincis biography. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Devastation at hand				 																																																				Sir  Try and imagine 49 million cubic metres of water gushing forward, with 30-feet-high waves at its head. This is exactly what might happen if the artificial lake created by landslides on the Pare Chu river, a tributary of the Sutlej in Tibet, bursts its banks (Fear of flood cripples life, Aug 19). This can cause unimaginable devastation. The hapless villagers of 56 villages in Himachal Pradesh have no option but to be resigned to their fate because the Chinese refuse to take any action. They are not even willing to let Indian engineers inspect the site. 				 																																																				It is true that controlled explosions to break the dam on the Pare Chu in Tibet, the root of all trouble, will allow the water to pass slowly. But it is not possible to fix several small explosives inside the dam at this stage when the ferocity of water is at its highest and the dam is on the verge of breaking. Further, explosions could cause more landslides, inviting disaster. The present dam is 35 metres high. The authorities should cause artificial landslides with the help of controlled explosions at a distance of, say, one kilometre to make another dam of 25 m height, then another one 15 m high another km away, and one more of 5 m height a further km away. This will control the surge of water gradually. The idea that another possible landslide caused by the surging waters could create a dam which would check the waters for some time is unfeasible. A single dam cannot counter the force of the gushing water which, even when static, broke the previous dam. Only multiple dams may control the force of water.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  What have the Chinese got to be miffed about when Indian authorities made a discreet inquiry about the causes of the floods in Tibet? The euphoria over the 50th anniversary of Panchsheel should not make us forget the lessons from 1962. The Chinese are always complaining if Indian officials meet the dalai lama. Add to this Chinas proposal to lay an oil pipeline either through Myanmar to Sittwe or from southern Xinjiang to Karachi, strategically encircling India. The Indian intelligence needs to watch China more closely.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S. Subramanyan, Mumbai

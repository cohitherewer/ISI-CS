		 Thursday, June 10, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																No better, no worse				 																																																				Sir  Mayavati may feel justifiably aggrieved at the unfair treatment of a poor dalit ki beti, who has been singled out by the revenue department for having amassed a few crores in loose change in her short political career (Mayavati property check, June 8) . She can shrug off responsibility, like her famous sister Rabri Devi did regarding the train dacoities, when she pointed out that lining ones pockets had been an instinct since time immemorial and no one had been able to stop it. Mayavati can at least claim to having declared an income of Rs 1.12 crore, on which she has also presumably paid some taxes. Anyone who has read the reports of the wealth disclosed by candidates in the recently-concluded elections could not have missed the large numbers of candidates with even briefer stints as ministers at the state level or the Centre, and no known source of income, who possess wealth that quite boggles the mind. Indeed, poor Mayavati is really to be pitied more than she is to be vilified or laughed at.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, N.G. Haksi, Ranchi
				 																Business sense				 																																																				Sir  There is a lot of debate going on over the disinvestment of public sector units (Highest common interest, May 28 ). One argument is that the government has no business to be in business and all it must do is ensure that business is conducted in such a way that the interests of both the public and businessmen are not harmed. But does the government own a PSU merely to make profits? Before asking for its disinvestment, we need to see not only how much profit a PSU has made in terms of capital, but also what it has given back to society. After all, the PSUs were intended to fulfil the socialistic ideals of the Indian state, to balance the blind race for profits with catering to the greater good of society. The National Democratic Alliance government had reasons to give the go by to this ideal  Indias foreign exchange reserves were low, and there was the meltdown in the Southeast Asian economies. In a way, disinvestments were warranted at that juncture. In the new scenario, this should change. Also, the governments renouncing its socialist agenda can fuel dissatisfaction among different strata of society. 				 																																																				The PSUs may cost the government quite a lot in subsidies. But that is the cost it has to pay in the interests of a society like ours. At the same time, it should also see to it that those without work do not thrive at the cost of the employed. The left parties and the Congress can do a good job to build on what we have already attained, and see India become a developed country from a developing one. Politically India shining may be doomed, but economic statistics do prompt some optimism. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dhiraj Kumar, Silchar

				 																																																				Sir  The governments objectives in setting up PSUs was to build productive assets in a particular area, as also create jobs. Earning profits was certainly not the primary objective for establishing PSUs. But given the many pressures on the government, it would make better sense if the state withdrew from a PSU once it was running smoothly, leaving it free to focus on core areas. The state should continue to run PSUs in strategic areas or where there is need to perform a strong developmental role  for example, oil exploration, telecommunications and power. Smaller units of little strategic importance may be discontinued. This should be the criteria for deciding which units should be divested  not whether the unit is earning a profit. Why should only loss-making units be divested? Dont they have workers? Should the divestment be seen as punishment to the workers for causing the losses? 				 																																																				If a loss-making unit is divested, in every likelihood a voluntary retirement scheme will be forced on the employees by the new management and the unit will be carved up for sale, in the belief that the value of the parts will be more than the value of the whole. In other words, it will be closed down and its workers retrenched  both these fall-outs would be directly opposed to the reason for establishing the PSU in the first place. On the other hand, if a unit is making profits, its workers will have more bargaining power and no management would upset the apple cart in such a case. It follows that preference when deciding which unit to divest should be given to profit-earning ones. The state would get a good value for the unit as well. Another important consideration is that after the PSU is sold, it will continue to fulfil its economic and social objectives. For this, proper regulations are needed, not state control. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The trade unions have no right to speak on airport privatization as this is a matter to be decided by parliament. If by privatizing, millions of passengers are benefited, at the cost of the workers, it will be welcome since the airports are meant to serve the passengers. As regards the increase in interest on provident fund, if the net revenue of the PF does not permit it, where do the unions think the government will get the funds to pay the higher interest?				 																																																				Also, the Marxists are playing to the gallery by demanding that PSUs should not be sold without the consent of the workers. Who owns the PSUs  the workers or the nation? Do not the comrades know that as a result of government funds being tied up in running a loss-making unit, the poor in the villages must go without water, X-ray machines in hospitals must remain unrepaired, primary schools in villages continue make do with poor infrastructure? The Marxists are definitely not fighting for the rural poor.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Some people say that the reforms must have human face. Is it possible? The telecommunications and information-technology fields are highly competitive. Non-performing or under-performing staff has to be weeded out by the employer for the survival of his business. Unfortunately, the profit motive prevails over human values. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Buzz off				 																																																				Sir  Ashok V. Desais columns are always fascinating. But I would be wary of the anti-mosquito properties of Marmite, lovingly spread on toast, unless, like the wise buffalo, the gourmand sits inside a mosquito net as well (Buffaloes in a mosquito net, June 8). Far safer to stick to G amp;T for lasting prophylaxis. But after Marmite, could the curative properties of the other pillars of the Empire, like Bovril and Horlicks, be worthy of documentation?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

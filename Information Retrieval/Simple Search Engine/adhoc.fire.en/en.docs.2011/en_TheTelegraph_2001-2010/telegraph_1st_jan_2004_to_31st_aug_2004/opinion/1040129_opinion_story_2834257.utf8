The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 							 																						DOING WHAT THE OTHERS DO GOURI CHATTERJEE																					Going by the conventional, and still functional, definition of news  man bites dog makes headlines, dog bites man does not  Doordarshan giving adequate time to the opposition is unquestionably news. 																					Even in a country where 54 per cent of the population is under 25, enough people will remember the excitement generated in the Eighties by the Newstrack video cassettes. That was our first glimpse of opposition leaders walking, talking, campaigning. Despite the growing reach of Doordarshan, the most we had seen of them till then had been grainy black and white photographs in newspapers. 																					DD News was supposed to carry on with that grand old tradition. Even at its launch last November, the DD bosses had gone out of their way to say that government news would surely dominate a government channel. Full marks for honesty, one had thought then.																					Not quite, it now appears  for which they are again being congratulated. Even with the politics of the country revving up in the run-up to the general elections, on most days the line-up of stories on DD News is more or less the same as that on other, private, news channels. 																					DDs come of age, it is being said  except that it begs the question why taxpayers money should be spent on something the private channels are doing just as well, if not better. 																					Lack of bias is, of course, a fine thing for any news organization. But shouldnt DD interpret its public-service remit a little more imaginatively? Like, say, BBC-type news features that commercially-driven private channels find too risky. Or is the government determined to be like the others in this too?																					Struggling in a red sea																					It is still the worlds biggest news organization with an intricate network of journalists spread across the globe, it is still one of the fastest with the news, it is still synonymous with trust, impartiality and reliability. Yet, Reuters today is a story of failure, financial failure. 																					Told by two former Reuters journalists, Breaking News: How the Wheels Came Off at Reuters is a riveting account of the low ranking of breaking news in the business of news. 																					From the assassination of Abraham Lincoln to Stalin dead: official, Reuters landed several hard political news first. Yet, the money it made, and it made enormous amounts for many years, came not from its reporting but through financial services  share prices, selling prices in money-market trading, even a software that provided subscribers with financial data on screen.																					When the bust came  as always because the management stumbled  into the vacuum stepped Michael Bloomberg, a financial analyst who knew what traders wanted better than journalists. Reuters fell back upon its news-gathering business  and it is still struggling in a red sea. 																					You deserve it																					It could have been a case of brilliant media manipulation, except there is nothing to show that Sonia Gandhi or anyone else in the Congress is capable of such precise planning. Though there are rumours that a senior Delhi journalist masterminded it all with the help of PR consultants.																					At any event, even the most cerebrally challenged Congressman would have known one thing for sure: once the Nehru-Gandhi babalog started on their discovery of Amethi, the media would follow faithfully every inch of the way. Not even the diehard Seva Dal worker is as desperate as the media to have the Gandhi siblings in the coming electoral fray, as candidates, as campaigners, whatever. 																					Pity the media. What can it do? The middle class wants to have nothing to do with politics, including elections. Even before television queered the pitch, magazines had seen sales plummet almost every time they put a politician on the cover, whatever his or her standing. No wonder the media goes overboard with the viewer-friendly Gandhi kids. If Priyanka is the Aishwarya of politics, dont blame the media. Readers and viewers get the media they deserve.

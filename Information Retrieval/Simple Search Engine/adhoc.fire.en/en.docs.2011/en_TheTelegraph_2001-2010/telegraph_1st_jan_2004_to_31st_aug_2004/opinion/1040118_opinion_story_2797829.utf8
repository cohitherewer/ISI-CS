		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 							 																						CLASH AGAINST CIVILIZATION The havoc wreaked on the collection  at the Bhandarkar Institute is a symbolic  attack on the values of civilization itself. Civilizations change, barbarians  do not. Like cockroaches, barbarians have endured almost  unchanged through time. The history of the worlds civilization  is punctuated by their ruthless, brainless depredations,  targeted almost without exception at the most significant  symbols of civilizational value, be they art or architectural  treasures or the irreplaceable archives of learning and  wisdom. Surely barbarians have their own indecipherable  history, by virtue of which one event  like the burning  down of the library in Alexandria  can become the archetype  for many later ones, like the devastating attack on the  Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune. One of the  greatest centres in the world for research in Indology with  about 1,50,000 books and 80,000 rare manuscripts, BORI has  not yet been able to assess the exact damage to its collection.  Manuscripts in Sanskrit, Pali and Ardh Magadhi appear to  have been stolen, as have 11th century copper plates, spearheads  and rare artefacts. A clay tablet from 600 BC has been completely  destroyed. The barbarians have also damaged a 10th century  manuscript of the Mahabharata, palm leaf inscriptions  and countless other books and manuscripts. Obviously, all  this is just at first glance. Time will uncover the true  scale of the damage. 																								Such an attack hurts twice over. The raison dtre of the barbarian lies in his hatred of the highest achievements of the human mind, its capacity to learn and its love of learning, its passion to understand experience and to order knowledge, its desire to create, and also the singleminded care and dedication with which it collects and preserves the learning of the past. The rampaging Sambhaji Brigade not only destroyed priceless books, inscriptions and manuscripts, but it also flaunted its disrespect of the finest forms of human activity by bringing to nought the devotion of those who had toiled to build the institution. The brigade, a branch of the Maratha Seva Sangh, has exposed the mindless ignorance typical of the barbarian. It was ostensibly objecting to the help the institute had given to a British scholar, whose book on Shivaji allegedly insults the Maratha heros parentage. The Indian scholar mentioned in acknowledgement had been attacked earlier. Apparently, the brigade felt that the best way to defend the culture it was so passionate about was to destroy its most valuable repository.																								Such brutality is no longer new in India. The dumbing down of the notion of culture, which has been distorted to fit the crudest possible idea of nationalism, has generated a chauvinism nurtured in its many forms by the dominant political powers in recent times. The result is a constant assault on those very liberties, constitutional and civilizational, on which the advance of a nation depends. Today, compromise is part of any crisis management. The offending book has been withdrawn by government order. What should have been the subject of scholarly debate has been hidden away because some barbarians objected to it. Freedom of the mind or institutions like the BORI cannot exist in a land where the lowest common denominator dictates terms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 19, 2004 							 																						YEARNING FOR PEACE																														It is never too late to wake up to the futility of violence. Leaders of the National Liberation Front of Tripura, who have now vowed to give up arms and start a dialogue with the Union and the state governments, are actually following a new trend in the Northeast. It must be attributed to the strength and resilience of the Indian democracy that more and more militant outfits are accepting peace as a better option. It is increasingly being accepted that the provisions of the Indian Constitution and the democratic process can better absorb local aspirations than a culture of militancy can ever hope to do. The peace-talks may have led to new local arrangements, as with the Bodo Liberation Tigers in Assam. In other cases, as with the two factions of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, these may still be inconclusive. But there is no mistaking the yearning for peace even among rebels who wielded the gun for decades. It is possible that many of the issues that prompted these groups to take up arms against the Indian state remain unresolved. But it must be a hopeful sign that an increasing number of them are now disillusioned with their mutinies and are prepared to give peace a chance. 																														The truce in Tripura will be the best thing that has happened in the state since the peace accord between New Delhi and the Tribal National Volunteers in 1988. In no other state in the North-east has the militancy taken such staggeringly high human costs. A movement that was born with the professed objective of protecting the tribals interests degenerated into a bloody tool for sowing hatred and distrust between the tribal and the non-tribal populations. While the militants achieved nothing, Tripura witnessed periodic massacres of innocents, both tribal and non-tribal. And, to add to the states tragedy, political parties sought to exploit the militancy in order to score narrow gains during the elections. Not just their guns and killings, their dangerous liaisons with the parties made the militants a worse threat to peace and democracy in the state. Both the ruling Left Front and the Congress have sometimes tried to make partisan gains from the surrender of militants. It is important, therefore, for both New Delhi and Agartala, to rise absolutely above politics in pursuing the peace-talks with the NLFT. There could well be some NLFT faction that would seek to subvert the peace process. It may be important to ensure that the rivalries between the NLFT and the other major militant group, the All Tripura Tiger Force, do not derail the truce. A holistic approach to peace is needed to take care of the local irritants.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Feeding on love				 																																																				Sir  Why do we have to be so thankful that Lord Meghnad Desai is in love (Love at 63, March 28)? Is it because he is an eminently eligible and evidently rich economist, holding an exalted position at the London School of Economics? Is it because the object of his love is an Indian editor and not another Londoner? Or is it because he worked the chemistry in his sixties (it is strange that we are still circumspect about the capability of males of Indian origin despite V.S. Naipaul having proved it)? Another question. Why is The Telegraph in thrall because the love affair took place over the phone? Whoever told Amit Roy that love strictly required either holding hands or touching one another? There could be reason for the new-found lovers to be on seventh heaven, but does it mean that the entire nation also has to accompany them? Why should we be fed such sentimental stories about what is, after all, commonplace?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,J. Acharya, Calcutta
				 																Bleak house				 																																																				Sir  Mahendra P. Lamas Turning red into green (March 16) shows genuine concern at the somewhat bleak prospects of the tea industry. As someone associated with this industry for the past 34 years, I believe that one of the chief problems of the industry is in its being labour-oriented, which allows it to be manipulated both by the labour unions and various political parties. As Lama pointed out, it is because of this that the uplift of the tea-estate workers never got any importance from the tea-garden owners. In fact, the takeover by the recent management has worsened matters. The corruption in the state administration and judiciary has severely affected the workers. The tea board, the provident fund department of the government, Central excise department, labour department et al are hand-in-glove with the tea traders whose greed now prompts them to flood the markets with bad quality tea in order to maximize profits. Meanwhile, the enormous growth of middlemen has dampened sales, and encouraged either under- or over-invoicing of the produce.				 																																																				The lack of knowledge of the local administration has multiplied the problems of the tea-garden workers. The gardens have always tried to remain in isolation. This isolation has to be broken to reach out to the people. The government and the tea board cannot absolve themselves of their responsibility towards the workers. Nor can organizations like the Indian Tea Association, Indian Tea Planters Association, Tea Association of India and the Terai India Planters Association, which at times hold back information from the government. Finally, one has to remember that tea is dependent on a number of factors. Soil and plant management, machinery and transport facilities, and finance management are vital to the health of the industry.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  In this era of globalization, consumer supremacy and management transparency are driving forces of international marketing. Therefore the willingness of the tea industry to have its produce tested by the Bureau of Indian Standards is a step in the right direction (Tea lines up for quality test, March 17). Arguably, the Indian tea industry has had to part with some of its share of the international market because of intense competition from other countries. The current step will not only help it regain its market share, but its former glory as well. Moreover, link with the BIS is likely to spread quality awareness in the entire tea industry, which would prove beneficial in the long run. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suresh Behera, Ranchi

				 																																																				Sir  It was painful to go through the report, Research prod for tea revival (Feb 5), which plainly showed our ignorance about major problems. The Helopeltis theivora is a major pest of tea plants, not a disease, as the report stated. Further, tea is one of the most developed agro-based industry and research on it dates back to 1893. What the industry lacks today is not science and technology, but professionalism. The mindset that would allow the technology to be put to use is lacking. Which is probably why technical people are never at the helm of affairs in the tea industry, unlike in other industries.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P. Bordoloi, Dibrugarh

				 																																																				Sir  The fallout of the politicization of the tea industry was apparent in the carnage at the Dalgaon tea gardens last year. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions had promptly disowned those killed and dissociated with the disgraced union leader, Tarakeswar Lohar. Yet the fact that the left had been quick enough to hoist red flags on the graves of the killed pointed to their indisputable role in the episode, as in many other violent incidents in the tea-gardens (Red flags on graves of disowned, Nov 11). The greed of tea-garden owners, mismanagement, lack of proper planning, and above all, trade union rivalries and the attempt of political parties to gain control over the gardens have been responsible for the steadily deteriorating situation in the gardens.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Phani Bhusan Saha, Durgapur

				 																Roads end?				 																																																				Sir  Kunal Saha may have decided to pursue his case to the Supreme Court, but will that bring relief to poor and middle-class patients (Kunal crusade crushed in court, March 20)? Medical science cannot be error-free, and diseases that are difficult to diagnose and treat will always leave relatives and patients dissatisfied. Moreover, medical treatment depends upon local facilities.				 																																																				In both the United States of America and Europe, doctors are gradually giving up undertaking high-risk surgeries. Given the current trend, it will be even less possible for us in India to make doctors more accountable in the future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Archana Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The celebration among doctors following the verdict on the Kunal Saha case shows that the medical fraternity does not want to be held responsible for its lapses. But Saha needs to be congratulated for his efforts. It is because of him that the apex court has directed the Medical Council of India to include non-medical members in its board. There is also greater awareness among both patients and doctors.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,K. Srikar Reddy, Berlin

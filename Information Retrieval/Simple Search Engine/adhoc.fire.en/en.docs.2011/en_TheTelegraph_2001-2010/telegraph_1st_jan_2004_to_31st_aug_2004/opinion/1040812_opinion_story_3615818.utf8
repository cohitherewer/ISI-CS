		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 							 																						NO MORE DECISIVE MOMENTS Gouri Chatterjee																					It could have been a tribute to Henri Cartier-Bresson. Three days after the death of the worlds greatest photojournalist last week, Indian Express carried an arresting photograph of a funeral procession making its way past a swollen, turbulent Damanganga river in Gujarats flood-hit Vapi. A fine example of photojournalism that stood out also because it is such a rare sight in todays newspapers.																					The photographer, Vikas Khot, still in his early 30s, is hugely embarrassed at the two names being mentioned in the same breath. But yes, certainly, Cartier-Bresson is his inspiration, as he has been to generations of news photographers.																					That too may soon be a thing of the past. Photojournalism itself is struggling for survival amidst the rising tide of celebrity and lifestyle journalism. News photography has always relied upon eloquently framing human drama. But these days, news managers see photographs as mere decorative elements to brighten up the pages, not as telling devices to convey news. On the other hand, the endless procession of Neha Dhupias opening hookah bars or launching fashion accessories is hardly the sort of challenge that sets cameramens creative juices flowing. 																					Things have come to such a pass that some newspapers (like The Times of India and Mid-Day in Mumbai) are increasingly getting reporters to shoot the pictures  functional pictures shot with utilitarian digital cameras  to go with their stories. 																					Two recent examples of how great the impact of news photographs can be even in this age of 24-hour television, are the two photos that have become emblematic of the Gujarat riots: A Reuters photograph of a tearful Muslim pleading for mercy and an AFP picture of a marauding Hindu fanatic. It is only in these foreign agencies that photojournalism is alive and well. They take the same Indian cameramen (the Gujarat shots, for instance, were taken by Arko Datta and Sebastian DSouza respectively), but give them enough support to come up with pictures that beat their rivals in the Indian press hollow. 																					But such complete domination of the agencies may not be all good news for readers. The primary aim of agencies is to sell the greatest number of single photos to the greatest number of buyers in the shortest time scale. Who knows how many decisive moments, to echo Cartier-Bresson, may be lost forever in the process.																					School of Gautier																					If there is one thing the BJP has always given primacy to, it is the business of media management. But how miserably it failed when the crunch came during the Gujarat riots. The press rounded on Narendra Modi and his band of brothers so virulently that some leaders still believe that that was what did them in at the last elections. 																					Now, help may be at hand, though the hand is of foreign origin. But then, it would be difficult to find someone more Hindu than the French journalist, Francois Gautier.																					To Gautier, the demolition of the Babri Masjid proved Hindus too can fight and the Gujarat riots, signalled for the first time that Hindus were not going to take things lying down. He has lamented the negative outlook of Indian journalists, has scolded foreign correspondents for making out that minorities were persecuted in India, confessed that his beliefs have landed him in trouble with all the newspapers I have worked for.																					No surprises then that Gautiers latest attempt to help his Hindu friends has taken the shape of a school of journalism that will train a new generation of Indian journalists. More, he has appealed to NRIs to send their children to his school so that in a few years time, the entire India coverage in the States could see a very important shift. 																					Only the very nave or the very foolish could have such faith in the power of journalism to change the world.

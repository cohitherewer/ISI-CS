The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																In unholy land				 																																																				Sir The medieval period  associated with superstitions and barbarity  may have become history for the rest of the world, but not for Bihar. The incident of child sacrifice is shocking, even by the standards of the state where rapes, murders and violence raise no eyebrows (A boy for a goat at Gods feet, Feb 15). It is no use blaming it all on superstition, for there is a method to this violence. Most victims of such violence hail from poor families while the perpetrators are affluent, local satraps. For all Laloo Prasad Yadavs call of empowering the Dalits, it has remained a pipedream in his own lair. No need to repeat that low literacy rates, shrinking employment opportunities and political patronage to criminals have worsened the situation. Any attempt to change the status quo is greeted with the language of the gun, as shown by the recent killing of social activists, Mahesh and Sarita. Undoubtedly, Laloo Yadav and his ilk will react to the boys murder with some more empty promises, before returning to their primary task of ruining Bihar beyond repair.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rameshwar Prasad, Calcutta 

				 																True lies 				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta has carefully chosen his words to give undue credit to his favourite Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government for liberalizing the Indian economy (Bye bye, nanny state, Feb 13). In the penultimate paragraph, Dasgupta writes that the socialist economic model  he mentions the names of Indira Gandhi and Jyoti Basu  ran out of steam by the mid-Seventies, although it was another three decades before it was formally junked. But wasnt it the Janata Party government, dominated by former Jan Sangh members, who drove out Coca Cola in the late Seventies and abused multinational companies operating in India at the slightest instance? The statement of economic policy of the Janata Party working committee in 1977 harped on the theme of self-reliance and spurned foreign collaboration, urging that the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act be rigorously enforced in consumer goods industries. The process of liberalization started with the manifesto of the Congress, the party which eventually won the 1991 general elections, explicitly stated the need for a drastic policy change, seeking to liberalize the Indian economy from bureaucratic shackles. 				 																																																				Dasgupta would have us believe that the NDA has been the first party or coalition in governance to think of changing the philosophy of governance from state intervention to state facilitation. It is also dishonest of him to talk of a euphoric middle class and a shining India when he knows full well the magnitude of the problems of poverty, unemployment and corruption in the country. Yet the NDA government is spending the taxpayers money to shamelessly project a cosmetic image of India, to suit its narrow political agenda. In the mid-Eighties, the sale of Bonita, a minor girl from Kalahandi, Orissa, had shocked the nation. Two decades later, politicians supporting the India Shining campaign refused to notice the plight of a one-month old baby whose mother, Sumitra Behera, was forced to sell her for a paltry sum in the same state. Is this called shining on?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Sengupta, Kharagpur

				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta hits the nail on the head when he says-that the Indian middle class has broken emotionally with the third world mentality. I strongly feel that it is high time we got rid of not just our third-world mentality, but categories like the first world and third world as well. Terms like these have come into use in an attempt to supplant the underdeveloped and developing labels, which are highly inadequate and undesirable. These terms are used by developed countries to describe economically weaker nations. Whether money plays any role in creating centres of excellence is debatable, but the fact that India is having elaborate discourses on higher education means that our third world tag should be promptly discarded.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suresh Behera, Ranchi

				 																Fowl play				 																																																				Sir  The mass burial of chickens at the Saint Alphonsus Social and Agriculture Centre, Kurseong, was brutal and unnecessary (Brutal burial fever grips flu-fear farm, Feb 6). First, the internationally accepted humane method of culling poultry is to smother them by sealing them in cloth bags, not to bury them alive. Second, it would seem that the first line of defence against bird flu for uninfected flocks would be strict quarantine from foreign birds, rather than mass destruction. Like all viral diseases, avian flu is self-limiting and eventually, this epidemic will run its course and disappear. A logical extension of the Alphonsus Centres policy would mean killing every single chicken in the world, leading to the extinction of the species. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir The rapid spread of avian flu adds another chapter to the saga of diseases spreading from animals to human beings. It began with the mad cow disease following which millions of cows had to be culled. Recently, numerous civet cats had been culled in China supposedly to get rid of SARS. Problems like these would not have arisen in the first place if men did not consume animal flesh. We must introspect whether we need to devour other species or let them live in peace.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Atanu Dey, Karbi Anglong, Assam 

				 																																																				Sir The report that Jesuits in Kurseong buried alive thousands of chickens was shocking. Have the Jesuits lost their noble qualities? In India, where public interest litigations are filed at the drop of a hat, the silence of our so-called animal rights activists on this issue is disturbing. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prakash Thaker, via email

				 																																																				Sir The exploitation of animals and birds for commercial purposes is the root cause of diseases like bird flu. Fowls are fed with feed laced with medicines to trigger unnatural growth. They are not allowed to move freely or have their natural food. All these factors make their immune system susceptible to diseases, which are easily transmitted to humans beings. These creatures cannot protest against such brutal human behaviour. Men have committed enough excesses on them, and it is time to stop. But human greed knows no bounds, so no matter how much nature gives us, we will still try to milk it even harder.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

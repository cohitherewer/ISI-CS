		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 							 																						SMOKING JOE																														The light is out. At least in public places. From May 1, it has become illegal to light up in public places. The ban on smoking in public places had a long period of gestation but now that it is in place, it can only be hoped that it will not be honoured more in the breach. The law against smoking in public places is one of those whose implementation is predicated upon a well-developed sense of civic consciousness. Even the best friends of Indians cannot accuse the latter of having oodles of this particular variety of awareness. A look at the litter all around, the almost blatant violation by some people of the no-smoking sign in trains, the disregard for traffic rules are all signs that even educated Indians are not particularly prone to obey rules and regulations. The ban on smoking cannot be implemented by policing all public places. It has to be obeyed voluntarily by smokers or be enforced by the public themselves. It should also be noted that the law knows of no exceptions. The powerful political boss, the local mafia don, the famous filmstar as well as the ordinary citizen will all have to stub out their cigarettes when they enter a public place. In many ways, the ban on smoking in public places is a test of the maturity of civil society in India.																														Smoking, it has been famously remarked, is a dying art. The deliberate double entendre in the statement refers not only to the dwindling number of smokers but also to the fact that smoking can lead to death through cancer and other ailments. Smoking harms the health of the smoker and those around him. The adverse effects of what has come to be called passive smoking have now been established. This knowledge  of how dangerous smoking actually is  is not common among Indians. This is a reflection of the lack of education in this country. But even among those who are aware, there are only a handful who have the moral courage to stand up against smokers in public and to demand their right to breathe air that has not been poisoned by nicotine. Smoking is a matter of individual choice and preference, but that choice cannot be imposed upon a collective. Nor should such an imposition, if and when it occurs, be indulged on the grounds of spurious politeness. Smoking epitomizes a clash between an individuals choice and the welfare of the public. Even the most dyed-in-the-wool advocate of individualism cannot argue that in this case the clash should be resolved in favour of the individual. The individual is free to injure himself in his private space by inhaling nicotine, but in a public space he has to abide by the considerations of public health.

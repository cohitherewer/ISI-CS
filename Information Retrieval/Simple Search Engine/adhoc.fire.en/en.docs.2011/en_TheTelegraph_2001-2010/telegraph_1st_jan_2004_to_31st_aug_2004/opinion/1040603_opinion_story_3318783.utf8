The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 03, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Imaginary fears				 																																																				Sir  There seems to be no end to Mamata Banerjees paranoia about security. First, she charged law and order officials in the state with looking the other way when her mother was assaulted by Marxist goons. That charge is yet to be proved true. Now, she has discovered yet another Marxist conspiracy in the Centres move to downsize her personal security profile (Mamata miffed at security snub, May 27). But what is Banerjee afraid of? Unlike L.K. Advani and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, she does not live under the threat of the Inter-Services Intelligence or the Peoples War. Her only enemy is the common man who punished her and her party in these elections for their non-performance. Therefore, the question of a security threat to Banerjee does not arise. Consequently, there is no need for continuing with Z category security for her, especially when the taxpayer has to foot the bill for this luxury. Banerjee should bury her baseless fears and start worrying about the likelihood of her party being on the fast fade out.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Moushumi Sen, Calcutta
				 																Imbalanced views				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitra seems to get a perverse pleasure out of dragging the United States of America into every discussion. While arguing the presence of god in The high horse of free will (May 31), he writes, The Klu Klux Klan was on the rampage in the southern parts of the United States: stories surfaced every day of insensate acts of torture, rape and marauding committed by them. If there were a god, there could be no such specimens abroad. I agree. But why does Mitra talk about such happenings in the US only? Is the killing of nearly two million Cambodians not something to be condemned? And what about Stalins annihilation of his adversaries, including Leon Trotsky in faraway Mexico? Obviously, Mitra thinks that these are glorious deeds as they were committed for the sake of a great cause  the establishment and consolidation of Marxism. 				 																																																				If Mitra wants to be taken seriously, he must shed his jaundiced views. His writings would be appropriate for political handbills meant for party cadre, not serious discourse to engage educated readers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

				 																																																				Sir  This is what an American friend had to say during a discussion on Ashok Mitras The high horse of free will. Aggression is the prerogative of men like George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and John Ashcroft, as also Hitler, Osama bin Laden, Tito, Mao, Julius Caesar, Timothy McVeigh and Koresh  men who believe that what they do is for the good of the world. They are secure in their own logic and they act accordingly. Historically thus, the worst monsters are those who believe that they have a clear understanding of the best way to govern. Perhaps then inaction is the only noble course of action, since everything else leads to suffering. 				 																																																				Also, the problem with American democracy, as with all democracies, is that it relies on an informed electorate, less than half of whom actually go out to vote. But it is impossible to educate large sections of the populace in a society as large as the US. In the circumstances, opinion polls become self-fulfiling prophecies when conducted among the uninformed. Specialization may advance society, but only a specialization in governance prevents a democracy from becoming weak  governors who dont know the first thing about those they govern make it even weaker. It would be best to take Platos advice and be a good citizen. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Samsara Basudev, Maryland, US

				 																																																				Sir  If Ashok Mitra writes in English to enlighten the Bengalis, he should know that the lingua franca of our imperialist rulers is not understood by many youngsters between the ages 20 and 25. If he writes with the American or British people in mind, then he should know that they dont care much about his advice. Men like Winston Churchill need no good-conduct certificate from Mitra. Churchills own countrymen are his best judge. Mitra should concentrate on West Bengal and do his best to improve the condition of the state. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bhaskar Pillai, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is pathetic that Ashok Mitra, an economist of international fame and whose regular columns in the eminent Economic and Political Weekly are so eagerly awaited, should write such thoughtless pieces.

				 																Man of the moment				 																																																				Sir  In his first term as finance minister in the United Front government, P. Chidambaram had introduced many reforms which ended up helping corrupt politicians, businessmen and officials (Merchant of reforms, May 29). This lot must surely be happy now that Chidambaram is back in the ministry. The voluntary disclosure of income scheme, which he had introduced with much fanfare in his first term, was actually an acceptance of the governments inability to ensure corruption-free, good governance. It amounted to penalizing honest tax-payers. Hopefully, Chidambaram will not re-introduce the VDIS again . 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

				 																																																				Sir  With P. Chidambaram and Manmohan Singh in the cabinet, the nation can hope for a reforms policy based on good economics rather than political exigencies. The National Democratic Alliance government could not implement many of the recommendations of the Kelkar committee or make effective use of the VDIS introduced by Chidambaram to eliminate black money. On the other hand, both Chidambaram and Singh, when they were finance minister, had heeded the advice of expert-committees like the one headed by Raja Chelliah on tax reforms and revenue increase. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Agrawal, Dariba 

				 																																																				Sir  P. Chidambaram seems to have learnt a lesson from the VDIS fiasco. The proposed tax information network to track tax defaulters, sounds promising. But Chidambarams refusal to use harsh measures in the crusade against black money shows that he is still a little wet behind the ears.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Diya Sen, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Dont go by the report				 																																																				Sir  When West Bengal produces a report, one has to remember that there is always more than what meets the eye. Take the states first human development report, drawn up collectively by its development and planning department in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, the Planning Commission and several NGOs (Peace positive in quality of life survey, May 20). Human development is conventionally measured in terms of literacy, employment and per capita income. While it is alright to factor in other important issues  the security situation in the state  one cannot account for the emphasis the report puts on the state being an oasis of peace. It is almost like trying to deflect attention from more serious issues like primary education, basic infrastructural facilities and malnutrition. The crime rate may be low in Calcutta, but does it make a difference to human development elsewhere in the state, especially that of women?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ashish Mazumdar, Calcutta
				 																																																				Sir  In Gratitude has a short half-life (May 8), Ashok Ganguly rues that, In our euphoria about the liberation of Bangladesh and the resurgence of Bengali culture, art and ethnicity, we have overlooked the stronger pull of religion fuelled by economic backwardness. He then goes on to say that Shaheed Suhrawardys dream of a united Bengal turned into a nightmare owing to these factors. Is the economic backwardness of east Bengal in Suhrawardys time one of these factors? Ganguly is perhaps going too far back in the past to analyse a problem that has cropped up only recently. Take religion. When East Pakistan seceded, did it not deny the pull of religion? 				 																																																				Ganguly has also criticized the Bangladesh government for pushing hordes of its own citizens as economic refugees into India. It is well-known that there are many illegal immigrants, including Indian ones, in developed countries. What happens if some day the governments of these countries accuse India of pushing its citizens into their country? People immigrate to other countries in search of better prospects, and this is often done illegally. Rich countries try and stop such inflows by maintaining a strong vigil on their borders, but cannot stop the influx completely. Look at the flow of illegal Mexican immigrants into the United States of America. 				 																																																				Ganguly also makes a very sweeping remark  that Bangladeshs very emergence as a nation was made possible by the generosity and support of its large neighbour. First, constant reminders of a large neighbours pro-active help to a small neighbour in distress may take some of the shine off that magnanimity. Second, Indias support accelerated the liberation process, but to assert that without it liberation would not have been possible for Bangladesh, is to make a wrong assessment of the situation. It is to belittle a liberation struggle that was accompanied by great sacrifices.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Ganguly should have highlighted three issues affecting India-Bangladesh relations. First, no serious attempts were made by New Delhi to sanitize Indias border with East Pakistan at the time of Partition. This resulted in hordes of people crossing over to India and upsetting the demographic balance. Second, anti-India rhetoric has always been the staple of Dhaka. This has been further fuelled by Indias half-hearted measures to address North-east Indias development problems. North-eastern rebels have always sought sanctuary in Bangladesh as freedom-fighters. Dhaka has extracted maximum mileage out of this. Third, to expect Dhaka to be grateful to India for being its saviour in 1971 is wishful thinking. For India has traditionally been a soft state. It cannot tackle terrorist strikes sponsored by Bangladesh. The Pyrdiwah-Boraibari outrage in 2001, for instance, when bodies of Border Security Force jawans came back badly mutilated from across the border.				 																																																				Bangladesh can choose to ignore India because all that the latter is capable of are a few ineffective verbal protests against Dhakas offensives. Also, Bangladeshs closeness to Pakistan, China and Myanmar has boosted its status vis--vis India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  India has only itself to blame for its worsening ties with Bangladesh. Had it not tried to bully and throw its weight about in regional bodies like the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or tried to solve the water dispute with its neighbour more amicably and trained an ear to Bangladeshs changing ground realities, it would still have had a friendly neighbour.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																Look whos talking				 																																																				Sir  Given the impudent remarks made by Biman Bose against the decision of the Election Commission to post poll observers from outside West Bengal in the state, it is a wonder that he should have been granted anticipatory bail by the chief judge of Calcuttas civil and sessions court (Bail for Biman, May 13). He has been asked to surrender before the court by June 10, but it is unlikely that much will come of it. Bose and his cadre are aware of their clout in the state. That is precisely why he had the temerity to direct his cadre to drag poll observers by the scruff of their necks. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arati Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is a shame that despite being a senior politburo member, Biman Bose can behave so irresponsibly. While inciting party workers to insult poll observers, he chose to forget that these officials had been constitutionally appointed by the EC. Manhandling them is tantamount to taking the law into ones hands. Boses behaviour makes it evident that there is a near breakdown of law and order in West Bengal. Bose should be penalized for his unruliness.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge

				 																																																				Sir  Complaints of malpractices, booth-capturing and rigging by opposition parties are a common phenomenon. Yet this time the chief election commissioner decided to treat West Bengal as an exception and poll observers were brought in from outside the state. But are polls free and fair in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh? If not, why werent such measures adopted in these states as well? Biman Boses comments and observations about the EC cannot be supported, but more for its form than for its content. The first information report filed against Bose may be justified, but how many FIRs have been filed against other offenders from other political parties? Why has action against Lalji Tandon been kept pending?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Tridib Roy, Calcutta

		 Friday, April 16, 2004 							 																						OLD WINE IN OLD BOTTLEBurial at Sea By Khushwant Singh, Penguin, Rs 275
If there is a point on which Khushwant Singhs admirers and detractors are liable to agree, it is this: that he shouldnt make promises he had no intentions of keeping. A couple of years back, the Great Sardar had sworn that his memoir, Truth, Love amp; a Little Malice, would inevitably be my swansong. Obviously not. Despite its shortcomings, the autobiography contained some fine writing with incisive, if not-so-flattering portraits of celebrities we secretly enjoy reading and speculating about. Whatever be the readers views on the work of this writer, journalist and editor that many love to hate, profess not to read and avidly devour  his latest fictional offering, Burial at Sea, is likely to evoke a universal response: ennui.																														Those looking for a glimmer of the promise revealed in Singhs first novel, Train to Pakistan, would do well to avoid it. The writer they had discovered in that work is no more, nor likely to be resurrected. Whats more, aficionados of the gossipy, malicious and voyeuristic outpourings that were, subsequently, to become Singhs trademark will have just as much reason to mourn. For Burial at Sea is old wine gone sour in a not-so-new bottle, a rehash of the authors usual ingredients put together with tired indifference.																														The tale of Victor Jai Bhagwan, the Eton- and Oxford-educated Kashmiri industrialist; Jaishree, his pale, frail, here-today-dead-tomorrow wife, with her ignorance of Western ways; Bharati their headstrong daughter, (her brisk, no-nonsense manner reminded many of the prime ministers daughter who often accompanied her father on his tours), and sundry other characters appears to be a thinly-fictionalized account of the Nehru-Gandhi saga. This is peppered with exotica in the voluptuous shape of Ma Durgeshwari, a female tantric loosely styled on Shraddha Mata, the god-woman with whom Jawaharlal Nehru is alleged to have had an affair. Theres a pet tiger thrown in for good measure. Swami Dhananjay Brahmachari, with glossy black hair curled down to his shoulders and his jet-black beard, puts us in mind of another Swamiji  Dhirendra Brahmachari  whose televized appearances in the Seventies made him an important ingredient of Indira lore. The reader is not too sure whether Nair is Krishna Menon, Singhs pet aversion from his days as an information officer at India House, London. Mahatma Gandhi plays himself, but comes across as one-dimensional  like the rest of the cast.																														For those itching to know, the novella is replete with descriptions of explicit sexual encounters. Thats par for the course with this author. What isnt so is their insipidity in this book. For despite the claims of its publishers, Burial at Sea is hardly vintage Khushwant Singh. And one can only hope that the nonagenarian, famed for his once-wicked sense of humour, was merely jesting when he reportedly declared at the launch of this book that I still write because I still can.

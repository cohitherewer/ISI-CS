The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 15, 2004 							 																						FOOTHOLD IN THE HILLS Sudipta Bhattacharjee																					Come elections, political expediency assumes curious forms and mechanisms. In the North-east, where horse-trading is a way of life, the past few days have witnessed a scramble for party tickets in ways that resemble the theatre of the absurd. 																					In the predominantly Christian states where the Bharatiya Janata Party was a non-entity, the party is now a much-sought-after ally. Take Arunachal Pradesh, where Gegong Apang led his merry men into the saffron fold en masse after wresting power from Mukut Mithi of the Congress. In Nagaland last year, chief minister Neiphiu Rio unseated S.C. Jamir, the longest-serving Congress chief minister and roped in the BJP, which won the first seats in the state as an ally in his government. His confidence in the national partys support has even resulted in his giving the BJP a go by in allocation of tickets for the parliamentary elections. In yet another Christian-dominated state, Mizoram, chief minister Zoramthanga has established an enviable rapport with the Centre. 																					New tag																					In Meghalaya, where a vast majority of the tribals are Christians, BJP legislators have not only been elected, the party has just witnessed a surge of defections from regional affiliations. The latest celebrity to join is the daughter-in-law of late parliamentarian G.G. Swell, former actress Sheba Diengdoh. Her husband, former minister Sanbor Swell Lyngdoh, is set to join the party and may well become the BJP nominee for the Lok Sabha polls. He stands a fair chance since sitting member of parliament of the Congress, Paty Ripple Kyndiah, is considered too old and ineffective by many. 																					The regional parties have surprisingly opted for the low-profile S.L. Marbaniang, a politician in hibernation. Given the propensity of the electorate in the hill state to go by individual stature rather than party loyalty, the Shillong result could well spring a surprise. It will certainly require more than Sonia Gandhis campaign capers (her bamboo pole vaults enthralled onlookers in Guwahati) to see Kyndiah home. With the electorate desperate for a change, the BJP, which is backing P.A. Sangma in Tura, should manage to cash in on the anti-incumbency factor. 																					Congress observers are concerned because the Garo Hills is home to Sangma, who is trying to retain the seat for a record fifth term. With the Election Commission depriving him of the Nationalist Congress Partys clock symbol (accorded to the rival Sharad Pawar faction) last week, this Garo stalwart initially opted to contest under a new tag  the Peoples Nationalist Party and set his heart on a budding rose for a symbol. 																					Will the lotus bloom?																					However, on Saturday, he merged with Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress to form the Nationalist Trinamool Congress, with her flower with grass for a symbol. Sangmas diminishing fortunes and waning vote bank can be attributed to his changing parties with the alacrity of a chameleon. Such is his desperation that he spared no thought for the eight elected NCP leaders in the state. His only hope is the Congress decision to field PWD and taxation minister Mukul Sangma, who, by no stretch of imagination, can match Sangmas larger-than-life image in the Garo Hills. Should Purno Sangma romp home, it would mean another seat in the NDAs kitty.																					In last months polls to its three district councils, whose results were expected to be the precursors to the outcome of the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress emerged a clear winner but without any significant gains. To add to the gloom in the Congress camp, the sitting Congress chief executive members of both the Garo Hills and Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council elections lost the elections. Simultaneously, the BJP made a silent debut in the council polls. Whether one attributes the change of heart to clever marketing strategies or the lure of largesse, it is the NDA that is set to gain, be it a budding rose, the grass flower or the lotus which blooms in the abode of clouds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 08, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Sibling psychology				 																																																				Sir  Will Atal Bihari Vajpayees filial affection for J. Jayalalithaa save her the blushes at the hustings (Atal goes national to save sister from local tormentors, May 6)? The blots on Ammas tenure  from the undemocratic crackdown on her rival, M. Karunanidhi, to the corruption cases pending against her  have been a few too many. Her promise of making Tamil Nadu the most developed state in India is far from being realized. Political love has the briefest of shelf-lives. Who can say that an electoral debacle later, the puratchi thalaivi and her new-found brother wont be back to bad-mouthing each other?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Nishant Goel, Calcutta
				 																Up in smoke				 																																																				Sir  Finally, someone is thinking of the non-smokers of the world. The Union health ministrys decision to implement the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003, is welcome (Puff in public, pay from today, May 1). This directive has made public places  including conveyances, offices, educational institutions, hospitals, auditoriums, amusement parks, courts, libraries and restaurants  out of bounds for smokers. But this should be taken a step further to stop the production of all tobacco items. For production creates markets. If the market for tobacco is kept alive, how can consumption stop? Strict vigilance is also necessary to prevent corrupt administrators from using the new act to fleece people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  The ban on smoking in public places and even advertisements of tobacco-related products is no mean achievement. Governments have always been scared to rub the tobacco lobby the wrong way. Since smoking is largely a social vice, smokers should also be counselled about the consequences of their addiction. Strangely enough, the governments social activism has not progressed beyond smoking to drinking, which leads many to crime. Most liquor companies freely advertise their surrogate products. Alcoholics should be treated on a par with smokers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Ireland, the first country in the world to outlaw cigarettes in restaurants and pubs, has reported a drastic fall in the number of heart attacks. India has a lesson to learn from this. The government should straightaway ban the manufacture and sale of tobacco-products, ignoring the pressure from the influential tobacco-lobby. The government expenditure on tobacco-related diseases could not be less than the revenue earned from the sale of tobacco products. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  Only the incurable optimist will believe that the ban on smoking in public places will serve any purpose. Smoking has already been banned in public vehicles, but that has not deterred people from smoking inside auto-rickshaws. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul 

				 																																																				Sir  Most young adult smokers take up the habit to emulate their screen icons. Celebrities must take their social responsibility seriously and refrain from smoking in public places or on television.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avinash Gupta, Bandel

				 																																																				Sir  I have been smoking for 25 years, my father for 40, and my grandfather for over 60 years before he quit. If any one of us dies before 90, we shall certainly not blame the cigarette-makers for it. Why go after a minor evil like smoking, when there are bigger killers  malnutrition, pollution, unsafe water and rash driving  on the prowl? Also, if smoking in public places must suddenly be banned, shouldnt smoking zones be mandatory too? The blanket ban on smoking means that now ticket-checkers will only be too glad to allow railway passengers to light up for a small fee. And what about the vigilantes who are smokers themselves? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 17, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																No need to argue				 																																																				Sir  The release of Karan Razdans Girlfriend finds the Shiv Sena doing what it does best  crying foul against quot;anti-culture quot; and indulging in arson (Sena boys cant stand Girlfriend, June 15). But in the ensuing confusion  the sainiks trading charges with the film-industry liberals who believe in the freedom of expression three significant points seem to have been lost. First, far from being a daring and honest depiction of lesbianism, Girlfriend portrays lesbians as abnormal and unhappy people. So the films latent message fits in with the Senas attitudes to homosexuality. Second, our self-appointed culture-police have no right to stop the screening of the film or stone buses carrying posters of the film. Violence has no place as a form of protest in a democracy. Finally, the localized nature of these protests clearly indicates that the majority of Indians feel there is nothing offensive about a film which explores a taboo subject, even though in a dubious way.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Rajendra Sen, Calcutta
				 																Mountain out of a molehill				 																																																				Sir The tone of S.L. Raos article, Playing up the worst (June 7), came as a surprise. Rao seems to expect moderation and decency from the likes of Sushma Swaraj  expecting her to be bothered about the plight of widows in India and about the consequences of her widow act in case Sonia Gandhi became prime minister. He also expects the seniors leaders in the Bharatiya Janata Party, like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani, to restrain lesser members from going berserk. He should know better. Vajpayee has always chosen to remain silent when the occasion demanded he act as prime minister, giving an impression of silently condoning the words and deeds of a Modi or Togadia. His pathetic appeal to Narendra Modi to follow raj dharma after the Gujarat pogrom is an example. In any case, there is a method in the BJPs madness. While lower-rung leaders go about spreading fear, the seniors maintain an image of respectability by making soothing noises. Advani, for instance, said just the right things to the foreign media: Gujarat was an aberration. Instead of being fooled by the partys doublespeak, one should understand what it stands for  the politics of hate and divisiveness, which all right thinking Indians should stand up against. As for petty politicians like Swaraj, they deserve to be treated with contempt.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bhaskar Ganguly, Agartala

				 																																																				Sir  Given the recent political developments, Sushma Swarajs actions require a deeper interpretation. Swarajs choice of protest, however outrageous, is the result of the political turbulence at the Centre and proves that the maxim, drastic situations need drastic measures, is correct. After all, our freedom-fighters did not shed their blood to pass on the reins of the country to a foreigner. Swarajs statements may not present Hinduism in a favour- able light. But the opportunism of the present governing class compelled her to adopt such wild means.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

				 																																																				Sir  By mixing up satyagraha-like protest with the unjust treatment of widows, S.L. Rao has created confusion. Shaving off ones hair is an established mode of protest, renunciation or even devotion. When a Jain muni or a devotee at Tirupati gets rid of his hair, will Rao say that he was keeping alive an ugly tradition? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dinker Charak, Chicago, US

				 																																																				Sir  S.L. Rao is wide of the mark when he alleges that Sushma Swaraj wanted to don the mantle of a widow if Sonia Gandhi became the prime minister. Rao should know that Rana Pratap slept on the floor and ate gram after he lost to Akbar. Similarly, in the Mahabharata, Draupadi vowed to leave her hair undone until Dushyasan was killed. Also, Kautilya kept his choti untied until the Nanda dynasty was overthrown. Thus, the things which Swaraj threatened to do are not necessarily practised by Hindu widows only. Gandhis abdication shows that Indians can never accept a foreigner as their prime minister.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramesh Parida, Delhi 

				 																On the backfoot				 																																																				Sir  The report, Council of CAs no-balls Sachin (June 9), has baffled all those who knew Sachin Tendulkar to be a cricketer with a clean image. As someone who is studying to be a chartered accountant, I am not inclined to believe that the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, which is renowned for its transparency, could have faltered in its judgment. While one cannot suspect the credibility of the councils decision, one finds it incredible that a person of Tendulkars stature would go to the extent of accusing M. Bhatkhande of financial irregularities. Before millions of fans shift their loyalties, Tendulkar should issue a clarification to remove this blot from his otherwise impeccable career.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

				 																																																				Sir  The ICAIs dismissal of Sachin Tendulkars petition against his former chartered accountant was uncalled for. Instead of approaching the ICAI or the courts, the police should have been called in to look into the alleged irregularities, to solve the problem once and for all.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The media, along with the followers of Indian cricket, should wait for the Bombay high court to deliver its judgment before putting the blame on either the star cricketer or the chartered accountant. Commenting or drawing conclusions on a sub judice matter is a habit which we, the citizens of India, need to do away with if we believe in the rules of civic behaviour.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Komal Singh, Calcutta

				 																Errata				 																																																				The report, Doctor honoured (Metro, June 15), on Dr Anupam Dasgupta overlooked the fact that Dr Dasgupta is already a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh. The Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians, London, which he will receive on July 7, is a new honour. The error is regretted.

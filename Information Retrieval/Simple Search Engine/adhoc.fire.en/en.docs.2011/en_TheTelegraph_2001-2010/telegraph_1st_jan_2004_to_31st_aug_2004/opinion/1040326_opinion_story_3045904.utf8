		 Friday, March 26, 2004 							 																						RITE OF EXCHANGE																														Human rights have long been a sore point with China. After all, Tiananmen Square and the decision to open up to the world do not go well together. But things have moved on a great deal since 1989. Chinas massive presence and its possibilities as the glittering land of promise have given it a formidable stature in the world of global trade. It has unhesitatingly said it will stop bilateral dialogue and exchanges with the United States of America, since the latter has suddenly decided to request the United Nations human rights commission to condemn Beijings human rights record. This is not the first time such an exchange has taken place. It was evidently understood that the US would hold its peace after China had promised to improve the record while joining the US in its war against terrorism in 2001. But the US has seen China backsliding since 2002, and feels it can no longer wait. In spite of the fact that China has released a democracy activist, a Tibetan nun, and reduced the prison term of an ethnic Uighur businesswoman recently, extra-judicial killings and repression of political and religious dissidents have blotted its record. These are the token releases China is adept at. The US-based Human Rights Watch has listed abuses against political dissidents, religious believers, labour activists, tenants rights advocates, people with HIV/AIDS, alleged separatists in Xinjiang and Tibet, and North Korean asylum seekers. Forcible eviction of tenants has become a serious problem in expanding urban China, while over-secretiveness has proved terribly damaging to the HIV-positive population. The outbreak of SARS highlighted the dangers of secretiveness and repression of the media.																														The nervousness about Chinas joining the war against terror in 2001 had been founded on its tendency to identify terrorism with separatism and religious extremism. Its repressive practices and violent human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang, the latter against Uighur Muslims struggling for cultural survival, are much older than 2001. But Chinas readiness for confrontation with US on the matter of human rights is quite explicable. Chinas authority is founded not only on its status as a major market, but also on the fact that the USs rights record can be questioned too. Its abuses may not be so obvious, but they are spread out wider in the world  in Afghanistan and Iraq, among Afghan soldiers kept in cages at Guantanamo Bay, to take some recent examples. There is absolutely no doubt that China has to go a very long way for a just and non-repressive society. But the US is not the ideal inhabitant of the proverbial glass house either.

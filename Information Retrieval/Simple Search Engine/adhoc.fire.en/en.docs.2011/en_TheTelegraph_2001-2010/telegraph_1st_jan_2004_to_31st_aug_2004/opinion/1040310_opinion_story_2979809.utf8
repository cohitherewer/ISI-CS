Why the skyline needs to be maintained is fairly obvious, you would have thought, but sometimes we need to ponder on the obvious as well. 																					Take the Taj Mahal, for example. The beauty of the building rests on the hue of its marble, that glimmers and reflects light as it changes every moment of the day. When the sky is pitch dark, the Taj glimmers against the dark black background in the light of the solitary moon. The sky is like a curtain that showcases the Taj  at early dawn, against the night sky, the Taj suddenly emerges out of the darkness as the first light of the sun falls on it. At dusk, as the sun sets, the Taj is infused by a golden pink hue of the setting sun before it plunges into darkness and oblivion. This daily play of light on the Taj and the clear blue sky are the perfect backdrop for this marvel in white marble.																					Between the minarets																					Several years ago, a TV tower was being built on the opposite bank of the Yamuna. The tower could be seen clearly, standing between the two minarets that frame the Taj on the right side. Letters to the press and to the Archaeological Survey of India saved the world-famous view  the favourite photograph of families and couples throughout the world. Imagine a TV tower peeping out at you in the frame of the Tal Mahal. The government responded very fast  but there are countless other tragic stories, in which the skyline of the historic building has been lost and disturbed.																					We need to see the building in the manner that it was meant to be seen, that way all visitors get an idea of the location, the splendid shape and form of the buildings, and can glimpse at the view intended by our grand old builders. 																					The tragedy of the corridor between the Taj and the Red Fort in Agra was that we would have lost the vision that Shah Jahan had in the last 7 years of his house-arrest at the Red Fort, and his view of the tomb he had built for his favorite wife, Mumtaj Mahal, that was to be his final resting place. Thank god the government stopped the corridor and the building of a shopping mall that would have smattered the view of the Taj with shop-signs and advertisements for pizzas and hamburgers. 																					Seeing history																					Muhammed Shah assumed the Mughal throne in late 1719 and requested the able statesman and astrologer, Raja of Jaipur, Sawai Jai Singh Kachhwaha (1699-1743), to provide Delhi with an observatory. The observatory was built in Delhi around 1725 in an area south of the walled city of Shahjahanabad known then as Jaisinghpura, now part of Delhis Connaught Place zone. The fabulous and awesome designs of the structural instruments constructed in brick and plaster make them a photographers favourite, even today. The observatory held a special place in the history of Delhi as it introduced a sense of science and aesthetics in a fast growing metropolitan city. But unfortunately, several modern skyscrapers in the area, that were given sanction by the government, came up around this historic complex.																					These high-rise buildings have destroyed the relationship of the sun with these gigantic instruments, and Jantar Mantar can no longer be used for observing the stars, planets and our passage through the universe.																					Think of Victoria Memorial or your favourite historic building, and you will know why we need the space around a historical building to showcase the historic structure, to reveal to us the many layers of history that constitute our cities and towns. As we traverse our cities from home to work, while taking visitors to see our favourite sites, the buildings need to stand out against the sky so that they can speak to us of bygone eras.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 21, 2004 							 																						SOUP AND JASMINE TEANeha Sahay																					Summers finally here, with the temperature up to 32 degrees. The streets of South Chinas newly developed coastal cities offer vivid contrasts. The women are, as usual, dressed to kill: in spaghetti straps or even bare-shouldered, wearing outfits that look like swimsuits, with skirts or shorts that barely reach the thighs. With clothes down to the minimum, theres even more need for protective umbrellas, for fair skins are valued highly here, with every beauty product having a whitening agent.																					Like the women, the men too shed their clothes: bare chests or vests rolled halfway-up and loose shorts are the order of the day. But most of the men who nonchalantly cross the road or relax in restaurants half-undressed are locals, probably with small businesses of their own. For the large number of migrants who come to these coastal cities from the interior to work, going to work in a pair of shorts isnt an option. All they can do is curse the weather and long for their cooler, but less economically advanced hometowns, amid cups of jasmine tea and bowls of a surprisingly delicious cold sweet soup made from boiled green moong.																					Water in the hills																					The South has always been hot, but the process of opening upto the West, which began after Mao died, has affected the climate too. What are now modern cities were tranquil fishing villages till the Eighties, when it was decided to transform them into urban centres to comprise the Special Economic Zone for foreign investment. Broad roads, highrises and sweeping shopping plazas replaced fields, hills and streams. For some strange reason, shady banyans along the roadside were replaced by short palm trees. Obviously, the South is far hotter today than it ever was, you realize as a cool breeze surprises you even at noon, if you happen to be in the shade of whatever remains of the hills of old.																					In this part of China, climbing hills is a regular activity, sometimes related to old festivals, sometimes to religion. Buddhist shrines can be found on the top of many hills, some of them built just a decade ago. But mostly the Chinese climb hills just for fun: steps and little resting places have been carved into almost every hillside.																					But in this heat, only those people climb the hills who need to fill water from the springs which still flow there.This water is valued highly as being good for health, and its not uncommon to see Hyundais and Passats drive up to the hillsides just to fill one two-litre container from taps which yield a trickle of spring water.																					By the seashore																					The favoured sport of the season is swimming. Like climbing hills, this sport is also accessible to the ordinary Chinese, at least to those who have the time for it. Swimming pools can be found in almost every neighbourhood; every big school and housing complex has one. Anyone with 8 to 10 yuan to spare can swim for as long as they want, with hotels and gyms charging between 15 to 25 yuan. Its not uncommon to find residents of upmarket residential complexes and the security guards of these complexes cooling off in the same pool.																					As with swimming pools, so with ice creams. Unlike in India, there arent two categories of ice-cream  the small cart for the common man and the big brands for the rich. Prices range from 1.5 to 5 yuan for all ice creams (except hard-to-find designer brands such as Haagen Dazs and TCBY). But foreigners have two major problems with Chinese ice cream: finding an ice cream which tastes like its expected to, and being able to distinguish chocolate ice cream from the universally favoured red bean flavour, and not mistaking green tea ice cream for pista or mint.																					Swimming pools and ice-creams are for all, but not air-conditioners. Strangely, ceiling fans are not the norm here. But here too, theres a remedy for the vast majority: nights out at the sea front. Hordes of ordinary Chinese families escape the stifling heat of small apartments to sleep, lulled by the cool sea breeze, on newspapers spread out on the wide grassy stretches that line the sea-front promenades. They go home at dawn, and by 8 am, the grass has been swept clean.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 05, 2004 							 																						WRONG TUNE																														Singing a different tune before elections is familiar stuff for politicians. But when a man of music does that, the notes can be discordant. Mr Bhupen Hazarikas entry into the Bharatiya Janata Party has not quite been music to the ears of the Assamese. Until recently, the singer and the saffron party had viewed each other with more suspicion than anything else. For most of the Assamese, the BJPs politics of Hindutva contradicted everything that their musical hero stood for all his life. But people change and Mr Hazarika may no longer cherish the same leftist political ideals that he once championed as a leading member of the Indian Peoples Theatre Association. However, what he professes to promote to this day is communal amity. Some of the songs he is best remembered for have the same message. Mr Hazarika may still claim to believe in all that, but that is bound to sound a little jarring now. In fact, his joining the sangh parivar looks more like a negation of the political creed that is supposed to have inspired his music. There is yet another reason why his decision has surprised and even revolted a wide cross-section of the Assamese. The BJP leadership apparently was not sure of his worth: it ignored a plea by Assams cultural groups last year to choose him as a presidential nominee for the Rajya Sabha from the state. Mr Hazarika has not covered himself in glory by surrendering to the party that snubbed him and the Assamese people so openly.																														For the BJP too, the move may actually be counter-productive. The party, which is busy drawing stars of all kinds to its fold, obviously wanted to cash in on Mr Hazarikas popularity with all sections of the Assamese. But the party seems to have played its cards wrong. Assam would have felt proud of the musician if the BJP had offered him a Rajya Sabha berth. But by claiming him as its own, the BJP has completely misread the states response. The result could well be the opposite of what the saffron strategists may have calculated. Given Mr Hazarikas own background and the BJPs recent indifference to him, the singer can be a liability for the partys prospects in Assam in the coming general elections. And the miscalculation comes at a time when the BJP is struggling to retain its alliance with the Asom Gana Parishad. If the AGPs new president, Mr Brindaban Goswami, is sceptical of continuing the alliance, it is because the party is far from happy with its experience of the alliance. Electoral arithmetic may still force the two parties to strike some deal. But a cloud will hang in Assam over both Mr Hazarika and his new-found party.

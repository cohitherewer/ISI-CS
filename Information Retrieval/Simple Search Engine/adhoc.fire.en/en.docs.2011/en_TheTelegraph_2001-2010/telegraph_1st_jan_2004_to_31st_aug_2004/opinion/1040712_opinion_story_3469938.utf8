The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 12, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Leading from the back				 																																																				Sir  As Harsud, a small town in Madhya Pradesh, faces the prospect of a watery end, one thought that one would find the mercurial Medha Patkar holding forth there, mouthing curses at global MNCs and the government (Wheres Medha, ask Harsud oustees, July 8). Instead, Patkar is somewhere in Maharashtra spreading her word among other gullible villagers. Her disappearance proves that making the right noises in front of the media is one thing, while being present at the hour of crisis is quite another. It also raises numerous questions about the nature of developmental activism in India. Millions are being pumped into the development industry and everyone, including activists and socialites, wants to have a share of the gravy train. It is more important to be seen voicing pro-poor, anti-establishment comments than doing anything concrete for the displaced. In the process, the work of other less famous but truly committed activists is being ignored. We have had enough of Patkar and her ilk. Can the media talk about some real heroes instead?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Tridib Sen, Calcutta 
				 																Made in Bihar				 																																																				Sir  The railway budget presented by the railways minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, was just a populist gimmick (Wheel plant on home turf, July 7). At a glance, the budget looks good  it has not raised the prices of railway tickets or freight charges. Traditionally, railways ministers have always been partial to their home states while presenting the railway budget. This is true of the present minister as well. Yadav allotted two new factories  a wagon factory in Jamalpur and a wheel-making factory in Chhapra  to Bihar in addition to the introduction of five new trains out of the fifteen announced. 				 																																																				Bihar is notorious for ticketless travellers, unauthorized train halts and rising crime. But Yadav has not done anything to discipline the users of railways in the state. Neither has he offered Mumbai, where trains are vital for intra-city communication, any largesse to improve the system. One suspects that the more useful ideas, like khadi and kulhads, came from experts and not the biased Yadav.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agarwal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Off the Rails (July 7), analysed the railway budget in a pragmatic manner. The budget has made development less of a priority. Nearly 50 per cent of the income of the railways is spent on salaries, pension and incentives like free rides for the staff. As a result, allocating resources for the re-laying of railway lines, modernization and introducing safety measures is proving to be difficult. 				 																																																				The hike in diesel prices means that the railways will have to incur additional expenditure. As it is, passenger fares are being subsidized from earnings through freight. It would have been prudent to increase passenger fares marginally to balance the books. But if ticketless travel were curbed, even this increase would become unnecessary. New trains will only hamper the movement of goods trains and put more pressure on the numerous railway tracks and bridges that are in need of repair. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  By deciding to stay away from the parliament when Laloo Prasad Yadav was presenting his maiden railway budget, the National Democratic Alliance has proved that it is an irresponsible opposition. The NDA must understand that the role of the opposition is not limited to staging walkouts and criticizing the ruling party. It should participate in parliamentary proceedings and work constructively towards solving the problems of the country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sagnik Dutta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  No matter which government comes to power at the Centre, Karnataka in general, and Mysore in particular, are always subjected to neglect by the railways ministry. What happened to the Bharatiya Janata Partys promise of doubling and electrification of the Mysore-Bangalore rail track? The former prime minister, H.D. Deve Gowda, demanded the betterment of railway services for his home district Hassan alone. Mysores long-standing demand of a Jan Shatabdi train was not met by Laloo Prasad Yadav. These facts only go to show that politicians across party lines are only interested in developing their home bases. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Syed Tanveeruddin, Mysore

				 																																																				Sir  The people of Orissa have been let down by Laloo Prasad Yadav. While Naveen Patnaik asked for an allocation of Rs 650 crore for the railways, Yadav earmarked only Rs 307 crore. Although the state government had asked for four new trains, only one  the Orissa express  has been introduced. Orissas economic development depends on improving its railway infrastructure. The lack of Central support would mean that development in the state would be stalled. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rahul Jajodia, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir There was no need for the NDA to describe the railway budget as tasteless, odourless and colourless. The NDA railway budgets could not match this one in terms of innovation. 				 																																																				However, the real test for Laloo Yadav would be the issue of security. Ordinary people can survive an increase in fares but they cannot afford to lose their lives. Yadavs tenure has already been marked by a surge in train robberies and murder, especially along the Bihar stretch. The minister needs to do something to prevent passengers from losing their lives and property. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The striking feature of this rail budget is its concern for the poor and the needy. It includes numerous concessions  free second-class travel for unemployed young people travelling for Central government interviews; a 75 per cent discount in fares in sleeper classes to widows of defence personnel and haemophilia patients; concessions for escorts of deaf and dumb persons. But a pro-poor budget is not enough. Laloo Yadav must tackle other problems  corruption, for example  to free the railways of some ills. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, Murshidabad

				 																																																				Sir  Laloo Prasad Yadavs lofty announcements will soon make the economic condition of the Indian railways similar to Bihars. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dipak K. Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It would have been better had Yadav decided to maintain punctuality of and safety standards for the existing trains rather than introducing new ones. A special railway protection force of non-Biharis should have been created to ensure passenger safety while passing through Bihar. Mercifully, Laloo Yadav has not provided for unreserved passengers to have free access to the sleeper class.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sudarshan Nandi, Midnapore

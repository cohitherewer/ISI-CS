The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 							 																						HEALTH SHINE																														It will not be difficult to find plenty of people in West Bengal who would look upon free healthcare, however short-lived, as manna from heaven. There are many who cannot afford private healthcare, and have no choice but to avail themselves of what the government offers, no matter how infernal the quality of these facilities. These are the people who are targeted by the exceptionally lavish three-day swasthya melas being funded by the Centre in every parliamentary constituency in Bengal. They are usually low-key health camps, with a budget of around Rs 40,000 for each. But this year, the Centre has allotted Rs 8 lakh for each constituency. With Bengal having 42 constituencies, more than three crore rupees will be spent on these melas this year before the elections. Even a single eye, heart or blood check-up may come to the desperately poor as a boon, never mind if there is no follow-up. Therefore it would not occur to the hapless beneficiaries of such melas that taxpayers money is being used to give politicians yet another forum in which to conduct their pre-poll munificence campaigns.																														The secretary of the Indian Medical Association in Bengal has already criticized how doctors have been pushed out of the limelight in these melas by loudly self-advertising members of parliament, suddenly eager to project themselves as embodiments of medical reform and charity. Most of these melas have now become regional and small-scale electoral battlegrounds for rival MPs from the Trinamool Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party and Communist Party of India (Marxist). Mr Sudip Bandopadhyay, for instance, who is the MP from the Calcutta North-west constituency, was being hailed as the symbol of progress on the dais at his local health fair. The fact that, in Bengal, it is the government and the party-political machinery that are primarily responsible for the criminal backwardness of the health sector can be totally obscured by the way these events are managed before the elections. Politicizing the propped-up, feel-good face of health in Bengal is therefore doubly ridiculous and hypocritical.

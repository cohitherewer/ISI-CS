				 																																																																														 First the winners. The Congresss isnt entirely a one-woman show, never mind the miles traversed by madam and her children. The man to whom the party owes much of its taj is Ghulam Nabi Azad, who took on the combined might of Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh. Before he snatched the mouse away from Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra, where he was the AICC in-charge, Azad had worked his magic in Karnataka four years ago. He had then been tried in Kerala and Uttaranchal, in both of which the Congress had a bumper yield. But then factionalism got the better of the partys affection and he was shunted out to Jammu and Kashmir as its state party chief. Here again, the Congress finished ahead of the PDP. And now, with the Congress sweep, he seems all set to replace his bte noire as Sonias right-hand man. But what is the secret of Azads success? His way with the Congress worker, it is believed. Azad, unlike the typical Congress boss, takes along the party worker with him, shuns mobile phones and air-conditioned comfort. He has for them a little smile and soothing assurance that in good tidings, they will be looked after. But that is, of course, provided he is looked after. He will be, wont he, Ms Soni?				 																																																																														 Its all in the mind, stupid. This seems to be the current position of the countrys left, but obviously, their less-gifted compatriots in the states are having problems with the new posturing. A hilarious situation arose during the election campaign in Kerala when the CPI(M) gen-sec, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, while addressing a public gathering, is supposed to have asked people to support the Congress to oust the fascist and communal BJP. The party cadre, who was translating the speech from English to Malayali, was so shocked that he decided to quietly drop the reference to the rival Congress. Meanwhile, the Congress CM of Kerala, AK Antony, had been asking people to listen to Jyoti Basu, who had said he would support Sonia. Hope the politburo take pity on its cadre and resolves the matter, once, if not for all time to come.				 																																																																														 Dial R for Prime Minister. The myth of the letter R goes like this. All former prime ministers had the letter in their names, starting from Jawaharlal to Atal Bihari. Sonia Gandhi, quite certainly, does not have the magic letter, but those astrologically-inclined in the Congress insist that since madams name is incomplete without a Shrimati or Mrs added to it, she also fits the bill. As you like it!				 																																																																														 The price of arrogance, and it is not the BJP alone which had to pay it. In Chhindwara, Kamal Nath had fought a lonely battle against his rivals this time. He is supposed to have told his supporters not to show their faces after they lost the assembly elections. Loyal supporters that they are, Deepak Saksena, Prem Narain Thakur and Harbans Singh thereby deserted him. Party leaders like Arjun Singh, Digvijay Singh and Motilal Vora, despite their personal differences, joined hands to ensure Nath was left isolated. Naths supporters were allegedly packed off to other constituencies. Apparently, till the last day, Kamal Nath kept ringing the state Congress chief, Subhash Yadav, for help. As the results show, Nath must have been made to eat his words.				 																																																																														 Among those in the firing line for the BJPs outstanding defeat is S Gurumurthy, the Chennai-based chartered accountant who wears his sangh affiliation on his sleeve. Supposedly, it was Gurumurthys persistence which had led to the sundering of ties between the BJP and the DMK, and consequently with the DMKs allies. Amma may have had her own reasons to go with the NDA, but it is again Gurumurthy who is believed to have sold the idea of allying with her to KS Sudarshan and LK Advani, who chose to forget that Amma had not spared a thought before pulling down the government when she had been part of the NDA. Then why blame Gurumurthy alone?				 																																																																														 Now that its all over, Arun Jaitley is supposed to be contemplating going back to the law practice he had abandoned, much to the chagrin of his family (not the saffron one). Good luck! 				 																																																																														 Some extremely articulate Congressmen were discouraged from putting up a TV appearance by Ambika Soni. She had drawn up a list matching categories of partymen with categories of private channels. While the favourites were reserved for prime time, others were sent to regional and second-rate newsrooms. Apartheid, it was alleged. Already?				 																																																																														 Now for the losers. The blame game has already begun in the parivar, and the one facing the brunt of it all is Pramod Mahajan, the supreme architect of the last assembly election victories. Mahajan is now being blamed for having sabotaged Sharad Pawars entry into the NDA, which would have allowed the right to sweep Maharashtra. If the grapevine is to be believed, it was Mahajan who, fearing a dilution of his status as the foremost representative of the state in the NDA, leaked news of Pawars dalliances with the saffronites. Mahajan is also accused of having virtually monopolized the media campaign which, it is now alleged, showed a total lack of imagination. There are also allegations that in complete defiance of M Venkaiah Naidus directive that the party president alone would be responsible for fund collection, Mahajan went about collecting doles from industrialists to finance the mammoth party campaign. Be that as it may, the thing that can be said about Mahajan is that he is the first of the saffron faces to have openly acknowledged defeat on camera. No mean task that!

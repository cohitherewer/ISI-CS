The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 07, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Missing in action				 																																																				Sir  Nobody is contenting the fact that the actor-turned-member of parliament, Vinod Khanna, had not enthralled the masses in his heyday. But if he thinks he can continue doing so even now, he is sadly mistaken. When he had pledged to turn his constituency, Gurdaspur, into Paris once he was elected  and this was just six years back  it was surely not a mistake to have taken his words literally (Paris twist in Khanna script, May 3). But the ordinary voter could not have known then that he actually meant to change Gurdaspur into the Paris of World War II, when major parts had to be rebuilt. Even if he were to defend himself by saying that he had been misunderstood, he should explain why people for whom he has apparently done a lot prefer to call him a gumshuda MP. Perhaps he should let his trips to 20 countries in just one year and his frequent surfacing at inane political functions like the Mahashakti Bharat Sangeet Sandhya do the explaining on his behalf.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S.K. Bedi, Calcutta
				 																Little appreciation				 																																																				Sir  In his article, Rise and shine (May 3), S. Venkitaramanan has expressed doubts about the rupees rise against the dollar. Crucial to this dynamic is the increased inflow of remittances in foreign currency. When foreign exchange reserves in India had hit an all time low, the government of India had offered special interest rates to non-resident Indians for keeping their money in foreign currency in fixed deposits. The interest rate was much higher than what local foreign banks would offer. For years, NRIs have deposited their dollars and pounds in Indian banks. The money has gone into swelling Indias forex reserves.				 																																																				But now that our reserves are overflowing, should India continue to entice NRIs with higher returns on their dollars? Bulging reserves and the consequent appreciation of the rupee is hurting our exporters. The rupees rise has to be checked and discontinuing the NRI deposit scheme is one way out. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  A strong rupee has its disadvantages. Apart from benefiting the few industries that rely on imported raw materials and machinery and the rich who have an appetite for products manufactured outside India, a rising rupee is expected to hit most sections of business and industry. Exports will become dearer, thereby reducing the competitiveness of our goods and services in foreign markets. A natural outcome will be loss of jobs.				 																																																				The Reserve Bank of India should not remain a passive spectator to the changes. It has to maintain an optimum value of the rupee. The United States of America will always want a strong rupee in its own interests. We should remember that China, one of Indias main rival economies, is not revaluing its currency. This makes India less competitive in the international market.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajeev Bagra, Baidyabati

				 																																																				Sir  S. Venkitaramanan is right in apprehending that a strong rupee may not be a good thing for the Indian economy. But the Reserve Bank of India has limited options in arresting the trend. With dollar inflows steadily increasing, there is a limit to which the RBI can mop it all up. If it intervenes in the market to keep the rupee from rising, imports will become costlier and rising domestic prices of fuel will cause inflation. On the other hand, if the rupee is allowed to appreciate, export earnings will become unremunerative. The RBI has an unenviable task of trying to strike a balance between the two.				 																																																				Given that few lucrative avenues exist for the proper deployment of forex reserves, Venkitaramanan has a feasible solution in the RBIs lending at better rates to Indian corporates through Indian commercial banks. This will be better than lending to the US at lower rates, as it is doing now. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The argument of S. Venkitaramanan that a strong rupee is not in Indias interest seems to contradict the current economic trends. With a stronger rupee, reprocessing and re-exporting capital goods to other countries trading in dollars would change the whole profile of our country as a low ended, low-priced third world exporter. We should also remember that this rise in the rupee is really a correction. The rupee is actually trying to find a level in a market-driven global economy, seeking a parity with the earlier market value that was undone by a series of devaluations.				 																																																				Another thing. Indian exporters are a pampered lot and in all these years have not paid much attention to brand development or modern technology. A rising rupee should actually benefit the industry in getting loans at lower rates in the international markets, thereby forcing Indian banks to lower bank rates. This will pave the way for cheaper funds for infrastructure and agro-development. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																At whose cost?				 																																																				Sir  On May 1, my 15-year old daughter, Oishi, who has cerebral palsy and is totally wheel-chair bound, was being taken to Calcutta from Chennai by her mother on Jet Airways. At the Chennai airport, my wife had requested the airlines to provide ambulift to enable Oishi to board the aircraft. Carrying her physically would be a humiliation for both Oishi and her mother, besides, lifting her along with wheel chair through the stairs would be an unnecessary risk. However, the airlines told her that she had to pay Rs 2,500 for the ambulift. We have never heard of such a demand during our frequent air travels with our daughter. When my wife challenged the airlines, they showed her the document issued by the Airport Authority of India which proved that the AAI charged the airlines for the ambulift service. This was surprising since Javed Abidi, who is contesting the elections as an independent candidate from the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, won a Supreme Court case that made it mandatory for airports to provide ambulift for the old, ailing and disabled. I would like to draw the attention of the aviation ministry to the lapse. It is supposed to provide ambulift to the disabled free of cost just as it is duty-bound to provide free drinking water and free use of toilet.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

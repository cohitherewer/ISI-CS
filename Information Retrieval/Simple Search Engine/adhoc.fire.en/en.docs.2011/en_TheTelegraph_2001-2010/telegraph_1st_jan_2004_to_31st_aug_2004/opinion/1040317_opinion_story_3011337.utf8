		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 							 																						POWELL POWWOW																														The unexpected is seldom the staple of diplomacy. The most effective diplomatic gains are those that are low-key and incremental. Thus, the smoothness of the visit of Mr Colin Powell, the secretary of state of the United States of America, to India should not take away from its importance. The apparently routine visit only confirmed the stable nature of the present state of Indo-US partnership. This partnership has been formed through arduous backroom work on both sides and also against odds. Washington has a history of pro-Pakistan tilt which became more pronounced in the run-up to the war against Afghanistan. India, despite its apparent discomfiture, did not show any knee-jerk reaction. The Indian government looked at the long- to medium-term in which an investment in a US friendship would bring rich dividends. The US too was not without appreciation for the support it got from India in the war against global terror. The US also could not ignore Indias geopolitical importance as a counterweight to the emergence of China as a major economic and political player. The Indo-US relationship is not based on the fragile turf of ideology but on the recognition of mutual needs and interests. Mr Powells visit only underlined this.																														Mr Powell reassured the Indian side that outsourcing or any other issue will not be allowed to derail Indo-US relations. He rightly pointed out that in the era of globalization, loss of jobs and other kinds of dislocation were inevitable and that his government would work to minimize their impact in the US. Two obvious issues dominated the discussions that Mr Powell had in India. One was the decline of cross-border terrorism and the revival of the peace process between India and Pakistan. The other was the clandestine nuclear network headed by Mr Abdul Qadeer Khan, a Pakistani scientist. The second subject will be the most thorny issue that Mr Powell will have to tackle when he goes to Islamabad today. There is an evident disapproval of the manner in which the matter was swept aside after a token pardon by the Pakistan president, Mr Pervez Musharraf. There is no certainty on the US side that the entire network has been uprooted root and branch. This, together with the appreciation that Mr Powell expressed over the progress of the peace process, would have been music to Indian ears, especially those who have been enthusiastic about Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayees initiatives to establish a durable peace with Pakistan. For the first time in many years, such a peace appears a possibility because uncle Sam is keeping his hawk-like eyes focussed to make the doves fly over the subcontinent.

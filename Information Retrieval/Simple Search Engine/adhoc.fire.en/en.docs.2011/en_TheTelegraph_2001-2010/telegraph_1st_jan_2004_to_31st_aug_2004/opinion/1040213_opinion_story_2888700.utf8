		 Friday, February 13, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Old tales with new namesMalgudi Adventures: classic  tales for children (Puffin, Rs 199) by R.K.  Narayan is a ragbag of excerpts from old classics. Most  of them are from Nara- yans novels  The Man-eater of  Malgudi, The Guide, The Bachelor of Arts,  The English Teacher. There are also three, originally  called Uncle, Naga and Nitya which have been given  new names like Cobra for a Companion and A Tryst at the  Temple to suit the current palate for intemperate alliteration.  The common ground for all these fragments and tales is the  enchantment of Narayans legendary town. The last excerpt,  from The Bachelor of Arts, is about the dawning of  love between Chandran and Malathi on the banks of the Sarayu. The splintered mind: understanding  schizophrenia (Penguin, Rs 295) by Vijay Nagaswami  is a useful primer written to commemorate the 20th anniversary  the Indian Schizophrenia Research Foundation in Chennai.  The dedicatees are ten million Indians who suffer from this  illness and to the staff of SCARF. Then, rather ambiguously,  the author adds, May their tribe increase! After dispelling  the myths about this illness, he goes on to discuss its  causes and outline its medical, therapeutic and legal aspects.  The book provides a reading list and a list of psychosocial  intervention facilities in India.Blue is the colour of heaven:  a journey into Afghanistan (Penguin, Rs 250)  by Richard Loseby is an account of travels through  Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq in the late Eighties,  driven by what remained of Losebys childhood fascination  with that part of the East: As a child in Australia, I  remember my father knowing a few things about Afghans. Like  the Aborigines, he would say, they were tireless walkers.  They knew how to ride a camel and a horse if need be. They  also wore baggy trousers tied up with rope and enormous  hats on their heads like piles of laundry. Vaastu for health, wealth and  happiness (Full Circle, Rs 195) by Raakesh  Chawla is a very entertaining book which explains how  T-shaped abodes cause adultery, a large mirror helps build  confidence in your child, how one must breathe several times  through ones right and left nostrils before conjugal sex  in order to produce boys or girls, etc. There is also the  story of the vaastu cow. The book is highly recommended  by two eminent CEOs, a prominent Congressman and a former  speaker of the Lok Sabha.

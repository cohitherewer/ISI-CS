The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 27, 2004 							 																						SUCCESS COMES AT A PRICE neha sahay																					The worlds largest transfer of population within a country has just got over. About a billion Chinese have travelled to their homes to be with their families for their most important festival, the Lunar New Year, and then back again to the cities where they work. A majority of these travellers are migrant labour, Chinese villagers who come to the big cities for work. Most can afford to make the long journey back home only once every three or four years  that is, if they can manage to recover the back wages due from their employers well in time before the new year, if they can afford to shell out the bus and train fares, and finally, if there are enough tickets left after the blackmarketeers have had their fill.																					This year, the government cracked down on employers, mostly in the booming construction industry, who hadnt paid workers for months. But despite arrests of blackmarketeers, tickets were hard to come by. Two enterprising policemen decided to make the most of the situation. Driving just two prisoners in their huge vehicle all the way to a distant court seemed such a waste when hundreds of people were desperate to go the same way. So they parked their van outside a bus-stand and sold seats to weary workers. Unfortunately, they were caught.																					Unlucky money																					This year, bus and train fares went up much more than 20 per cent, like in the bad old days before Qiao Zhanxiang, a lawyer appalled at labourers having to pay two months salary for a ticket, went to court against this officially sanctioned practice. Since then, public hearings have decided the hike, fixing it at about 20 per cent. But no such hearings have been held in many places since 2002.																					The only fares that didnt increase during this period of mass celebration, were plane fares. But well-heeled Chinese grumbled that the hefty discounts available the year round were not offered during the new year. 																					Other worries tormented the rich: the prospect of a fortnight of winning and dining prompted one businessman to hire a heavy drinker to drink for him. Psychiatrists report an upswing of cases every new year, as many successful members of the new elite confront the prospect of shelling out thousands of yuan to the children of their extended families. Like our Diwali baksheesh, tradition demands that children be paid lucky money, a token amount of cash during the new year. Over the last decade, this token amount has also been increasing, sometimes going up to four figures. With the new one-child-generation growing up, this burden might ease some, while another begins. Already, single children aged as little as four have been found hiding money instead of handing it over to their parents.																					Cash rich?																					The weeks just before the new year are peak crime time as the poor and unemployed, desperate to go home, make a bid for mobile phones, wallets, even handbags from unwary commuters, specially foreigners, at bus stops. Unlike urban Indians, itching to lynch a pickpocket, the Chinese simply look away, too afraid to confront what they fear may be an organized gang. Foreigners have now learnt the rules: dont carry too much cash; put your mobile in an inaccessible pocket; and avoid using it on the road. 																					But this year was special for some foreigners who went to live with Chinese families who had volunteered to host them so that they could experience a real Chinese new year. This new year was also different for south China, where a lingering cold wave saw temperatures drop to 5 degrees. That hasnt kept crowds off streets, though. One can spend hours gaping at Chinese women and children turned out in the most eye-catching winterwear: sequined scarves, stylish knit caps, elegant overcoats, knee-length boots, most of it amazingly affordable.																					New Year was, of course, quite different during Chairman Maos time. Villagers then couldnt migrate to cities for work unless allowed to by the Communist Party. They stayed in the countryside and worked on their collective farms. The only travelling they did was to each others homes, and the only lucky money they had to give was one or two yuan.

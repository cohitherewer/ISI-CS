The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 							 																						BATTERED AND BRUISED Parimal Bhattacharya																					Six-year-old Ishani Bhattacharya, a student in the first standard of the Sunny Preparatory School in Calcutta, was caned by her teacher recently. After her teacher allegedly beat her with a heavy ruler, school has become a nightmare that she refuses to visit again. Her family reported the matter to the police and a case was filed. But the matter took an ugly turn with the school authorities claiming to have a memorandum signed by 300 guardians contradicting the incident. Why should so many guardians join hands over an incident that they did not witness? Or for that matter, why should a six-year-old lie about her teacher?																					But first, let it be said that Ishani is not alone in her misery. A few weeks ago, a schoolteacher in Hooghly district locked up two pupils inside a trunk and left for home. Although the high court has recently banned corporal punishment in classrooms, children are routinely exposed to it. The incidents largely remain as silent, painful stories of the victims growing up years because of the shame and humiliation involved. Ishani too was reluctant to speak out, till her family found out.																					Spare the rod																					The Pratichi Trusts report on the state of primary education in West Bengal had exposed the caste prejudices that still exist in rural classrooms. One wonders why there are so few detailed studies on the abuse a child suffers in schools in the name of discipline. Is it because of our cultural conditioning? From Rabindranath Tagores autobiography to Satyajit Rays Pather Panchali, cane-wielding tutors people our cultural landscape. We perceive them as an inalienable part of early school life. Of course, in reality, kind-hearted and loving teachers far outnumber such fearsome prototypes. But the tale of one Ishani Bhattacharya can undo the good work of thousands of schoolteachers who cope with meagre resources and over-crowded classrooms everyday. More important, it reflects some of the larger maladies of the system.																					Thanks to the Left Front governments experiment with language at the primary level, the last decade has witnessed a mushrooming of private kindergarten and nursery schools in the city and the districts. Born out of purely mercenary interests, these auntyniketans feed on the middle classs aspiration for English medium education. Most of them lack proper buildings, playgrounds, infrastructure and  most important  trained teachers. Low salaries and poor service conditions often ensure that teachers fail to fulfil the responsibility of introducing young minds to the joys of learning. Naturally, fear and pain become popular teaching tools in classrooms.																					Save the child																					Since salaries of schoolteachers were raised, the government and the party in power never miss an opportunity to crow over this fact and to remind teachers of their duties and responsibilities. Codes of conduct for teachers have been introduced at the primary and secondary levels. But they cover only the state-aided schools. The government has no control over privately-run pre-primary and primary schools. Perhaps the state primary education minister, Kanti Biswas, will repeat the recent advice of the health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra, to shun private nursing homes. Unfortunately, such an attitude cannot wish away the reality.																					The sight of children weighed down by heavy school bags, or travelling in cycle vans like caged poultry, is part of our daily urban landscape. Calcutta ranks high in the number of schoolchildren suffering from lung ailments due to air pollution. Stress-related psychological disorders among children receive little attention, until a suicide makes the problem explode on our face. For the state to wake up, some form of activism on our part is imperative. Unfortunately, there seems to be a politics of silence and even complicity between the system and the people who allow their children to be its daily victims. The traumatic episode of Ishani carries a message. If children like her are battered in the name of education, then we are doomed because they are the future of our society.

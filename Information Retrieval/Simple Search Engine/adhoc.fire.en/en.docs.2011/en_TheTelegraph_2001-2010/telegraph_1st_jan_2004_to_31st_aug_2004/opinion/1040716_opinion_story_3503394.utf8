		 Friday, July 16, 2004 							 																						STORIES FOR THE NEW WOMAN				 	 Into the sunset																														Down-market romantic fiction is a large part of the book market. It accounts for nearly 10 per cent of book sales in the metros. The readers are housewives who come from all social groups though they are unlikely to be highly educated. Romantic fiction of the Mills-and-Boon-kind (widely translated in Hindi for film and TV serials) followed a predictable trajectory  boy meets girl, they fall out, come together and live happily ever after, or as happily as most married couples do. Now, with the rise of feminism, this simplistic format has changed. The woman has a mind of her own, she is no longer prepared to live in a dolls house.																														Take the earlier format before going on to the new. Both hero and heroine had to be the sort of people you would like to meet in real life. The heroine did not have to be beautiful but she had to be young, in the mid-twenties, with a mind of her own, and one which had not been made up on a range of subjects. She need not be a career woman, but should have a job of sorts which she enjoyed, even a high-powered, unfeminine-sounding one like a commercial airline pilot; a doctor instead of the usual nurse, in a big hospital; a TV producer; even a garage mechanic.																														The hero was simply a man women dream about. He didnt have to be handsome or a millionaire. But he couldnt be too short or fat or bald. He should have a compelling personality and be an achiever. In shorts, he should have a strong character. No woman would dream of marrying a wimp, but he should not be too demanding or aggressive.																														As for dialogue, it should be short  three lines or so, and to the point. Characters must speak for themselves instead of the author doing it for them in the narrative. Given the readers profile, she would often remember dialogue better than paragraphs of the narrative. Also, dialogue makes the transition to film easier because the role of the script-writer is somewhat diminished. 																														Whats changed now is the heroine. She is not just a pretty face; she is determined to get her way. She has had affairs, could well be divorced and her workplace is what would have been an exclusively male preserve a decade ago  she could be a CEO, a police officer, a banker, a chartered accountant. And as the terms of the relationship shift, she grows defiant, while the hero mourns.																														Antagonistic couples are brought together because there is no such thing as Miss Right; and if Miss Right does appear, it is hand-in-hand with Mr Wrong. In short, the woman is shown as the dominant partner who has to be asked before expressing an opinion. And the woman is no delegate of the international womens movement; she is middle class, with a conventional education. If the relationship breaks up, she doesnt have any hard feelings; it is the man who mopes and goes around like a zombie.																														Also, she has no special interest in the equality of sexes; she is simply a feminist who has withstood patriarchal oppression. The big question at the end of day is whether the changed format sells. Yes, it does, because it is in keeping with the new woman who has come out of the closet and is now to be seen everywhere.						RAVI VYAS

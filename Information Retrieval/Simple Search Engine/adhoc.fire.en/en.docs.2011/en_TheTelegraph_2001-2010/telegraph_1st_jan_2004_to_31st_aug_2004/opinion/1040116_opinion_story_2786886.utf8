		 Friday, January 16, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																A thief who always told the truth A Letter From India: Contemporary  Short Stories From Pakistan (Penguin, Rs 200)  edited by Moazzam Sheikh gathers a number of different  voices  most of them highly complex in their modernity   in Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, Siraiki and English  fiction written in Pakistan and the Pakistani diaspora.  Haunted by the Partition and the 1971 war, but going beyond  these defining moments in the history of the nation, the  stories explore filial relations, sexuality (with astonishing  candour and particularity), dream-lives and decadence through  a wide range of linguistic and narrative modes. Such distinguished  men and women of letters as Intizar Husain, Talat Abbasi,  Ikramullah, Ashu Lal, Muhammad Umar Menon, Fahmida Riaz  and Javed Shaheen are collected here, in crisply readable  translations. Charandas chor (Seagull,  Rs 150) by Habib Tanvir is Anjum Katyals translation  of a classic of contemporary folk theatre. Integrally associated  with the Naya Theatre, the company formed by Tanvir and  his wife, Moneeka Misra, Charandas Chor was developed  in performance over two years, from its origins in a Rajasthani  oral tale. It took full, but still open, shape in 1975   a turning point in Tanvirs career, a breakthrough in introducing  Chhattisgarhi as a language for a modern play. This reprint  of the 1996 translation has a useful introduction by Javed  Malick, and a long conversation between Tanvir and the translator.  Chor is about the transformation of an ordinary  thief into a famous man: And how did he do it? By telling  the truth. English poems (Penguin,  Rs 150) by Jeet Thayil is a slim volume of difficult  and some beautiful poems, intricately arranged in a spiralling,  internally doubled, seven-part structure. This arrangement,  taken from Robert Wilsons seven-act play, Stalin,  is depicted in a mysterious drawing, that mirrors the many  journeys which form the substance of the poems. This is  Fool and Flea: Dearly beloved,/ we are gathered here/  to join together/ this fool and this flea,/ in holy matrimony.//  Fool will sing,/ flea will suck./ Fool will work,/ flea  will pluck./ Both will learn// the virtue of obedience./  Fool will give up freedom./ Flea will give up whatever chance/  she may have had// at happiness./ Both will die./ Fool first./  Flea so full/ shell burst. Crossings: stories from bangladesh  and india (Indialog, Rs 250) compiled and  translated by Radha Chakravarty aims to bring alive  the spirit of contemporary Bengali fiction, highlighting  the overlaps and differences between writings from the two  countries. According to Chakravarty, the Bengali writings  from India and Bangladesh are united by a shared language  and a common cultural past. Selina Hossain, Syed Shamsul  Haq and Hasnat Abdul Hye from Bangladesh, and Sunil Gangopadhyay,  Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Mahasweta Devi are some of the writers  included.  Time within time: the diaries,  1970-1986(Seagull, Rs 375) by Andrey Tarkovsky  is a reprint of Kitty Hunter-Blairs 1989 translation  of this great Russian film-makers journals, with a few  important essays on Solaris, Mirror, The  Idiot and Hamlet. The journals start with Dostoiesvsky  and Solaris, and end with Hamlet and chemotherapy,  a fortnight before his death in 1986. These are studies  in human time  Tarkovskys favourite, but feared, medium:  For many years I have been tormented by the certainty that  the most extraordinary discoveries await us in the sphere  of Time. He wondered how to turn Thomas Mann into cinema,  declared Pushkin his favourite poet, and believed that a  womans driving-force was submission, humiliation in the  name of love.

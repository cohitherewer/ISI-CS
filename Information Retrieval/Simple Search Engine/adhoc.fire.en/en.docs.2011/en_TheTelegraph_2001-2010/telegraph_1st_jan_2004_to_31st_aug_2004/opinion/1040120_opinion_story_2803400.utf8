		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 							 																						TOWARDS JUSTICE																								Fear and prejudice belong to the realm of the irrational. Hence, the paradox of trying to build a system of justice that would legislate some of the most brutal expressions of such unreason. Lawyers Collective is working on the draft of a bill to protect the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS in India. This would mean about four and a half million Indians  a number that makes the matter one of the highest urgency. Discrimination against those directly or indirectly affected by HIV/AIDS remains extreme and widespread in India; but apart from the United States of America and Australia, the highest number of HIV/AIDS-related litigation has perhaps taken place in this country. A study of 130 legal cases handled by the Lawyers Collective between 1998 and 2001 revealed that the most important legal issue for men related to employment. In the case of women, the major problem areas were maintenance, custody of children and property rights, together with an increase in the number of divorce cases. Hence, this new bill will have to address a wide range of issues, from a perspective sensitized to the specific human rights entitlements of men, women and children. This means confronting  with commitment, lucidity and practical awareness  questions of voluntary testing and informed consent, of privacy and confidentiality, and of equality in healthcare, education and employment. This would also entail a precise understanding of various possible scenarios involving diagnostic and counselling centres, hospitals (government and private), workplaces, universities, colleges and schools, the insurance sector, panchayats, police stations and the courts of law. In India, particularly, the divides between urban and rural, and between various levels of literacy and economic empowerment will also have to be reckoned with in both framing and implementing such a law.																								Legal reform around HIV/AIDS will also have to branch out to other laws regulating various forms of sexual behaviour. Lawyers Collective must keep up its work towards the decriminalization of homosexuality, and a radical revaluation of the laws concerning injecting drug users, sex workers, trafficked women, girls and boys. A societys confused and arbitrary attitudes to sexuality and criminality, to disease, death and infection, its deepest taboos and duplicities, are what this bill will have to address. Such a law should not exist to discipline and punish, to moralize, repress or look away, but to ensure that men, women and children are allowed to realize their fundamental human rights in the multiplicity of their everyday lives.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 							 																						DRIFTED APART																														Electoral alliances are seasonal affairs. What works in one season may not in the next. It is no great surprise, therefore, that the Bharatiya Janata Party has severed its alliance with the Asom Gana Parishad. In fact, the way the two parties had been drifting away from each other for some time made the separation only a matter of time. But what it implies for the BJPs coalition politics seems to be of greater import. The AGP is only the latest in a line of former allies of the BJP which have found the going tough. Parties like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Haryana Vikas Party, Lok Shakti or the National Conference had earlier deserted the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance on different issues. It may not have always been the BJPs fault; these parties had their scheme of things substantively altered by changing political scenarios in their areas of influence. The failure of the alliance with the AGP too can be attributed largely to the AGPs internal dissensions. The new AGP president, Mr Brindaban Goswami, has not been as keen on the renewal of the alliance with the BJP as his predecessor, Mr Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. It is possible that the BJP leadership now finds a faction-ridden AGP more a liability than an asset. But the failures in Assam and elsewhere indicate that the BJP has not quite mastered the art of coalition politics. 																														The separation in Assam has a special message for the BJP though. The tie-up with the AGP was a major plank in the BJPs larger plan for penetrating the North-east. It was not merely a question of challenging the Congresss traditional domination of the area. The march into the region could give the party of the Hindi heartland a larger identity and a greater national presence. Since the party was unable to achieve this on its own, it was crucial for it to befriend regional parties opposed to the Congress. It has made some headway to that end in states like Nagaland and Manipur. But the failure of its first such experiment in Assam can only harm the BJPs prospects, not only in that state but perhaps in the whole region as well. It is understandable that the party has now settled for new allies in Assam. One instant choice would be the Northeast Peoples Forum led by the former Lok Sabha speaker, Mr P.A. Sangma. But its influence in Assam remains small because the AGP, which is the principal anti-Congress force in the state, has decided to stay out of it. Even BJP leaders cannot doubt that only the Congress stands to gain from its new-found isolation in Assam. At another time, the lonesome journey would have been a test of its own strength; but now it can only spoil the BJPs poll party.

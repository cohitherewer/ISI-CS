				 																																																																														 For the saffronwallahs, suddenly so happy to discover that their party is growing at the same pace as AB Vajpayee (not a pretty picture at all if one were to consider the PMs dimensions; which probably explains why most of ABs snaps were taken off Vision), there is a mathematical problem to solve. According to the parliamentary records, the prime ministers age is 79, but apparently, in legal documents produced in the court of a magistrate in September 1942, ABV is declared as a 20-year-old. That means the PM is now 82. Yet to recent charges of being an informer during the Quit India movement, Vajpayee has insisted that he was merely a high school student then. Which means he was a tender thing of 16-17 years. Not too old for a rebellion, but, presumably, too young for a vision.				 																																																																														 Saffron top gun Arun Jaitley has been asked to stay put in Karnataka, and not the least because it is cooler there at this time of the year than most other electorally active places. The stakes in this state are high for the party, given that the assembly polls here take place together with the Lok Sabha election. A victory here could take off the Hindi-belt party tag from the BJP, and in case of a defeat in Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, even compensate for the loss of face. But the grapevine suspects another gameplan. It is an open secret that Jaitley is vying for the top honour as party strategist with none other than Pramod Mahajan. Jaitley had coordinated and won the gamble in Gujarat last year, but lost out in Himachal Pradesh. In the semi-finals late last year, Jaitley excelled in Madhya Pradesh, but so did Mahajan in Rajasthan. To be one up on Pramod, it is essential that Jaitley works his magic in Karnataka. But if Sushma couldnt, despite her Kanada, can Arun?				 																																																																														 There is one thing Pramod has that Arun doesnt  his residence, 7, Safdarjung Road. The NDAs national agenda for governance was released from there last week probably because it beat other preferences on three counts. First, because of its number  lucky 7. Second, because the NDA in 1998 and 1999 had released its agenda from the same house and managed to stay in power. And third, because of Pramods proximity with tent managers  the house played guest to more than 400 guests. Will the bungalow be third-time lucky?				 																																																																														 The prime ministers recorded telephone calls to voters created a piquant situation in Madhya Pradesh recently. A state minister had gone on an electoral campaign, leaving his mobile behind at home. His wife received a call on his cell in which the caller, in his measured voice, announced himself as Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The wife panicked and hung up. In the next hour or so, she made frantic calls all over to get in touch with her husbands convoy to tell him who had called. The minister, having received the message, rushed back through bumpy, dusty roads. As soon as he reached, he called up the PMO, which pleaded ignorance. After a flurry of activity, it dawned on the minister that the call must have been the much-talked-about recorded message. 				 																																																																														 A neat deal. The recently established Farmers Commission is reportedly all set to lose its founding member-secretary, RCA Jain, to FAO, where he will be serving as a middle-rung official. Yet it was Jain who, as Union agriculture secretary, had pushed for the commission. As member-secretary of this body, Jain was assured of a decent sinecure and the inevitable bangla, gari, phone. But the negotiations with the FAO had been kept alive. And in the end tax-free dollars obviously carried more weight than the produce in farmers field. 				 																																																																														 Popularly known as the aish (comfort) and cash government, Amarinder Singh has been depicted in recent Akali Dal posters as a man enjoying himself immensely in power. The caption reads, Ais to ilaba do saala chi ki kita (What have you done in two years besides living in luxury)? Singh is believed to be seriously in campaign mode, but will he be able to live down his image?				 																																																																														 From marriages to funerals  the vote-catching spree is taking our politiicos everywhere. When Irfan Pathan ripped through the Pakistani batting line-up, Satyajit Gaikwad, the Congress candidate from Baroda, took a bagful of sweets to the Pathan family. The event earned him good media coverage. Next day, the rival BJP candidate, Jaya Ben Thakkar, was seen attending a kitty party. She was apparently overwhelmed with the response from the chatty lot. Each to his (and her) own. 				 																																																																														 The power of the telly to make or break political fortunes is now part of folklore. Aware of the idiot boxs influence, parties today fall over themselves to hire telly stars and brief their representatives on how to react to various channels. The BJP and the Congress in fact have a panel of leaders who are expected to represent the party in debates and discussions on TV. Regional outfits like the Samajwadi Party and the BSP, which dont have much telly talent, rely on their favourite faces (Amar Singh or Mayavati) to see them through. The trouble crops up when the regulars are not around or are too busy and the seconds have their field day. Only days back, Sahib Singh Verma was on TV against Sheila Dixit, much to the consternation of the party saffron bosses because of the mess he made of himself. But much as they wanted to censure him, the party top brass decided to discourage him gradually so that they didnt have a sulking leader to contend with at this time of the election season. BP Singhal is another one they are going slow on. But theyve got cracking anyway.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 							 																						CRYING HALT																														Hartals have long become a byword for politics in Bangladesh, much like the bandhs in West Bengal. Politicians in Dhaka, like their counterparts in Calcutta, will merrily stall things in their narrow, partisan interests. Both the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the opposing Bangladesh Awami League have been so rooted in the culture of hartals that they fail to see the futility of this kind of politics. But the people of Bangladesh seem to be increasingly seeing the politics of strikes for what it is  wasteful, undemocratic and harmful to the societys interests. In a mature democracy, politicians are expected to honour such public sentiments and mend their ways accordingly. It is tempting to think that Bangladeshs opposition leader, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, has read the public mood correctly. But she is now prepared to impose a ban on hartals by her party for a year only, provided the ruling BNP promises to do the same if the latter becomes the party of the opposition in future. It is not difficult to see why Ms Wajed wants the quid pro quo over shutdowns. The BNP and its allies had made things difficult for the previous government, led by Ms Wajed, by frequently shutting down the country. But, if Ms Wajed is serious about starting a new political culture in Bangladesh, she would do well to set her own example rather than wait for her rivals to reciprocate her gesture. 																														It has been suggested that this politics of endless confrontations actually points to a fundamental weakness in Bangladeshs experiments with democracy. The country has been under military regimes for far too long to fully absorb the democratic values. The party system, instead of ensuring a democratic political process, has reduced it to endless bickerings. The bitter personal rivalry between the prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, and Ms Wajed is only symptomatic of that larger failure. The result has been a hopelessly ineffective administration which serves partisan, rather than public, interests. The culture of shutdowns has destabilized the civic institutions at various levels. It has reduced academic campuses in particular to battlegrounds for ugly shows of strength. But the greatest damage by far has been to the countrys economy. The insensitivity of the political class shows repeatedly in the way it ignores calls from businessmen and other sections of the society to abandon the politics of hartals. Every shutdown pushes the country farther from tackling its two major problems of poverty and illiteracy. It may not be enough for the business community alone to cry halt to this politics. It is perhaps time that civil society in Bangladesh came forward to call the politicians bluff.

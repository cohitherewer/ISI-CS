		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 							 																						INTELLECT IS NOW PROPERTY 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Getting an insight																														Ways of reducing the costs of anti-retroviral drugs in south Asia: The access to ARV treatment is severely limited in developing countries in general and south Asia in particular because of several reasons: lack of proper guidelines on the proper selection and use of drugs, lack of adequate and competent health services, lack of affordable drugs on a sustainable basis, high prices of patented drugs and low purchasing power. 																														There have been several attempts by public-private collaborations to offer anti-retroviral therapy drugs at decreased prices, the most important of these being the Accelerating Access Initiative. Till March 2002, 78 countries had expressed interest in participating in the Initiative. Each of these countries has committed itself to, and is in the process of, developing national care and treatment plans. So far, 18 countries (12 from Africa, 5 from Latin America and the Caribbean countries and 1 from Europe) have actually reached an agreement with the drug companies...																														The role of patents: Patents are a major factor in restricting access to ARV drugs. Pharmaceutical companies in high-income countries develop these drugs after years of research and development at high costs. Patents on these drugs preserve monopoly rights on producing them for a minimum number of years and the selling price includes a premium that helps recoup the research costs. Generic versions of these drugs are much cheaper to produce.																														The cost of these drugs in a particular country depends on several factors. Some of these are related to patents: whether the pharmaceutical companies have applied for patents in that country (which, in turn, depends on the size and value of the potential market); whether the country permits product patents on pharmaceuticals; and whether it has the technical capacity, market size and the legal framework to produce generic versions of these drugs. Pricing policies within these countries also determine the cost. India, for example, has been imposing price controls on bulk drugs through the drug price control order, 1995. However, the number of drugs under this order has been steadily decreasing after complaints by the industry over loss in profitability. Combined with the change in the patent regime, this has adverse implications for access to affordable drugs. 																														Till 1995, individual country patent loss was determined by domestic policy. However, the global system of intellectual property rights is today much more structured than before. With the establishment of the World Trade Organisation agreement on trade-related intellectual property rights, most countries are required to strengthen their intellectual property laws. TRIPS has profound implications for the availability of and access to medicines for the south Asian countries, especially in the context of HIV/AIDS since most of these medicines are the products of ongoing research, and their supply will be immediately affected by changes in patent laws. 																														The TRIPS agreement and access to drugs: The TRIPS agreement which came into effect in 1995, requires all member-countries to extend intellectual property rights to all technologies, covering both products and processes. TRIPS requires countries to recognize products and process patent rights in the pharmaceutical sector and offer patents for a minimum of 20 years in order to protect the rights of innovators and balance them with the rights of consumers. 																														India, Pakistan, Maldives, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka together account for 98.7 per cent of all HIV/AIDS cases in the region. All five of them are members of the WTO. Nepal and Bhutan currently have observer status at the WTO...Despite their varying official WTO status, all countries in the region are affected by the TRIPS agreement, since (barring India) all of them lack the capacity to manufacture drugs locally and are dependent on imports from countries that are signatories to TRIPS.																														The single-most important implication of TRIPS for access to treatment is the impact of patent protection on drug prices. In the case of India, several studies have shown that the introduction of patents once TRIPS is implemented can raise the prices on drugs by as much as 200 per cent.																														TRIPS also affects the production of generic versions of drugs. Countries in south Asia have different levels of production capacity. India has innovative capabilities and technical capacity to produce generic versions of drugs. Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Iran have reproductive capabilities to differing degrees, since the pharmaceutical industry in these countries can manufacture finished products from imported ingredients only. Bhutan and Maldives depend entirely on imports to fulfil their drug requirements.  TO BE CONCLUDED

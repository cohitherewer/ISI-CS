		 Friday, March 19, 2004 							 																						IN SEARCH OF A THIRD WAY 							 - Globalization and its apologists				 	 With hindsightThe Roaring Nineties: Seeds of Destruction By Joseph Stiglitz, Penguin, pound; 13.50Joseph Stiglitz has impeccable credentials and an astounding track record. Joint winner of the Nobel prize for economics in 2001; chairman of the council of economic advisors during the first of Bill Clintons two terms as president; subsequently, chief economist at the World Bank until 2000; and currently, professor of finance and economics at Columbia University, he is widely respected by his peers. Stiglitz, who received the Nobel for his pioneering work on the esoteric economics of asymmetric information, has also written the internationally-acclaimed bestseller, Globalization and its Discontents, and is, not surprisingly, a popular polemicist.																														The Reagan-Thatcher obsessive commitment to deregulation, minimalist government and free rein for the financial markets, Stiglitz asserts, was not only responsible for the boom and bust in America at the end of the Nineties and the corporate scandals that accompanied them, but it also seriously damaged American society. Though the crash, strictly speaking, did not happen during the authors time (he had moved on to the World Bank by then), the first Clinton regime, of which he was an important member, turned a blind eye to the impending crisis. This book is thus, in part, a mea culpa, explaining how  despite the efforts of the author and a few colleagues  the Clinton administration failed to stick to its election platform of putting the people first. The vision of a third way between socialism and Reaganism was there but, says Stiglitz, we pushed deregulation and deficit reduction too far, not arguing as forcefully as we should have done for the important role that government can and should play. Although the economy did well, not enough was done to reduce poverty and inequality. Social justice was given too low a priority. Clinton, Stiglitz believes, was too timid in these matters, because he was afraid that if he spent more or taxed more he would upset the financial markets. 																														The adage, what is good for Wall Street, is good for the country, is blown to smithereens by Stiglitz. Financial markets, he states, do not work perfectly and are structured in such a way that insiders have more information than outsiders. As a result, prices dont reflect costs, and booms and busts can be engineered by vested interests. (Dont question this line of reasoning  it is a part of the asymmetric information thesis, which won him the Nobel!)																														Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, comes under severe criticism for not doing more to curb the irrational exuberance which was driving share prices to absurd levels in the second half of the decade. On interest rates and on the 1997 cut in capital gains tax (which Stiglitz strongly opposed), the Fed, under cover of its vaunted independence, was largely driven by the view of the financial markets. Wall Street banks, in league with top accounting firms, concealed the facts about companies they were bringing to the stock market, in the hope of boosting the share price and making bigger profits for themselves and their favored clients. This largely contributed to the meteoric rise in share prices and to their inevitable crash in the late Nineties. As Stiglitz points out, deregulation of the banking system increased the scope for conflict of interest within the huge financial groups that were formed during this period.																														Stiglitz was well placed to observe all this at close range and his reflections on how decisions are taken in Washington are interesting. He gives a clarion call to governments to be on hand to correct market imbalances by regulating and promoting competition, and by being proactive, although one cannot visualize all this being acted upon in the near future, given the political climate in the US over the last two decades and more. However, the author steps on sticky turf when he urges other countries not to follow American-style capitalism. He favours more humane versions of capitalism, for example, that of European countries like Sweden, which has modified its traditional welfare system but not abandoned it entirely, thus avoiding the extremes of wealth and poverty which exist in the US.																														What this comparison ignores is the significant European weakness, most evident in large countries like Germany and France  the inability to create new jobs and promote innovation on anything like the scale of the US. Continued high unemployment figures in Europe for more than a decade are proof enough. To catch up with the Americans, Europe needs more of the market and less of government. Notably, it needs a more flexible labour market, which will allow workers to move more easily between firms. There is also need for more sophisticated and less regulated financial markets, making it easier to shift resources from declining industries to fast-growing ones. This is where the US still has important lessons to offer. But Stiglitzs book fails to present this perspective. Perhaps the polemicist in him did not allow it!						SATRUJIT BANERJEE

		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 							 																						WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED 															- Document Excerpts from Sexuality, abortion and the media: a review of adolescent concerns by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Seeking and finding																														According to Pelto (2000), research so far indicates that male dominance in sexual relations, often with the use of violence and coercion, has deep roots in Indian culture. On the other hand, changing moral standards concerning premarital sex and other issues mean new tensions and social problems within the Indian family. Young people are facing ambiguities in relation to the varied images of sex portrayal in films, television and other media...																														A study carried out in the urban Delhi settlement of Tigri in 1996-97 showed that boys and girls, like modern adolescents everywhere, have a high interest in romance, love and sex  the stuff that modern movies are made of (Sodhi, 1998). Of the sample interviewed, all had a highly developed interest in sexual matters. They had considerable knowledge concerning some aspects of sexual behaviour, but many (especially girls) are relatively ignorant about physical relations, and are not well prepared for dealing with intimate relations that the boys are seeking...																														There is a general recognition in many quarters that any response to reproductive health issues and HIV/AIDS requires working with young people because their attitudes and actions will have a profound effect on future prevention and control of the epidemic...																														Prabha Nagaraj, of the NGO TARSHI felt that there was a large unmet need for reproductive health information. The reluctance to openly address the issue coupled with a ever-increasing population, rampant rise in sexually transmittable infection, HIV/AIDS and unsafe abortions have further worsened the problem.																														When adolescent sexuality is denied, reproductive health ignored and adolescent queries unanswered, it leads to increased unplanned pregnancies among teenagers, back street abortions and reproductive tract infections, STIs and HIV/AIDS...																														Preventing pregnancies: Contraception versus abortion: A study conducted in 18 schools in Delhi by the NGO Sakshi revealed that 65 per cent of children had been abused within their families, and 25 per cent of these were serious sexual violations  mostly outright rape. Sakshi volunteers also reported that over the last few years, young women, as young as 11, were brought in to them, pregnant. (Anand, 1997)...																														Adolescents do not have too many choices when it comes to contraception. For men, the condom and for women, the birth control pill. And, it is only the condom that provides protection against HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. In the Indian context, there is great deal of social disapproval and disincentive for boys and girls to seek contraception. If girls and young women are single, they will be asked a thousand questions as to why they want it. Young men, too, shy away from buying condoms even though they are more openly available than birth control pills.																														It is not surprising that so many girls and young women resort to abortion. Little or no awareness of how their bodies work, and almost no information about where to access contraceptives, they often find themselves pregnant.																														Recent efforts to popularize condoms have met with a backlash. In December 2002, a controversy erupted over what some activists were calling condomisation of society and a condom-centric approach to the prevention of HIV/AIDS. They felt that promoting condoms was in fact encouraging promiscuity and sex. Objecting to hoardings in Mumbai, television advertisements in Orissa and in other parts of the country, three NGOs and a government agency were called into the ministry of information, and told their campaigns did not empower women and focussed too much on condoms. They wanted womens empowerment to be included in the campaigns.																														No one could object to this. But for adolescents, condoms are crucial for safe sex, and preventing unwanted pregnancies.																														Studies of abortion in India, particularly among adolescent abortion seekers are limited. The majority are hospital based and urban and hence, refer to a small proportion of abortion seekers. The few surveys that exist tend to underestimate its prevalence, since investigators rarely ask the questions required to obtain reliable information about abortion experiences, and because they focus on married rather than all women. The limited data gives a disturbing picture of adolescent abortion seekers.																														Unmarried adolescents constitute a disproportionately large number of abortion seekers. Large proportions of adolescents who seek abortions are unmarried, and in rural and urban areas. In addition, at least half the women seeking abortions are adolescents and a disturbing number are below 15. There is no specific campaign to address the issue of adolescent abortion. TO BE CONCLUDED

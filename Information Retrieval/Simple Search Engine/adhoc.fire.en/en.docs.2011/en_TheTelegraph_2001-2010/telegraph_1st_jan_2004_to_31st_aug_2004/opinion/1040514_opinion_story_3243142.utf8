The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 14, 2004 							 																						FEEL BAD FACTORThe election results are a rejection of the NDA and its nonchalant show of arrogance. The verdict rejects the politics of religious hatred tooPollsters propose, people dispose. Not only pollsters, none expected the outcome of the general elections to be so full of drama. The sheer unexpected nature of the verdict has made the results of this election comparable to the 1977 general elections. It is quite clear from the voting pattern that the people of India have rejected the National Democratic Alliance, which had become virtually synonymous with the Bharatiya Janata Party. The latter has suffered the maximum damage because it masterminded the coalition and the campaign. The status of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as prime minister and as leader of the BJP, has taken a severe beating. The details of the voting pattern will lend themselves to a more disaggregated post mortem but the larger picture offers some very important clues to explain the verdict of the people. The results apparently confirm the old adage about the impossibility of trying to fool all the people all the time. The people of India have reacted, and reacted angrily, to the arrogance with which the BJP purveyed misinformation to gain leverage before the elections.																														The India Shining campaign, which was unleashed by the BJP spin doctors, lost its sheen as soon as people began to realize that the figures of growth did not quite support the euphoria that the campaign wanted to whip up. With this realization came the evaporation of the feel-good factor. The arrogance embedded in the campaign was obvious in the stark contrast between the prosperity of the few and the deprivation of the many. India Shining left those who had no power, no health facilities and no electricity, bewildered and angry. The NDAs arrogant show of power was the contamination of electoral death in this election. The BJP spin doctors did not read this because they were smug and they were deluded by their own cleverness. A similar insolence was manifest in the decision of the BJP  Mr Vajpayee was an honourable exception to this  to launch a personal attack on Ms Sonia Gandhi. The language that leaders like Mr Narendra Modi used against Ms Gandhi was beyond the pale of even rabble-rousing. The whole issue of foreign origin, which was the crux of these attacks, proved to be a non-issue and may have even helped Ms Gandhi.																														The arrogance has a long lineage and the memory of this surfaced and merged with present perceptions. In its public pronouncements, the NDA emphasized good governance and economic development. But at crucial junctures, the BJPs core ideology of Hindutva and hatred of the minorities surfaced. Witness the Gujarat pogrom, Mr Modis behaviour after the killings and the BJPs soft-pedalling of Mr Modi. The people of India, over a period of time, grew wise to this and, when they got the chance, displayed their displeasure. Arrogance angered the people. There was a growing suspicion of the sincerity of many of Mr Vajpayees moderate utterances. The vote may not be a vote for secularism but it is most certainly a vote against the politics of hatred and religious fundamentalism. Vox populi, vox dei  the saying goes: the people have spoken like god but not in the voice of Ram.

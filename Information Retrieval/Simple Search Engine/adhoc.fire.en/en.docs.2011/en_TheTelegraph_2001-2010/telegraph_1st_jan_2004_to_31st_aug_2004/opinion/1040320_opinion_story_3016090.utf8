The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 20, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Beware of the wilting flower				 																																																				Sir  Where did Kumar Sanu get the impression that because he can sing passably, he can also be a lyricist? Whatever may be said of the lyrics of Ek ladki ko dekha, what Sanu makes of it is hideous (the graphic, 2004: An Atal story, but will he love it?, March 17). Atal Bihari Vajpayee being a poet himself, Sanus panegyric is more likely to repel him than bowl him over. And hasnt Sanu gone a little over the top with the flowery metaphor, Vajpayee, a blooming lotus? Sanu should, literally, choose his words carefully. Laying it on too thick may rub the electorate up the wrong way. Sanu may find himself a failed star twice over. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Avijit Mondal, Calcutta
				 																On a decline				 																																																				Sir  Achin Vanaik hits the nail on the head with his comment that the Congress has no alternative or programmatic or ideological vision (Swing high or low, March 16). This is the reason the Congress has so rapidly lost ground to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Even critics of the BJP will admit that the Congress lags far behind the saffron party in tactics, shrewdness and electoral mobilization. The rise of Hindutva is not a sudden phenomenon; it was the decline of the Congress that led to the ascendance of the Hindutva party. 				 																																																				The Congress has failed to prevent Hindutva from permeating every sphere of our lives, and the BJP from giving a political dimension to this process. The Congress should have been more vigilant because the BJP has been very focussed in its activities and has even successfully extended its influence to the Dalits and adivasis. It must try harder to appeal to the majority of Indians if it wants to do well in the coming elections. It must re-think its strategies, include in its programme policies and slogans centred around unemployment, affordable access to food, healthcare and education.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Achin Vanaik is right  the Congress has lost its distinct identity and the BJP has successfully hijacked its economic reforms. But while it is true that the Congress does not have the huge cadre base of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh or the cohort organizations of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal, it does have the support of the Indian National Trade Union Congress and the Chhatra Parishad  the largest trade union and the largest students union in the country, respectively. It simply does not have leaders with the charisma to convert this support into an election victory. Infighting, one-upmanship, ego problems and over-dependence on one member of the Gandhi family or the other have become the bane of the Congress in India today.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																Vegitate on it				 																																																				Sir  It is bizarre to ban the sale of eggs in Hardwar, Rishikesh and Muni ki Reti (Egg ban in temple towns, March 12). The majority of visitors to these places may be vegetarians, but they need not go near the shops selling eggs. Also, how can this ban lead to the welfare of the people, when traders and non-vegetarian residents and visitors to these towns would be inconvenienced by it?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aparajita Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The order banning the sale of eggs within the municipal limits of certain temple towns in Uttar Pradesh should be extended to cover Hindu pilgrim centres all over the country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  The Supreme Court did well to uphold the ban on the sale of eggs in Rishikesh, Hardwar and Muni ki Reti. The judgment is a thumbs-down for the pseudo-secular culture pervading the country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba 

				 																																																				Sir  The pilgrims whose sentiments have been hurt by the sale of eggs in Rishikesh must be a very touchy lot. They are also hyprocrites because they belong to Hinduism, a religion that preaches tolerance Where eggs are sold, or if they are sold at all, should not bother them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Saptarshi Mukherjee, Calcutta

		 Friday, May 21, 2004 							 																						A CELESTIAL AFFAIRThe Sound of the Kiss or the Story that must never be told By Pingali Suranna, Oxford, Rs 445The 16th century was an era of much fecundity in Telugu literature. During this period, there was a phenomenal development of the rich tradition of Telugu narrative poetry, or kavya. Krishna Deva Raya of Vijaynagar, a patron of this poetic form, was himself a great practitioner of this genre. It was towards the end of this period that the prolific Pingali Suranna emerged on the cultural horizon. His masterpiece, Klaprnodayamu, critics claim is the first south Asian novel, comparable in its range of imagination and structural innovativeness to Cervantes Don Quixote.																														Klaprnodayamu, translated here as The Sound of the Kiss or The Story That Must Never be Told, is an intricately structured narrative, written in the campu style, alternately in verse and prose. The bewilderingly convoluted plot accommodates a number of tales which are intertwined, yet dispersed over time. The characters are mythical and go through physical transformations in different births. The motif of transformation is linked to that of illusion and reality as the characters struggle to decipher the different layers of reality they live in. The narrative style too varies in different sections of the book. 																														But what sets Klaprnodayamu apart from other contemporary texts is its distinctive use of language which, as the translators, V.N. Rao and David Shulman, explain in the section, Invitation to a second reading, operates on three levels  literal, figurative, and suggestive. Though some of the original import of the language must have been lost in translation, the images and metaphors have been tellingly rendered. And these string together the tales, which not only reflect on but also decode or interpret the master narrative in which Brahma talks to Sarasvati while in love-play with her. 																														Since every individual perspective in the narrative opens up a new avenue, the novel, in its style, approximates what Bakhtin termed polyphony. The master-narrative occupies centre-space in the fictional scheme of the text while the other narratives spread out like ripples, even as an underlying current pulls them back.																														The labyrinthine plot thwarts any attempts at summing up. The novel is as much a love-story between Manikandhara and Kalabhasini or, as they are re-born, between Kalapurna and Madhuralalasa, as it is a layered allegory on language and reality, as also one on knowledge and memory. 																														The translators introduction makes up the final section of the book. In it, they take pains to chart out the history of the critical approaches to it. But for these, the modern reader would have struggled to make his way through this extraordinarily complex text.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 02, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Losing ground				 																																																				Sir  A post mortem of an electoral disaster is supposed to identify the causes of the debacle. Sadly, introspection is not a favoured activity of Congressmen (Self-defeat theory, Dec 31). Staying true to tradition, Pranab Mukherjee has tried to pass the blame on the junior leaders of the party. And herein lies a sorry tale. Leaders like Mukherjee have lost touch with contemporary political reality. Issuing orders from plush offices comes easily to them, much easier than working at the grassroots level. Also, the Congress think tank seems to be frightfully short of ideas. After trying to ape soft Hindutva with disastrous consequences, it is now focussing on real issues, again in the footsteps of its arch rival. Mukherjee should understand that elections are not won on borrowed slogans, but on solid agenda and performance. Also, Mukherjee is ever unwilling to touch base, a standard escapist strategy. Accepting defeat with humility is just one among the many things he has failed to learn despite decades spent in politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Paromita Basu, Calcutta
				 																Across the great divide				 																																																				Sir  It is true that devaluation of research occurs in the physical sciences, but it is more common in the social sciences (Teaching shops, Dec 29). Undergraduate and postgraduate courses in this country do not encourage students to raise questions; neither do the course-content inspire inquisitiveness among them. Our universities have forgotten that postgraduate courses are meant to build the base for research. Students are increasingly opting for jobs in the corporate sector or going abroad after graduating from elite institutions. This is a wastage of their potential and a national loss because the government has invested heavily in these institutes. The students cannot be blamed, as the faculties in most of the leading universities have failed to highlight the importance of research. The Delhi School of Economics, renowned for its quality research, is now offering a masters course which is more job-oriented. No wonder the number of research scholars has reduced drastically. 				 																																																				It is the same story in the Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Statistical Institutes. At the Jawarharlal Nehru University, students are encouraged to take up research, but they soon lose their motivation owing to the paucity of funds  the University Grants Commission has reduced the number of junior research fellowships, while universities have stopped funding research. Since research funding is project-based, research institutes are mushrooming. This phenomenon has to be seen in the context of research in the least developed countries. The developed world hardly encourages indigenous research in the LDCs, and India is no exception. Our policy-makers, instead of encouraging research, have played a negative role. While aiming to be a global power, India can hardly afford to ignore indigenous research.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Indranil Mukhopadhyay, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  As an academic who left India for a more satisfactory career, I want to make some observations on Tirthankar Roys argument for encouraging research in Indian universities. The article, perhaps unwittingly, creates a divide between teaching and research. Good teaching is nearly impossible at any advanced level  including the post-secondary level  without active interest in research. The author ignores this interdependence altogether, using the word synergy instead. 				 																																																				Teaching and research need to be supplemented periodically by some exposure to academic administration, and all three should be expected of a university teacher. I dont know how things stand in specialized institutions. But a university is a complex organization whose well-being depends directly on the efforts of scholar-employees on every aspect of functioning. I am not talking of routine rotations of headships or of senior teachers abandoning teaching and research for permanent administrative posts. Instead, brilliant researchers should take full collegial responsibility, including that of administration. An academics contribution to society also derives largely from the individuals university experience. 				 																																																				Finally, did Roy have to reify his argument by appealing to an idealized United States of America and Nobel laureates. Perhaps it will be good if our academics try to reach more reasonable goals. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shyamal Bagchee, Edmonton, Canada

				 																																																				Sir  The reason behind the brain drain in Indian academia is not just the want of good-quality research. Students often opt for higher education outside the country to escape the politicized education system here. Depoliticizing Indian education is a must for arresting this brain drain.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapas Pal, Calcutta 

				 																Damage control				 																																																				Sir  Syringe shock from ministry (Dec 19) opened our eyes to the fact that the spread of HIV/AIDS does not occur through unsafe-sex only. Syringes, particularly those used in government hospitals, are often re-cycled or are of doubtful sterility. Those who are selling such adulterated syringes should be given exemplary punishment.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  AIDS is a global concern, not just of a single country (Kerala boost to AIDS battle, Dec 30). Promiscuity is one of the main causes for the rapid spread of the disease. Unfortunately, films and television serials continue to feature extra-marital affairs. Modesty and chastity  the cardinal virtues of women  are being ignored. If these influences are not checked at the earliest, promiscuity will increase, and with it AIDS.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The West Bengal governments providing of anti-HIV drugs to pregnant women is undoubtedly a step in the right direction (Medicine cover for HIV-positive mothers, Dec 19). India would soon have the dubious distinction of the highest number of AIDS cases in the world unless stringent and scientific measures are adopted. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS is still found wanting among large sections of Indians, including doctors. It is imperative that doctors have correct and updated information. Women should also receive comprehensive healthcare services post-pregnancy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully

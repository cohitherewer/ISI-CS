		 Friday, August 27, 2004  Climb every wall
 Neha Sahay																					Olympic fever has gripped China. Prime-time viewing is now the Athens Show. Go shopping in the evenings and all you see are the Olympics. With the Chinese participating in almost every game, viewers have more than an academic stake in watching the Olympics. Young men and women knock down chairs, climb on the backs of sofas and yell in excitement at every turn in the fortunes of their compatriots. They assume the world is as high on the Olympics as they are.																					It is difficult to imagine that China rejoined the Olympics as late as 1980 (the IOCs recognition of Taiwan causing it to stay away after 1952) in the Lake Placid Winter Games. The 1984 Los Angeles Games were Chinas first full-scale experience. Its athletes astounded the world and their own country by winning 15 golds.																					This time, it was taken for granted that the team would do well. In fact, a gambling company has been offering bets on who will win gold medals and how many everyday, and most Chinese say they had expected more golds.																					Made for life																					But there is no anger against their team. The Chinese love their athletes, and blame the media for having built up unrealistic expectations and nitpicking when these were not realized. Some young Chinese take a more mature attitude: their medal tally is seen as one more fun thing, nothing to get hysterical about. The Chinese know that their Olympic team comprises the best their country has. If they fail, it is not for want of trying, either on their or their governments part.																					Even the most cynical Chinese has no doubt that where the Olympics are concerned, their government pulls out all stops to back those with talent, whether it is grooming potential champions from childhood, or providing Olympians with special massage beds (sponsored by a pharmaceutical MNC) and cooling vests.																					Alert coaches spot prodigies at age six or seven, or, parents enrol them in special but inexpensive schools. Once the child makes a mark in city- or province-level events, the government takes over. The system ensures that really talented youngsters, even from poor families, can look forward to a career in sports, more than the average academically-inclined student, who does not know what the future holds. Olympic medallists are made for life.																					Serious pastimes																					The mascot for the next Olympics, to be held in Beijing, is a person performing tai chi. Sports are part of everyday life in China. Within housing complexes, young people jog, play tennis; old couples play badminton on the sidewalks late at night, young and old go swimming. A group of young working women can as well spend a free afternoon mountain climbing as shopping. Table tennis and bowling facilities in hotels are always crowded, with many Chinese coming for an after-dinner bout. Dormitories for workers often have basketball grounds. Schoolchildren begin their day with exercise, and all public schools have huge basketball and football grounds, tennis and badminton courts, while some also have swimming pools. These facilities are open to the public, for ridiculously small fees. For the more seriously inclined, there are the state-run giant stadiums, where for a nominal fee, any game can be played. 																					Are the steadily increasing standards of living after China opened up responsible for all this? Or was the foundation laid way back after Liberation, when every neighbourhood had basketball grounds for workers to relax? After all, Mao chose to announce his comeback at the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 by swimming the Yangtze river, and also a decade later to dispel rumours that he was dead. His words, He who does not climb the Great Wall is not a hero, continue to challenge visitors to the imposing structure.

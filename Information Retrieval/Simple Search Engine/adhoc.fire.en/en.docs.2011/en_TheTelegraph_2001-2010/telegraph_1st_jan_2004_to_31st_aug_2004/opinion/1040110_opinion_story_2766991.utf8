		 Saturday, January 10, 2004 							 																						WIELDING SARCASM AGAINST THE RICH THIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT  SINGH																								I first met Sahir Ludhianvi at a small gathering of poets at the house of Rafiq Zakaria and his wife Fatma. Zakaria was then a minister in the Maharashtra government and lived in a spacious bungalow on Malabar Hill. The party was in honour of Firaq Gorakhpuri, who happened to be visiting Bombay. The guests included the Akhtarul Iman, the novelist Krishen Chander, Sahir Ludhianvi and a few other lovers of Urdu poetry. The only misfit was Mota Chudasama, a Gujarati businessman who knew neither Urdu nor poetry. He was rich and a friend of the Zakarias. The party had just started with a few poets reading their compositions when Chudasama made some inane remark which upset Sahir. He exploded in bad temper: Who invited you here? If you know nothing, you should keep your mouth shut. Or words to that effect. Chudasama walked out in a huff. The party was ruined.																								I learnt that Sahir was prone to losing his temper and behaving rudely. He was a heavy drinker. When he arrived at the Zakarias home, he was already high. He expected to be served Scotch and soda. Instead he was served tea and pakodas. That may have triggered off the explosion.																								He invited me over to his bungalow by the sea in Juhu. I was on my guard, lest I say something which might upset him. I spent most of the evening talking in Punjabi to his mother and a lady cousin or niece. I could sense his mother doted on him as he doted on his mother. More than once she asked me: Putter (son), you tell him not to drink so much. He is ruining his health. I didnt dare. I joined him for a couple of drinks, had my dinner and departed. 																								I got Sahirs back round in bits and pieces from his many admirers. He was by then the most celebrated lyricist in the Bombay film industry. Though I did not get to see his films, I got to know many songs Sahir had written. Unlike other men of letters who never miss an opportunity to praise themselves, Sahir modestly conceded that he was no more than a writer of songs designed to fit into a film plot. He rebelled against authority and hated the rich. In his celebrated poem on the Taj Mahal, he execrated Shah Jahan, who ordered its construction, and praised stone-masons who gave it shape and beauty. In another poem, Chaklay (brothels), he wrote sympathetically of prostitutes while castigating their rich clients. His forte was sarcasm.																								An article by Shamim Ahmed in a Pakistani magazine filled in some gaps in my information about Sahir. He was born in Ludhiana (hence Ludhianvi). His real name was Abdul Haye. He took on the poetic pseudonym, Sahir (enchanter). He had a very unhappy childhood. His father, Fazal Din, who owned a little agricultural land was an inveterate womanizer: he married fourteen women in succession. Only one, Sardar Begum, bore him a son (Sahir). He divorced her to marry another. He took Sardar Begum to court alleging her son was illegitimate. The Lahore high court accepted Sahirs legitimacy and appointed his mother his guardian. Sahir developed a strong mother-fixation and loathing for his father. Which made him incapable of consummating the few love affairs he had in the short life of 59 years.																								Shamim Ahmed names three women in Sahirs life, all three non-Muslims. The first was a Hindu girl, Prem Choudhury, who died of consumption at a young age. Sahir wrote a poem, Marghat (place of cremation), about her. The second one was Ishar Kaur, a sikh girl he met while he was a student in Lahore. She spent a night with him in the college hostel. Sahir was expelled from the hostel. She followed Sahir to Bombay where he had shifted on the advice of S.D. Burman but married some distant cousin. No one knows what happened to this Ishar Kaur. The third was also a Sikh, the eminent poet, Amrita Pritam. She admits to the love affair in her auto-biography, Raseedee Tiket (Revenue Stamp). He responded to her overtures and came to meet her in Delhis Claridges Hotel. It was a non-starter. By then Sahir had burnt himself out with excessive drink and complexes which rendered him impotent. Names of Lata Mangeshkar and Sudha Malhotra are also mentioned as his heart-throbs.																								Sahirs mother died in 1976. With her went Sahirs will to live. She was the only real love in his life. Because of his doting on her, he developed a distrust of other women (glynephobia) and fear of marriage (gamophobia). Four years after his mother left, he died on October 25, 1980.																								It is time someone researched Sahir Ludhianvis life, poetry and his abortive love affairs because he was poet of great stature. Tagore in the Mediterranean																								Reba, the lovely wife of our ambassador in Rome, Himachal Som, has not only carried her exotic Bangla beauty to Italy but also her scholarship and Rabindrasangeet with her. While discharging the duties of an ambassadors wife, she not only completed her thesis on Gandhi, Subhas Bose and Nehru, but also recorded a disc of Tagores songs. She has a melodious voice and was able to get a sarangi and tabla player to accompany her. All the twelve songs recorded have been translated by her from Bengali to English and are available with the disc. I produce a couple of her renderings:																								Majhe majhe tabo dekhaa payee																								Why do I see you only sometimes, and not always and forever?/ Why do clouds overcast my hearts skies and take you out of sight./ Even in the fleeting light and in an eyelids blink when I chance to see you,/ I live in constant fear of losing you and indeed, you are lost in a moment,/ What must I do to keep you within the range of my eyes?/ How can I find so much love, my beloved, to bind you to my heart?/ Never will I glance at any other, this is my pledge,/ Should you ask it of me, I will give up, at this instant, all the desires of the world.																								Tagore was at his best describing nature. This one on the advent of spring entitled Boshonto tar gan likhe jaye:																								Spring writes her song on the dust with such affection/ That the dust smiles and awakens many times, in many forms,/ And beautys basket fills itself again, and yet again, with such affection/ It is the same touch that has made its way to the bottom of my heart/ Blessing me with the strength of its magic/ And so I awaken again, and yet again, to an unknown wonder and thrill/ And so, also, do blossoms of song appear again, and yet again, with such affection. In a topsy-turvy world																								Seeing Nehru perform the sheersh aasan, a friend asked with a gentle bow: Why do you raise your legs so high and bend your head so dangerously low? 																								Nehru smiled and replied: This world is in utter confusion. I have also to stand upside down to see the world in its true position!																								(Contributed by G.C. Bhandari, Meerut)

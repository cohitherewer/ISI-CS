		 Monday, August 09, 2004 							 																						DOCTOR AT HOME																														Anger cannot be the starting-point of justice. Nowhere is the opposition more evident than in a professional field, where the basic issue is competence. By ruling that doctors would not be considered criminally liable unless found guilty of gross negligence, the Supreme Court has exposed the deep confusions that underlie charges against doctors. The ruling makes clear that error of judgment, accident, inadvertence, want of some degree of adequate care or caution could bring on a civil suit, in which the doctor found guilty would have to pay compensation but would not land in prison. It is only when there is proof of recklessness or deliberate wrongdoing, gross ignorance or gross negligence that a criminal suit can be filed. Such a distinction can still seem vague, but it does hinge almost entirely on the matter of proof. What the court has done is to shift the onus from perception to proof, for the perceptions of grieving kin or a patient damaged instead of healed by medical care are likely to be based on anger.																														In the ruling, the court has emphasized the doctors sense of insecurity. If an error of judgment is likely to bring a doctor to the criminal court, he would always be worried about his own safety. It would also indirectly affect the patient. There would be less trust in the doctor-patient relationship while the patient would pay more money  for a headache may impel the doctor to ask for a CAT scan. The wisdom of the Supreme Courts decision can be gauged by recent developments in some states of the United States of America. Between 2002 and 2003, Mississippi, Nevada, Idaho, Oklahoma, Florida, West Virginia and Texas adopted laws that would allow the legislature to put a cap on non-economic damages. In these states, many doctors were leaving high-risk practices for fear of litigation and others were drastically curtailing the number of cases they took on. Patients had begun to look like adversaries. High malpractice-insurance premiums, an increase in jury awards and settlements and a spiralling number of lawsuits had made these states into what the American Medical Association called full-blown medical liability crisis states. By making its distinction before the popularity of the medical negligence lawsuit is full-blown in India, the Supreme Court may have helped to avert the kind of crisis the US states are facing.

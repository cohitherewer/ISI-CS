		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 							 																						OILING THE WAY																														Global oil prices have increased and, notwithstanding the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production, will remain high for three reasons. First, OPEC accounts for a small share of global production. Second, the war premium in Saudi Arabia and Iraq is not likely to ease. Third, demand in countries like India, China and the United States of America remains high. If the administered price mechanism on oil products is on its way out, as is supposed to be the case, high global prices should immediately translate into higher domestic prices of petrol, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. What compounds matters is the complicated system of working out retail prices and the lack of transparent correlation with crude oil prices, indirect taxes muddying matters further. That is, government control on retail prices has not yet been discarded and any price below the market-determined price is tantamount to a subsidy, even if it is couched as the oil pool account or the price stabilization fund now proposed. Unfortunately, subsidies get into the messy area of populism, which is why petrol and diesel prices have not been hiked since January 2004 and LPG and kerosene prices since 2002. It is doubtful that subsidies on petrol, diesel and LPG benefit the truly poor. Even for kerosene, subsidized kerosene is used for adulteration or smuggled into Bangladesh. Overdue hikes in prices of petroleum products were a test of the United Progressive Alliances commitment to reform, as opposed to pandering to populism. It is welcome that even the left has gone along. 																														By no stretch of the imagination has the hike been complete. Petrol and diesel prices have been hiked by roughly half of what they should be; there has been no change in kerosene prices and the subsidy on LPG is still more than Rs 100 a cylinder. Part of the argument is that with oil companies generally profitable, they should absorb some of the shock and the budget is expected to announce an explicit subsidy package. Also proposed is a price band, within which oil companies will be free to determine prices, thus granting them relatively more autonomy. Finally, there is the matter of indirect tax changes. No import duty changes have been announced. These will presumably wait for the budget. While no imports of petrol or diesel actually take place, and duty reductions do not therefore affect government revenue, such notional duties are included in calculating retail prices. What have at present been announced are excise duty reductions, costing the government about Rs 3,000 crore. Clearly, the entire package will have to wait for the budget.

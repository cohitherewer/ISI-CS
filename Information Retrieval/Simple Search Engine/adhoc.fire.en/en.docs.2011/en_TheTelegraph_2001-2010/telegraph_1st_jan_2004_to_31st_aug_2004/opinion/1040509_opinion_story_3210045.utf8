The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 09, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Beyond the bar				 																																																				Sir  The Election Commission may have a point in challenging the Patna high courts order to bar imprisoned candidates from contesting elections (Jailbird poll bar challenge reaches SC, May 6). But surely it could have done something about Pappu Yadavs cohorts going around and asking for votes? Although one knows that the model code of conduct is followed more in breach than in letter, it is incredible to see a candidate so openly threatening voters and getting away with it. Is it the case that the EC, like others, sees wisdom in looking the other way when it comes to handling Bihars goons?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Arpita Maitra, Calcutta
				 																All in the game				 																																																				Sir  Dhanraj Pillays omission from the 18-member experimental team scheduled to play in Japan this month clearly indicates that he will be omitted in the team for the Olympics (Dhanraj Pillay hopes suffer a jolt, May 3). The selection has once again exposed the bias and short-sightedness of the Indian Hockey Federation. Pillay is as respected among hockey players as Sachin Tendulkar is among cricketers. He is talented and deft. His speed on the field, especially during penalty corners, has saved the Indian team on numerous occasions. He is also a great motivator. 				 																																																				Pillay has contributed greatly to Indian hockey. Given his talent and fitness at this age, there is no way that his exclusion can be justified. The Indian hockey team stands a chance of winning the gold at Athens only if Pillay plays in the team. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ullas Pradhan, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  The IHF has been doing a lot of experimentation while selecting the Indian hockey team for international tournaments. But this has proved to be a costly procedure  the latest example being the exclusion of Dhanraj Pillay, and two other senior players, Baljit Singh Dhillon and Baljit Singh Saini. This comes as a shock to hockey lovers. The IHF should bring them back pronto.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Milan Lahiri, Guwahati

				 																																																				Sir  Perhaps the IHF should start considering the appointment of a Dutch coach for the team.The Dutch are masters of technique and it is because the Pakistanis understood this so well that they have already appointed a Dutch coach, Roelant Oltmans. We could follow Pakistans example to improve in hockey.				 																																																				Hockey-lovers in India are losing interest in the game because losing has become routine for the Indian team. After each loss follow the usual post-mortems and blame games. This is allowed to go on for some time, after which it is back to square one. This pattern has to be undone. We just need to look at Indian cricket now, where a foreign coach was brought in after initial reluctance, to understand how better training can help the game.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Firoz Alam, Shibpur

				 																																																				Sir  Gurbux Singh offers a valid suggestion in Trios fitness should be tested (May 4). Instead of assuming the unfitness of the three senior players, they should be made to sweat out at the training camps. The decision of their exclusion should have been made only if they failed to perform. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arijit Mandal, Calcutta

				 																Bring it back				 																																																				Sir  The omission of the weekly television schedule of various channels in the ETC to accommodate film gossip is disappointing. If such gossip has to be printed, The Telegraph should consider increasing the number of pages of its Friday supplement.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Partha Datta, Burdwan

				 																																																				Sir  The TV this week in the ETC does not allow readers to make their own choice of television programmes. It lists a limited number of movies and other programmes. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pradip Kumar De, Uttarpara

				 																																																				Sir  If the editors choice about TV programmes had to be made known, these could have been highlighted in the general list of programmes. Why did the entire list have to be scrapped?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jaishankar, Calcutta

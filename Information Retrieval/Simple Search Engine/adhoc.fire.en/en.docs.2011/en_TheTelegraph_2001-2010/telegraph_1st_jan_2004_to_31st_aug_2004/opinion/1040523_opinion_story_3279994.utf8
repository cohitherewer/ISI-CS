The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 23, 2004 							 																						BERTH CONTROL																														Making a cabinet is a different kind of challenge from preparing a budget. Mr Manmohan Singh, even before he has sat down on his new chair, is discovering the difficulties of drawing up a list of cabinet ministers and their portfolios. His task is thankless because he has to deal with coalition partners. There is no way he, or for that matter, anybody, can satisfy everybody. Some will be left out or be disappointed because they did not get what they wanted. There is a mad scramble on in New Delhi within the United Progressive Alliance to secure lucrative ministries. In some ways, this is understandable, because each political party is trying to maximize its political advantage. This is somewhat similar to the demands put forward by regional leaders when a single party used to come to power at the Centre. In the era of coalitions, instead of regional leaders, allies try to push forward their positions. A ministry, after all, is a very valuable asset in India. It provides access to patronage and to spoils of office. Mr Singh has to strike a balance between political expediency and the need to establish a credible and competent government.																														The complex nature of the task before Mr Singh is suggested by two aspects of his ministry-making. One is the number of ministers who were sworn in yesterday evening. As prime minister, Mr Singh will be primus inter pares among 68 ministers. This is a drastic reduction from the number of ministers the previous dispensation had. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee ruled with 81 ministers. But even 68 is too big a number for an efficient cabinet. The size of Mr Singhs ministry can only be explained in terms of his attempt to accommodate as many of the allies and their demands as possible. But even this has not been enough and this is the second aspect. Mr Singh was unable to announce, in the course of the swearing-in ceremony, the portfolios allocated to the different ministers. Obviously, the process of bargaining and negotiations is not yet over and the more important job of governing the nation will be shelved for some more time.																														While it is true that bargains and compromises come as the baggage of a coalition government, the UPA must recognize that if the haggling goes on for too long it will damage the image of the alliance and of the new prime minister. The notion that Mr Singh is not his own master must not even be allowed to germinate in the minds of the many enemies within and without the Congress. Mr Singhs accession to the prime ministership has come about through extraordinary circumstances and this is one reason why he needs all the support that he can get. There are other factors to consider. The Bharatiya Janata Party is down after its defeat but it is by no means destroyed. It will wait in the wings for a comeback and this can only happen if the UPA fails to deliver and fails to stay together. The allies of the Congress would do well to keep this in mind and thus curb their greed. Mr Singh must be allowed the space to get his act together.

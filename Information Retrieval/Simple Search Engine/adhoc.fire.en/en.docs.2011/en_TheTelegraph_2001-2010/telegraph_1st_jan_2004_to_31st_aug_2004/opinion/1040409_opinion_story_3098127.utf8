The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 09, 2004 							 																						BLOWING OF THE WEST WIND Neha Sahay																					This Sunday, Macaos churches will be full of expatriates from Mainland China, eager to savour the flavour of a real mass in a real church. The nondescript buildings that pass for churches on the Mainland, dont inspire the kind of devotion felt during Easter or Christmas. 																					Special territories Macao and Hong Kong for worship, the Mainland for celebrations. That seems to be the Chinese policy for the large and growing Western expatriate community in the countrys southern coastal cities. From Halloween to Thanksgiving, every Western festival is celebrated here. Five-star hotels and bars, supermarkets and theme parks lead the celebrations with roaring sales of pumpkins, turkeys and New Orleans dishes. X-Mas shows have fake snow and giant pizzas. One young girl actually bought a 2,000-yuan rose bouquet on Valentines Day. But what do you make of a 65-year-old Chinese couple participating in a lovers race to celebrate the day?																					China opened up to the West just 20 years back, but already, Western, especially American influence in its cities, is way beyond anything found in Indias most Westernized metros. Its not just the universal use of toilet paper, which the Chinese buy in bulk. Nor are the US Beef delights in almost all cafes, or McDonalds hoardings seen in practically every main square. 																					New delights																					The burger giant plans to open its 561st outlet in China in Inner Mongolia, and ranks second in the $ 48 billion fast food market in a country where less than a generation ago, noodle soup was the fastest food. Beating it to first place is its compatriot, KFC, which recently introduced traditional Chinese breakfast in some major outlets.																					Urban kids love both brands of junk food, washed down with a can of Coke or orange fizz. When they grow up, these children will find it difficult to fit into the slim-fit Western outfits so popular here; a recent survey found one in every 10 urban kids obese. Even the generation born after Mao frowns at the new fondness among kids for chocolates and flavoured yoghurt and milk. In the new cities, ice-cream bars and track-suit uniforms with sports shoes are the distinguishing features of school students. Jeans are universal, except for weddings, where the bride wears white. University dos have blondes or redheads dancing on stage in sailor suits, while beauty contests cater to all ages, from five to 75.																					Giant sweep																					The US influence extends to American spellings, pronunciations, sports (bowling is in) and even left-hand drives. The Americanism, Its cool, has a Cantonese equivalent. Stunted palm trees line the sea front of coastal cities, having replaced the traditional graceful willows that provided shade in the hot south. The latest proposal is to replace street names by numbers, like in the US.																					Janet Jacksons exploits and fashion features on the advantages of slit skirts figure regularly in English tabloids. The two free English channels, ABC and Pearl, offer the usual Sex amp; the City, and Ally McBeal reruns, not to mention the funniest US home videos. With all this, can the sex industry be far behind? Forty-one newly-weds participated in a New Year Kissing Competition; discreet sex shops selling intriguing equipment are mushrooming, but so are state-sponsored sex education bases featuring phallic mountain peaks. A colour advertisement in a local tabloid for Valentines Day, featuring half-clad girls, asked readers to turn up in red, end the day in bed. Chinese Sexual Culture On-line was launched this year, and a columnist has even written an on-line sex diary, detailing her one-night stands, names and all.																					Just when you despair at Maos country having gone Yankee with a vengeance (they even purged their national anthem of an anti-US phrase), comes some heartening news. Notebooks issued to primary school children have just been withdrawn after parents protested against the advertisement for KFC products on their covers. There are limits, it would seem, even to the mighty sweep of American commerce.

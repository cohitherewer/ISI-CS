		 Friday, March 05, 2004 							 																						INTO THE MIND OF A ROGUE STATEPAKISTAN AT THE CROSSROADS Edited by K.K. Nayyar, Rupa, Rs 795
The general malaise in Pakistani society and trouble arising out of it has resulted in the disintegration of its state institutions. Shock waves originating from this rouge state are causing distress in neighbouring India. The collection of essays in the book under review address this issue. 																														Arvind R. Deo, one of the contributors, writes that the core issue of Pakistans foreign policy from its very birth has been to achieve parity with India. This is unrealistic,if Indias overwhelming demographic and natural resources are taken into account. Trying to achieve parity has so far manifested in enmity with New Delhi over the Kashmir issue. Ever after it realized in 1971 that it could not meet India in an open fight, Pakistan has resorted to low intensity warfare against India. 																														Pakistan has always portrayed to the global Islamic community the image that it is an Islamic state fighting the Kafirs to liberate the Kashmiri Muslims. But S.K. Datta argues that the secular credentials of the Pakistani state vanished with the death of Jinnah in 1948. In fact, Pakistan feeds on an Islamic anti-India ideology in order to sustain itself.																														Essayist Afsir Karim claims that even in the Fifties, Pakistan was encouraging unconventional war against India by training Islamic insurgents. The rise of anti-India sentiment within an Islamic context further exacerbated the jihadi culture. 																														Islamabad has always been attempting to reduce Indias strength by aligning with other countries. Y.M. Bammis essay shows that Pakistan joined SEATO and CENTO during the Fifties in order to get American aid. In recent times, Pakistan has allied itself with Indias potentially hostile neighbour, China. Beijing, in order to circumscribe Indias attention within south Asia, is providing Pakistan with military hardware. India in turn is trying to match Pakistan by buying arms from the West and Russia  resulting in an arms race in the subcontinent. 																														Pakistans ambition to catch up with India has led it to believe that nuclear weapons have become indispensable to offset Indias superiority in conventional weapons. Matin Zuberi writes that the most vociferous proponent of non-proliferation regime  the United States of America  was largely responsible for the Pakistani bomb. As early as 1974, the Americans had trained 120 Pakistani nuclear scientists. Later, China actively aided Pakistan to realize her nuclear ambition. 																														The basic argument of the book that India-Pakistan rivalry is due to structural factors inbuilt in the Pakistani state system is not completely original, but are elaborated upon and strengthened in the book. The essayists point out that the extra-regional great powers are further exacerbating India-Pakistan tensions. This book is a necessary read for those peaceniks who expect much from cultural and diplomatic understanding between the two countries.						KAUSHIK ROY

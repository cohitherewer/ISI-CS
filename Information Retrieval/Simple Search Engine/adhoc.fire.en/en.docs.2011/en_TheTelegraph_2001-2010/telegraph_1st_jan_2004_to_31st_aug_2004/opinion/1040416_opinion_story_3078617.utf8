The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 16, 2004 							 																						ON AN UNEQUAL PLATFORM Amitava banerjee																					All challenged people, their guardians and the non-governmental organizations serving and caring for them need to unite and create a vote bank as todays politicians do not see anything beyond the ballot boxes. Most politicians have no qualms about exploiting deficiencies in persons, even when it is physical or mental.																					Although the last census lists 70 million challenged people in India, the actual number will not be less than 300 million, including those with autism, haemophilia and different kinds of learning disability. They account for about 30 per cent of our population. If united, they can exert tremendous pressure on all political parties.																					Barring the legislation of the two acts  the Persons with Disability Act in 1995 and the National Trust for Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disability Act in 2000  the Central government has so far shown little political will to implement the laws. Education for challenged persons upto 18 years has been made free under the acts, but institutions are forced to charge more than before as the government is in the process of withdrawing the aids to these special schools. 																					Access denied																					Including challenged students in regular schools has been made mandatory, but little effort has been noticed in formulating suitable curricula on formal as well as non-formal subjects according to the different abilities of the students. For prevention of and early intervention in disabilities, only hospitals in urban areas are taken into consideration. The primary health centres in rural India are not even equipped for safe and infection-free delivery. 																					The challenged have been assured 3 per cent reservation in employment by the act, but this remains on paper. Unless employment of the ably disabled is made compulsory for employers, there is no hope for them. Till date, only 0.5 per cent of the total workforce in the multinational companies in India is disabled. In the country of their origin, these companies could not have got away with such discrimination. It should be impressed upon companies interested in outsourcing to India that 5 per cent of their total recruitment must be from the community of the challenged. In the United States of America, United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Austria, China and some other countries, a quota system for the challenged is in practice. Failure to follow the rules invites heavy compensation, which in turn is used for the disabled.																					Poll duties																					The problem of access is still a huge problem with the disabled in India. Only a few days ago, a person was not provided a wheelchair and denied entry into Parliament although he possessed a valid entry pass. What does it say of the much-flaunted feel good factor when 70 million people struggle to access their daily requirements? There are no auditory signal on roads, no ramps and rail-bars in any building or monument, no sign-language interpreter in any government function. Above all, there is a lack of sensitivity among public servants when it comes to interacting with the challenged.																					Amidst all this, it is nice to hear about rallies organized by disabled-friendly NGOs in Srinagar and New Delhi recently. In Srinagar, those assembled appealed to the people to vote for apolitical, challenged candidates. In New Delhi, the Disability Rights Group, along with other NGOs, demanded that the Election Commission guarantee access to all the polling booths for every voter, including the old and disabled. The NGOs also forwarded the candidature of Javed Abidi, the leader of the DRG, for the New Delhi constituency. The rallyists appealed to all political parties to lend their support to Abidi.																					The BJP has already announced their candidate from this constituency. The Congress has been approached, and Abidis long association with the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation could come in handy.																					The first thing the EC should do now is ensure access to all polling booths for all voters and provide Braille in electronic polling machines. Only then will the elections hold some meaning.

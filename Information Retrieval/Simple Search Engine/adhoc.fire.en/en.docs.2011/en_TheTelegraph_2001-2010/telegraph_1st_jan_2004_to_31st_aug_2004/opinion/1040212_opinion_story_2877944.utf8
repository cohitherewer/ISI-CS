The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 12, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Media savvy pays				 																																																				Sir  Peter Bleach is becoming too much with the readers of The Telegraph. As if the run-up to his release, and the release itself, were not enough, now he is being tracked down in London and asked the same questions about his future plans and past experiences. Amit Roy is on his trail, and anyone remotely connected with the Purulia arms drop accused is good enough for a quote and a photo-op. So a beaming Bleach with his former girlfriend, Jo Fletcher, is thrust down the throats of the readers, as are trivial information about Fletchers past and present professions. It is possible that The Telegraph has caught a future bestselling author in his nursery-school days (remember Bleach intends to write a book on his eight years in captivity, and Fletcher insists he is a very funny writer). Then, of course, Amit Roy can go to town claiming Bleach the writer to be his discovery. But right now, Bleach is just another unfairly detained individual who happens to be media-savvy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Parimal Sengupta, Hooghly 
				 																More suds than sops				 																																																				Sir  The sops announced by Jaswant Singh in his interim budget will constrain the next governments budget exercise to some extent (Interim lollies to suck on till election, Feb 4). It focusses on easy reforms that are likely to find wide support among the electorate.				 																																																				The interim budget does not address any of the goals of fiscal consolidation head-on, nor the issue of expenditure management, prioritization and control. India needs to invest more in education to reduce its high rate of illiteracy, but Jaswant Singhs budget overlooks commitments to such expenditure towards social development and poverty alleviation.				 																																																				Jaswant Singhs announcement of the merger of 50 per cent of dearness allowance with the basic pay could trigger off similar demands from state government employees. This will have adverse consequences on the states finances, just as the Centres decision in 1997 to implement the fifth pay commissions packages did. Liabilities owing to pension and gratuity will also be higher if the DA is merged with basic pay.				 																																																				The decision to initiate an accelerated drinking water supply scheme for mega-cities such as Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad is undoubtedly meant for wooing urban voters with an eye on the forthcoming general elections. Surely, it will not be possible to provide drinking water within three months. But what about the hundreds of villages where people have to travel miles to get potable water? The sense of confidence that this budget exudes could prove to be misplaced. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sankar Lal Singh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  There is nothing wrong with Jaswant Singhs pursuit of gross national contentment, but the average Indian understands better the language of direct benefits, not economic jargon. The finance minister should hence take bolder initiatives to provide relief to the middle classes, for instance, by revising the structure of personal income-tax, increasing the tax limit or the ceiling for benefits under Section 88. Singh ought to adopt this as his top-most priority if he is in charge of the finance ministry after the elections as well. He could, if he wants, take a few tips from one of his predecessors, P. Chidambaram.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  The beneficiaries of Jaswant Singhs largesse are clearly Central government employees, rich farmers, small businessmen and people below the poverty line, in that order. Singh does not seem to have any crumbs to throw in the direction of the middle classes. What is more, he has already made it clear that the prices of cooking gas and kerosene will rise soon after the elections. Will the Bharatiya Janata Party still get the middle-class votes?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, 

				 																																																				Gokarna, Murshidabad				 																By the holy tail				 																																																				Sir  The fine gesture of Mufti Habib-ur Rahman, the head of the fatwa bench of the Dar-ul Uloom of Deoband  appealing to Muslims not to sacrifice cows on Bakri Id in states where cow-slaughter is banned  needs to be publicly appreciated (Voluntary moratorium on cow killing, Feb 2). Such gestures can go a long way in strengthening the bond between Hindus and Muslims, provided they are reciprocated by the extremist elements among the Hindus, such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The Hindus have sentimentalized the issue of cow-slaughter for a long time now which finally culminated in the ban on the act in states like Madhya Pradesh. Under these circumstances, the voluntary issue of fatwa on cow-slaughter in these states by the largest theological school in the subcontinent, Dar-ul Uloom, stands like an exemplar. Cows are useful animals to Hindus and Muslims alike. Since killing animals is not mandatory in any religion, it should not harm if cows and goats and buffaloes and spared the gallows. There surely are other things to eat than animals.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mema Mohan, Dibrugarh

				 																																																				Sir  The message sent out by the Dar-ul Ulooms appeal that Muslims desist from killing cows in states where cow-slaughter is banned is that Islam is not opposed to communal harmony. Let other Islamic groups like Ahle Hadees and Sunni Jamat come forward and work to promote peace and amity in the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Feroze Akhtar, Chandannagar

				 																																																				Sir  The reaction of the Hindutva groups and ideologues to the Dar-ul Uloom voluntary moratorium on cow-slaughter was disgusting. They seem to regard it as a small triumph. Worse still is Uma Bhartis imposition of vegetarianism on parts of Madhya Pradesh. Can we still hope for communal harmony to descend on India?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Sujata Somasundar, Calcutta

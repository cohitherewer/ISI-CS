Shes won swimming medals for India at the Commonwealth Games and a Pulitzer Prize last year as the Wall Street Journals health reporter. So what does anybody whos been-there-done-that do next?

The plays director, Kalyan Sen Barat, says Gulzar was only too happy to oblige. But whether he meets with the standards set by Ray remains to be seen.

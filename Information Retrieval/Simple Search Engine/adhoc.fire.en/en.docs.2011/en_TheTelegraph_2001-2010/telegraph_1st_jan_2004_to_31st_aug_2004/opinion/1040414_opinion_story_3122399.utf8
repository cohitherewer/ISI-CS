The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 							 																						OUT OF GUJARAT																														Gujarats path to glory will be less effortless now. The Supreme Court has delivered one of its harshest rulings on the Best Bakery case. It has directed that the re-trials are to be conducted outside Gujarat because of a complete, and continuing, subversion of the justice delivery system in the state. The terms in which the Supreme Courts directive has damned the Gujarat government, police and law-courts are perhaps without precedent in their severity. Everything that was being triumphantly forgotten about the communal violence in Gujarat has been brought back again in the courts long and incensed pronouncement. It has also charted out a course of monitored legal action, to be carried out in Maharashtra, which will repair the abused, misused and mutilated state of justice in Gujarat. In March 2002, a mob of more than a thousand Hindus had burnt down a Vadodara bakery, killing 14 Muslims. Since it came up in a fast-track court in Gujarat more than a year later, the Best Bakery case has come to stand for everything that makes the nearly two-month-long violence in the state a pogrom rather than a mere outbreak of rioting. The Supreme Courts ruling cuts through all the equivocation that had subsequently gathered around this event. It declares systematic subterfuge and a culpable lack of seriousness in the government as the causes behind this subversion of justice. And it does not believe the situation in the state to have changed in any significant manner.																														Two elements in the ruling show the extent of the courts mistrust of Mr Narendra Modis government. First, it has not spared the Gujarat courts, whose passiveness in the face of the perversion of justice has been strongly chastized. A new public prosecutor will be appointed, and the victims and witnesses will have their say in the choice. This is unprecedented. Second, the Gujarat governments looking elsewhere is portrayed by the court as a heinous act of terror: the modern-day Neros...were probably deliberating how the perpetrators of the crime can be saved or protected. The states role, therefore, is not simply that of an ineffectual spectator. The court endows it with active agency and deliberation. This is the clearest and most authoritative pronouncement on the exact nature of the violence in Gujarat, around which the state and Central governments have woven their web of evasive sophistry. (The prime minister had recently recommended forgiveness and forgetting.) The Supreme Courts statement dismisses all such obfuscation. But this is only the beginning of a process, and there are 11 more cases still awaiting justice.

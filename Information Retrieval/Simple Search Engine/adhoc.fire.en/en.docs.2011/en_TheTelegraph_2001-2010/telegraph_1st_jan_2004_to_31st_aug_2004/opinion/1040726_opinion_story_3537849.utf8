The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 26, 2004 							 																						UGLY FARCE																														Indian politics is never quite starved of the farcical. But the case of Mr Shibu Soren is hardly a laughing matter. Little wonder that the absconding minister hugely embarrassed the United Progressive Alliance government. Although he has finally put in his resignation, it is unlikely to bring the curtain down on the ugly episode. Once the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, asked him to resign, his exit from the cabinet was only a matter of time. And Mr Singh himself had little option but to show him the door once Mr Soren went underground to evade possible arrest in a criminal case against him. In a different situation, the prime minister would have probably sacked him straightaway. That would have been much more palatable for the government than facing the oppositions fire and its own embarrassment in and outside parliament. But the compulsions of coalition politics force governments to try and defend the indefensible. By hiding from the law, Mr Soren himself forced the prime ministers hands. His conduct once again raises serious questions about the politicians contempt for the law. The people no longer expect politicians to be the epitome of public morality. Mr Sorens bizarre case must have come as a new low in politicians popular profile.																														However, there may be some truth in the complaint that the case against Mr Soren is born of political vendetta. The government of Jharkhand, run by the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies, may well have a political motive in digging out a 29-year-old case and implicating Mr Soren in it. The suspicion is strengthened by the fact that over 400 cases, relating to incidents during the agitation for a separate Jharkhand state, have been withdrawn by the same state government. Even the BJPs decision to stall proceedings of both houses of parliament on Mr Sorens case has more politics than morality in it. After all, the previous National Democratic Alliance government tried everything to protect ministers like Mr George Fernandes and Mr Dilip Singh Judeo from corruption charges. Mr Fernandes, then defence minister, who had been forced to resign, was reinducted into the cabinet even before the inquiry against him was completed. But all this cannot justify Mr Sorens act of hiding from the law. It also makes little political sense for a man who aims to lead his party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, to power in Ranchi after the coming assembly elections. If he is eventually arrested, his supporters will understandably try to project him as a martyr. That is in the future, though. For now, his case is the first major loss of face for the UPA government.

		 Friday, April 23, 2004 							 																						TALK NUCLEAR																														The decision by India and Pakistan to hold a meeting of their experts on nuclear confidence-building measures at the end of May will be widely welcomed. It remains to be seen, however, if the meeting leads to the introduction of tangible measures to reduce the threat of a nuclear exchange in the sub-continent. The nuclear issue is clearly one that has caused deep concern to the international community and there has been tremendous pressure on New Delhi and Islamabad, in recent months, to engage each other seriously on this question. This, of course, is not the first time that India and Pakistan will be conducting a dialogue on the nuclear issue. Indeed, soon after the nuclear tests of 1998, both countries had begun talks on the nuclear issue. Ideas that were exchanged at the preliminary meetings translated into the well-known memorandum of understanding, which was signed at Lahore in 1999. Indeed, the Lahore MoU has, within its ambit, a comprehensive set of nuclear confidence-building measures. But while the Lahore MoU contained a series of imaginative proposals, specific technical agreements needed to be worked out. 																														Unfortunately, this did not happen for a variety of reasons. The Kargil war of 1999 and subsequent events ensured that the MoU remained on paper and made little difference on the ground. It was only after the prime ministers visit to Pakistan earlier this year, and the joint statement Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee issued with Mr Pervez Musharraf at Islamabad, that a decision was taken to carry forward the initial understanding arrived at in Lahore. It is fortunate that Pakistan seems to have finally realized that the nuclear issue cannot be kept hostage to the resolution of the Kashmir problem. In essence, both New Delhi and Islamabad seem to agree that nuclear weapons or instruments are for deterrence and not war-fighting. But to ensure the stability of deterrence, there has to be clarity about concepts and doctrines. New Delhi and Islamabad need to have a common understanding about the complexities of nuclear weapons and their management. They must know which lines must never be crossed. Moreover, specific systems need to be installed to prevent war because of an accident or misperception. There is an added need for a nuclear risk reduction centre in the region. If the forthcoming meeting of experts accomplishes even a few of these tasks, it will generate a great sense of relief in south Asia and beyond. The two sides can then also begin to address the more complex, but less urgent, issues that bedevil the relationship.

India could try influencing the US through its corporate allies which benefit from business process outsourcing, writes S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve Bank of India Wired for change Globalization involves import of goods  and services, where possible  without any barriers, in terms of tariff or other restrictions, from anywhere in the world. The United States of America has been an advocate of globalization and also its beneficiary. But recent events have seen a change in its attitude to the globalization of services inasmuch as they affect jobs in the US. The coming US presidential elections have lent an edge to the controversy about the shift of jobs from the US to India and China. Everywhere in the world, corporates are guided by profit. If it is more advantageous to produce goods and services in China or India, they would shift jobs there. Unfortunately, the outsourcing episode has happened just when the US has been facing a recession, though not a serious one. The presidential candidates are much concerned at reports of jobs being shifted out. Both politicians and trade unionists are trying to block such outsourcing.This is of particular importance to India because our balance of payments depends on business process outsourcing, which involves services ranging from call centre services to security analysis. This has been made possible by internet, which has reduced the cost of long-distance transmission and also made communication both clear and fast. US corporates are able to refer their consumer enquiries to call centres in India which respond immediately to them. The consumer at the other end is often unable to distinguish whether he has been serviced in the US or India. Corporates obviously benefit from the lower wages paid, which translate into lower costs of services.The outcry in the US against outsourcing is understandable given Americas recent economic conditions. Corporates moving jobs out have thus become targets of attack. A recent amendment introduced in the US restricts federal financing for corporates which outsource jobs to China and India. Certain states have already taken steps to prohibit contracts from being given to companies which outsource jobs to these countries.It is unfortunate that the godfather of globalization is now facing a backlash against BPO. US advocacy of free trade in goods and services can sound hollow when it is matched by measures to restrict access to free trade in services. All imports involve jobs going out along with the order for imported goods. The only difference is the degree of jobs embedded in goods. Services involve a higher percentage of jobs-per-dollar outsourced than in manufacturing.The merit of free trade is that each country specializes in those services or production of goods in which it is more efficient. This is the principle behind David Ricardos doctrine of comparative advantage. If China and India are more efficient in reducing services of goods at lower costs or a better quality, free trade dictates that they should provide the services or the goods. The same phenomenon occurs in reverse when the markets are opened up by India and China, who in turn receive goods and services from the developed countries of the world, often at the cost of craftsmen and small and medium industries.Fortunately, sober counsels have not been totally absent in the US. Gregory Mankiew, chairman of the presidents economic council, has argued that outsourcing is not bad in itself: When a radiologist in India analyses an X-ray sent to him via internet, the patient benefits by virtue of lower costs at equal efficiency. This brought on him the fury of the speaker of the House of Representatives himself. Mankiew was not defended even by the president, George W. Bush, who at that time was contemplating signing a prohibitory measure himself. Economists, who advise on free trade, are no longer as welcome in the US as before. If they go against what is perceived to be the availability of jobs in the US, they are told that their views are not welcome. Obviously, the US has its own reading on how far free trade can go.The democratic candidate, John Kerry, even called corporates, who resort to outshoring, Benedict Arnolds  or traitors who had once betrayed the American revolutionaries in the countrys war of independence. Expectedly, if Democrats come to power, the fate of BPO from the US will be jeopardized even more. Our policy-makers have to consider seriously the prospect of BPO being affected and revenue from it not rising at astronomical rates. Some believe that China has been handling its problem with regard to outsourcing of manufacturing jobs better than India in respect of services. One observer has even pointed out that Chinas lobbying involves US corporates directly. This is because many of the manufacturing entities in China which receive outsourcing of jobs from the US, are themselves partly owned by the US corporates. US corporates will have a serious hit on their bottom-lines if they are prohibited from sourcing their goods from China.Many argue that our lobby in favour of outsourcing has been less effective because corporates, like GE, which benefit from it, have not been active in canvassing against anti-outsourcing measures. China is also able to handle its lobbying better because its goods are visibly cheaper and demonstrably benefit the American consumer. Indias services lobby will have to present its good side  its provision of cheap services, including the types pointed out by Mankiew. Free trade does bring benefits, even if it means jobs going out as a consequence. The transition is, of course, painful, but it has to be tolerated.It cannot be denied that India needs to adopt a holistic policy in its approach to the US to beat the anti-offshoring tirade. In his recent visit, the US trade representative had pointed out that India still has high tariff barriers on imports from the US and needs to further liberalize its approach to purchases from America. Thus, India can tilt its purchase policy, such as in the case of purchase of aircraft from the US instead of France. After all, India has much to lose if it alienates US corporates. It will be good for India if it can point to the jobs it creates in terms of its import from the US. If it can be argued that Indias aircraft imports give rise to jobs to workers in the Boeing factory in Seattle, Washington, there is a better possibility of being able to justify low-paid call centre jobs migrating to India.

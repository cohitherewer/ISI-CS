		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 							 																						THE BATTLE FOR UTTAR PRADESHTWENTY-TWENTY / BHARAT BHUSHAN				 	 Art of making friends																														One of the keenest electoral contests of the forthcoming general election is likely to be witnessed in Uttar Pradesh. It is here that the mainline parties can improve their performance.																														Sonia Gandhi has spent a record number of nine days campaigning in UP although her party had only nine seats out of 80 in the state in the last Lok Sabha. She has also done everything to persuade Mayavati to form an alliance with the Congress.																														The Bharatiya Janata Party, having reached a saturation point in the states where it is strong, has to regain UP if its fortunes are to look up. Atal Bihari Vajpayee very carefully chose to kick off his partys election campaign from Ayodhya.																														It is a measure of UPs importance that the BJP had to go in sack cloth and ashes to invite Kalyan Singh back. The insult was greater for Vajpayee because Kalyan Singh had described the situation in UP at the time of his expulsion saying, PM piyakkad. CM bhulakkad. Janata fakkad  the PM is drunk, the chief minister (then Ram Prasad Gupta) forgetful and the people poverty-stricken.																														UP has always been important politically, often at the cost and to the chagrin of other states. The state has given India all but three of its prime ministers. Mulayam Singh Yadav dreams of ruling Delhi on the basis of his strength in UP. However, all the major political players preparing for the battle for UP are more vulnerable today than ever before. 																														Samajwadi Partys Mulayam Singh Yadav has begun his latest tenure as chief minister with a series of mistakes. Abolishing five of the new districts created by his predecessor, Mayavati, prompted an unnecessary agitation against his government. He has not been able to pay a higher procurement price to the sugarcane farmers even after the Centres announcement to do so. And as is the case with all his tenures in Lucknow, crime seems to be rising again. This time it has hit nearer home  with his own nephew being kidnapped.																														The UP Muslims once formed a solid vote bank for him. But now he is playing footsie with the BJP. He changed the government affidavit in the Babri Masjid demolition case so that the cases against BJP leaders like L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti could be dropped. His tryst with Sakshi Maharaj, alliance with Kalyan Singh, the chief minister who oversaw the Ayodhya demolition, and his refusal to say anything when Vajpayee talked of the emotional demand for building a Ram temple at the Babri site has put a question mark on his secular credentials. There is speculation that Mulayam Singh may go in to the election opposing the BJP but may not be averse to supporting the National Democratic Alliance in its aftermath. Perhaps his increasing vulnerability with regard to the Muslim vote bank made him issue an order curtailing school timings on Fridays to enable Muslim teachers and students to offer Friday prayers. He backtracked within 24-hours when Muslim leaders rejected such communally divisive action. 																														His detractors are accusing Mulayam today of promoting his own dynasty  his son was the member of parliament from Kannauj and is likely to contest again; one brother has been a three-term MP of Rajya Sabha and another is the agriculture minister in his government.																														The next contender in UP, the Bahujan Samaj Party, is also relatively more vulnerable today. Mayavati weakened herself by her involvement in the Taj corridor scam. Then Mulayam Singh poached her legislators to form his government. Six months have gone by, but the speaker of the UP assembly, BJPs Kesarinath Tripathi, is still mulling over the fact whether this was a defection calling for the disqualification of the legislators who switched sides, or a legitimate split. If he rules for disqualification, then Mulayams government becomes vulnerable to toppling.																														There is also a perception that under the Mulayam dispensation, the Dalit vote may not come out in sufficient numbers. Both the Congress and the BJP are in a position to pull down the Mulayam government and oblige Mayavati. However, the prospect of a hung Parliament and the need of both to woo the Samajwadi Party prevents such precipitate action.As for the BJP, it was weakened in UP with the departure of Kalyan Singh, a backward caste (Lodh Rajput) leader. However, his recent return cannot strengthen it now. When he led the party earlier, he was able to attract several other backward caste leaders  prominent among them were Mulayam Singhs bte noir, Ashok Yadav, Gangacharan Rajput, Kailash Yadav, Om Prakash Yadav, Avadhpal Yadav as well as some caste leaders of the Kurmis and Dhobis. Today most of them are out of the BJP  Gangacharan Rajput, from the same Lodh community as Kalyan Singh, joined the Congress last year, and Ashok Yadav became the prize catch of the party two weeks ago.																														Some alienation of the other backward classes vote in UP from the BJP was also caused by the abortive attempt by the then chief minister, Rajnath Singh, to introduce job reservation for the most backward castes within the OBC quota. The BJPs upper-caste vote is also in disarray. A large chunk of the Rajputs were alienated with the arrest of Raja Bhaiyya (Raghuraj Pratap Singh) under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Then Sanjay Singh, the Raja of Amethi, left the BJP and joined the Congress. And Amar Singh of the Samajwadi Party has also been trying to mobilize support among the Rajputs of eastern UP. The Brahmins are unhappy because they have been kept out of power by the BJP. 																														Overall then, the BJP is weak in UP and its fortunes are unlikely to change dramatically because of Kalyan Singhs induction.																														That leaves the Congress, which as of now is the weakest party in UP. Sonia Gandhi is making a valiant effort to breath new life into the party through her road-shows in the state. It is not in a position to organize rallies or big public meetings. Sonia Gandhis mass contact programme is likely to be effective only if she has an alliance with the BSP. Such an alliance would create tremendous problems for the BJP and Mulayam Singh. Wherever the Congress and the BSP come to an understanding, the Congress will be in the reckoning. The Muslim community in UP would have an alternative to Mulayams leadership and its vote would split. Both the Congress and the BSP would stand to gain.																														However, Mayavati is still frightened. The significance of a media report that the attorney general had advised the Central Bureau of Investigation not to arrest her has not been lost on her. She knows that she cannot form an alliance with the Congress in haste. Yet another reason could be that she wants to keep a door open to support the NDA after the elections.																														However, Mayavati has personal scores to settle in UP both with the BJP and with Mulayam Singh Yadav who are engaged in a wishful battle to finish her politically. There is every possibility, therefore, of Mayavati reaching a seat adjustment with the Congress. If this is to happen, it would be after the Election Commission announces the poll schedule. The BJP-led government cannot then get her arrested by the CBI.

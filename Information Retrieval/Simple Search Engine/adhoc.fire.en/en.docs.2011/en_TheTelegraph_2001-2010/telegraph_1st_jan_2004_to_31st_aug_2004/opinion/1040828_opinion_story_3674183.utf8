The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, August 28, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																It takes all kinds				 																																																				Sir  In a coalition, we normally designate ministers by the party to which they belong. But from the report, Left twins sore over arrogant ministers (Aug 24), it seems that in the United Progressive Alliance, ministers are being conveniently divided into tainted ministers, suavely arrogant ministers, bluntly arrogant ministers, loquacious ministers, and so on. These varieties of ministers do not need an opposition to bring discredit to their government. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S. Subramanyan, Mumbai 
				 																Tongue twisters				 																																																				Sir  Bibek Debroys article, All this hue and cry (Aug 24), struck a chord. Anyone comparing, say, the 9/11 commissions report with a government document in India will be struck by the difference: readable prose on the one hand and prolix officialese on the other. The reason why there has not been a plain English movement in India is obvious. In India, English, like Sanskrit once, has always been seen as the language of the ruling classes. 				 																																																				But English today is also the language of large numbers of Indian youth in both their private and professional lives. The English spoken here is certainly better synchronized with the English evolving worldwide. However, with the enthusiastic adoption of Hinglish by the media, in a desperate bid to appear hip, we have succeeded in creating a flavour of English that will be, in a couple of decades, as dialectical and unique as pidgin or Engrish. It will certainly be interesting to read government documents then.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Simplicity of language does not appeal to many, especially those who want to articulate complex ideas. But it does not make sense to write a legal document in a convoluted language whose meaning is unclear even to litigants. There is definitely a case for the language of law to be made simple. But at the same time, simplicity cannot be expected everywhere, as it may inhibit creativity.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Protyush Mozumder, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  I like Bibek Debroys plea for brevity and simplicity in the written word. Obviously, it is not simple to express the simple idea simply. More than 40 per cent of Debroys sentences exceed the prescribed 15-word limit.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Mukerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Bibek Debroy hits the nail on the head when he says that statutes need to be written in a way that they are comprehensible to most citizens. The problem is that most institutions in India have been set up on the pattern of British ones. Those who set them up forgot that most of the countrys population lives in the villages. The bombastic expressions in our statute books have allowed lawyers to exploit their clients time and again. 				 																																																				The concerns of the underprivileged masses in our country need to be heeded in a language that gives them the feeling that they are a part of a caring legal and administrative system.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

				 																																																				Sir  Bibek Debroys article brought to mind a Scottish legislation, a masterpiece of a complex sentence. In the Nuts (unground/other than ground nuts) Order, the expression nuts shall have reference to such nuts, other than groundnuts as would but for the amending order not qualify as nuts (unground/ other than ground nuts) by reason of their being nuts (unground).				 																																																				This is I feel enough to drive one nuts, unground or otherwise.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

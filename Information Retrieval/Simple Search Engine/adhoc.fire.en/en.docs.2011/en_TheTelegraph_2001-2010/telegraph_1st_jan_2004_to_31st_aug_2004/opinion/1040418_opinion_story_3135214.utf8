The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 18, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Frankly speaking				 																																																				Sir  Whatever faults V.C. Shukla may have, hypocrisy is certainly not one of them (Sympathy why? Asks Shukla, April 15). No one would have looked askance had Shukla softened his antipathy towards Ajit Jogi after his recent road accident. Shukla is forthright enough to say that the accident is unfortunate, but it doesnt absolve the former Chattisgarh chief minister of his misdeeds. Thats refreshing plainspeak, a welcome change from the run-of-the-mill politicians who smile when they want to snarl, and generally mean the exact opposite of what they say. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, J. Banerjee, Calcutta
				 																																																				Friendly contestn Sir  Ram Jethmalani is too clever by half (Ram pulls out, PM laughs it off, April 17). By citing a sudden family problem as the reason for pulling out of the fray at the last minute, he probably thought that he was forestalling criticism about his having given in to the prime ministers request not to contest against him. But the voters are no fools, they can see through such a transparent ruse as this. 				 																																																				But why did the high profile lawyer at all decide to contest against Atal Bihari Vajpayee? Or, for that matter, why did he join the Congress, since he was once a Union minister in a Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government? Is he still miffed at the BJP for sacking him from the law ministry? Certainly, Jethmalani did not join the Congress because he had suddenly developed an ideological opposition to the saffron party. Be that as it may, the Congress cannot complain now since it has brought the situation on itself, having inducted a fair-weather friend like Jethmalani.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Suman Rathod, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Both the prime minister and Ram Jethmalani are too old to contest elections (PM asks friend Ram to pull out, April 16). If government servants must retire after a certain age because they are no longer deemed fit for the job, it is senseless to elect such spent forces as law-makers. There should be an upper age-limit of 60 years for those contesting direct elections so that politicians can retire from active politics by the time they are 65. This will not only bring fresh talent into politics, but also see the end of professional politicians who run politics like their family business, and check the growth of dynastic politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayees open appeal to Ram Jethmalani to leave the Lucknow seat for him, on grounds of personal friendship and long association, is a gross subversion of the democratic process. It amounts to denying the electorate a choice of candidates, and the freedom to vote for or against Vajpayee. 				 																																																				The chief election commissioner should take note of such novel and seemingly innocent subversive strategies, and respond with appropriate cautionary notices.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai 

				 																Eye for detail				 																																																				Sir  The uniform worn by or designed for Amitabh Bacchhan in the picture accompanying Stars in her eyes (April 3) does not conform to the rank he is shown as holding. The cap is that of a selection grade officer and the collar ranks and badges are all wrong. It is embarrassing to find that neither the designer nor the actor, who is so esteemed, have an eye for such details. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Zutshi, via email

				 																																																				Sir  Amitabh Bachchan and his fans may be much-relieved at his having regained his star status, not so the millions of others who suffer his commercial endorsements on television, on the roadside or on print every other minute of their waking hours. In fact, Bachchans face has become so ubiquitous that one easily forgets which product he is asking one to buy  digestives, paints or energizers? Havent brand managers realized that getting the Big B to advertise their products can sometimes backfire on them?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Halder, Calcutta

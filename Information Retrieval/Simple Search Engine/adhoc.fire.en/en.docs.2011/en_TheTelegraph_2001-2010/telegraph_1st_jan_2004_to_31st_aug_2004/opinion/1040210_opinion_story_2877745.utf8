The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 							 																						PULLING OUT																														It is not easy to draw the line between what the state should do and what it should not. But common sense would suggest that the state has no business to waste public money on perennially loss-making ventures. It is no secret that West Bengals state-run transport system is not only a huge drain on the public exchequer but is also notorious for inefficiency. It is not surprising, therefore, that the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, does not want the state government to run buses and trams in Calcutta as it does now. His statement to this effect marks a major shift in the ruling Left Fronts policies. It is an indication of the changing priorities in governance. Even a leftist government can no longer afford to ignore basic economic arguments and stick to old ideas about the welfare state. More important, the communist chief minister seems to be veering round to capitalist ideas about the withdrawal of the state from areas which are best left to private initiative. If he is serious about putting such ideas into practice, the state government should withdraw from running not only a decrepit transport system but also other loss-making ventures such as hotels, tourist lodges and even manufacturing units. Some tentative steps suggest that the Left Front government is learning the basic economic lessons and trying to get out of businesses that are not the business of a government. 																														What the state can  and perhaps should  do is to create the right kind of infrastructure that enables a proper transport system to work in Calcutta. It should be some cause for hope that Mr Bhattacharjees government has entered into meaningful negotiations with Japanese and other foreign companies for major urban surface-transport projects for the city and its surrounding areas. The six Japanese-aided flyover projects offer hopeful signals that after decades of neglect Calcuttas transport system is finally poised to get at least a semblance of order and mobility worthy of a metropolis. Given the dismal state of the citys roads and its vehicular traffic system, such an overhaul was long overdue. And, there seems little doubt that the states own transport system is ill-equipped to improve the situation. It is possible, though, that the government would have to continue running its transport system for some more time. As long as it has to do so, the least that it can do is to ensure that the state-run transport corporations are run efficiently and with some financial discipline. Ultimately, however, only a change in policy perspectives can help matters in transport as in other public utilities.

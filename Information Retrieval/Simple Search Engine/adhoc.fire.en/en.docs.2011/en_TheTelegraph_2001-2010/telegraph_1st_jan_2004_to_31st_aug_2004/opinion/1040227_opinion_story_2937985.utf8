The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 27, 2004 							 																						OF DWARFS AND DEMONS				 	 Strange brewThe Simoqin Prophecies By Samit Basu, Penguin, Rs 250																														Dont go by your initial reaction to Samit Basus The Simoqin Prophecies. Because there is more to it than meets the eye. On a cursory glance, you are likely to wonder why Basu bothered to write the novel at all, because despite being promoted as Indias first fantasy novel, it seems little more than a rehash of virtually every well-known piece of literary work in this genre : from The Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland to Sukumar Rays Hojoborolo. In fact, it comes across as so derivative, that Basu himself, in recent interviews, has felt it necessary to counter possible charges of plagiarism.																					But it is not difficult to see that the allusions are part of the design. Basu grew up on a diet of fantasy novels, in fact, he devoured them. So it is not surprising that he should be hungry to do some cooking himself. But what he does, instead of a straight-forward dish, is throw into the pot all the ingredients at his disposal. What emerges is a hilarious concoction, a kind of khichdi, that gives readers a taste of mild spoof of the genre.																					Basu draws from a vast source, only to weave it all together with amazing deftness, piecing the fragments together until they fit like a jigsaw puzzle. Characters from Indian mythology mingle with ease with those of Greek legends. Little Red Riding Hood strolls casually into the world of Robin Hood. Other than the obvious allusions to the works of Tolkien and J.K. Rowling, there are, among other things, large quantities of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. He doesnt even spare Bridget Joness Diary.																					The story comes across as exceptionally imaginative. The novel is set in magical times, in mysterious lands, inhabited by mythical creatures. There are dwarfs (vamans), ogres  including a three-headed one  golems and things which intermingle freely with humans. There are heroes, heroines and demons. And of course, the obligatory quest and the eternal fight between good and evil. Two hundred years ago, the evil rakshas, Danh-Gem, who had unleashed an age of terror, was killed by an immortal race called the Ravians. But only after he managed to pronounce a terrible prophecy, which he inscribed in small, black letterings on the chest of a kidnapped Ravian hero named Simoqin. It predicted that he would rise again exactly two hundred years later. But what he didnt know was that as Simoqin lay dying, tortured and tormented, he uttered a counter-prophecy  that the last Ravian hero too shall return during this time and destroy the demon forever. 																					It is that time and suddenly there is news of sleeping dragons stirring in various parts of the land. Monsters have been sighted and the waters have risen to dangerous levels. These events indicate Danh-Gems return. Humans are worried because there is yet no sign of the saviour. So the worlds most powerful woman, the Chief Civilian of Kol, which is the richest nation, hires the most sought after secret service agent, Silver Dagger, to find him. Basu weaves an intriguing tale, full of mystery and suspense, with generous doses of humour. There are, for instance, traffic jams in the sky, a result of too many flying carpets. And followers of King Leer, the leader of the stone-men  Pashans  gets beaten up for eve-teasing.																					Basu also does a brilliant job of inventing fabulous (and grotesque) creatures. For instance, Spikes, who is a combination of yeti, porcupine, wild boar and Pashan: shorter and slimmer than other Pashans, standing about six feet tall, (he had), barring the huge tusks and eyes of yellow-green colour with vertical lids, reasonably human-like features. Calling Basus novel unoriginal is a grave mis take. In fact, barring the allusions, Basus interesting and witty tale captures our imagination till the very end.						DOLA MITRA

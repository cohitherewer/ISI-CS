The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 ALMOST A CIRCLE
																								History, when trapped in the labyrinth of Indian politics, appears to move in strange ways. For example, in Tamil Nadu, it seems to be moving in circles. The Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the latter fresh from its stint in the National Democratic Alliance, have decided to form the Progressive Front to confront the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies. This is hardly a surprise move. Mr M. Karunanidhis carefully calibrated build-up to the exit from the NDA suggested calculation and foresight. It also argued confidence. The relationship between the DMK and the Congress has had its ups and downs. The two were together in 1980, but in 1997 the Congress withdrew support to the United Front government led by Mr I.K. Gujral because the front would not banish the DMK, which had been mentioned unfavourably in the Jain commission report on the murder of Rajiv Gandhi. But the world has changed, and so has the Congress. It is willing to accept the BJPs taunts about its sudden change of heart regarding the DMK. It is also willing to accept that alliances are necessary and that attitudes and strategies need alteration. The Congresss defeats in the assembly elections must have affirmed the need for flexibility. 																								The promise to form a secular front, though, is becoming a bit of a ruse. The BJP is playing down its sectarian side, almost willing people to forget Gujarat  while Dara Singhs conviction has put a salve on the memory of the Staines murder. But the Congress is still batting on yesterdays pitch. Instead of countering the BJPs claims of good governance with records and programmes of development, the Congress has its most high-profile members exhibiting their devoutness, through yagnas, temple donations, river pilgrimages and such other activities. It is no longer possible to persuade the people of secular ideals once the meaning of the word has been systematically and timorously corrupted. Mr Karunanidhi is certainly the most useful ally the Congress can have in Tamil Nadu at the moment, although the finer points of the alliance have not yet been worked out. That will take time, but it is likely that both sides will adjust. They need each other.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 27, 2004 							 																						MEN WHO RULE 																														A well-known truth when reiterated by the seniormost mandarin acquires a certain edge. Mr Kamal Pande, the cabinet secretary, did not utter anything new when he underlined the prevalence of venality and influence in government offices. This knowledge is part of the experience of any individual who has had the misfortune of trying to get work done in a government office. That the cabinet secretary had to take note of this is novel. Mr Pande bemoaned the fact that even retired civil servants have to stoop to use influence to get their work done. It could be argued that retired civil servants are only hoisted by their own petard since they are to an extent responsible for perpetuating the system and the corruption and inefficiencies within it. How many civil servants can honestly claim that, while in service, they took steps to eradicate corruption and inefficiency? Mr Pande himself has spoken out only when he is practically at the end of his career as a civil servant. The prospect of descending to the common from that of a member of the heaven-born may have helped the process of realization. Whatever the motives, Mr Pande needs to be applauded for having spoken out against his colleagues. Such candour is rare in India.																														A part of the problem is indicated in Mr Pandes statement which distinguished between the common man and the retired civil servant. Government officials in India see themselves as a breed apart that is in some ways superior to ordinary mortals. They overlook the simple fact that the ordinary mans taxes pay their salaries. This sense of superiority produces insouciance. And this then becomes built into the system. Government servants are only too aware that there is little or no accountability in their work. They cannot be dismissed unless moral turpitude can be proved against them. Nobody has yet been able to define moral turpitude. The smugness this leads to creates the bizarre phenomenon where public servants do not serve the public and of a civil service which at the best of times is not even civil. Mr Pande has taken only the first step. He has identified the problem and instead of trying to suppress it, which is the standard government practice, he has made it public. But as the head of the countrys civil service, he owes it to the nation to at least put in place a system which will weed out and punish government servants who remember they have salaries to collect but forget they have duties to perform. Mr Pande has spoken of a paradigm shift. But this will not happen by itself. Mr Pande will be judged finally by his actions.

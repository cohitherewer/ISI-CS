The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 13, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																I remember, I remember				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee need not have been so literal while trying to sell the image of A resurgent West Bengal (Gherao out, says Buddha, June 10). No matter how strong, the winds of change can hardly alter the communists true colours. How could Bhattacharjee forget this even while insisting that gherao is now a thing of the past? True, the left have come a long way. Gheraos have now given way to bandhs and rallies. But their effect remains the same  disruption of work. Pity Bhattacharjee does not consider giving them a burial as he has done gherao.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Arnab Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																 Bad connection				 																																																				Sir  The report, New entrant in Internet service (May 26), mentions that only Sify-i-way and Amtrons Magic Surf are providing broadband services in Guwahati now. But North East Online Services (P) Limited has been the first internet service provider in the region to provide broadband services. The companys customer base at the moment is more than the combined customer base of Sify and Amtron. About 40 per cent of the cyber cafes in Guwahati use the companys broadband internet connection. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shovon Chakraborty, Guwahati 

				 																																																				Sir  The report, 80,000 hang up on CalTel landlines (May 1), is not surprising. The Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited has never been known to ensure prompt and courteous service, which would be more welcome than fact-finding exercises. The World Wide Fund for Nature, India, is a well-known non-governmental organization. Since one of our office telephone lines was in the name of a former director of the organization, the WWF, in 1996, had put forward an application along with the requisite documents for deletion of the directors name. But no action has been taken so far. The BSNL has also mistaken the word Nature for Mature in the address for one of the NGOs telephone lines. Despite the correspondence and numerous visits to the BSNL office, the error has not been rectified. If better services can be obtained from other service providers, customers will have no problems shifting their loyalties from the BSNL.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Shakti Ranjan Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The BSNL charges its customers unfairly. Although it widely advertises on its webpage and in newspapers that it applies a 10-minute pulse in off-peak hours for internet access, it actually charges for a 3-minute pulse any time in Kharagpur. BSNL authorities have been notified of this anomaly in several letters. Action must be initiated against the BSNL for misleading and overcharging customers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prasenjit Bhakat, Jhargram

				 																																																				Sir  This is to draw attention to the apathy of Calcutta Telephones. I had applied to the commercial officer, Calcutta Telephones (south), on September 15, 2003, for the surrender of the telephone at my residence. My case was registered and, as advised, I attached the relevant documents (the first and last bill paid and the security deposit slip) to my letter to the accounts officer (south). Despite several reminders, I have not got a refund. Worse, the officials did not even have the courtesy to acknowledge receiving my letters. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kuber Sen Parkash, Calcutta

				 																The argument stands				 																																																				Sir  With reference to Tsewang Rigzins didactic assertion in Pristine hills (June 9) about the politics of Tsering Angmo Shunu, All India Radios station director in Leh, the good lady herself confirmed to me that she had been a Youth Congress activist and had met Indira Gandhi in that capacity. That was after friends in Srinagar, including some in the National Conference office, told me of the connection. As for Ladakhs radio and press, they do not compare with televisions reach.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, Calcutta

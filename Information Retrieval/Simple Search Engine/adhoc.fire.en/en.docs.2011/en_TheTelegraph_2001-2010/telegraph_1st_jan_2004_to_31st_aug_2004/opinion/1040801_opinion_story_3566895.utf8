The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 01, 2004 							 																						LA DOLCE VITA																														The allure of the celebrity world often camouflages deep despair. The glitter hides egos that are fragile and vulnerable. The suicide of former Miss India, Nafisa Joseph, brings home a side of the world of tinsel and limelight which is spoken of only in hushed tones. When Nafisa Joseph sashayed down the catwalk and when she answered with a smile the questions that were put to her by the jury, nobody quite suspected that behind the apparent show of confidence and joie de vivre was a persona that was sentimental and prone to anguish and doubt. A set-to with ones fianc cannot be an adequate reason to take ones life unless ones persona had been badly bruised. It speaks of an immature ego which sees a break-up as an emotional apocalypse. It is a fact of society that celebrities have egos which are disproportionately large, and therefore, insecure and fragile. Constant public attention and adulation and the strain of matching persona to image erode the ego to the extent of making the mask more important than the man. A seemingly minor incident snaps the world of make-believe, but by then, the person concerned is in no position to bear too much reality. The ending of ones life appears as the only option.																														The classic victim of this process was of course Marilyn Monroe. Born Norma Jean Baker, she became Americas poster girl and every males ultimate fantasy. Who will ever forget that picture of Monroe nude, spread out on the cupboard or of her on a New York street, holding down her skirt from a sudden gust of breeze from the subway? Her acting talents were overshadowed by her projected sex appeal and she acquired an image of a sex goddess which had little or no connection with reality. Somewhere, deep down, she remained the little girl from LA who became the plaything of powerful men in Hollywood, New York and Washington DC. A president claimed her, as did the New York mafia. It ultimately proved too much for her and she chose the exit route via an overdose of sleeping pills. Monroe was a typical, if extreme example. But many other actors and actresses suffered from the bizarre alienation that comes inevitably with celebrity status. They may not have been driven to suicide but they sought solace from their alienation through alcohol and drugs.																														Forms of escapism are invariably bred into the celebrity status, especially when that celebrity status comes out of showbiz, the world of fashion or modelling. The limelight switches on and off, and this converges with periods of light and darkness, between periods of confidence and despair, between the pose and the persona. Most celebrities are emotionally and intellectually not equipped to cope with these cycles. They prepare faces to face the faces that they meet and the effort to keep up this relentless performance saps the system of the wherewithal to cope with any kind of crisis. Nafisa Josephs suicide only draws attention, once again, to the transient and shallow nature of all celebrity status. The lure of glitter is never too far away from the psychiatrists couch and, worse, the desire to end the meaninglessness of everything.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 18, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Dead men tell no tales				 																																																				Sir  Had the minister of state for Paschim Anchal Unnayan affairs, Maheswar Murmu, been listening closely to the villagers of Amlashol, he would have thought twice before announcing that the deaths in the village had been caused by illness and not starvation. Did not the truth reveal itself to him even after villager after villager had narrated how their inability to procure food, coupled with the dearth of medical facilities, had taken a toll in Amlashol (In rain, minister made to listen to starvation wail, June 13)? Even if one were to go by the illness card that is being played by Murmu, he should perhaps be reminded that in every case, the deaths had been hastened by malnutrition. The picture that all is well that Murmu is now painting, together with his perverse claim that the media reports had been exaggerated to get more aid for the area, is despicable, to say the least. Either way the minister was being economical with the truth  now and when he had coyly said that the people did not have the means to have a proper meal a day.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Monideepa Dutta, Calcutta
				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Wrong to starve (June 14), will not open the governments eyes to the starvation deaths in Midnapore if it chooses to keep them shut. Starvation deaths do not occur suddenly. One wonders what the local administration was doing all the time the Sabars and Lodhas were dying. More despicable, the media expose, instead of pushing the administration into taking immediate corrective measures, only made it defensive, in trying to prove that the deaths were the result of natural causes or illnesses. Now the only alternative left to these people may be to shift and find some space in Calcuttas footpaths, where nobody dies of starvation. Or they may eat the leaves of the remaining trees in the area. If the goats can survive on the diet, why cant the men? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have finally conceded that hunger and malnutrition continue to haunt a large section of the people in West Bengal (CM admits poverty amp; pockets of hunger, June 15). But instead of being remorseful, he appears intent on telling the people that the Left Front had not done a bad job of ruling the state. Bhattacharjee claims that his government is aiming to develop infrastructure in the backward areas. But if people keep dying of hunger, whom will the infrastructure serve? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aamir Sajjad Ahmed, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I cant agree more with the view expressed in the report, Hunger then and now (June 15), that Ten years have changed little, except the chief minister, in a part of West Midnapore. It is a disgrace not just for those in Bengal but for Indians everywhere that people continue to die here for lack of food. No government has the moral right to continue if even one of its citizens dies of hunger. If only the states communist leaders had learnt from capitalist countries like the United States of America and established some form of a social security system, which ensured food and clothing for everyone, people would not have had to die so in Amlashol. But the communists have never really cared for the poor. The only time they do something for the poor is during the elections, after winning which they disappear into their air-conditioned party offices. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Ashis Chakrabarti highlights an important truth about governance in the country today  the relationship between the government and people continues to be that of ruler and ruled, as it was in colonial times (Living on the edge, June 16). Sadly, Marxism has failed to remove this mindset from the rulers of Bengal. As long as the ruling classes distance themselves from the ruled, such apathy and wilful suspension of disbelief will continue. A paradigm shift in the perceptions of administrators is needed. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Partho Datta, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The starvation deaths in Amlashol in west Midnapore have been shocking. The farmers suicides in Andhra Pradesh were related to debt, yet N. Chandrababu Naidus party was punished in the elections. But the left remains in power given its machinations and muscle power. The chief ministers claim that West Bengals record in alleviating poverty is among the best in India is a cruel joke. Barring Kalahandi in Orissa, starvation deaths have not been reported from anywhere in the country. No starvation deaths have been reported in Bengal since the great famine of the Forties. The 27 years of Marxist rule, however, have reduced us to penury and starvation.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

				 																																																				Sir  The Amlashol deaths are very different from the starvation deaths reported from Kalahandi. From photographs, Kalahandi seems to be a thoroughly parched area. But nature has not been as cruel in Amlashol. The medias claim that the deaths are owing to starvation and the governments counter-claims that they were due to malnutrition and disease need to be properly investigated. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Tarun K. Sarkar, Calcutta				 																Look back in anger				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayee took a very long time to decide that Narendra Modi should be sacked as chief minister of Gujarat on account of the post-Godhra riots in the state (Vajpayee dares to put Modi on notice, June 14). Had this statesman come to this view on moral or constitutional grounds, he would have taken action immediately after the incident. After all, he was prime minister at the time. 				 																																																				The sangh parivar may protest the inclusion of tainted ministers in the Union cabinet. But their blue-eyed boy, Modi, is just as objectionable and has been indicted by no less than the Supreme Court.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mukul Dube, Delhi 

				 																																																				Sir The sangh parivar seems to be a divided house. The way Praveen Togadia and Giriraj Kishore have been venting their ire on Atal Bihari Vajpayee for damaging the partys prospects by appeasing the Muslims, it seems the sangh leaders believe that the most effective way to secure another term at the Centre is to humiliate the Muslims as much as possible. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Abdul Barique, Dhaligaon, Assam

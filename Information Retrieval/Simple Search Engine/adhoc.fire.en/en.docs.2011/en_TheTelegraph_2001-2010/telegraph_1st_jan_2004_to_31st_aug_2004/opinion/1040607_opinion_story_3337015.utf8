The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 07, 2004 							 																						SELECTORS UNDER THE SCANNER Raju Mukherji																					Abhijit Kale has been banned for seven months for gross misconduct and indiscipline although no direct proof was found of his trying to bribe selectors of the national team last year. But there still remains questions which have not been answered. Let us once again take a look at what exactly happened according to the national selectors, Kiran More and Pranab Roy, who were allegedly offered bribes.																					It is claimed by the two former test cricketers-turned-national selectors that the state-level (Maharashtra) and national-level one day international player, Abhijit Kale, offered them a sum of money in exchange of getting selected into the national team. Let us accept that this is true. And also let us accept that the selectors were not willing to play ball on this issue.																					In that case, the best two options that the selectors had in front of them were: one, if they had wanted to save Kale, they should have told him not to pursue the matter further. Also that they would forget the incident and forgive him. Two, if they had wanted to nail him, then they should have asked him to bring the money so as to get him caught red-handed by the police.																					It is claimed by the selectors that they told Kale not to pursue the matter further. Fair enough. All indications meant that it was their intention not to nail him but to save him. This was indeed a praiseworthy idea, coming from two senior cricketers who wanted to guide a supposedly wayward youngster along the right path.																					The wise men																					However, within a few days, the two senior national selectors went to the Board of Control for Cricket in India as well as to the media to complain against Kale. This was ridiculous. If they were so keen to nail him, why did they not ask Kale to bring the money so that he could be nabbed?																					The action of the selectors defies logic. The two wise men initially informed the world that they were approached over telephone. In a civilized society can a telephone conversation be held to be adequate proof? As if this was not incredible enough, the two have put forward witnesses. Where were these witnesses months ago when the issue had originally cropped up? The answer that has been given to this question is as queer as their selection policies in which they insist on taking injured players on holiday jaunts.																					Indian cricket selection has always been open to suspicions. Over the last 80 years we have had some very strange policies. In 1936, we had Baqa Jilani playing one test match for abusing a co-player. We have had players playing test matches for their close proximity to selectors and captains. We have had innumerable players who have played one or two tests for reasons best known to selectors. We have had players who have played tests as batsmen without a single century in first-class cricket. 																					Doubtful credibility																					Once in 1952, the worlds greatest all-rounder of the time, Vinoo Mankad, was omitted by the Indian selectors because he was unable to attend a selection trial. There have been many other instances when the credibility of the selectors has been doubted.																					The breed of selectors seems to belong to a certain class where integrity is not a qualification. Is this the reason why men of the legendary stature of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Mohinder Amarnath are not considered capable enough to be national selectors?																					If it is true that a player dared to offer inducements to BCCI selectors, then it is indeed a matter of deep regret that the selectors did not have the intelligence to pin down the culprit. The question is should men of such calibre then be allowed to serve in such exalted positions of Indian cricket? The matter is not to be taken lightly, especially because in these days when players earn crores of rupees, there is every possibility that such cases would recur in the future with regularity. The best way out would be to have men of impeccable credentials in selection committees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 08, 2004 							 																						HAWKS EYE VIEW																														The Economic Survey shows the budget as much as morning shows the day. Thus the imprint of the common minimum programme and what the finance minister reportedly wants to do are clear in the Survey of 2003-04. Profit-making public sector units will not be divested and labour laws will not be reformed without consensus, although, on the latter, the Survey also mentions rigid labour laws as a constraint to 10 per cent industrial growth. Since the Survey has not so far been a political document, there was no reason to dilute the rationale of several earlier Surveys to reflect the constraints of the CMP. Mr Chidambaram inherits a sound macro-economy and the Survey has expected plaudits, especially on the external sector, with caveats thrown in about high global oil prices and the consequent impact on inflation. On the external sector, an argument is advanced about reducing import duties and gradually aligning them with levels in the Association of South East Asian Nations, spliced with liberalization of the foreign direct investment regime. 																														A reduction in peak manufacturing import duty from 20 per cent is unlikely in the budget and the Survey perhaps advisedly uses the word gradually. While the macro-economy is sound, 7-8 per cent growth on a sustained basis is not axiomatic, notwithstanding the spectacular 8.2 per cent in 2003-04 and the expected 7 per cent in 2004-05. There can be no quarrel with the Surveys agenda of 7-8 per cent sustained gross domestic product growth  industrial growth of at least 10 per cent, diversification and increase in agricultural growth, and physical infrastructure improvements. Nor can there be any doubts about the Surveys list of constraints on 10 per cent industrial growth  reservation for small-scale industries, high import duties, labour law rigidities, lack of economies of scale, entry and exit problems, and distortions in indirect taxes. Both direct and indirect tax reform is high on the Surveys agenda and this goes beyond making tax administration easier. Other than adherence to the new value added tax deadline of April 1, 2005, the Survey flags the two Kelkar task-force recommendations, particularly on removal of exemptions. Without the tax/GDP ratio increasing, fiscal consolidation is impossible and the Survey warns of a possible hardening of interest rates, together with the problem that lending rates have not dropped as much as deposit rates have. 																														Other than exemptions and easier compliance costs, the Survey also harps on more rigorous penal and enforcement mechanisms. This is in line with the recommendations of the Kelkar committee and several statements the finance minister has made. Many public expenditure commitments that the CMP has are contingent on fiscal consolidation, especially at the state-level, and the Survey links this to VAT and recommendations of the 12th finance commission. This is a doubtful argument because VAT rates are revenue neutral ones. The Survey, much as usual, has only underlined the problems.

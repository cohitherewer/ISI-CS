The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, March 28, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Why are the top stars of the political firmament shying away from contesting the general elections? This reluctance is quite strange because to look at them and to hear them in the media, one gets the impression that they, at least, have no doubts about winning and coming to power. And its not just Congressmen who are chary about testing their popularity, the BJP-wallahs are no better. Consider the shirkers  Pramod Mahajan, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, M Venkaiah Naidu, Ambika Soni, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmad Patel, Salman Khurshid, Arjun Singh, Mohsina Kidwai, K Karunakaran... the list can go on and on. Ask these leaders, and their reasons for not contesting would appear either justified or merely an excuse, depending on where you stand. Sample Rajnath Singhs take on keeping out of the fray, which is something like this  while I can win from any seat I choose to contest from, I belong to the whole of UP and couldnt possibly be tied down to a single constituency. Also, where would I contest from? Amethi? I am a Thakur and Thakurs never take on a woman; Ghaziabad is too close to Delhi; Bulandshahr doesnt have the right caste equations. And so on. Given these high-profile politicians anxiety to save their skins, are the contestants then fools who are rushing in where angels fear to tread? 				 																																																																														 Is Salman Khurshid a closet admirer of Atal Bihari Vajpayee? Or is it only a coincidence that every star he inducts into the party turns out to be a fan of the prime minister? The press conference to admit Khurshids latest trophy  Miss India Universe Nikita Anand  went something like this. Q: What is your opinion about Vajpayee? A: He is our respected prime minister. I respect him. Q: Why do you want to campaign for the Congress? A: Because it is a secular party. Q: Do you consider the BJP a communal party? A: No. A few days ago, Naveen Jindal, another Khurshid inductee, had similar things to say about ABV: that he was a man of integrity and stature, and he respected him a lot. As did music director Ravindra Jain. Following his induction into the Congress, Jain did not even bat an eyelid when telling the media  I have no qualms about going anywhere. I have great respect for Vajpayee. He is a great man. In the evening I will be going over to the Shiv Sena for dinner. Standing next to Jain, Khurshid could almost be seen squirming. 				 																																													After this hat-trick of Vajpayee-admirers, perhaps Khurshid will be fourth-time lucky.				 																																																																														 Come elections, and it is time for god-men, astrologers and the like to make merry. After all, politicians are legendary for their insecurity. Take Kamal Nath, who has won six times from Chindwara but still feels the need to call up Asha Ram Bapu and seek his blessings. But if god is scrupulously fair to all those who appeal to him, godmen are known to play favourites. Bapu, for one, has his pet politico  Prahlad Patel (remember Mamata Banerjees junior in the coal ministry?), who is alleged to seriously believe that HIV/AIDS is on the rise among goats in India. Next, perhaps he will want to distribute condoms among them.				 																																																																														 The best part, however, about astrology and all that mumbo-jumbo is that it can mean whatever one wants it to mean. At a sumptuous do held recently at M Venkaiah Naidus residence to celebrate the Telugu new year, Nagmani Sharma, a Sanskrit scholar, gave a discourse on what the coming year had in store for his host. The high-point of this speech  that person(s) with the alphabet v in their name would do well this year. By that logic, Venkaiah Naidu, AB Vajpayee, LK Advani  all would qualify. Now thats what they call killing three birds with one stone. 				 																																																																														 Pranab Mukherjee might be contesting elections after a long time, but he sure knows how to make friends and placate rivals. For a start, he has made up with long-time rival ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury, whose house he will be using as his base camp. Not only will Barkat-das hospitality cushion the travails of the election campaign, but Mukherjee also hopes that his political goodwill in Malda will have a spillover-effect in neighbouring Jangipur. 				 																																													Thats one rival won over, but what does the West Bengal Congress chief intend to do about the cold vibes hes been getting from Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, whose exclusive hold over the lower house may be threatened if Mukherjee wins?				 																																																																														 SMS has become the favoured medium for political parties to spread the word. Take this recent one  Kaun banega PM  Sonia jisne shaadi ke liye desh choda, ya Atalji, jinhoney, desh key liye shaadi chodi? Poor Sonia Gandhis Hindi might not stretch to making a fit reply, but what about the EC?				 																																																																														 The rising son has upset power equations in 10, Janpath. Until now, Congressmen had been used to viewing Sonia Gandhi as the source of all power, with Priyanka being equally, if not more, important. Now they are not so sure. A new club of Rahul-philes is emerging, which has members like Jairam Ramesh, Salman Khurshid, Sam Pitroda and Ambika Soni (the last by default, since she apparently does not get along with Priyanka). Lower down the rank and file too there is a lot of curiosity about the heir apparent  what does he like, what does he eat, drink and watch? His preference for the English language has been a bit of a dampener for the khadi-clad, paan-chewing netas, who would have much preferred Priyanka. But the Rahul camp is not sitting idle. It counters such criticism by pointing to Rahuls supposed liking for Hindi films and to Kareena Kapoors once having said that she would love to date him. They may have been believeable there, had it not been for the fact that the Kareena quote they are referring to was made quite some time ago.

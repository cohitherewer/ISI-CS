The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 11, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Priyanka Gandhi is yet to say yes, but the BJP has already decided whom it will put up against her in Rae Bareilly  Varun Gandhi. The saffron party has already adopted Varuns mother, Maneka, and by fielding Varun seems all set to make political capital out of the disaffection between the two branches of the Nehru-Gandhi family. The battlelines are already being drawn, with Varun being projected as the real heir to the family legacy and Priyanka discredited as only half-Indian and one-fourth Hindu, given her mothers lineage and husbands religion. Whether Varun will win against his charismatic cousin is doubtful  and really the BJP didnt prop him up for his winning ways, he is just meant to muddy the waters a bit and provide some drama. But Varun is taking his new role very seriously; he can be seen nowadays pacing up and down with his hands tied behind his back. He is practising being Jawaharlal Nehru!				 																																																																														 Bihar is a world unto itself  or so the Biharis love to say. The BJP is only now learning that this is no empty boast. M Venkaiah Naidu was at a function recently to welcome Nagmani Chowdhary, who led a revolt against Laloo Prasad Yadav, into the party. But when he entered the hall where the alliance was to be formally announced, he found that it was packed with Chowdharys followers from the Soshit Kranti Dal. Nobody recognized him and horrorstruck, he saw that everyones attention was firmly fixed on the stage where a male nachania was dancing  a favourite pastime of Bihari politicians. Even when he made his way to the podium, he had to wait as Nagmani made a long speech to thunderous slogans. When he finally got a chance to speak, Venkaiah Naidu couldnt resist telling them that they were in the BJP, they should learn some discipline. But was anyone listening?				 																																																																														 Come elections, and astrologers, numerologists, vaastu specialists and such like seem to crawl out of the woodwork. It is early days yet, but some predictions are already being peddled. One is that Sonia Gandhi is never going to be a prime minister  because she doesnt have an r in her name, as all Indian PMs, from Jawaharlal Nehru to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have had. If that leaves Sonia high and dry, it doesnt hold out any hope for Mulayam Singh Yadav or Mayavati either. Vaastu expert Ishwar Reddy blames all the Congresss ills  from the recent fall in its fortunes to the untimely deaths of Feroze, Sanjay and Rajiv Gandhi  on Anand Bhawan, 24 Akbar Road and 10 Janpath facing the north-east. Then how does Reddy explain Anand Bhawans earlier pre-eminence or Rajivs landslide 1985 victory, operating out of 24 Akbar Road?				 																																																																														 With elections round the corner, the hunt for the right CEC has really hotted up. For one, the choice has to have the consent of Sonia Gandhi, and with the BJPs relations with the Congress being the way they are, that wont be easy. But at least the political class is agreed one thing  they will not have anyone who has an even remote chance of grandstanding  la TN Seshan. 				 																																													Two, the tussle in babu circles seems nowhere near ending. TS Krishnamurthy, senior-most after JM Lyngdoh, would have been the logical choice, only he is an IRS, and the IAS will never allow a mere IRS to make it to such a high position. The latter has picked Deepak Chatterjee, a choice blessed by Arun Jaitley, the BJPs flavour of the season. 				 																																																																														 Everyone seems to have dismissed Sonia Gandhis understanding of politics, but her speed in stitching up alliances or poll understandings in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal must be admired. In panic, the BJP was driven into the arms of the Akalis in Punjab. But that alliance does not do much for the BJP  of the 13 Lok Sabha seats from the state, the Akalis get 12 and the BJP, 1. The joke going round in the state BJP circles is that Sukhbir Singh Dhindsa, who conducted the negotiations on behalf of the Akalis, had not forgotten the comment Pramod Mahajan, the BJPs emissary, had made  that there were two redeeming features of the match-fixing controversy  the country had come to know that it had a sports minister called Dhindsa and an actor called Kishen Kumar!				 																																																																														 Sonia Gandhi may want to be seen across as an advocate of secularism, but she is as Hindu as they come  at least in being superstitious, conservative and a strong believer in rituals. She will not make any of the much-needed changes in the AICC in the inauspicious month of Pous and is waiting for January 14, Makar Sankranti, and the beginning of Maagh for shifting her pawns around. Another politician who is waiting desperately for the new month is Uma Bharti, who wants to start her stay in her chief ministerial residence in Bhopal on a lucky note. Meanwhile the sadhvi CM has raised the hackles of the state DGP, SK Das, who was scandalized at his men, in full uniform, touching the feet of saffron-clad politicians. 				 																																																																														 There are no longer any doubts that he is Indias most popular politician, but did you know that our prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is also probably the most popular Indian in Mian Musharrafs land? The Pakistanis are so sold on his peace plan today that they have quite forgotten that Vajpayee came to power in the last general elections by selling war  the one in Kargil. 				 																																													It was thus not surprising at all that Vajpayee came back from Pakistan laden with lots of gifts. Among them are numerous shalwar kameezs, stitched by the tailor who also makes them for the Pak PM, Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamaali. When they met, Vajpayee had admired his hosts wonderful Pathan suits and the later had immediately called his tailor and asked him to take Vajpayees measurements. Shaukat Aziz, finance minister and Vajpayees minister-in-waiting gave him a whole set of CDs of well-known Pakistani singers like Noor Jehan, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Reshma, Ghulam Ali and so on. Given this show of camaraderie, one can only hope that the bonhomie lasts for some time.

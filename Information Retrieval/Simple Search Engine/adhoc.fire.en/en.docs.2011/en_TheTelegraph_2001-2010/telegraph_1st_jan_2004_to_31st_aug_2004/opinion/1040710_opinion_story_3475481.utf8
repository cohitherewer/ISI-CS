The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 							 																						WILLINGLY TO SCHOOL																														It is only in fairy-tales that good news comes unqualified. India could have done with the good news that more children are going to school, but the latest Economic Survey does not stop at that. Although there has been a rise in the percentage of children from six to fourteen years of age enrolling in school between 2000-01 and 2001-02, the dropout rate has shown an increase in the same period. Figures are not the stuff of fairy-tales, in any case. Even the growth in enrolment percentage leaves many questions unanswered. Does growth mean that more children from backward groups or regions are beginning to go to school? A few states have claimed success for pockets where the midday-meal scheme has taken hold. But even as an achievement, it is really an incentive and an assurance of one nutritious meal for children who generally do not eat well. That might make them healthier and brighter, although the importance of this should not be underestimated. But it is still the kind of tangential good that distracts from the main issues.																														The main issues are many. Real improvement has to be looked for in a change of mindset, and there are some signs of that. For one, more people want to educate their children, and even in very backward rural areas, are willing to go through much hardship in order to do so. Educating girls is being seen as a need, as an earning woman, especially in lower-income urban and semi-urban families, has become an asset. But to encourage the changing mindset, there must also be a changing infrastructure. The increase in the number of primary schools and the burgeoning number of educational programmes are still unable to meet the desires of the people. Some schools lack a wall or two, or have a leaking roof; a large number have only one or two rooms, which means the lowest class accommodates all pupils from four to eight and registers a big number of enrolments; rural schools often lack drinking-water facilities (children may have to go across and draw water from a nearby well) and toilets are scarce, especially for girls. Three teachers in one primary school is standard, but that magic number is sometimes elusive, especially in Bihar and West Bengal, which tend not to fill up posts.																														These problems have been reiterated endlessly. That they persist suggests that thinking about primary education is still fuzzy. It is not only necessary to build schools within accessible distance, but also to ensure that the children can absorb what they are taught. This would include proper seating space and shelter from the elements apart from regular classes. Also, local conditions must be a determinant in how the basic things are taught. Many children from the backward rural areas and the poorest urban sections are the first to become lettered in their families. No education for them can be planned without taking the ambience of such homes into account. Again, forcing on a child from an indigenous group the main language of the state as medium of instruction  Oriya for a Kue speaker in Orissa, for example  is self-defeating. It is not only a disincentive, it is a stalling of the learning process that no midday meal can make up for. If enrolment is to beat dropout rates, perceptiveness about local conditions is a major consideration.

		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 							 																						SHEER MINDLESS DRUDGERY Gouri Chatterjee																					If you thought outsourcing was already big news in the West, rest assured itll be nothing compared to the churning that the news about outsourcing journalism to India will bring forth.																					The news, as reported in Mondays New York Times, is startling enough: Reuters is hiring six journalists in India who will be based in Bangalore but will cover companies in America.																					The trickle could even turn into a flood. Ill keep you informed on how this develops, the global managing editor of Reuters, David Schlesinger, has told his present editorial staff. This could be a very exciting way to get more news on our wires in a more efficient way. 																					Reuters today, AP or AFP or even the New York Times tomorrow. Indian journalists can at last hope for their place in the sun.																					I wonder. All these jobs will be exceedingly low-level. The task of the reporters in the Reuters BPO will be to cull out basic financial information from company news releases and quarterly earnings reports, which will then serve as inputs for the financial services products that form the main source of revenue for Reuters. That is, sheer mindless drudgery. 																					The sort of gauntlet all budding journalists have to run, yes. Except that the ones in BPOs can never hope to graduate to anything more challenging. The action relating to the stuff they will be processing will be too far away.																					As for foreign news organizations seeing BPOs as talent pools, forget it. Even when it comes to reporting India, self-respecting media outlets ship in their own people with knowledge of readers and viewers at home. The natives can at best be their assistants, but even for that one will need experience in real journalism.																					Now I know why N.R. Narayanamurthy looks so embarrassed at India being called an IT giant. Its not false modesty. There is something demeaning in India shining because of call centres.																					Trial by press																					Delhi high court Justice J.D. Kapoor must be allowed his few minutes of glory. Even then, his diatribe against the media for its role in the Bofors case in particular and trial by press in general has to be noted as it is sure to strike a chord in many. 																					The press was an integral part of the Bofors case right from that day in April 1987, when Swedish Radio claimed A.B. Bofors had paid kickbacks to Indian politicians and bureaucrats, notwithstanding the Rajiv Gandhi governments assertions to the contrary. 																					More, while the government did nothing for nearly three years, the press followed up this revelation and established that yes, commissions were paid, whoever the recipients may be. Surely, this did not merit the judges comment that it was a nefarious example which manifestly demonstrates how the trial and justice by media can cause irreparable, irreversible and incalculable harm 																					The judge, like many others, seems to be labouring under the delusion that investigative journalism must lead to the presentation of a legally watertight case. Thats endowing journalists with excessive and unnatural abilities. The most journalists can do is establish wrongdoing. It is for the government to hunt out and charge the wrongdoers. The press cant be blamed for the government failing to do so in 16 long years.																					Safe is boring																					What does the most powerful man in the world do when things start slipping? Brave an interview with Tim Russert, as George Bush did last Sunday. Not because he had anything new to say, but because just sitting down with Russert is a political statement in itself. Such is the standing of this 53-year-old lawyer-turned-interviewer, seen as a tough but fair, equal-opportunity griller by all in America.																					Who could Atal Bihari Vajpayee (or Sonia Gandhi) turn to? My money is on Karan Thapar. Prannoy Roy is too markedly anti-BJP, Manoj Raghuvanshi too pro. Vir Sanghvi is too indulgent while Prabhu Chawla is too brash. And Kapil Dev did choose the BBC and Thapar to protest his innocence. But, of course, our leaders will opt for safe and boring Doordarshan in the name of reaching the masses.

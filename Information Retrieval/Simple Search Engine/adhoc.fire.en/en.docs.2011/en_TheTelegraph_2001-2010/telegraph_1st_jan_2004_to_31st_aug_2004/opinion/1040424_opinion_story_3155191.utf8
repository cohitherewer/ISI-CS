The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 24, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																In solitary confinement				 																																																				Sir  The 25-year-old woman, who was molested on a crowded Hridaypur station last Wednesday, may be really traumatized. But what exactly does she hope to gain by resigning from her job simply because she does not feel safe outside (Young woman harassed at home and outside, April 22)? Her belief that she will manage to save her honour by staying within the confines of her home is hopelessly misconceived if Barasat is any proof. Besides, such meek submission to a common crime will not make her feel any better  she will only be foregoing her independence and end up encouraging the miscreants.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Partha Pratim Roy, Calcutta
				 																Right to life				 																																																				Sir  The Supreme Courts directive for the creation of the Rs 7,000 crore fund for the handicapped, along with the order to make adequate arrangements for the disabled is most welcome (Illegal interest in disabled kitty, April 21). As a first- time voter in the general elections, I am disgusted with the government and political parties for their lack of concern about handicapped. I am nineteen now, doing my graduation from a reputed girls college in Calcutta. Nine years ago, a car accident led to the amputation of both my legs from the knee. I am now wheel-chair bound and very disheartened by the medieval reaction of most people to those who have a handicap. 				 																																																				This is reflected in the governments lack of response to the special needs of such people. There are no ramps or lifts for their use in any government building. I cannot watch any film in the theatre as my wheelchair blocks the way for others. In college, I have to keep an attendant, which is an expensive proposition, to help me reach the second floor on which classes are sometimes held. I cannot ride the metro railway as it is impossible for me to negotiate the stairs. 				 																																																				A sizeable section of society is being deprived of the simple pleasures of life because of the negligence of the government. I request the political parties to give more attention to our needs. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pallabi Majumdar, 

				 																																																				Calcutta				 																																																				Sir  The report, Illegal interest in disabled kitty shows how people have been fooled by banks. While the decision to have the fund for the disabled is commendable, something must be done to fix responsibility for the deception.Yours faithfully, 
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta 				 																Picture imperfect				 																																																				Sir  It was shocking to see The Telegraph waste precious space splashing photographs of the Salman Rushdie-Padma Lakshmi wedding on the front and the whole of the back pages. This space could have been used in a more worthwhile manner  suppose a private advertisement from the newspaper, urging all eligible voters to cast their votes prudently and without fail. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashok Chandan, Jorhat 

				 																																																				Sir  My April 19 morning was spoilt when one whole page of news went missing from the Monday edition of The Telegraph. What is so exclusive about Salman Rushdies marriage that his wedding photographs had to be carried this way? The space devoted to the event raises questions about the news-sense of a responsible daily like yours.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anand Jhunjhunwala, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why is so much importance being given to a controversial author like Salman Rushdie, more so in the event of his fourth marriage? If there is such a dearth of news, why not carry pictures of the indiscriminate felling of trees in Golpark or other environment-related issues? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Devosree Roy, Calcutta 

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  Who is Samantha Bonar to judge whether Britney Spears can make a Bond girl (What lies between Britney and the Bond girl, April 22)? Bonars comments are immature and downright rude. Spears in fact might overshadow Bond. Hence the fear.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Palmer Churchill, via email

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 							 																						SAME SPOTS																														In victory arrogance, in defeat also arrogance. This seems to be the motto of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Having sulked for a few weeks after the election defeat, the BJP first went into bickering mode. It overcame this only after a few characteristic flipflops by Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The former prime minister broke his self-imposed silence by firing a few salvos at Mr Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat. It seemed quite obvious from Mr Vajpayees pronouncements that he wanted the removal of Mr Modi and wanted to stop the BJP from retreating into the primeval cave of Hindutva. He failed to achieve either, and when he realized that he was going to fail, he even announced that he had no intentions of carrying on as the leader of the BJP. He later withdrew this, saying it was a joke. Anybody familiar with Mr Vajpayees style of politics will be surprised at this display of expression and retraction. What was more significant, however, was Mr Vajpayees failure, in the national executive of the BJP, to stop the descent into hardcore Hindu fundamentalism. The other thing that surfaced in the national executive of the BJP was a breach between Mr Vajpayee and Mr L.K. Advani. Power and responsibility had papered over this crack, but all it needed was an election debacle to bring it out in the open.																														The arrogance of the BJP is evident in its renewed enthusiasm for Hindutva. The partys most important decision-making body refused to accept that the failure to remove Mr Modi after the Gujarat pogrom was a major contributory factor in the poll debacle. This reiteration of faith in Hindutva is nothing more than a rejection of Mr Vajpayees middle-of-the-road policy. Mr Vajpayee, when he was prime minister, had endeavoured to make the BJP forget its ideology and become a party of economic reform and good governance. The party had then reluctantly acquiesced to this because this was the only viable way to keep afloat the National Democratic Alliance. But there was, within the BJP, a body of opinion that believed that Mr Vajpayee was squandering the BJPs unique selling point and in so doing, he was compromising the BJPs identity. Mr Vajpayee, while he licks his wounds suffered in a tactical war, could well ponder the truth or otherwise of these charges. The BJP, smug with power, has not adjusted well to being in the opposition. It knows that its very identity is under scrutiny. It also knows that, for its own survival and expansion, it cannot stand by and see the Congress run away with the middle ground of Indian politics.

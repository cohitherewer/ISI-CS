The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 11, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Just a lot of gas				 																																																				Sir  There has to be very good reason for being generous about Hillary Clintons feeble joke about Gandhi being a guy who ran a gas station down in St Louis (Hillary chokes on Gandhi, Jan 8). And the administrator of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence, Michelle Naef, certainly does not have a good one. Unless one makes small allowances for the fact that she is just one of the millions of Americans who think the world is made up of the United States of America, and it alone. Besides, she still has some way to go before she manages to cover up her faux pas with as much ease as her husband.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Anindita Sen, Calcutta
				 																Collision course				 																																																				Sir  The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad deserves a pat on its back for showing the guts to refuse the governments monetary support. It has taken a subtle but decisive stand against the governments interference in its administration and curriculum (IIM cuts off Delhi pursestrings, Dec 29). It is reported that the IIMs at Calcutta, Bangalore and Ahmedabad are among the richest in the country. But the decision of the first two to wait and watch instead of following in IIMAs footsteps only betrays their cowardice (IIMC takes safe stand on grants, Dec 30). 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dines K. Mukhopadhyay, Midnapore (W)

				 																																																				Sir  The IIMs, especially IIM Ahmedabad, and the human resource development ministry have been in the news over the last few months for all the wrong reasons. Now with IIMA refusing the annual Central grant of Rs 10.5 crore, the two are clearly on a collision course. It is well known that the IIMs are the best flagbearers of a new and promising India in the world of business and education. There are reasons for worry when they take up cudgels against their creator, the government of India. The IIMs have earned their reputation through the combined efforts of some of the best minds and the government. But that does not give any of them the right to trespass into the others territory. In the current impasse, it is best that the government acts as facilitator and allows the IIMs to take independent decisions in the interest of imparting quality management education to Indian students. 				 																																																				It is still a sad turn of affairs that such a large sum of money will not be put to use in financing original research by an IIM. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Dwaipayan Bora, Duliajan, Assam

				 																																																				Sir  Given the governments continuous efforts to goad the IIMs to giving up their autonomy, the latest stand-off between the Centre and IIM Ahmedabad is both heartening and disturbing. Heartening because this institute has taken a firm stand against Central bullying. This decision should have come much earlier. What is disturbing is the attitude the present government, or its representative, Murli Manohar Joshi, has adopted. 				 																																																				Whenever the government has decided to poke its nose into the education sector, be it primary, secondary or higher education, it has committed a gaffe in trying to pursue its immediate agenda. Forcing the IIMs to surrender their academic, administrative and financial freedom runs along the same lines, but is more horrifying. It is true that the government had a role to play in the birth of these institutes. But isnt it ridiculous to think that a bunch of half-educated, ill-informed and incompetent politicians will do a better job than some of the best management brains in the country? It is time for the government to realize that some jobs are done best without its over-eager and self-seeking participation.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avijit Mandal, Calcutta 

				 																Like a bad penny				 																																																				Sir  Coins of small denominations are rarely used these days. After the 10-paise and 20-paise coins, 25- and 50-paise coins seem to become obsolete in the near future. Many countries set prices of commodities in such a manner that small changes are not rendered useless. Instead of letting such a huge proportion of the currency go to waste, the government could start considering a similar policy here.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Paromita Das, Calcutta

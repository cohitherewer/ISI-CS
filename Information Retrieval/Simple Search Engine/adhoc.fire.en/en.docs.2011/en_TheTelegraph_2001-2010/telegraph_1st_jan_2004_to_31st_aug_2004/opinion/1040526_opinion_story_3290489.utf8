The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 							 																						WHAT TO LEARN FROM ST MARYS Shobita Punja																					Exams are over and the results are out  but one is still in the mood for grading. Which historic place in India would one mark the highest for its antiquity and present educational significance? There are beautiful campuses of universities in Delhi and the magnificent buildings of Presidency College in Calcutta, the dramatic building of La Martiniere College in Lucknow and the age-old structures of the public boarding schools of Doon and Darjeeling.																					There is, however a lesser-known place in Chennai that some young aspiring students of India, who wish to study abroad this new academic year, may not remember.																					In 1616, Sir Thomas Roe was appointed the first British ambassador to the Mughal court and he obtained permission to open three factories in the Mughal heartland, including one in Agra. In south India, the rulers were more amenable to granting rights to British traders. A local raja granted the British company a lease on Madras, at that time only a strip of land 10 kilometres long, where they built Fort St George. It was from this Fort that Robert Clive sailed to Calcutta and fought the fatal battle of Plassey. It was only then that the British East India Company moved its Indian headquarters to Calcutta, where Clive took over as governor in 1765.																					Fort St George, originally built right on the seashore, was a welcoming sight for weary travellers who had traversed the treacherous seas from Europe. With its fine buildings, the mint, the Exchange Office House and trading centres, it must have been a very busy, charming place.																					Within the fort is the oldest church in Madras. It is called St Marys church and was built and consecrated in 1680. The church is of simple but sturdy construction, built to withstand the bombing and blasts of rival guns. The master gunner, William Dixon, designed the church. Obviously, in those days, gunners were also engineers. 																					Pounded sea-shells																					The church was sparsely decorated, but had a plaster called chunam that made the interior bright and light. Mrs Kinderly wrote in 1765 that the chunam was made of shells from the coast that when burnt, pounded and mixed with water formed the strongest cement possible; as hard and very near as beautiful as marble. It is this chunam that gives the buildings of Fort St George a special elegance and style. One can only conjure up the image of young English soldiers and pompous governors meeting in the churchyard, exchanging greetings and going inside the pretty church to pray for victory and perhaps a wife or companion strong and brave enough to withstand the heat of Madras and the onslaught of monsoon malaria.																					The church contains many tombstones and records that make it a virtual museum. The altarpiece is a painting of the Last Supper (ascribed to a pupil of Raphael) stolen from French-occupied Pondicherry when the British defeated the French in 1761. According to the church records, it was under this roof that Clive was married in 1753.																					Yale in India																					Another, perhaps lesser known, person, was Elihu Yale who was also married at St Marys, in Fort St Georges in Madras. Born in Boston in Massachusetts, he came to Madras from England in 1672. Yale joined the East India Company as a clerk, but fruitful investments in pepper and shipping soon made him a prosperous independent merchant. Yale then became governor of Madras, but did not live very long after his subsequent return to England. Yale made a donation to his collegiate school in Saybrook, Connecticut that, bearing his name, was later given its charter in 1745 and came to be known as Yale University.																					St Marys contains many stories about our past, and also the story of one man who prospered so well in India that a university was named after him. Perhaps Fort St George should be declared a place of educational and heritage significance, a shrine for all young Indians wanting to study abroad.

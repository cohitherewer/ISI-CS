The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 							 																						CLOSE CALL																														Spilling the blood of the innocent is an extreme act, but it is not always clear what it signifies. For the former prime minister of Bangladesh and leader of the Awami League, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, it was a close call. But not so for those who died and for the hundreds of seriously injured people crowding the hospitals. Among them are senior leaders of the Awami League. No extremist organization has owned up to the nine grenades that changed the public rally in Dhaka Ms Wajed was addressing into a blood-soaked mess. The rally itself had been planned in the context of a similar, but less spectacular, incident in Sylhet, in which some supporters of Ms Wajeds opposition party had died. Sporadic violence of this sort, especially against the Awami League, has recurred throughout 2004, although no incident matches the cruelty and gore of the Dhaka grenade attack. Ms Wajeds address was directed against the government, headed by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, Sheikh Khaleda Zia, in coalition with other parties, which include two Islamic ones. The BNP has disavowed complicity in the attack and the prime minister has expressed regret and promised to find and punish the guilty.																														Politicians in Bangladesh are no strangers to violence and bloodshed. At the same time, this attempt to assassinate the opposition leader is deeply disturbing, for it is a direct assault on the democratic rights that the country is trying to establish. To wreak such havoc in a peaceful rally is also to threaten the very activity and process of democratic politics. Politicians may not find it easy to hold public rallies, and their supporters may not feel like joining in, after this. The attack has led to violence and arrests across the country, a destabilization that is seriously damaging to Bangladeshs image and interests. Then there is the uncomfortable question of security, a question that the American ambassador raised on his visit to Ms Wajed after the attack. No one has yet been caught for the earlier attacks on Awami League supporters and leaders. If, in spite of that, the opposition leader could become such an easy potential target, security could not have been at its best. This does not speak well of the present governments grip on law and order. Or of its political will.

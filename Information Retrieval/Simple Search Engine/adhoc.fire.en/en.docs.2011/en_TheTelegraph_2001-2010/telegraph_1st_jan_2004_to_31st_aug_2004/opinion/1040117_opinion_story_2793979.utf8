		 Saturday, January 17, 2004 							 																						OLD ORDER CHANGETH																								The churning of politics in India is producing unexpected divergences and bizarre convergences																								If the churning of the sea in the Puranic myth produced ambrosia, the churning of politics that India is now undergoing is producing unexpected divergences and bizarre convergences. To begin with the startling, but significant, paradox: Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, even though he is poised to be an octogenarian, is the youngest person in the Bharatiya Janata Party. He is young because he has refused to allow his outlook to age. He is still capable of thinking outside the groove to which he has been accustomed ever since he came into the fold of the sangh parivar. His policies in the realm of the economy and in the field of foreign policy have redefined the BJP gospel. His domestic policy has re- written Hindutva. He has emerged as the leader of the BJP of tomorrow and the prime minister of an India that is marching in quick step to the future without the trammels of any unnecessary ideological baggage. By driving this forward-looking mov- ement, Mr Vajpayee has left behind many of his peers who are tied to an older and an irrelevant face of the BJP. Mr Murli Manohar Joshi is an example of those who have been left behind. Mr L.K. Advani, unless he watches his step and his tongue, is perilously close to suffering the same fate. To keep pace with Mr Vajpayees youthful strides, Messrs Advani and Joshi  and others of their ilk in the BJP  will have to forget their anti-Pakistan and anti-Muslim rhetoric; they will have to cure themselves of their obsession with Hindu glory; and commit themselves, with even greater zeal, to liberalization and governance. This is not to say that the churning process is complete, but for the moment Mr Vajpayees vision has captured the imagination of a large part of the BJP and of India.																								The process of reinvention and redefinition is also operating in the Congress. Here, too, the change is most significant in the attitude and behaviour of the leader, Ms Sonia Gandhi. This is perhaps the emergence of Ms Gandhi in her third incarnation. From the home she came out as a public figure, somewhat shy and enigmatic. In the last few weeks, she has come out of her shell to parley with potential allies and redraw the Congresss position in the formation of a future coalition capable of making a bid for power after the forthcoming general elections. Even those who have no time for her will be forced to admit that she has been successful in winning allies and in convincing the BJP that the polls will not be a cakewalk for it. This has also left behind many old Congressmen who believed that sycophancy to the Gandhi family was the stuff of politics in the Congress.																								This churning of the political cauldron is creating identities which were previously inconceivable. There seems to be one group wedded to liberalization and economic progress but somewhat conservative in its social values. Both Mr Vajpayee and Mr Manmohan Singh can, in some ways, be seen to belong to this group. While the other group still retains a vestigial faith in state-driven social and political engineering. Ms Gandhi and Mr Joshi display aspects of this faith. The old distinction between secular and communal has become blurred and pass. The battle between the conservative democrats and the social democrats might well hold the key to Indias destiny.

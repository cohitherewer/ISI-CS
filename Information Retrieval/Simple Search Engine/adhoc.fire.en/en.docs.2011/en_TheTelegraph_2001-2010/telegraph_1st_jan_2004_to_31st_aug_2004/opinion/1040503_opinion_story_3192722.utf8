		 Monday, May 03, 2004 							 																						LIVING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the assessment at the 27th session of the Committee on World Food Security, 2001				 	 No relief																														Mortality rates for newborn infants provide a good indicator of the nutritional status of their mothers, while those for children under five are suggestive of the nutritional status of the children... 																														The International Development Goals call for a two-thirds reduction in both of these indicators by the year 2015. Actual or projected data on infant mortality indicate progress between 1990 and 1998 in all regions. But the 10 per cent reduction in infant mortality in the developing world over the last eight years appears too slow to meet the target set in the IDG or 2015. Some countries have lost ground over the Nineties. 																														Between 1970 and 1998, infant mortality differences between Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and developing countries declined in absolute terms (from 87 in 1970 to 53 in 1998) but rose in relative terms: While infant mortality in 1970 was around five times as high in developing as in OECD countries, it is now about ten times as high.																														It is now recognized that 6.6 million out of 12.2 million deaths among children under-five  or 54 per cent of young child mortality in developing countries  is associated with malnutrition. Child mortality rates in the developing world are also declining too slowly to attain the target of a two-thirds reduction...Rates should have come down by roughly 30 per cent in the Nineties, but they declined by only 14 per cent. Between 1990 and 1998, 17 developing countries reduced their under-five mortality rate fast enough to meet the IDG. But over the same period, 14 countries experienced worsening rates; among them Democratic Republic of Korea, where the child mortality rate increased from 35 to 68, and Zimbabwe, where it went from 76 to 125.																														Because hunger and malnutrition shorten lives, life expectancy is lowest in countries with the highest prevalence of undernourishment. While the long-term trend has shown some improvement, with the life expectancy of people living in developing countries rising from an average of 55 years in 1970 to an average of 65 years in 1998, it still lagged far behind that of OECD countries, which was 78 years in 1998. Thirty two countries have seen life expectancy decline since 1990. Most are countries hit by the AIDS epidemic.																														As of March 2001, some 60 million people in 35 countries were facing food emergencies of varying intensity. Sub-Saharan Africa was the most badly affected, with 16 countries suffering from exceptional food emergencies caused mostly by natural disasters and civil strife. Despite improved weather conditions recently, the effects of the drought in eastern Africa were still being felt in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Sudan and Tanzania, where emergency food assistance continues to be provided to some 18 million people by international relief agencies. The number of refugees and internally displaced people due to civil strife continues to increase, particularly in central and western Africa. 																														In southern Africa, serious flooding in some areas, particularly in Mozambique and Malawi, has caused loss of life and damage to property, infrastructure and crops. With some 25 million people in need of food assistance, Asia has seen a grave food crisis emerge in Afghanistan, caused by incessant civil strife, successive droughts and harsh winters. 																														In Mongolia, another extremely cold winter has killed large numbers of livestock, aggravating the food insecurity of nomadic herders...The food supply situation remains tight in Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea due to drought, economic difficulties and the coldest winter in decades. Armenia, Georgia and Tajikistan all face food supply problems because of last years drought. Altogether, 11 countries in Asia are reported to be facing food emergencies.																														Monitoring the other dimensions of food security; Availability and stabality of supply: seven individual food security indicators were developed following the food crisis in the mid-Seventies. These indicators, while confined to cereals, shed light on the present and future global food situation.																														One indicator, referring to the ratio of world stocks to world cereal consumption trends, has not been estimated this year. The second indicator is the ratio of the sum of their grain production, imports and opening stocks to the sum of their domestic utilization of grains plus exports. TO BE CONCLUDED

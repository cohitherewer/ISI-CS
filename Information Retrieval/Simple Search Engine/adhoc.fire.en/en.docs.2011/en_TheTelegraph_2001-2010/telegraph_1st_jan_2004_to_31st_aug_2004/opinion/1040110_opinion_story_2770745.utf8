But with her 55-hour marriage, Britney Spears has really taken the bakery																								Britney Spears may or may not have lost her much-touted virginity but shes certainly lost her mind. Look at what the kids just done. On Saturday, January 3, she (in torn jeans and a baseball cap) and childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander got married at the Little Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. Fifty-five hours later, the marriage was annulled on the grounds that the couple had not worked out the serious issues involved in marriage and was therefore not compatible.																								What issues had they worked out then? Kindergarten?																								Splendid timing, though. The singer released her fourth album In The Zone in November and she begins a concert tour on March 2 in San Diego. What a time to make news.																								All right, all right, so shes a media fixture. Shes also a favourite of as elite a figure as the second in line to the British throne. All the same, if my own heir, a 24-year-old, married her, Id give him a walloping. As ex- Sync singer and former boyfriend Justin Timberlake will testify, the babe has no staying power.																								Which is not to say she has not proved extraordinarily adhesive to the top of the pop charts since 1998 when her record label Jive Records released her debut single Baby One More Time. Powered by its video, the single shot to the top of the Billboard charts. At the MTV Europe Music Awards that year, she took all four awards in the categories she was nominated for  Best Female, Best Pop, Best Breakthrough Artiste and Best Song.																								Since then, through a carefully choreographed career and public relations (her claims to chastity  denied by then lover Timberlake, the time she wore nothing but pasted-on diamonds for the video of Toxic, the high-temperature kiss she and idol Madonna shared in public, the bhangra remix she did with British Indian producer Rishie Rich) she has contrived to stay both at the top of the charts and the height of public memory.																								How does she do it? A few years ago, a vapid ordinary-looking singer would not have made it to the top. It s a disillusioning reflection on the times that they now allow such things to happen. If, according to Outlook, 54 per cent of Indians are now below 25 years of age, a significant percentage of that is now swaying to Britney Spears. Music shops around the country stock her in heaps. The new album, launched on December 24, has already sold 200 copies in one music store in Calcutta alone.																								Britneys story began in December 1981 when she was born to Jamie (a contractor) and Lynne (a schoolteacher) Spears in Kentwood, Louisiana. She began performing as a singer and dancer at a young age. At age eight she auditioned for Disney Channels TV series The New Mickey Mouse Club. She was turned down because she was too young but one of the producers took an interest in her and introduced her to an agent in New York. Britney spent the next three years studying at the Professional Performing Arts School. At age 11, she returned to The New Mickey Mouse Club for a second audition and this time was taken on. Although her fellow Mouseketeers included an impressive array of future stars  Justin Timberlake for one, the show was cancelled after Britneys second season. At age 15 she returned to New York and resumed the rounds of producers, finally landing a deal with Jive Records.																								The success of Baby One More Time was followed in 2000 by OopsI Did It Again which was an instant smash. Britney was a superstar and her romance with Timberlake added to the media attention lavished on her. In 2002 she acted in the feature film Crossroads, which was not quite successful. Her romance with Timberlake ended soon after.																								But her dance with fame went on. A clever manipulator, she knew that if she was content to be a teenage bubblegum pop idol, her fans would outgrow her. So she took on an edgier personality and let it be known that her private life wasnt as innocent as she had once claimed. (At 17, she appeared in countless magazines including a Rolling Stone cover that started the rumour that she had got breast implants.) 																								Her nasal tone and babytalk progressed to breathier singing and a lot of moaning as in Breathe On Me. A personal peak for her was the time Madonna lent her voice to the single Me Against The Music. Collaborating with one of her all-time greatest musical influences was a dream come true for Britney. As we were working together, there were moments when I simply could not believe that I was standing there on stage next to her, she said at the time. Ironically, their arrangement was not deemed a success.																								Strange pairings seem to be part of Britneys act, however, and her recent flirtation with a wedding will not be the last of them. She and fellow pop star Christina Aguilera have had an on-again off-again relationship over the years, culminating, this time, too, with a kiss at last years MTV Music Awards. Following their little act Aguilera told Blender magazine, She seemed very distant, even during rehearsals  she seems to me like a lost little girl, someone who desperately needs guidance. 																								A measure of what many people think of Britney is the fact that she has spawned no less than 2,000 websites that have I hate Britney Spears as their motto. Compare this with the mere 744 totted up by Saddam Hussein.																								But she neednt fear that her constant reinvention of herself hasnt worked elsewhere. Her latest fan is 77-year-old Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, proving she has at least one potential boyfriend. Britney would make a great girlfriend, he is reported to have said.

		 Friday, July 23, 2004 							 																						TALE OF ANOTHER TIME				 	 Remains of the dayA BEGGAR AT THE GATE By Thalassa Ali, Review, pound; 10.99The novel travels back and forth in time, and also talks about differences  cultural, intellectual, political and spiritual  between men and women, the British and the Indian, the elite and the ordinary citizen and so on. It also uses the image of a beggar in a symbolic way. One may say that Alis book incorporates the Sufi idea that man is ultimately a beggar before god. 																					Ali starts with a quotation from the Quran, but the story is not religious  it is a love story with a Sufic twist. There are numerous characters, both historical and fictional, ranging from Lady Macnaghten, Lord Auckland, Ranjit Singh, Kharak Singh and his wife, Sher Singh, to the ordinary British soldiers serving under their queen. 																					But the central protagonist is Givens, who has to decide whether to leave her husband  Hassan Ali Khan, with whom she has not even spent a single night, and her three-year-old stepson, Saboor, who has the power to see the future  and marry one of her own kind. 																					For this, Givens travels hundreds of miles by water and land from Calcutta to Kabul, where her uncle is posted. In Calcutta, Givens puts up at 65, Chowringhee Road, where she attends the services held at St Johns Cathedral. However, she is loathed by the British community because of her marriage to Hassan, a native. Ali however fails to establish what exactly drove Givens to marry Hassan. She is also shown constantly thinking about one of the British officers who she believes she could have married.																					The novel fails to hold the attention of the reader. The characters have not been fleshed out by Ali. This is because the author tries to deal with an excess of them. Given her importance to the plot, Givens fails to live up to the expectations of the reader. Strangely enough, the hero of the novel, Hassan, makes an appearance only in the middle of the story. His character has not been developed properly and he somewhat fails to keep pace with the progress of the plot. The characterization of Saboor remains sketchy, and fails to attract adequate attention. For reasons best known to Ali, she names a woman Akhtar, a name usually given to a man. 																					The novel depends more on the art of narration than on the actual drama in the story. The strength of the novel lies in the long descriptive passages, especially those of the street fights in Lahore between opposing forces trying to assert their power. Although Alis insight into the myriad ways of Muslim life is powerful enough, there are certain inconsistencies which have crept into her narrative. For instance, Ali shows her characters eating on banana leaves. This was not a prevalent practice in the upper echelons of Muslim society. 																					The sentences used in the novel are short, simple and bereft of any emotion.Although some may find the story appealing, the technique adopted by Ali to tell her tale definitely needs to be sharpened. A Beggar At The Gate proves that if Ali masters the craft of story-telling, there is a wonderful future waiting for this talented writer.						SHAMS AFIF SIDDIQI

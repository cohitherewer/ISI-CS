The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 28, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Rage against the dying of the light				 																																																				Sir  Who would have expected the singer of Hamma, hamma and Jalwa to lead the charge against the intellectual bankruptcy of mainstream Indian arts and culture (Remo rage against bankrupt Bharat, Feb 25)? It is, of course, possible to argue along grapes-are-sour lines, and say that this is a failed Bollywood singer speaking. But how many such failed individuals have had the guts to tell the emperor that he has no clothes on? Most of them are busy cosying up to one producer or another music director in the hope of making it big some day. Remo Fernandes deserves a pat on his back for refusing to be part of the Bollywood feel good, even if his latest remark is suspect.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Reeth Sunderrajan, Madurai
				 																From pillar to post				 																																																				Sir  A packet containing four books was despatched on my behalf from the Indraprastha Head Post Office on October 15, 2003 by registered surface mail at the printed paper rate to a friend of mine in Lahore. On November 20, a complaint was lodged at that post office because the packet had not reached the addressee. The next day the chief postmaster of the post office wrote to the director, foreign post, about the matter. I was sent a copy of the letter. 				 																																																				On returning to Delhi on December 23 after a weeks absence, I found a letter from the chief postmaster of the Indraprastha H.P.O. requiring me to intimate full particulars within three days, failing which the case [would] be treated as closed at this end. 				 																																																				When I protested that those three days had almost certainly already passed, I received another letter, this time asking me to furnish the particulars (which I had done in my earlier letter) within two days, failing which, etc. I furnished the particulars again. I also pointed out that the phrase, whether enquiry fee has been realised, had no meaning for me because no one had told my representative what this fee was or how it was to be paid; and it did not appear on any of the letters I had received. Back came a cyclostyled letter with the following paragraph tick-marked: You have not affixed postage stamps of Rs.10/- as enquiry fee on your complaint. The letter ended with kindly do the needful within three days of the receipt of this letter failing which [the] case will be treated as closed at this end without any further correspondence. 				 																																																				The stamp worth Rs10 was deposited at the Indraprastha H.P.O. on January 12. Till today, I have heard nothing from the post office. Evidently, the post and telegraph manual, whose rules were cited to give me just two or three days to respond each time, permit the postal department itself to take as long as it pleases. This is no way for a public service to treat a member of the public.				 																																																				There are two things that I fail to understand. First, why do I need to pay the organization against which I am lodging a complaint on account of an apparent failure of its service? Second, if such a fee must be paid, would it not make sense (and save time and effort and paper and postage) for the post office to say this at the start instead of treating it as a lacuna at a later stage?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mukul Dube, Mayur Vihar, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The Elgin Road post office, which is one of the more important post offices in Calcutta, has been finally renovated after years. But the post office still functions temporarily from the first floor, inconveniencing senior citizens hugely. How much longer will the ground floor remain unutilized?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Saumen Kumar Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  A couple of weeks back, I received an envelope from Unit Trust of India in my letter box. The envelope happened to contain a payment cheque for Rs 9159.69 in the name of Rekha Khanna, while the address printed on it was mine. For once, it was not the postal departments fault. But how could UTI, being fully aware of the ill repute of our postal department, send a cheque for such a large amount by ordinary post? 				 																																																				In the absence of the payees address, I have had to return the mail back to UTI. I can only keep my fingers crossed that it reaches safely to Rekha Khanna.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Roy Choudhury, Calcutta

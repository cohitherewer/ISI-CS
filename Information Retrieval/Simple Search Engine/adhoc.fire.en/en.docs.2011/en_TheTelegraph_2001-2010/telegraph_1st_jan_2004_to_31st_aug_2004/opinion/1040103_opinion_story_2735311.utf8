	Not many of us are aware that when  Shakespeare wrote his plays and sonnets, there were  no dictionaries. There were some compilations of difficult  words with their meanings but no one dictionary giving origins,  meanings and usages of all words in the English language.  The plan to compile one was conceived by a few gentlemanly  scholars meeting in London Library on November 5, 1857.  Hundreds of men pitched in with contributions which were  first assembled in a small room of a school and arranged  in the alphabetical order under the guidance of a Scotsman,  James Murray. The operation was later shifted to Oxford  where the Oxford University Press was located. It took over  70 years of combined effort to put together over half-a-million  words into 21 volumes to become the worlds largest  and most authentic lexicon. The story of the OED may not  appear very exciting. But with Simon Winchester focussing  it on two principal contributors who did not meet till after  17 years of corresponding with each other, it is as rivetting  as any crime or detective fiction as I have read. The Professor  and The Mad Man is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn  how to put life into a subject as dead as a dictionary. 
	In the true story, the professor is the Scotsman, John  Murray; the madman, an American, Dr Chester Minor. Both  men had a strictly religious background. Minor was the son  of a missionary working in Sri Lanka and south India. As  a boy, he picked up languages he came across: Singhalese,  Tamil, Hindi, Malay. He was also highly sexed and chased  coloured girls wherever he saw them. His parents packed  him off home to keep him out of mischief. He qualified as  a doctor and joined the US Army Medical Corps. He grew to  be a tall, lanky young man with a long flowing beard and  piercing eyes. The American Civil War was on.  
	Dr Minor saw a lot of fighting including the execution  of two deserters. To compensate for the violence he witnessed  during the day, he sought solace in the company of prostitutes  every night; a different one every time. He picked up a  variety of venereal diseases. He also developed an acute  sense of guilt and a paranoid fear of people wanting to  kill him; he always carried a gun in his pocket. By the  time he left the US army and migrated to England, he was  a thoroughly mixed-up character. He found lodgings in Lambeth,  then the seamiest part of the city. He continued consorting  with prostitutes and spent the rest of his time reading.  On the early morning of February 17, 1872, he shot dead  a poor, innocent labourer who had a family of seven children.  At his trial for murder, the defence lawyer pleaded insanity.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment. He found himself  in the Broadmore Lunatic Asylum some 40 miles from Oxford. 
	Dr Minor was given special treatment. He was given two  cells, one of which he converted into a library and studio.  He was allowed to receive books and visitors. One of them  was the widow of the man he had killed. He was supporting  her and her family. There is an oblique allusion that he  might have also had sex with her because she often came  somewhat tipsy and was plied with hard liquor by her host.  He was also given to excessive masturbation. 
	Dr Minor saw the advertisement inviting people to contribute  words for inclusion in the OED. He flooded Dr Murray with  his contributions. It was 17 years after they started correspondence  that Murray called on Minor to thank him for his valuable  contribution. It was only when he arrived at Broadmore that  he discovered that Minor was not the asylum doctor but an  inmate. 
	Dr Minors persecution mania and guilt complex went  from bad to worse. One fine morning he decided to get rid  of the source of most of his troubles. With a pen-knife  he had been allowed to keep to cut joined up pages of books,  he cut off his penis. His brother was finally allowed to  take him back to the US: his discharge papers were signed  by young Winston Churchill, holding his first job in the  British government. He died on March 26, 1920. 
	Can anyone put down a book which gives one so much information  in so delectable a manner?  
	The quality of piety 
	Though not religious myself, I respect people who are.  What riles me is not religion, but the display of religiosity  to show to the world. Amongst the earliest statements  he made, Jesus Christ condemned wordy display: And  when thou prayest, thou shult not be as the hypocrites are;  for they love to pray standing in the temples and in corners  of streets that they be seen of men. And again, When  thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast  shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and  they Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 
	There is something extremely cheap about displaying ones  religiosity: it is the ultimate in hypocrisy. I know of  one ex-minister who, every time he visits a gurdwara, informs  TV channels so that they can give his visit full coverage.  There was Uma Bharati on the eve of the election shown feeding  a cow. I am all for feeding animals, birds and insects.  I know a lot of kindly men and women who feed stray cats  and dogs every day and people who feed pigeons, sparrows,  crows and drop palmfuls of flour near ant holes without  making a display of it. One may well ask, why dont  politicians have themselves filmed feeding goats or buffaloes?  The answer is simple: feeding other animals (birds or insects)  yields no political dividends; feeding cows does. 
	As cheap as making a public display of religiosity is publicizing  piety. A person who makes anonymous donations to a good  cause is far more pious than one who wants the world to  know what a good man he is. When giving in charity, it is  nobler to follow the Biblical injunction Let not thy  right hand what they left hand doeth. Every night  on my TV screen I watch a man doing the rounds of a clinic  making kind enquires about the health of inmates before  he spreads out his arms and breaks into a besura (out of  tune) song exhorting everyone to love everyone including  the almighty bhagwan. It makes me sick. I watch such antics  to refresh my knowledge of the kind of people we are. 
	Queer case of the lost sweater 
	Nihangs are a community of Sikh Samurai ever-ready for  battle. They wear huge turbans, blue or saffron, with miniature  weapons stuck on them. They also wear layers of clothes  which they dont bother to change for months: they  do not like to bathe too often. They often indulge in drinking  bhang which they call sukha pershad (the peace-giver). Making  or consuming bhang is forbidden by the law. So when a Nihang  Singh was taken by the police on suspicion he was hiding  bhang in his clothes, they took off one shirt after another  till they came to the last garment, a sweater. Wah!  Wah! exploded the Nihang, Your noses are sharper  than those of sniffer dogs.
 
	 Why do you say that? asked the constable.  Do you have hash beneath it? No, Santriji,  replied the Nihang, For the last year I have been  looking for this sweater and you have found it for me.

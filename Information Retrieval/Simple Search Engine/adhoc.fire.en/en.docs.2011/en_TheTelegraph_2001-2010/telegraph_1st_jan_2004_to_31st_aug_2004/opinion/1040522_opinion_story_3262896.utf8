The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 							 																						FROM HERE TO ETERNITYThis Above All / Khushwant Singh				 	 A hollow ring																					When I made my plans to get away from Delhi to cooler climes, the gulmohars were in full blaze of glory  fiery reds and molten gold. The sun was hotter than the gulmohars. Along the water tanks on either side of Rajpath from Vijay Chowk to India Gate, jaruls were beginning to come out in mauves and pinks. Many trees had shed their winter foliage and had fresh light-green leaves sprouting on their branches. Juicy cantaloups and watermelons were piled up in mountainous heaps in grocers shops; mangoes had yet to make their appearance. They should be in the market by the time I return.																					My weather forecast went wrong. The day before I was to leave Delhi, a violent dust storm blew over the city. It was followed by heavy rain and showers of hailstones as large as pigeons eggs. The temperature dropped by six degrees and a pleasant cool breeze began to blow. It was too late to change my travel schedule. But it did occur to me how foolish one can be in predicting future events. The day when the dust-storm engulfed the city followed by heavy rain and hail was declared by astrologers to be the most auspicious: akhshay tritiya (day of eternity) and Akha Teej, when nothing can go wrong. Unfortunately, everything did. Almost 20,000 couples including Virender Sehwag decided to get married, Jayalalithaa, who does not take a step without consulting her astrologers, led her party members to file their nomination papers for the Lok Sabha elections. The anger that Indra displayed on baraat processions and marriage rituals in Delhi had to be seen to be believed. And almost certainly quite a few of Ammas devotees will bite the dust at the polls. 																					Will my countrymen ever learn to use their common sense and discard superstitious beliefs in astral phenomenon? I doubt it. And for once, I am not at all sorry: it is the theme of the short stories I am working on during my sojourn in Kasauli. How the most religiously devout can also be the most corrupt; how often those who extol the virtues of celibacy turn out to be whore-mongers; how the brightest of people can also be the stupidest. I havent yet thought of an appropriate title. I am toying with calling it India: the land of humbugs, I love my India and want to rid it of humbuggery.																					Rain played hide and seek through the third week of April. The day after the auspicious day of eternity was washed out, there was not a cloud in the sky. The following day, I woke to claps of thunder and lightning. The journey to New Delhi railway station was in pouring rain. A few minutes after the Shatabdi Express commenced its northwards journey towards the Shivaliks, it was a clear blue sky. We sped through the dust bowl of an expanse of khaki fields with stubbles of harvested wheat crop and neat squares of sunflowers glowing under the sunlight. And so to Chandigarh on the dot. Awaiting us (I am too old to travel alonemy daughter Mala accompanied me) on the platform to help us out of the train was my old and trusted friend, A.S. Deepak, and two gorgeous beauties: Punam Sidhu with her son, and Nagina Kohli of Aroma Hotel. I was reminded of an Urdu couplet:Iss say waqt aur kya dhaayega sitmJism boorha kar diya, dil jawaan rahney diya?What more cruelty can time inflict than Age the body and leave the heart still young?																					Onwards to Kalka and Shimla by road courtesy a car provided by Nagina Kohli. For a summer weekend there was surprisingly little traffic. So more hungry rhesus monkeys lined along the roadside awaiting passers-by to throw them some food. The gulmohars had yet to don their flamboyant reds but Jacarandas, which had wilted in Delhi, were still there in all their glory like clusters of blue sapphires to embellish gods own signet ring.																					My ill-repute preceded me. In no time the word spread that I was seen driving past. By the time I had settled in my summer abode, two young men arrived carrying a bunch of red roses and a ball-point pen. Who could it be except Kuldip Munshi, who always keeps a few pens and coloured pencils to give me when I come to Kasauli?																					Scenes from the past																					People like to return to the scenes of their childhood days, if for no other reason than to see how much of what they remember is correct and see if there are some old people still around who recall their parents and grandparents. Kasauli, having once been a British cantonment with a school and a large hospital, had quite a few English boys and girls who were born or went to school there. So there is always a trickle of English visitors every year whose sole aim is to visit homes they once lived in, and to go round cemeteries, including those in neighbouring cantonments in Sabathu and Dugshai, to see if any names or tombstones ring a bell.																					This April, we had two English couples who return to India every 2 or 3 years to visit scenes of their childhood which includes Kasauli. One couple I had known for many years and had them stay with me in my home in Delhi. They are Giles and Lisane Radice. When we first met, Giles was a Labour Party member of parliament and into writing books on contemporary British political history. Prime minister Tony Blair put him in the House of Lords. Now he spends three days of the week in London to attend to his parliamentary duties and the remaining four with his wife in their country home in Lincolnshire. Lady Lisanne Radice is also his writing partner and edits books for a publishing house. 																					Giless father and grandfather were in the Indian civil services and among the Brits who supported Indias freedom movement. I suggested to him that he do a book on English men and women who supported Indias demand for independence. The Indian National Congress was set up by an Englishman, A. O. Hume; Annie Besant (Irish) was president of the party. B.G. Horniman and C.F. Andrews were ardent supporters of Gandhiji. Madeleine Slade (Mira Behn) was a close disciple.																					Spratt and Ben Bradley were imprisoned in the Meerut Conspiracy Case. There were dozens of others in India and England who agitated for Indias freedom. Giles seemed to be taken up by the idea. I get good reviews for the books I write, he said ruefully, but they dont earn me much royalties. I replied, I get panned by most critics but manage to make the best-seller list. You do one on Brit supporters of Gandhi and I bet it will make the top of bestsellers in both countries.																					The other couple were David and Gina Alexander. David was in the army (Sappers) during World War II. He also spent some time in Kasauli and other Indian cantonments. He speaks Hindustani fluently and makes it a point to come back to India every 4 years to refresh his memories of the days of his youth as a soldier and to keep up his Hindustani. It is up to Brits like the Radices and Alexanders to extend hands of friendship to the Indians: I know there are thousands of Indians who will grasp them eagerly to start a new chapter in Indo-British person-to-person relationships.

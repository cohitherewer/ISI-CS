		 Monday, January 05, 2004  YEAR OF SOME BIG DECISIONS 
 GWYNNE DYER 
	History normally runs on rails, with one development following  another in fairly obvious succession. It may seem like a  roller-coaster ride at times, but twenty years later the  outcome is just about what you would have expected at the  start. Once in a while, however, history goes right off  the rails and this may be one of those times. Well  probably know for certain by the end of this year. 
	Two years ago, we were being told that 9/11 had changed  everything, but that was just media hype. In reality, 9/11  changed nothing except Americans mistaken belief that  they were invulnerable to foreign threats, and normally  the terrorist threat would have faded in a year  or so, to be replaced in the headlines by some trendy new  problem. But a hijack has occurred, and the course of history  really may have changed. That would be very bad. 
	The war on terror is a huge distraction from  the real priorities that face the world. The human population  of this planet has tripled in the past sixty years. That  puts enormous pressure on both resources and the environment.  The pressure is mounting even faster because many of those  who have been poor (including most Asians) are rapidly industrializing  and raising their consumption levels. Meanwhile, those who  are left out of the prosperity, particularly in Africa and  the Middle East, become ever more desperate and resentful.  
	Hope sinks 
	The tightly interconnected wealth-producing machine that  is the globalized economy is tremendously vulnerable to  environmental catastrophes, political shocks, or even financial  mismanagement. These need our undivided attention if we  are to get through the next half-century without a really  big blow-up. 
	Until recently, things were looking pretty hopeful: the  Cold War had ended, the great powers began to cooperate,  democracy spread around the world, and, with the help of  globalized massmedia, something that you could call world  public opinion began to emerge. Complex multilateral deals  were made on difficult issues like trade and climate change. 
	During the Nineties, the broad trend was reassuring. It  still is, but broad trends have been dislocated by relatively  local events in the past. China was not doomed to go into  centuries of isolation and stagnation in the early 15th  century just as its immense wealth, technological prowess  and fleets had positioned it to dominate the entire planet.  Europe didnt have to throw away a century of relative  peace and rapidly rising prosperity in the needless cataclysm  of World War I. If emperor Zhu Dis favourite concubine  had not been killed by the lightning that burnt down the  Forbidden City in 1421, or if Gavrilo Princip had gone home  after failing to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand on  his first try in Sarajevo in 1914, things might have been  very different. 
	Real concerns 
	Things would certainly be different now if al Qaida hijackers  had been caught before they carried out 9/11, or if George  W. Bush had not been awarded victory by the US supreme court  after the 2000 election. What we are living with now is  a runaway fluke. 
 A small band of Islamist fanatics is trying to provoke a  global confrontation between the West and Islam as a way  of levering themselves into power in Muslim countries, and  a US administration dominated by neo-conservative ideologues  is using this threat to justify their own project for global  American hegemony through military power. Neither is likely  to succeed, but between them they could wreck both the institutions  and the spirit of multilateral cooperation that were going  to ease the real crises that are coming.
 By this time next year, we will know whether the Bush administrations  adventure in Iraq has succeeded or failed, and whether Bush  himself has been re-elected or defeated. Without the neo-cons  in Washington to inflate their importance, the Islamist  terrorists would dwindle to a minor policy problem, and  normal service would be resumed on all the important global  issues. Decisive years are generally something you would  prefer to avoid, but this is going to be one.

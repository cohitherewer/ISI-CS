The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, March 28, 2004 							 																						FAMILY MATTERSAlthough India is a proud republic and has repudiated dynasty, evidence indicates that its political culture has not outgrown the dynastic principleThe rejection of dynastic rule is not the same as a complete disregard for the dynastic principle in public life. Great Britain is nominally under dynastic rule, but in Britains public life the prevalence of the dynastic principle is hardly noticeable. It is difficult to imagine Ms Margaret Thatchers children emerging as the leaders of the Conservative Party. In India, dynastic rule has been rejected since India is a proud republic, but the shadow of the dynastic principle looms large over Indian political life. The most glaring instance of this is, of course, the hold the Gandhi family has over the Congress. From Rajiv Gandhi to Ms Sonia Gandhi and to Mr Rahul Gandhi, there has been a series of Congress leaders who have assumed the leadership mantle on the basis of their surname. They had no other claims to leadership when they first joined politics. Rajiv Gandhi was pitchforked into being the party leader and the countrys leader after the assassination of his mother. Ms Gandhi became Congress president and prime minister-in-waiting because she was the widow of Rajiv Gandhi. Now Mr Rahul Gandhi goes to Amethi to contest the Lok Sabha elections from what is the Gandhi familys pocket borough.																														But the widespread prevalence of the dynastic principle is exemplified in the actions of other political parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been the most strident in its criticism of the Congress for projecting the Gandhi dynasty. The BJP too has sent out scions of former royal families, major and minor, to claim their political inheritance. Mr Dushyant Singh, the son of Rajasthans chief minister, Ms Vasundhara Raje, is being fielded from Jhalawar, a constituency from which Ms Raje had previously contested on five occasions. Similarly, Mr Manvendra Singh, the son of the finance minister, Mr Jaswant Singh, is contesting again from Barmer where he lost in 1999. It can be argued that the candidature of these two cannot really be compared to that of Mr Rahul Gandhi. The latter has no experience in politics and has never nursed the constituency of Amethi. His one and only asset is his lineage. Both Mr Singhs have been involved in politics and in their respective constituencies for a longish period of time. But even this line of thinking cannot ignore the fact that lineage did play a part in the nomination of these two BJP candidates.																														There are other political parties where this trend is noticeable. Witness the elevation of Mr Naveen Patnaik as a leader in Orissa. Or that of Mr Ajit Singh in Uttar Pradesh. The fathers of both were reputed leaders in their respective states. The evidence suggests that political culture, despite a public repudiation of dynasty, has not outgrown the dynasty. This has a certain fit with the ambience that holds sway in Indian society. Even in the urban world, lineage, caste and family status have a certain importance over and above achievements based solely on individual merit. The dynastic flag flies highest in the Congress but other parties have hoisted the same flag when it has suited their interests. The flag of the republic, as a result, flies figuratively in half-mast.

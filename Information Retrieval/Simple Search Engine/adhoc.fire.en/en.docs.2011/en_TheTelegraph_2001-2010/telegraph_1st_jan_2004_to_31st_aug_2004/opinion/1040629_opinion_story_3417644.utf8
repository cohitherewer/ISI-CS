The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																At the receiving end				 																																																				Sir  Chanda Raos story is a cautionary tale on the plight of women in India (Adultery yes, but murder?, June 27). That nothing has changed in the villages is well-known. But even in the cities, and among the upwardly mobile, well-educated classes to which Chandas family belongs, attitudes seem to languish somewhere in the dark ages. It might not seem so from the hoardings where women are seen as wearing the pants  in all senses. But dare a woman cross entrenched patriarchal norms and she will, like Chanda, have lost everything; one affair outside marriage, and she is deemed capable of anything, even murder. What is strange about the case is not just that the police seem to have concluded that the lady is lying about not having had anything to do with her husbands murder without conducting even a rudimentary investigation. It is that even her brothers jumped to accuse her. Obviously, when it comes to troublesome sisters, blood is not thicker than water. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Sahana Joshi, Jamshedpur 
				 																In the spotlight				 																																																				Sir  The report, North-east chapter in history books (June 17), brings good tidings. Until now, the North-east has barely found mention in NCERT history textbooks, except for the story of Lachit Barphukun and his famous one-liner, mur dekhot ko, mur mama dangor nohoy(My maternal uncle isnt above the nation). But all that is about to change now, even if Arjun Singh, the Union human resource development minister, may have been influenced in his decision to include chapters on the North-east by the fact of the prime ministers being a domicile of Assam. 				 																																																				Once the decision is implemented, it will help change the way people from other parts of the country perceive this region. Being an Assamese, I have often been asked questions like, Dont you have someone like Subhash Chandra Bose or Bhagat Singh? Do people in the state, barring some parts, wear clothes? And this at a time the internet has spread to remote parts of the region, there are call centres in many places, and the prime minister has an Assam-connection. Such questions are the result of ignorance. Can anyone think of posing such silly questions to someone who comes from West Bengal or Maharashtra? Will Singhs proposal be implemented or will it, as always, remain on paper?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

				 																																																				Sir  The proposed Indian Institute of Management in the North-east may be the catalyst for the long-delayed socio-economic development of the region (Region to get IIM, says Arjun, June 16). One of the established IIMs may act as mentor to the proposed institute, just as the two leading IIMs in Ahmedabad and Calcutta were started in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, respectively. The government might even consider involving a foreign institute like the Asian Institute Technology, Bangkok, so that the new IIM could be one of the best and have a global outlook. As for the location, the popular choice may be Guwahati, since it is well-connected. But Guwahati has more than its share of educational institutes. Other cities like Shillong, Dibrugarh, Imphal may be looked at. Security and accessibility might come in the way, but these considerations are overshadowed by the prospects of development which the IIM will bring to these far-off regions.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manash Buragohain, Rolla, USA

				 																																																				Sir  Every year, haj pilgrims from the North-east have to come to Calcutta to catch a flight to Mecca and Jeddah. The waste of time and money involved could be avoided if the flights were directly from Guwahati. Flights for hajis leave from 12 airports in the country, not one leaves from the North-east. From time to time, Central ministers make pious statements about how they want to help the North-east, but the words are never translated into action. The Assam chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, has been promising direct flights from Guwahati for the last three years. Earlier, he would blame the Centre for the delay. Will he continue to do so now that he heads the government? Even the prime minister, a Rajya Sabha member from Assam, has not done anything in this matter. 				 																																																				Yours faith fully,																															
Mehbub Alam Laskar, Hailakandi

				 																																																				Sir  I agree with Patricia Mukhim that universities must rise above parochialism of all kinds  religious or ethnic (Secularism in universities, June 1). Institutions of higher education must inculcate values that are universal. Sadly, parochialism and chauvinism are creeping into the academic life of students from almost all communities in the North-east. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Amguri is hardly an oilfield (Strike call over oilfield sell-off, June 25). The principal yield from the wells at the site is gas. For the past few years, most of these wells have fallen into disrepair because the ONGC finds it uneconomic to maintain them. As a result, tea estates in the area, which depend on the gas, have had to incur a lot of expense on other fuels. This has added to the cost of producing tea. The gas generators too are lying idle. Under the circumstances, whose interest will the proposed strike of the workers of the oilfields serve? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashok Trivedi, Jorhat

				 																Cult figure				 																																																				Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjees article on Chanchalkumar Chattopadhyay was very perceptive (Picture and book remain, June 27). I would only like to add a footnote to it. Sometime in 1949, Chanchalkumar wrote in Sahitya Patra a piece on the magical qualities of the prose of Kamalkumar Majumdar. He thus started a cult. Chanchalkumar has passed into oblivion, the cult carries on. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ashok Mitra, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 23, 2004 							 																						SAFETY NET																														Who killed Naif Ahmed? There is a way of working backwards from an accident in order to work out a sequence of determining factors that usually stops somewhere. This is a way of ascertaining responsibility, which, in the eyes of law, is different from guilt. Nevertheless, taking responsibility for fatal neglect is an essential part of civilized society, and more specifically, of a civic order. Naif Ahmeds two-wheeler skidded off the Zeerut Bridge and fell into Tollys Nullah, killing him instantly, because the bridge had not been maintained properly. Its railings were broken and left unrepaired. But when the police tried to pin the responsibility for this neglect down to a particular civic authority, a shocking passing-the-buck game was played out between the various suspects. The public works department, the CMDA, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Writers Buildings and the police themselves  none of these bodies considers itself responsible for maintaining the bridge. The PWD, for instance, believes that the irrigation department is responsible for maintaining the bridge.																														The state human rights commission considers this to be a violation of human rights, and has asked the PWD, the CMC and the police for an explanation. But apart from the culpable indifference to public safety, the deeper malaise in this case is in the tendency to evade responsibility by taking advantage of bureaucratic intricacies. Significantly, the buck always passes laterally, from body to body at a certain level of authority. Its movement is never vertical, holding a higher authority in the state responsible for the failings of an institution that is accountable to it. In this way, the bureaucracy acts as a sort of trapeze net of complicity, sustaining a callousness of inhuman proportions. Inquiries, and suo motu orders from ultimately powerless bodies like the SHRC, have to be far more relentless in order find a breach in this seamless web of evasion and apathy.

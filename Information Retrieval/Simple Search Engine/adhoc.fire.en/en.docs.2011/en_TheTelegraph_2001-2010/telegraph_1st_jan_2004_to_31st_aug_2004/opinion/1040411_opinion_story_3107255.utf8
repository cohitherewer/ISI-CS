The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 11, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Lady protests too much				 																																																				Sir  Why is Priyanka Gandhi playing so hard to get? If she is destined to enter politics, inasmuch as all Nehru-Gandhis are destined to join politics, then Priyanka Gandhi had better join politics and be done with it. At least then we wont have the entire nation, especially the media, tying themselves up in knots over will she, wont she. Or is that what the gameplan is  keep up the hype, even as the Congress mulls when to make use of her, in effect its final trump card? If that is so, Sonia Gandhi had better not wait too long, or the ship will go under, and not even a Rahul Gandhi can save it.Yours faithfully, 
Rashmi Bhattacharya, CalcuttaWithout shine
				 																																																				Sir  Ashis Chakrabortys More than a pinch of saffron (April 8) is marred by his comment that the Bharatiya Janata Party is swelling its ranks by cynically exploiting the anger over the oppression of Hindus across the border. It is the knowledge of the persecution of Hindus both in Bangladesh and in West Bengal that is driving Hindu voters in Bengal to vote for the BJP. Despite having information of the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh from refugees, leftist leaders in West Bengal have always tried to hide human rights abuses in Bangladesh from the people in the state. Not only Bangladesh, but also West Bengal is shown as a picture of communal harmony in order to pander to the minority vote bank here. Bengals leftist rulers sometimes turn a blind eye to their minority supporters close links with fundamentalist organizations in Bangladesh. If the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-ruled West Bengal allows the media to focus on human rights violations both within and beyond the borders of Bengal, there would be less of a groundswell of anger and frustration against the state government. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Kumar Pal, London 

				 																																																				Sir  Even if we believe that India is shining, the shine is unlikely to spread to West Bengal. For a state that does not listen to the high court, where the headmaster of a school openly defies law and has to be dragged to court, where the ruling partys chief whip challenges the Election Commission observer, where students unions force out the vice-chancellor from his office, such a miracle is unlikely. So while India shines, West Bengal will continue to rust.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arjun, Calcutta

				 																New shine				 																																																				Sir  For the first time ever, 36 well-known companies, both national and multinational, have visited the Indian Institute of Technology campus at Guwahati. This is essentially the outcome of a prolonged students agitation in the region which has managed to attract the attention of the companies. It is probably time for an Indian Institute of Management in Guwahati to serve the North-east. And why not? If there can be an IIM in Kochi, Indore and Kozhikode, why should the North-east be left out? The IIM Calcutta came up a decade after the IIT in Kharagpur. The Guwahati IIT was set up in 1994. A decade later, the state should have its IIM. Yours faithfully, 
Dipankar Talukdar, Calcutta 				 																																																				Sir  It was a great day for the North-east when Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited Guwahati. His speech gives a new ray of hope to the terror-struck people, smarting under militancy and the unceasing infiltration problem. Vajpayee has touched peoples hearts. Although the population is wary of election gimmicks, they are likely to give the BJP a chance.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N.J. Parasara, Bangalore

				 																Still shining				 																																																				Sir  K.L. Saigal may be the voice which grandfather loved, but to the music aficionado, he will always be remembered as the first Bollywood superstar (Saigal who?, April 4). He epitomizes an age when mixing and voice modulation were unknown terms. One can well imagine the labour put in by each singer to attain perfection at one shot.Yours faithfully, 
Abhinav Dasgupta, Calcutta

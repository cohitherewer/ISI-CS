The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 28, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Rotten to the core				 																																																				Sir  Political formations like the Bahujan Samaj Party have made it big, riding on the frustrations of the under-privileged sections of society. But success, in terms of a rich lifestyle, media visibility and of course, immense power, has taken a toll on the personal lives of its leaders. This disjunction between their present eminence and their humble origins may be one explanation for the allegations Kanshi Rams family have made against Mayavati (Kanshi a prisoner, cries family, May 26). There may be some truth in what they say, or there may not be. There is no doubt that Mayavati owes her career to Kanshi Ram, and seems to have gone out of her way to keep him alive and healthy. Also, Kanshi Rams family may be reacting a little too hysterically to the doctors fears for his safety. But then with politics being all about circles within circles with something rotten at the centre, one can safely say that the truth will never be known.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Sahana Basu, Calcutta
				 																Spots on the shine				 																																																				Sir  The inclusion of tainted politicians like Laloo Prasad Yadav, Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav and Mohammad Taslimuddin in the cabinet shows that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance has given ethics and moral rectitude the go-by in its bid to form a government (Tainted Bihar trio finds place in ministry, May 23). It is unlikely that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh  a man of unimpeachable integrity  favoured the induction of these corrupt leaders. Can it then be assumed that he had to make compromises for the sake of coalition politics, at the behest of Sonia Gandhi? 				 																																																				Many people, including sections of the media, had canonized Sonia Gandhi after her renunciation of the prime ministership. Some even compared her to Mahatma Gandhi. My question is  would the Mahatma have compromised on principles in order to form a government? Some may argue that such compromises are necessary for the sake of secularism. But would Gandhi ever have preached the primacy of ends over means? Let us hope that Singh can govern India the way he wishes to, without undue interference from his mentor, and that his reign is free of scams. It would be sad for the nation if, after a lifetime of honesty, Singh has to retire with the burden of corruption charges against his name.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The inclusion in the cabinet of persons against whom there are criminal cases pending is shocking, as the editorial, Out of tune (May 24), says. But even more objectionable is the fact that the cabinet also has a minister from the Indian Union Muslim League. The Congress and the left keep saying that they want to usher in a secular government. Do they think the IUML is secular? Was it not the Muslim League, led by M.A. Jinnah, which was responsible for the Partition?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

				 																																																				Sir  It is very unfair that persons charged with serious crimes like murder, assault, cheating, fraud and the like should be sworn in as ministers, when an ordinary citizen cannot even get a government job if his antecedents are found objectionable. If criminals must be retained in the cabinet, then the provision for police verification for those joining government service should be scrapped. 				 																																																				How can the media, academicians, jurists, and the intelligentsia justify the fact that small crimes send one to jail, but big crimes enrich? If notorious criminals must remain in the cabinet, Manmohan Singh must ask his human resources development minister to introduce courses in different crimes to be taught in schools, so that we can produce even better criminals. If success comes readily through crime and criminals get the patronage of the government, why not teach crime in a methodical manner? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Balram Misra, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  One can understand Sonia Gandhis compulsion in inducting several corrupt regional leaders in the Union ministry. But it is up to the prime minister to ensure that these ministers are restrained from making free with the public exchequer. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The induction of charge-sheeted politicians into the ministry is often sought to be excused on the plea that until convicted, they are innocent. But some of the charges against these ministers are quite serious. Given how long it takes the judiciary in our country to dispose of such cases, it can be assumed that these ministers will continue in office for some time. 				 																																																				In the circumstances, is it any wonder that in the international corruption index, India figures near the bottom? Since politicians do not wish to expedite such cases or change the law to keep out criminals from politics, it seems the country has to learn to live with a bad name. The only ray of hope is if the Supreme Court were to intervene.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If Sonia Gandhi can give up the highest office of the country in response to her inner voice, there is no reason why the ministers against whom there are corruption charges cannot leave office to give Manmohan Singh greater freedom to chose a cabinet which has a cleaner image. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The United Progressive Alliance must keep in mind the sensitivity of the Indian voter. The latter will not take kindly to the subversion of their verdict through back-door entries into the cabinet, criminals in government office and public-fighting over prize ministries				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

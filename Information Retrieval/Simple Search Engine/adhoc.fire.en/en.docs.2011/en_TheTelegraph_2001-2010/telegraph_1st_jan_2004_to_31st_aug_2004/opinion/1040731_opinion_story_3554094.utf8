The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 							 																						TALES OF TWO COUNTRIESTHIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT SINGH				 	 National question																					One section, The Arrogance of Hindutva, began: India has always operated best when she is in partnership with others, whether its the Mughals or the British. To strike out these chapters of Indias history with a saffron pen is to miss the point about India, which is ultimately too hospitable, too welcoming to stand on her own. The British did not subjugate her, rather they allowed her to blossom, much like the support a rubber tree gives to the twisting pepper vine that grows in its shadow.																					The extract is taken from the Jon Stocks spy thriller The Cardamom Club. Stock was the correspondent of Londons Daily Telegraph in Delhi for a couple of years and spent quite some time in Cochin. He is back in England writing his third novel.																					Stock makes a black and white division between the English who hated everything Indian (Indophobia) and those who loved India and Indians (Indo-philia). India-haters highlighted everything bad about the country: sati, bride-burning, human and animal sacrifices and so on, to prove that Indians were incapable of running their affairs and giving them independence was a blunder. Indians are equally divided between those who believed that we were better off under British rule than under our corrupt leaders and those who fought for freedom and vowed to make India a nuclear power on par with the most powerful nations of the world.																					Stock names the leader of India-haters  Macaulay (the choice of name is noteworthy). He is sadist and a sexual pervert and lives in an island off the Malabar coast. His outfit is known as the Cardamom Club. It has vast resources at its disposal, including means to bribe a whole village to enact sati, spies to keep watch on Indian emigrants settled in England who they heartily loathe. It has its agents get important posts in the British high commission, and if they find the high commissioner too pro-Indian, they have him sacked or bumped off. On the other side is a Malayali, a one-time freedom fighter now practising medicine in Scotland. He is also engaged in stealing British nuclear secrets and sending them to India. His son, Raj Nair, having qualified as a doctor, gets a posting as medical officer in the British high commission in Delhi. He can speak no Indian language. The high commissioner, who is pro-Indian, sends Raj Nair to Cochin to check up on Macaulay and his Cardamom Club. With him is a Malayali beauty, Priyanka, a journalist who he had run into at a diplomatic party in Delhi.																					The Cardamom Club is a tangled tale of intrigue, back-stabbing and violence. It is utterly contrived and lacking in conviction. It heads towards a fairy-tale ending with Raj and Priyanka getting married and living happily ever after. That is not to be. The tale is given yet another twist, which makes it even less credible. Nevertheless, much as I tried to give up on it halfway, I was unable to do so.																					Lost in translation																					Lovers of poetry agree that in order to get the best of its flavour and the music of its words, it has to be read in the original; translated in other languages, it reads as flat as if it has been robbed of its resonance. There are a few notable exceptions when the language of the original is close to the one in which it has been translated, as German, French, Spanish and Italian into English. The worst victims are translations of Oriental languages into European. The only examples of successful renderings I can think of are Edwin Arnolds Light of Asia, Scott Fitzgeralds Rubaiyaat of Omar Khayyam, Brough and Lee Siegels renderings of Sanskrit poems, and recently, William Radices translation of Tagores songs. When it comes to Urdu-into-English, most Urdu-lovers, including Ralph Russell, are agreed that no one has succeeded as well as Victor Kiernan in translating selections from Faiz Ahmed Faiz.																					Kiernan for some years was teaching English at the Aitchison Chiefs College in Lahore. During his Lahore years, Kiernan taught himself Urdu and had the benefit of having Faiz as a close friend. It was not the same when he tried his hand translating Allama Iqbal who was dead by the time Kiernan arrived in Lahore. I for one was not even aware that he had done so till last week when I got Poems From Iqbal: Renderings in English Verse with Comparative Urdu Text published in 1955. It is a sad commentary on Indo-Pak relations when it comes to exchange of books between the two neighbours who share a common linguistic heritage. 																					Having tried my hand at Iqbals poetry, I have a few bones to pick with Kiernan and his publishers. First is about the selection made by them. I can well understand the omission of Allamas Saarey jahaan say acchha Hindustan hamaara: it would not go down well with Pakistanis, then in the first flush of patriotism after breaking away from India. Even more difficult for them to swallow would be Hindi hain hum, vatan hai Hindustan hamaara (we are Indians, our homeland is Hindustan). I was vastly amused when my old friend Vasant Sathe shed his secular pretensions and stated publicly that Iqbals lines would read better if changed to Hindu hain hum vatan hai Hindustan hamaara. Can we really blame the Pakistanis for being Muslim chauvinists when our Hindutva supporters are no different from their bigots?																					However, I have other reservations about Kiernans rendering of Iqbal. Unlike his translations of Faiz which read very smoothly, his renderings of Iqbal are in laboured rhyme. I will quote one poem, Haqeegat-e-Husn (Beautys essence). He translates it as follows:																					Beauty asked God one day/ This question: Why/ Didst Thou not make me, in Thy world, undying?/ And God replying / A picture-show is this world: all this world/ A tale out of the long night of not-being;/ And in it, seeing/ Its nature works through mutability/ That only is the lovely whose essence knows decay./ The moon stood near and heard this colloquy,/ The words tool wing about the sky/ And reached the morning-star;/ Dawn learned them from its star, and told the dew/ It told the heavens whisper to/ Earths poor familiar;/ And at the dews report the flowers eye filled,/ With pain the new buds tiny heartbeat thrilled;/ Springtime fled from the garden, weeping;/ Youth, that had come to wander there, went creeping/ Sadly away. 																					I rendered the same poem as follows:																					To the Creator did Beauty one day complain/ Why made ye one of stuff that doth wane?/ The world is like a hall of mirrors, answered He/ A tale told to pass the long night of eternity./ Since of changeable hues it was first made/ Its the essence of beauty that it must fade./ The moon overheard, she was not far/ It spread in the skies to the Morning Star./ The Star told the Dawn, Dawn to Dew extended/ The secret of Heaven thus to the Earth descended/ The buds little heart burst with grief and bled/ Grief filled the garden in loud lament/ Youth that had come to sport in sorrow went.																					I leave it to my readers to judge which version is closer to the original and reads more smoothly  the Pakistani or the Indian.

		 Friday, July 02, 2004 							 																						UNDER THE SCANNERTHE PILLARS OF ISLAM VOL II: Laws pertaining to Human Intercourse Translated by A.A. Fyzee and revised by Ismail Kurban Husein Poonawala, Oxford, Rs 995Islam as a religion, has always attracted the attention of the people for reasons more than one. At present, however, actions of some misdirected people have brought the community under bad light but well-written books about this religion can dispel the doubts rising in the minds of those who know little about it. The Pillars of Islam is one such  although written for the Muslims and for a particular sect in Islam, it can be read by all for it deals with laws that govern all human actions.This is the second volume, and like the earlier translated version, will enlighten the reader because of its subject matter and its treatment.																														The Pillars of Islam or Daaim al-Islam was originally written in Arabic by al-Numan around the 10th century. It was written for the Ismailis, a religious sect amongst the Shia communities, because of the need for an authoritative document on Ismaili law in the Fatimid state in north Africa. The establishment of the Fatimid state, incidentally, had started in a clandestine manner. 																														But after the establishment of the Caliphate, it was felt that there should be a document laying down Islamic laws for proper governance in civil and religious matters of the state. Caliph al Muizz li-Din Allah asked al-Numan to write an authentic book for the use of the Ismaili people as well as the state of the time. The Caliph took personal interest in supervising the work from the very outset. Once written, Daaim al-Islam became the official book of conduct for the Fatimid state. The Mustali Tayyabi Bohras follow the contents of the book in letter and spirit and consider it an authority on Ismaili law even today. Even the law courts in the subcontinent take the help from the book in matters of disputes relating to Ismaili law. 																														This book had earlier been translated in Urdu and Gujrati. A.A. Fyzee, a scholar of Islamic law who was principal of the Government College in Mumbai, initially took up the books translation into English. He completed both the volumes but, because of ill health, could not do away with the inaccuracies in the manuscript. The work of revision was passed on to Ismail Kurban Husein Poonawala, who teaches Islamic Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. The first volume dealt with religious and devotional topics while the second deals with food, dress, marriage, laws of inheritance and other things. It is voluminous and consists of twenty-four chapters detailing all the subtleties of the topics taken up in the discussions, with ample reference to their sources from the Koran and the Hadith. 																														It is surprising how, given his age, al-Numan logically arranged the topics to clearly expound his ideas about the intricacies of religious thoughts. However, not all of the topics deal with religion. Some, like the chapter on medicine, can appeal even to the curious layman looking for ways to get rid of diseases without modern medicines. 																														Readers will remain indebted to both Fyzee and Poonawala for bringing into English a text they would never have had the chance of reading otherwise.						SHAMS AFIF SIDDIQI

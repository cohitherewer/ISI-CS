The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 							 																						LEGAL RIGHT																														Issues of citizenship have a history of inciting xenophobic sentiments in the North-east. The Election Commissions decision to allow the people belonging to the Chakma and the Hajong tribes to vote in these polls has stirred old passions in Arunachal Pradesh. It is not difficult to see why all political parties in the state are united in opposing the ECs move. They cannot afford to lose votes by supporting the cause of a people whom the natives had always regarded as outsiders. It is not the fault of these people that the issue of their identity has remained unresolved for four decades. They were displaced from their homeland in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in present-day Bangladesh in the Sixties when a dam over a river submerged the area. If India showed a humanitarian gesture by settling them in a corner of Arunachal Pradesh, successive governments in New Delhi avoided granting citizenship to them for fear of upsetting the local people. This obviously was no way to assuage local sentiments. If the natives suspicion of the rising Chakma and Hajong populations grew, New Delhis indifference made things worse. 																														The chief minister, Mr Gegong Apang, may find the ECs decision politically inconvenient. The EC must have been convinced of their citizenship right to have given these people the franchise for the first time. It is the state governments responsibility to ensure that they can vote. No matter what the states political parties say or do to suit their electoral strategies, it is a legal, and not a political, issue. It is also for Mr Apang to decide how he can persuade the All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union to withdraw its call to the parties to boycott the elections to protest against the ECs move. The state government and the parties can take the matter up with New Delhi as well. But it would be both illegal and unfair to deny a small community of people their right to vote. The problem is that governments have always let the issue die down once the elections are over. This short-sighted approach has failed both the local people and the Chakmas. Worse, it has kept ethnic passions alive in a sensitive border state.

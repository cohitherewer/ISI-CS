		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 							 																						NO ONE LIKES A BAD FLOOD The floods that ravage north Bihar are the result of engineering failure, bureaucratic inefficiency and lack of political will, argues Uttam Sengupta				 	 View from the top																														Although floods are no less devastating than earthquakes, the horrors of the latter are appreciated better in this country. The reason, it would appear, lies in the aerial route that most political leaders and newsmen take to look at flood-hit areas. The havoc wrought by earthquakes is there on the ground for everyone to see, but floods are invariably viewed from a distance, from a safe height and in fair weather. 																														From the top, water-logged areas often look like pretty picture postcards. Trees and buildings surrounded by sheets of water seldom tell the fury with which the water rushed in to sweep everything before it. Surveyors from the air can rarely visualize water washing away houses and animals, often at night. They rarely see human beings and reptiles taking shelter on the same trees or 10-feet wide embankments providing shelter to a mass of humanity, eating, defecating and sleeping together, and even delivering children in the open  often in torrential rain. They almost never witness the overloaded and leaking country boats sinking in the flood-water or hear the screams of drowning women and children. A devastating flood manages to draw media attention only when the flood waters inundate parts of the urban landscape and is usually described as worst-ever when stocks of grain stored by the rich and middle peasantry get washed away. 																														It came, therefore, as no surprise when concern for the Indian truckers held hostage in Iraq overshadowed the tragedy in eastern India. The flood waters may have receded somewhat, but the situation on the ground remains grim. Indeed, more air time was devoted by television channels to waterlogging in Mumbai or New Delhi than to the estimated 25 million affected by the floods so far. Three lakh people marooned in Assam, the seven times that number rendered homeless in Bihar where over 600 people had died till the end of July, marked one of the worst floods in the region. 																														The nation, however, remained curiously unmoved. There was not even much of the ritual noise over relief that one gets to hear in the wake of such natural calamities. This is not unnatural because the rest of the country has virtually no experience of the ravages caused by floods, with 70 per cent of the people living in flood-prone areas belonging to the eastern states. Indeed, the Central Water Commission estimates that only 5 per cent of the Indian population are vulnerable to floods. 																														An even more important reason, perhaps, is that the floods affect only the poor. The rich and the middle peasants can afford to migrate, set up house and shops in urban areas, protected by embankments. The poor can afford no such insurance and are forced to wait for the furies to be unleashed. 																														The inability to either store or drain out surplus water in the plains of north Bihar must rank as a colossal technological and engineering failure. The inability to institutionalize relief and rescue measures raises questions about bureaucratic efficiency and political will. The engineering approach has been to build reservoirs to store monsoon water, to build embankments to prevent rivers from spilling over the banks and to ensure better drainage by building channels to improve the flow of the rivers. 																														The approach has not quite worked in Bihar. The state had only 160 kilometre-long embankments in 1954; in the next 34 years, the length of the embankments went up to 3,454 km. But so did the flood-prone areas in the state, which registered a three-fold increase in the three decades. In 1954, 2.5 million hectares of land were estimated to be vulnerable to floods in the state, but by 1988, the figure had been revised upwards to 6.46 million hectares. 																														Experts and engineers have now started advocating river-linking and the creation of a national water grid to take care of the problem. Environmentalists have been busy opposing the plans, pleading instead for allowing the rivers to flow freely till they merge with the Indian Ocean. They also oppose the construction of a high dam in Nepal, which they feel will be disastrous both financially and geologically. In any case, they point out, there are already not one but two barrages in Nepal, at Bhimnagar and Balmikinagar, both of which are manned by engineers from Bihars water resources department. 																														In addition, the Central Water Commission maintains as many as 80 flood forecasting stations in the Ganga basin. But none of this appears to have helped. Activists in Bihar quote an elderly lady in north Bihar to indicate the enormity of the situation  Floodwater earlier came cautiously and slowly like cats, but now they rush in and pounce like a tiger, giving us little time to collect our belongings and escape. 																														Everyone not only loves a good drought, as the title of P. Sainaths book puts it, but everyone seems to love a good flood as well. There is enormous scope for bureaucrats and engineers to make money by cashing in on the miseries of people and possibly by building or repairing the same embankment over and over again. 																														China is learnt to have punished 97 officials involved in the construction of the controversial Three Gorges Dam project, the largest of its kind in the world, and sentenced one of them to death for corruption. In our country, not a single such example is available, though it would be nave to presume that corruption does not cast a shadow over flood-control projects. 																														Indeed, the Centre for Science and Environment says cheekily in one of its reports, Indias political administration is a bureaucratic nightmare. Under its mountains of files, forests disappear, rivers go missing and corrupt politicians and businessmen make easy money without anyone ever noticing. 																														Politicians can also be rather casual about the havoc wrought by floods. Newspapers recently quoted the irrepressible Laloo Prasad Yadav as saying that floods are actually a boon for the poor. He explained to reporters how fish, generally trapped in the private ponds of the rich landlords, spill into the homes of the poor with floodwater. One could have allowed him the benefit of the doubt if he, as the Union railway minister, had at least ensured that the freight on relief materials for the flood-affected areas was waived. But then even relief material during floods takes the aerial route, reaching very few people. According to one report, while relief material worth Rs 1 crore was air-dropped in north Bihar last month, the cost of the helicopter sorties has been several times higher. 																														Following what was then described as the centurys worst flood in 1987, the Bihar government had promised to construct helipads in every block and raised platforms in every panchayat to facilitate relief and rescue measures. Like many such promises, these too remained on paper. No wonder Bihar, which was once known as the heart of the country, is now described as Indias armpit. For the victims, it is poor consolation and for the rest of the nation, it remains a crying shame.

		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 							 																						SEEING IT DONE																														The beheading of Nick Berg, an American hostage in Iraq, may be watched on the internet as a video-clipping. It has become part of the theatre of revenge, which includes the digital photographs of the Abu Ghraib atrocities. The idea of revenge, and then of playing it out as a visually reproducible spectacle, are now integral to the broadcasting of terror. This particular cycle of images started on September 11, 2001, and Nick Bergs decapitation video  titled Abu Musab al-Zarqawi shown slaughtering an American  is the latest in the sequence, which also includes the recording of Daniel Pearls execution. Berg was a staunch supporter of the American position in Iraq. In this drama, unfolding for the eye of the world, vengeance and justice have become indistinguishable. Mr Zarqawi, a lieutenant of Mr Osama bin Laden, has declared in the latest video that the dignity of the abused detainees in Abu Ghraib is not redeemed except by blood and souls. Redemption has therefore become irreversibly identified with the cycle of blood. The video also warns Messrs George W. Bush and Pervez Musharraf to expect severe days in which they will not receive anything from the avengers but coffin after coffin. As it is becoming increasingly evident that the Abu Ghraib disclosures are more systemic than aberrant, a scale by which to measure and compare atrocities is also being worked out. The footage of Bergs beheading seems to reinforce the Bush administrations insistence that the American abuse of Iraqi prisoners pales in comparison with the barbarity of the enemies of freedom. 																														But justice is also being prepared for alongside this cycle of vengeance. Before the transfer of power at the end of June, the United States of America will be handing over Mr Saddam Hussain to the Iraqis, together with more than a hundred other high-ranking Baathist officials. Their trials will begin early next year in a tribunal run by five Iraqi judges, unlike the international courts set up in the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. This tribunal will have the power to investigate and try cases of genocide, crimes against humanity and other war crimes particular to Iraq. It will be a proper court of law, authorized to punish and to execute. Iraq and the US are locked together then at two levels of action and reaction. There is justice, governed by the laws and conventions of democracy. But there is also revenge, the rougher justice, in which cruelty and its visual pleasures confound the saviours of freedom with its enemies.

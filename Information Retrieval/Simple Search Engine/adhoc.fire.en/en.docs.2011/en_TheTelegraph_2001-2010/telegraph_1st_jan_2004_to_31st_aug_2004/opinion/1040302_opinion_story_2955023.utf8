The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 							 																						POLL CALL																														The wait is over. Once the prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had announced the dissolution of the 13th Lok Sabha, it was obvious that general election would be held sooner than later. The only issue was the timing of it. The prevailing speculation was that the outgoing government would try to capitalize on what has come to be called the feel good factor. But the Election Commission could not be hurried. Working at its own pace, it has now announced the election time-table, thus laying to rest the suspense and speculation. The politics of electioneering will now predominate over the politics of governance, and the task of ruling India will run on its own inertia till the 14th Lok Sabha is sworn in and a new government is in place. It has now become the standard practice to have a staggered election time-table. Given the demographic and geographical size of the Indian democracy, this is the only viable way of holding the general election. This time, voting will be spread over 20 days beginning from April 20. The results would be known on May 13. Every general election is justifiably billed as the biggest experiment in democracy. It is also the most colourful and volatile of secular festivals in India. It was also, in living memory, the most notorious of all political processes. There was violence, coercion and bribery. Since the time of Mr T.N. Seshans tenure as chief election commissioner, the election process has been cleansed of many malpractices.																														One of the crucial ways of cleaning up the election process has been a strict imposition of the model code of conduct. In India, the distinction between party and government is, at best, tenuous. Much too often, the holding of public office is used for electoral advantage. Over the last few years, the EC has been very demanding on this score and it has forced political parties to adhere to the code of conduct. The present election commissioner, Mr T.S. Krishnamurthy, as soon as he assumed office, objected to the India Shining campaign. He thought that this violated the spirit of the code of conduct. But his objections were somewhat premature since the code had not then come into force. But Mr Krishnamurthy had made his intentions clear: he was not going to pussyfoot on issues of violation of the code of conduct. With the announcement of the election schedule, the code has come into force and the EC has to be extra watchful about picking out transgressions.																														One of the main problems facing the Indian democracy is the growing cynicism, especially in the urban areas, about the political class. No election quite measures this. The EC suggested that a category called none of the above should be introduced into the electronic voting machine. But this proposal has not won the immediate approval of the political parties who have temporized with the counter-proposal of an all-party conference on the subject. The ECs proposal is important, and the EC should ensure that procrastination does not steal it away.

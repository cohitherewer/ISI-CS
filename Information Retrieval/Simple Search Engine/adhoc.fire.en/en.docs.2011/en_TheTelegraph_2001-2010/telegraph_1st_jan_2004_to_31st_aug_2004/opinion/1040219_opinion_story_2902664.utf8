		 Thursday, February 19, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Young and silly				 																																																				Sir  Only the sweet innocence of youth can make Varun Gandhi believe that family and party are separate (BJP or Cong, dynasty cant lose Feb 17). What does Varun think he is doing in the Bharatiya Janata Party, for heavens sake? Perhaps, he thinks he has been inducted into the party amidst so much fanfare because of his political skills, or because he is a poet like his partys prime minister? Thats so funny that it is almost sad. As is the fact that Varun has inherited and will now have to carry forward his mothers animosity towards her late husbands family. Otherwise, Varun could well have claimed his share of the family concern, the Congress, like his cousins. As things now stand, one can only feel sad that the familys dirty linen will now be washed in public and that the BJP will now play off one Gandhi against another, while the media and voters have a field day. And to think that the silly young man does not even understand the BJPs perfidy!				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Jagannath Mullick, Calcutta 
				 																																																				Making up the past				 																																																				Sir  Why is history a compulsory part of modern education today? This question came to mind while reading Avijit Ghoshs profile of Romila Thapar, HerStory and beyond (Jan 28). Why should children all over the world have to come to terms with metanarratives under the garb of a subject called history  be it right-wing or left-wing  when the compulsion is not natural? It does not take much imagination to realize that the reason lies in what European imperialism and third world nationalism have together achieved  the universalization of the nation-state as the most desirable form of political community and its consequences for the present. 				 																																																				Wherever the academic discourse of history is conceived  at the Jawaharlal Nehru University or the Aligarh Muslim University or the shakhas of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh  Europe is its sovereign theoretical subject. Peculiarly, all our histories, whether Indian, Chinese or Burmese, and even our methodologies, saffron or Marxist, tend to become variations of a master narrative that celebrates the nation-state and can be called the history of Europe. This is a Europe constructed out of the tales imperialists and nationalists have told the colonized.				 																																																				Selective preservation and exegeses of texts is a common way to peg a culture as intrinsically superior to others (for example, Swapan Dasguptas Reclaiming the Hindu gods, Jan 30). It is through such a construction that nationalist historiography (in Dasguptas case Hindu nationalism) tries to rationalize the past. This legitimized past, not the historical past but an idealized one, is then presented as a panacea for the tensions of the present. And it is this conviction of certainty in relation to the difficult realities of the past that is the stamp of all brands of fundamentalism. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nanak Ganguly, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  HerStory and beyond says little about Romila Thapar but a lot about Avijit Ghosh. Commenting on the vandalism at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Ghosh alleges deafening silence from the Union government. But it was the job of the Maharashtra government, led by the Congress, to prevent such acts of vandalism. Again, no less than the prime minister condemned the banning of the book. Ghosh goes on to lament the protests against Paul Courtright. Probably he does not know that Courtright analysed the trunk of Ganesha to represent erectile dysfunction. As for Thapar, Ghosh claims she passed London universitys minimum requirement test on Sanskrit  ergo she knows Sanskrit. Is Ghosh really that innocent? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nirmal Dutta, Calcutta

				 																Convenient alliances				 																																																				Sir  Political parties nowadays change partners more often than even Casanova. Why, only a few months ago, Kalyan Singh was spewing venom at the Bharatiya Janata Party. Elsewhere, the Congress has allied with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, ignoring the Jain commissions report; the BJP is hobnobbing with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam despite J. Jayalalithaa bringing down the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government some years ago. But the Bahujan Samaj Party takes the cake for its overtures to the BJP just to bring down the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh. Politics without morals  the worlds second oldest profession is fast beginning to look like the worlds oldest. If capturing power is the sole motive for which any difference can be forgotten, I suggest our parties merge into the All India BDCBSP (Bharatiya Dravida Congress Bahujan Samajwadi Party). Any takers?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Meraj Ahmed Mubarki, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Kalyan Singhs return to the BJP shows yet again how politics in India has come to be driven by self-interest. Singh seems to have forgotten what he had said about A.B. Vajpayee when quitting the BJP about two years ago. But it is not Singh alone  Mayavati, Mulayam Singh Yadav, P.A. Sangma, Sharad Pawar, K. Karunakaran are all in the same boat. Even as they say upholding secularism is their first priority, they dilly-dally about forming an anti-BJP coalition. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K. Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Our politicians fondness for changing parties to suit their selfish interests can be checked if we switch to a two-party system. Only those parties which get at least 20 per cent votes at the national level should be recognized as a national party. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

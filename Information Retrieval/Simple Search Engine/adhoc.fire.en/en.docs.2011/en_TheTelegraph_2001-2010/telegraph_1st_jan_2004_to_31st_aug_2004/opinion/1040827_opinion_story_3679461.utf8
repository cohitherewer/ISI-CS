The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 27, 2004 							 																						NOT SING ALONG																														The opposition exists because there is a parliament. Yet it appears that the opposition does not believe in the parliament. Proceedings in the Lok Sabha have been at a standstill in the current session because the opposition parties chose to scream and shout rather than discuss matters that affect national life and governance. The Bharatiya Janata Party leadership and that of the National Democratic Alliance must decide what they consider to be of greater consequence for the nation: a discussion on the Union budget in the Lok Sabha or protests against the removal of a plaque dedicated to one of its leaders. There are fora in which such protests can be voiced, but there is no other forum, save the Lok Sabha, where the budget can be debated. The choice, at least for a responsible political party committed to democracy, is obvious. The NDAs disregard of parliament  the most important institution in a democracy  was underlined by the bizarre move to present a memorandum to the prime minister with a clutch of suggestions pertaining to the finance bill. The move is bizarre because there is only one forum where the finance bill can be discussed: the Lok Sabha. The NDA has stopped that forum from functioning and it then puts forward a memorandum on one of the most crucial instruments of governance. This reveals the NDAs cheek or irresponsibility. Probably both.																														The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, completely rejected the memorandum. He was entirely justified in doing so. If he was a trifle brusque in his rejection then the opposition deserved the treatment it received. Mr Singh has taken every possible step to ensure the smooth functioning of the Lok Sabha, and these include meetings with opposition leaders including Mr L.K. Advani. But the prime ministers gestures have been returned with scant respect for decency and democratic norms. Every single assumption that underpins the working of a democratic polity has been desecrated by the behaviour of the opposition parties on the floor of the Lok Sabha. After all this to expect courtesy from the prime minister is, not to put too fine a point on it, rather rich.																														Mr Singh, as anybody who knows him is aware, is the epitome of courtesy and kindness. But even his patience and innate good breeding must also be nearing the end of the tether. Mr Singhs rejection of the opposition memorandum  and perhaps even the manner of the rejection  probably took the opposition by surprise. They saw a side of Mr Singh which is seldom, if ever, seen. Mr Singh made it clear that his politeness cannot be taken for granted especially by those who cannot honour the promises they made to him.

		 Friday, July 02, 2004 							 																						SHIFTING WATERS 							 - Seamless illusions with words				 	 River novelThe Hungry Tide By Amitav Ghosh, Ravi Dayal, Rs350As the boundaries of land and water shift and change daily in the tide country  the bhtir desh of the Sunderbans  in Amitav Ghoshs The Hungry Tide, centre and periphery merge and disperse. And at the mohona or confluence, where the fast-growing forest dwindles into a distant rumour of land, the many layers of beguilement around the word are enough to bedazzle the measuring mind. Yet if it were possible to locate a central chapter within the layers woven into his meticulously arranged 400-page novel, one choice could be Listening. In it Piya, the Indian scientist from America, passes the night on the river in Fokirs primitive fishing boat, as he sings in a language to which she has no entry. Around her play the dolphins, the subject of her research, and to which Fokir has brought her. She feels a perfect sense of contentment, listening to his voice, against the percussive counterpoint of the dolphins breathing. This moment of poise on the surface of a river, whose mood might change any instant, is interpenetrated by silences. For the dolphins, to see was also to speak to others of your kind. Together with the unknowable thoughts in Fokirs head, this silence is for Piya the invitation into the more honest world of speechless knowing. Language is merely the equipment with which to shut one another out. That is what blocks her out of Bengali  the language carries memories of her parents midnight quarrels.																														But the ebb and flow of tides allow for no still centre. For every point, there are many counterpoints, and inevitably, the moment of speechless magic is carved into a bewildering array of texts. It is a secret diary left behind for him by his uncle Nirmal that brings Kanai, master of many languages, from his home and business in Delhi to the delta island of Lusibari. For Kanai, the knowledge of languages is a richly saleable commodity in liberalized India, which needs interpreters for visiting foreign diplomats and businessmen. He also interprets Fokir and Piya to each other, although in every episode that Fokir saves Piyas life, no language is needed. What does this wordless bond have to do with love? Kanais unique gift to Piya is a translation of Fokirs song, which is also Fokirs past and the past of his land. With one mans music and another mans words, Piya feels, at least for a moment, forever torn between the two. And there are letters, and songs, and stories, lines from Rilkes Duino Elegies, rendered into English from a Bengali translation, the theatre of myths of Dokkhin Rai and Bon Bibi  read, heard, spoken, sung and seen. 																														The tension of opposites and the constancy of change comprise the structuring principle of the novel: every movement in the story is permeated with inescapable irony. Although Part I is called The Ebb: Bhata and Part II, The Flood: Jowar, it is in the first part that the movement gathers momentum, new horizons are opened, into the past, present and future, new bonds spring into being and old ones are renewed. But Part II seems almost halting at first, a little unsettled, often disturbed, and gradually rises to devastating loss.																														Ghoshs thick description never lets the reader escape the immediacy of the present, with its smell of slimy soil, water and mangroves, the fish and crabs and insects, the fearful sound of the one terrible beast that must never be mentioned by name, for to see it is to die. Yet amid all this, the physical reality of dependence in primitive conditions and the perfect symbiosis between Piya and Fokir, as one studies dolphins and the other catches crabs, touch upon the idyllic at strangely uncertain moments. 																														Different times and places cross the shadow lines around this live, antique land. Piya with her range of precision instruments, Moyna with her ambition to be a nurse and educate her child, Nilima with her thriving hospital, the urbane Kanai, confident of success in a new world, people it, as do Kusum, who is part of Kanais, Fokirs and Nilimas pasts, Horen Naskar, connecting them all, and most of all, Nirmal, whose diary and stories, whose lost dream of revolution and of writing, run like a commentary through the narrative. In the tide country, nothing remains the same. But it is here that past and present merge most perfectly. Piyas monitor, connected to the satellites of the global positioning system, captures a map of ancient memory, decades of work and volumes of knowledge, that could promise safety for the Irrawaddy dolphin. 																														Harsh histories of disappointments and violence knot the tales together. The Scotsman, Sir Daniel Hamilton, patron of Lusibari, who died in 1939, is brought to life by the now-dead Nirmal, who was arrested briefly for his leftist sympathies when still in Calcutta during the communist insurgency in Burma, and who came away to Lusibari after 1949. Morichjhpi, the other elusive centre of the narrative, is the subject of his short diary, written in 1979. That is another story, of refugees escaping from Madhya Pradesh to return to the land of rivers they love. Their strategies to give shape to a dream end in a violent conflict with government forces. But even that story is woven into Fokirs and Nirmals lives, their loves and losses. This politically sensitive space is tied in with another recurring, but transitory, centre in the ebb and flow: Garjantola, almost mythical in its ability to set free primal impulses in man and nature.																														Just as the forests are real, hostile and threatening, human relationships are taut with tension and the failure of understanding. Ghoshs story-telling is at its best, tempting the reader on as if with an unsolved mystery, focussing dramatically on edgy exchanges between unusual individuals, blending tale into tale in a vast-seeming narrative close to the Bengali tradition of the river novel. By building an almost seamless illusion with words, Ghosh himself seems to offer an ironic counterpoint to Piyas doubt: is it really folly to believe that you can see through the eyes of another being?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 23, 2004 							 																						HEART AND HOME																														What determines how long children have the right to live in their parents homes? This is not really one question, but many questions disguised as one. It is difficult to see what relevance the fact that youngsters in many countries in the West leave home at 18 could have in West Bengal. The countries where this is normal have a very different economic profile. It might also be asked which came first, the chicken or the egg: the economic, educational and employment possibilities or the leaving-home age. Or a very different notion of rights and duties bred by a far longer tradition of the nuclear family than in India. Eighteen is the age of adulthood here too. Certainly that should allow parents, who run a home, the choice of deciding whether they want their married sons family to live with them. The latest ruling on the matter by the Calcutta high court permits in-laws to turn a daughter-in-law out of their home should she displease them. This presupposes economic independence on the part of the older couple, because one of the factors holding the trans-generational family together is the sons performance of his duty towards his parents by looking after them financially when they are no longer earning. It also ignores the fact that a marriage is between a woman and a man, not between a woman and a family.																														The ruling, even according to some womens groups, corrects an imbalance sometimes caused by the implementation of Section 498A. The spiralling reports of violence against women in their marital homes had made the provision necessary. The immediate arrest of in-laws and the husband upon reports of torture or untimely death was intended as a deterrent to dowry killings. Inevitably, reports of misuse of the law also grew. The ruling by the Calcutta high court allows in-laws to push their sons wife out only if it can be proved that there has been no torture before this act. But as the womens groups have also warned, the ruling is equally open to misuse. Mental torture is not easy to prove or disprove, and the history of mental torture of women in this country gives little reason for confidence. Also, economically independent in-laws might be socially and financially more powerful than the woman being turned out. It would be fair that the in-laws then returned the dowry or any present that the woman might have brought with her. Any law, seeking to correct violence within the home, is susceptible to misuse. Cruelty, malice and exploitation cannot be legislated against. Laws and rulings will always tend to grope their way through the grey area in which human decency and mutual respect run contrary to notions of rights and duties.

		 Friday, February 06, 2004 							 																						THE WATERSHED SEVENTIES The Man Who Bombed Karachi: A  Memoir By S.M. Nanda, HarperCollins, Rs 395 The year 1971, to borrow one  of Churchills phrases, was the Indian navys finest hour.  Not only did the eastern fleet blockade East Pakistan, but  the western fleet was also successful in confining the Pakistan  navy within the harbour at Karachi. In contrast to its aggressive  posture in 1971, the Indian navy had been a mute spectator  during the 1965 India-Pakistan war. One of the principal  figures responsible for transforming the Indian navy into  a battle-hardened and aggressive war machine, Admiral S.M.  Nanda was the chief of naval staff then. 																														Nanda was born in a Punjabi middle-class family and spent his childhood in Manora, a small island near Karachi. In 1941, when the royal Indian navy was expanding, Nanda joined as a sub-lieutenant. World War II provided him with ample frontline experience. His experiences along the northern Arabian Sea and his childhood memories of Karachi served him well when he was drawing up plans to attack Karachi port in 1971. In 1946, when mutiny broke out in the royal Indian navy, Nanda remained loyal to the raj  thus saving his career.																														Just after independence, writes Nanda, Nehru was keen on building a huge fleet in order to secure Indias control over the Indian Ocean. However, the India-Pakistan war in 1947-48 and the continuing dispute with Islamabad over Kashmir caused the Indian government to go slow over expanding the navy. The 1962 India-China war forced the government to further increase expenditure on the army and air force at the cost of the navy. 																														After independence, the Indian navy had acquired some obsolete British ships for paltry sums. According to Nanda, the British government was unable and unwilling to transfer state-of-the-art ships to India. Thus, the modernization and limited expansion of the Indian navy started only after 1965 when the Soviets displayed eagerness to cooperate with the Indian navy. 																														India acquired several Osa class patrol boats from the Soviet Union. These boats had short range and were deployed in the coastal waters to guard the Bombay port. But, Nanda had plans to use these vessels offensively. When war broke out between India and Pakistan in 1971, Nanda ordered the patrol boats to be tugged with the frigates. The frigates took the boats into the Arabian Sea and then, under cover of darkness, brought these boats near the harbour of Karachi. 																														These boats then sneaked inside Karachi and attacked the installations with missiles. The biggest fuel dump of the Pakistan navy in Karachi was put on fire. A nervous Pakistan navy then recalled all its ships inside Karachi to guard the burning harbour.																														Nandas autobiography is not only rich in historical details but is also easy to read. Besides being a treasure trove for historians, Nandas lucid style will also attract lay readers.

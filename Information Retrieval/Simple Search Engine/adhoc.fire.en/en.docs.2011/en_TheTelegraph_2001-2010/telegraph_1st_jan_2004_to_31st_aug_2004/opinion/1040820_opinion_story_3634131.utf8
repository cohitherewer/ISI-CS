The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 20, 2004 							 																						SAILING THROUGH 							 - The best is yet to be				 	 Hard land A QUEST ACROSS THE SEA By Arathi  Krishna, Mayur, Price not mentioned Arathi Krishna is to autobiography  what Tiger Woods is to golf. Both have brought what was  considered a preserve of the old to the world of the young.  They also embellished their fields with their astonishing  skills. Who would have expected a 35-year-old mother of  two, working full-time at the Indian embassy in Washington,  to have the time, inclination or the wealth of experience  to write her autobiography? What is remarkable is that she  has a story to tell and the ability to tell it well. 																														A Quest Across the Sea is designed like a coffee-table book with plenty of pictures, which take the readers through her life as girl, teenager, bride, mother, scholar, official and singer. But there is more than pictures in this handsome volume, on the cover of which are the Sringeri temple and the Capitol in lovely colours, bearing a strange resemblance to each other. Krishnas book contains a wealth of material on the life and times of a young woman who, within the confines of tradition and family, ventured forth in her quest for knowledge, experience and public service. It is a kind of an introductory volume to a life that would surely be exciting in the future. Her sense of nationalism, spirit of adventure and sheer tenacity cannot but have an impact on her future endeavours. 																														The book opens with Arathis recollection of the historic election campaign in Chikamagaloor, where Indira Gandhi fought for a Lok Sabha seat after the debacle of the Emergency, two years of Janata rule and virtual political exile. For young Arathi, whose father, Begane Ramiah, played a significant role in that campaign, Indira Gandhi became a role model. The readers of this book cannot but wonder whether the author made an effort in her own life to emulate the great leader. In Arathi, we see the same grit and determination as in Indira Gandhi. Perhaps this was the most telling influence on her life. A writer has observed that creative writing comes only if there are major changes in ones life. Living a routine life, which one has inherited, does not inspire writing. A new life of ones own creation is needed to instil the creative instinct. Had Arathi lived the normal life of a Bangalore socialite, whose biggest adventure may be a gin and tonic at the Bangalore Club, she would not have thought of recording her life and thoughts. 																														But here, she felt that her experiences had something to offer to the younger women of Karnataka, to inspire them to aim beyond their immediate environment and to achieve something for themselves, for Karnataka, and for India. The thumbnail sketches that Arathi draws of her father, her husband and her children are so graphic that the reader feels they have known them before. They are people whom we come across in our daily lives, and they share one thing in common  their awareness that Arathi is a woman of destiny. Her decisions may have played havoc with their own routine and preferred way of life, but they have learnt to adjust themselves to the fact that Arathi must be encouraged to pursue the path that she chooses. That is a major sacrifice and contribution they have made. But, in turn, she makes sure that their interests are protected at all times. This dual responsibility to the family and to her ambitions makes her story heart-warming. America is a promised land for those who are on this side of the sea, but only those who have gone across know that it is not a bed of roses, particularly for those who arrive there for the first time. The Statue of Liberty is indeed inviting, but the challenges of adjusting to the fast pace of life and the bureaucracy can overwhelm anyone. Arathi finds herself there with two small children, hunting for a home, a school and other paraphernalia. 																														Relatives are there in plenty, but none are too keen to take on her problems. It is here that Arathi triumphs and sharpens her skills that help her in later life. It is a success story still in the making, but the paths are clear and she is well on her way to stardom. The university life for a young mother, attractive and alone, can be both exciting and hazardous. Arathi gives hints of the sensation her arrival created in the university and the unsolicited attention she received. It takes a lady of her determination and courage not to be distracted from her chosen quest. 																														Her focus remains unaltered and her energy is spent on caring for the children and educating herself. No wonder she sailed through her degree courses well and made the children win laurels in their schools. The story of Arathis transformation from a scholar to an embassy official is no less fascinating. 																														Her impatience with bureaucracy comes out clearly in her narration. But it is a testimony to the functioning of the Indian bureaucracy that her talents are eventually recognized and she gets recruited in the embassy. In a short time, she becomes an important member of the mission on which the embassy itself and its contacts begin to count on. She is modest enough not to claim her successes, but those who know the system can read between the lines. A couple of chapters in the book deals with the Indian interludes, even when she is fully preoccupied with her work and home in the US. 																														She finds the time and leisure to come to India, train herself to sing her favourite Kannada songs professionally and to record them commercially. 																														No less a person than the chief minister of Karnataka releases the CD at a glittering function held in Bangalore and showers praises on her for her patriotism and verve. She also brings her professors at George Mason to Bangalore and ties up arrangements for academic co-operation so that even those who are not able to go across the sea can have the benefit of quality education. She goes to the Vidhan Soudha to address her fathers erstwhile colleagues in the legislative assembly and introduce her teachers. This kind of enthusiasm for the motherland is rare among those who live abroad. 																														A Quest Across the Sea was released in Bangalore by the new chief minister, Dharam Singh, in one of his first appearances as the chief minister of Karnataka. During the event, the speakers rightly noted the historic significance of Arathis achievements as well as her book. It was noted that when the Kannada version of A Quest Across the Sea is published, Arathi will become the first lady to publish her autobiography in Kannada. History apart, the book makes for good reading just for the felicity of its language and diction. Like Browning, Arathi seems to say, Grow old along with me, the best is yet to be.						T. P.

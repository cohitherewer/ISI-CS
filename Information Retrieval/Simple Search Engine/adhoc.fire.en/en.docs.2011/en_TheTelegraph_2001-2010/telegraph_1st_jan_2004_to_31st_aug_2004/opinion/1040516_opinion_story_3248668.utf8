The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 16, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																With a little bit of help				 																																																				SIr  Anju Bobby George may be right in saying the Indian government has not helped athletes do well at international competitions (Anjus potshots at govt, May 14). But isnt Georges career testimony to the fact that this is not entirely true? Surely George could not have trained under Mike Powell, or gone to meets abroad without some official help? Perhaps with greater help she could bring home an Olympic gold instead of a bronze at the World Championships. But thats in the realm of the hypothetical. If the Indians are given the facilities athletes get in the West, will they too perform as well? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Shikha Bose, Calcutta
				 																																																				Spent force				 																																																				Sir  The election results of the Calcutta Northwest constituency are simply amazing (Blame game at Mamata hub in suicide shadow, May 15). Subrata Mukherjee and Sudip Bandopadhyay were the Trinamool Congresss two star leaders who could have won the party two seats in Calcutta. Instead they fought against each other, and Sudhanshu Sil of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) won  all thanks to Mamata Banerjees whimsical ways of running the party. Hopefully, Banerjee will learn from her mistakes and become more serious in her attempts to put together a credible opposition to the left. She must do this or there will be a vacuum in Bengal politics with the Congress joining hands with the left. But as of now, it will probably be ekla cholo re for her.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
G.D. Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjees popularity is on the wane, as Sumit Mitra rightly gauges in Ground beneath her feet (May 9). It is clear that Bengalis no longer consider Banerjee chief minister material. As Union railways minister, Banerjees populist measures of not hiking fares and introducing new trains without caring where the money for them would come from, got her some applause. But they put a question mark on her administrative skills. Banerjees appeal has also been dented by her political immaturity. Her resigning from the Union cabinet just before the 2001 assembly elections was seen as a cynical ploy to appease voters in the state who were angry at her alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Then there is her flip-flop  earlier between the Congress and the BJP, and later between supporting and withdrawing from the National Democratic Alliance. Banerjee would have done better had she worked to strengthen her party machine. The final nail in the coffin was her refusal of a ticket to Sudip Bandhopadhyay in Calcutta Northwest, a sure seat for the Trinamool Congress. The absence of a credible opposition has pushed people into voting left. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sayan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjee may be populist and an opportunist, but she has guts. A leader of her stature does not need Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The fate of the Trinamool Congress shows how one leaders arrogance can pull down a party. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mamata Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																Hocus-pocus				 																																																				Sir  The Supreme Court has endorsed the Union human resources development ministrys proposal to include astrology in the university curriculum. Given the pressures of life today, everyone wants to know about the future. This has helped many fake astrologers and tantriks make a fast buck. The teaching of astrology in universities will enlighten the new generation about this ancient science.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba 

				 																																																				Sir  Astrology as a science is obscure and dead. No one wants to study now that the earth is flat and that the planets move around it. Students today are interested in courses that will get them jobs. The introduction of astrology in universities was the National Democratic Alliances ploy to saffronize education. Hopefully, the new government that is sworn in will reverse this decision.Yours faithfully, 
Subhobrata Basu, Calcutta

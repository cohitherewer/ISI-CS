		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 							 																						SETTING THE AGENDAGiven how the BJPs vision and the NDA manifesto approximate to each other, not even its enemies will deny that the BJP now sets Indias political agenda An artist, someone said, is a person who holds two completely contradictory views and still functions. By this yardstick, the National Democratic Alliance is the work of artists. It has innumerable contradictory points of view and still functions successfully. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the head of the NDA, has become quite a master of coalition management. When the NDA began its political journey, no one gave it a long life. The obvious contradiction was between the Bharatiya Janata Partys pronounced communal proclivities and the more secular aims and aspirations of some of the allies. This contradiction was managed by putting all controversial issues on the back-burner and by concentrating on governance and development. Power served as the cement of the gimcrack coalition. Power also served to smoothen the BJPs rough edges, and to create a distance between the BJP and the more extreme wings of the sangh parivar. What nobody had quite anticipated was the change that the other constituents of the NDA were undergoing. The manifesto of the NDA is an index of this change. It is a document marked by greater self-confidence. This is clear from the manifestos intention of addressing contentious issues instead of evading them in the name of governance and development.																														The NDAs preferred way of facing controversial issues is by coming closer to the vision that Mr Vajpayee has been trying to project for his party and for his country. Thus, it does not avoid the question of building a Ram temple on the site of the Babri Masjid. But it is against making the temple a poll issue, and is in favour of a negotiated settlement between the various parties involved. This is clearly the voice of Mr Vajpayee. And this is how it should be. Mr Vajpayee is the undisputed leader of the BJP. His leadership is critical for the survival of the coalition. So it is in the fitness of things that the NDAs manifesto should bear the indelible imprint of Mr Vajpayees leadership and vision. Just as the extremists within the sangh parivar have realized that Mr Vajpayees presence is essential if the BJP is to remain in political power, the NDA too has come to accept the importance of Mr Vajpayee. The NDA has tried to bring its own programmes and proposed policies nearer to those that Mr Vajpayee espouses.																														A unified vision may be good for the coalition but may not always be good for the country. The NDA manifesto proposes that in the field of education, there should be greater focus on Indian culture. This is also an echo of an enduring BJP preoccupation. How the NDA proposes to define Indian culture will be something to watch out for in the future, if it is at all serious about this part of its manifesto. For those who have been sceptical about the BJPs sincerity  given its commitment to Hindutva  in speaking for the whole of India, have always counted on the other parties in the NDA to serve as a check. This insurance appears to be disappearing as the BJPs vision and the NDAs manifesto approximate to each other. Not even its enemies will be able to deny that the BJP now sets the political agenda of the country.

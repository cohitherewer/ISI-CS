The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 01, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Whats sauce for the goose				 																																																				Sir  Kamal Pande might be on the way to earning the eternal gratitude of millions of citizens driven to their wits end by corruption and bureaucratic red-tape (Eureka! Something rotten in Delhi, Feb 26). Administrators have tried every variation of the carrot-and-stick policy  wonder why no one had this brilliant idea before. The best part of the idea is its simplicity  remind the babus of what will happen when they themselves retire and become no better than the man across the desk, whom they now pester for bribes. Of course, the cabinet secretary is being a little optimistic because he is assuming that the bribe-takers will want to exchange immediate appeasement of greed for future hassle-free dealings with the government machinery. Or perhaps, Pandes own looming retirement is making him sentimental about the problems of the long-suffering public. What about those who are young and feel retirement is a long way off, and so theyd better make hay while they could?

				 																Muted shine				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasguptas Habit of treason (Feb 27) was enlightening. So now one must join the India Shining brigade in order to be considered patriotic. But for many Indians like me who have had a chance to go abroad and for even those who have not, India has always been shining as only ones land, its peoples and their endeavours can shine. Maybe the shine has not been a steady gleam like the shining pates of some India-shiners. Maybe it has been more like a lamp of equity amid diversity flickering dangerously in communal and global winds, or like sparkles of ingenuity in the dust of mediocrity and stifling customs. But shining without blinding us to the Bittoos living on and off arcs, rings and quadrilaterals.				 																																																				Surely such a shine is better than the one sought to be thrust into our faces by the Bharatiya Janata Party and its band of maverick writers and copywriters. Dasgupta would do well to realize that intellect is not limited to intellectuals and that a growing number of Indians are in no mood to prove their credentials by joining the choruses of India Shining. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta grasps the distorted mindset of Indias intellectuals. He is right in his thesis that Indias pseudo-intellectuals have been, and still are, a part of the problem rather than the solution. In the name of liberty, these pseudo-intellectuals lick the boots of the West and offer stones and snakes to common Indians. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta comes across as one of the most vocal supporters of the sangh parivar in the media. Take the title of the column  Habit of treason. Is Dasgupta advocating a blanket ban on traitors who openly question the facts and figures of the India Shining campaign, which cost the taxpayer more than Rs 400 crore? Or is he merely frustrated that noted economists and social scientists are exposing the chicanery of the government day after day? Dasgupta sets a bad precedent by naming NDTV and The Hindu for their apparent treason in covering anti-national events like World Social Forum and anti-Bush protests across the country. Of course he would have eulogized them if they covered the Lakme India Fashion Week instead for a full seven days. During the NDA rule, India has slipped from rank 124 to 127 in the human development index of the United Nations development programme. Dasgupta should note another startling fact  the average family absorbs nearly 100 kilograms less of foodgrain a year today than five years ago. This is unprecedented. But, there is another issue for concern  the growing intolerance among flag-bearers of Hindutva in public life in general and the media in particular. It seems that criticizing the government or even the ruling party has become treason. In fact, Dasgupta probably would be happier if these intellectuals periodically kowtowed to the government and assured the rest of the country that everything is all right. The right to dissent is hard-earned and is bound closely to the spirit of a free, modern democratic republic. The sadhus of the sangh parivar who abandoned their spiritual quest to embrace the kursi, the media pundits who abandoned journalism to become Rajya Sabha members and political leaders who engineer riot to divide society and garner votes are the threats to this spirit. It is they and not the liberal intellectuals who have betrayed their motherland. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Sengupta, Kharagpur

				 																																																				Sir Though Swapan Dasgupta intends the headline, Habit of treason, to apply to Indias intelligentsia, I feel it more befits him. Dasgupta seems to be so optimistic about Indias prospects that any opposition gets his bile running and flowing through his pen. But isnt it the medias duty in a democracy to act as a check on the government activities and provide alternative views? 				 																																																				Dasgupta cleverly tries to give the present National Democratic Alliance government all the credit for liberalization. But it was Manmohan Singh, who took the difficult decision to change the course of Indias economy. The NDA stayed with the reforms for changing course would be another hard decision. It made the easy choice, forgetting swadeshi (wasnt that what the Bharatiya Janata Party stood for?). As for Pokhran-II, I it has made citizens feel more insecure because they know that any confrontation with our neighbour could mean disaster. Earlier, we were more secure; now we are at the mercy of one mans sanity.				 																																																				Economically, we have a long way to go. And certainly, we dont have money to waste frivolously just to make some people feel good. We have many Telgis and coffingate conspirators feeling good. Rather, I think if we make the few feel good people feel bad, the nation would progress.				 																																																				Dasgupta wants everyone to go by the mood and consensus of the people. So, now that the diabolic Narendra Modi has been overwhelmingly endorsed by Gujarat, does he want the nation to exonerate him? And if anyone feels otherwise  does he disavow motherhood, mock the national mood and become anti-national?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

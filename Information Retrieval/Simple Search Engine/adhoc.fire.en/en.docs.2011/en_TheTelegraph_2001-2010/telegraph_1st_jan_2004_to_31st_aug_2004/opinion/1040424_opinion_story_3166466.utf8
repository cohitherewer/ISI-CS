The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 24, 2004  Out and About
				 																																	You may remember Tabish Khair as a poet, but the 38-year-old teacher of English at a universtiy in Denmark is now busy penning prose. The Bus Stopped  a novel by the Ranchi-born and Gaya-bred Khair  has just been released by Picador and Khair is now working hard on a new novel. This one, slated to be out next summer, is intriguingly set in the Calcutta of the late Twenties and the Bombay of the next two decades. The backdrop, says Khair, is the Partition and cinema. Its conservative and bohemian, the novelist says. Of course, one never knows, he adds. It seems to be going well, but there can be a creative hartal in the offing. Dont we know it? Fans of one Ms Roy have been waiting for a second novel for the last seven years!  Elizabeth HurleyThe Hurley girly has more to her past than meets the eye. At a Duran Duran concert in London last Sunday, fans were treated to a better sight than an ageing Simon Le Bon. An exclusive video collage of Liz frolicking in stockings and suspenders, which included a naked shower scene, made sure that people got their tickets worth. The bands keyboardist Nick Rhodes, a long-standing pal of the lady, had shot the video before she hit the Big Time. Fans arent complaining. Most think the curvier, younger Liz is a lot more sensational. Wonder what boyfriend Arun Nayar has to say. There were always certain dos and donts for Indian bahus. And a nude video is a decided dont.  Amitabh Bachchan Role Call				 																																	Big B wants a small role. Or so weve heard. Amitabh Bachchan is so taken by Shekhar Kapurs film, Mandela, that he has met its producer, and requested him for a small role in the film. Nothing has been finalised, though. Takes us back to a time when producers would do the requesting. Sigh!

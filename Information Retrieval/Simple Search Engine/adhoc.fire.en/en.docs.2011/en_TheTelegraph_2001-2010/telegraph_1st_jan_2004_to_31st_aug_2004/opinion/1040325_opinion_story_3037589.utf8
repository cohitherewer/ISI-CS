The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Whose concern is it anyway?				 																																																				Sir  There is little reason why one should join Dola Mitras ecstasy over the markets new discovery  mothers-to-be (Great expectations, March 23). Like all other sections of consumers targeted by companies for increasing their sales and profits, there is a heightened awareness of the expectant mother now  just as there is a sudden realization of the existence of teen love on Valentines Day. Had our society and country really understood the need for pregnant womens health and welfare, there would have been more emphasis on giving her free nutrition, financial support, better working hours and more maternity benefits than on filling shelves with health drinks and maternity dresses. But with a society concerned more with the gender of the foetus, such pious thoughts are a rarity. And the government would rather plead bankruptcy than pay women for having children. By the way, has Mitra ever pondered over the term father-to-be?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,J.B. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																																																				Sir  It has to be kept in mind that the situation in West Bengal, so far as the forthcoming polls are concerned, is explosive. The Election Commission does not realize that paramilitary forces are of secondary importance here (Outsiders for poll duty in Bengal, March 18). When things go wrong, the rapid action force, which is under state control, is called in. So the 150 companies of Central forces are unlikely to be put to use. 				 																																																				That poll officials have to be summoned from elsewhere is a sad commentary on the political situation in the state. In the last panchayat elections, 30 people died in poll-related violence. The police and the administration remained mute spectators to the turmoil. The same situation might be repeated this year. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah

				 																																																				Sir  The EC is bringing in poll officials from other parts of the country to ensure free and fair elections in West Bengal. But it is doubtful whether the aim will be realized. One, given the political culture in the state, how can the chances of poll personnel from outside the state being intimidated by the leftist cadre be ruled out? Two, when the voters list itself is supposed to include more names of decoy voters than those of genuine voters (as often alleged by the opposition), how can external polling officials ensure that the results are free and fair?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P. Pramanik, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Outsiders for poll duty in Bengal, shows that the EC is perturbed by the rampant corruption among poll officials either affiliated to the ruling left in West Bengal or somehow biased towards it. That the chief election commissioner is committed to stop large-scale malpractices is evident from his attempt to bring in poll officers from outside and deploy a substantial number of paramilitary forces. But to be effective, the forces have to be actively engaged in the state, not merely kept on stand-by. Yours faithfully, 
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta 
				 																																																				Sir  As the editorial, Transferred vigil (March 22), pointed out, the EC is well within its powers and jurisdiction to order the transfer of police officers in West Bengal. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has absolutely no grounds for complaint. It would have been even more commendable had the EC stopped L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday Yatra.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The ECs recent initiatives in West Bengal are unlikely to make a major difference to the poll outcome in the state. As in most states, the Left Front government enjoys virtual autonomy in its functioning. Like most parties in power, the left cannot be absolved of the sin of trying to manipulate election results. In one election, we even heard of some 90 per cent voting for the party. Such results raise serious doubts about the election process. West Bengals rulers are clever and determined. No watchdog, not even the EC, can keep them away from power.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  As per the Constitution, the EC has the exclusive right to organize the elections and it is in no way obliged to go by the recommendations of any state government or the Central government. The hue and cry raised by the CPI(M) over the transfer of three police officers is tantamount to challenging the Constitution and must be resisted. Further, it shows the CPI(M) in a very negative light. It demonstrates that under its tutelage, elections are not held, but managed.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.K. Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																Better use				 																																																				Sir  Shantanu Ghoshs letter in Double standards (March 16) only goes to establish his own pseudo-secular credentials. There is no denying that some madrasahs encourage militancy. Yet, Ghoshs sympathies lie with them, not with organizations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which he chooses to vilify.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramesh Dewan, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Shantanu Ghosh should pay a visit to remote areas in Jharkhand, Chattisgarh or Madhya Pradesh which have a substantial tribal population. Here vanavasi kalyan ashrams, run by the much-maligned RSS, are taking care of some specific needs of tribals  education, income-generation and healthcare  and makes them responsible citizens of this country.Yours faithfully, 
Banikumar Banerjee, Madhyamgram

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 24, 2004 							 																						NOT AT THE CENTRE OF THINGSUddalak Mukherjee																					The Communist Party of Indias (Marxist) decision to stay out of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government should not have come as a surprise to Indian political analysts. Given its history and the peculiar idiosyncrasies of the party, the decision was a foregone conclusion. It clearly proves that as in 1996, the hardliners still dominate over moderate figures in the 77-member central committee. By opting to stay out of the government, the left has chosen to re-write history by making the same historic blunder twice. 																					The election results have given the left its best ever mandate in recent times. Yet, this does not prove that the people of India voted left. The real reason for the lefts electoral success was the collective disenchantment with the social, political and economic policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. 																					The CPI(M) wrested three seats from the Trinamool Congress in Calcutta  a traditional anti-left bastion. This can be attributed to the common mans anger at the Trinamool Congresss tie up with the BJP. The same logic can be applied to explain the lefts success in other states as well. For Indians, the left was, and still is far from being perfect. But it was definitely more acceptable than the BJP in these elections. 																					However, this anti-BJP sentiment offers only a partial explanation of the lefts electoral success. A large section of rural India still reels under the yoke of feudal oppression. Here, the left stands as a symbol of redemption for the socially oppressed and marginalized. Its role in initiating land reforms, fighting communalism and championing workers rights still pays dividends in the market of Indian politics. By evading power, the party has betrayed the trust reposed in them by the electorate. And no criticism, however scathing, is enough to condone this deed.																					The partys aversion to assuming power at the Centre stems from its own lack of confidence. Power, especially at the national level, entails certain crucial responsibilities. The CPI(M ), traditional backbenchers in the classroom of national politics, is inept in shouldering them. The views of the politburo member, Sitaram Yechury, on disinvestment that triggered the fourth largest crash in the Indian stock market is a classic example of this irresponsibility. Used to operating in its own little kingdoms, the party lacks the skills and the experience to run the show for the nation. When history offers an opportunity (or two), it is found groping for excuses to turn tail and flee. 																					High price																					The partys unhealthy obsession with protecting its regional power bases makes it incapable of looking at the big picture. It cannot imagine entering into a tie-up with the Congress for the fear of sending confused signals that might lead to the erosion of its vote-banks in these states. Sadly, the consequences of this decision might prove costly for the CPI(M). An access to the Centre gives greater political visibility and mileage, something which the party lacks due to its regional moorings. First, this mileage would have proved invaluable in collating the isolated left movements into a united force to be reckoned with at the national level. Second, as a coalition partner, the CPI(M) would have had a better grip on Central resources  finance, technology and manpower  to augment the pace of development in West Bengal. This would ensure the completion of stalled projects in the state. Such measures would have automatically translated into votes when Bengal goes to polls in 2006. Finally, by being a part of a secular alliance, the CPI(M) would have been able to expand its fight against the spectre of communalism in India.																					One cannot say whether the party would be blessed with such a favourable mandate again. If it does, the other partners of the Left Front would have to unite and act as a pressure group to prevent the CPI(M) from repeating the same mistake. However, after being let down by the party once too often, it is unlikely that the people would be in a hurry to vote for the left.

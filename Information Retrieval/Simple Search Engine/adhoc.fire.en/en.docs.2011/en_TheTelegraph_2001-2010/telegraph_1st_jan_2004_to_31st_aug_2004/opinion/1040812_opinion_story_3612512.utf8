The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 							 																						STAR STRUCK																														It was in the stars that Mr Arjun Singh, the present human resource development minister, and Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, the previous holder of the same position, should agree on the subject of astrology. Mr Joshi introduced astrology as a subject in the university curriculum and Mr Singh, despite his virulent anti-sangh parivar campaign, has decided to retain it as a subject. Mr Singhs justification for retaining astrology as a subject is that astrology comes from astronomy. By this statement, Mr Singh has proved only one thing: he should be kept as far as possible from education. Astronomy is a science based on mathematics. Its only similarity with astrology is that both study stars. Astrology looks at stars and planets to make predictions about human affairs. The concerns of astronomy are radically different. It looks at questions like origins of the universe, it studies the relationship between time and space and so on. To equate the two is to betray a level of ignorance which is truly shocking. There is no university in the world that offers astrology as a subject and all universities have astronomy as a part of the science syllabus. The reason for this is simple: astrology is considered hocus pocus.																														But there is more to Mr Singhs decision than an exhibition of ignorance. Mr Singh projects himself as a great champion of secularism. But his brand of secularism does not separate politics from religion, and neither does it fight superstition and obscurantism. The apparent reason behind his refusal to remove astrology from the curriculum is his fear of alienating fundamentalists, especially of the Hindu variety. Astrology feeds on the weakness and vulnerability of human beings and strengthens superstition and obscurantism. By supporting astrology, Mr Singh is only fortifying those forces in Indian society that are working overtime to pull India back to medieval times. There is no reason to believe that such forces owe allegiance only to those Mr Singh has chosen to describe as fascists. Fascism breeds on the weakness of human beings, so does astrology. It is thus not surprising that Mr Singh and Mr Joshi should agree on the subject. The convergence has more to do with logic than with the movements of the planets. Certain types of minds agree on certain matters: ignorance and lack of knowledge invariably converge.

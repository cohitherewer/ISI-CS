The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 02, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Tread with care				 																																																				 Sir  The more subcontinental cricketers are treated as royalty, the more reason they have to be careful about their deportment. Take Virender Sehwags comment after becoming the first Indian to score a triple century  I dont follow records, I simply bat. Records are meant to be broken (March 29). Undoubtedly, Sehwags innings at Multan was brilliant and had the added merit of helping India win a test match on Pakistani soil for the first time. The quote, which smacks faintly of arrogance, duly made it to the front pages of most newspapers, even though it was made in all innocence. Having played international cricket for some time now, Sehwag must know that the people in the subcontinent are as quick to deify a cricketer as they are to vilify him. Now the media is running features on Sehwags speechless mother in front of his humble home in Najafgarh. But has he forgotten that after his lacklustre showing in the last world cup, he was the butt of cruel jokes which parodied a mobile phone advertisement featuring him and his mother?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Aloka Ghosh, Calcutta
				 																Ignoble 				 																																																				Sir  The theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia from the Uttarayan complex in Santiniketan has undoubtedly shocked the nation (Bengal bolts door after thieves bolt, March 27). But in a sense, the thieves have done the nation, and Bengal, a service by reminding us that we only get what we deserve, or its concomitant  if we have something we dont deserve, then we wont keep it for long. The theft is symbolic of the intellectual and cultural bankruptcy of the state and indeed, the entire nation. 				 																																																				The Nobel Prize is given to more than half-a-dozen persons every year and as such, is nothing but an international recognition of path-breaking work in certain fields. But in Tagores case, the prize meant much more. Awarding the literature Nobel to writers from obscure third-world nations had not yet become fashionable when Tagore received it. Thus, Tagores Nobel became the symbol of the first worldwide recognition of the cultural pre-eminence of a people constrained by poverty and long subjection to foreign rule. Intellectuals all over the world sat up and took note of Bengalis after this. Many even rushed to learn Bengali to read Tagores works in the original. 				 																																																				But now, all that cultural eminence is long gone. Perhaps it is in the fitness of things that the prize is lost to a nation undeserving of keeping it safe. In this connection, it is a shame that neither the Union human resource development minister nor the vice-chancellor of Visva-Bharati University has resigned over this incident, and that the communists are making much of it in the run-up to the elections. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sudipto Roy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal does not say much about the law and order situation in West Bengal, which the Left Front government always boasted of as being exemplary. The left once boasted that it was they who made Tagore a biswakabi. What does this theft say about that claim? And what of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is known as a messiah of Bengali neo-intellectualism? The rise of lumpen elements under left rule is the main reason for such incidents, as is the failure of the people to raise their voice in defence of the right and just. The latter should now act to restore the values for which the state was once fted globally.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajshekhar Banerjee, Osterley,UK

				 																																																				Sir  Over the years, Visva-Bharati University has lost much of its prestige. But this incident has really made me ashamed of being an alumnus of the university, since the theft from the very heart of the campus is clearly an insiders job. We seem to have completely lost sight of the ideals with which Rabindranath Tagore founded the university. Even now, we have not learnt a lesson  look at the political games being played over the burglary. This is a sure sign that when the hue and cry die down, the culprits will get away, unpunished.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sudip Mitra, Agartala

				 																																																				Sir  Sujit Kumar Basus Morality appeal to Tagore thieves (March 27) is an indication of his helplessness more than an instance of his following Tagores philosophy. The theft was the result of security lapses, which everyone seems to be waking up to now, after the damage is done. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Avinash Gupta, Bandel

				 																																																				Sir  Santiniketan is much above electoral politics. Hence, the Centre and state governments must work together to bring the culprits to book, at the earliest.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Seema Sengupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The theft of Tagores Nobel medal, seen against the backdrop of Indias victory against Pakistan in the Lahore one-day international, provides a true measure of India Shining. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Das, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is shameful that opposition leaders like Mamata Banerjee are staging hunger strikes instead of helping the Left Front government bring the thieves to book. Obviously, they have an eye on the coming general elections. In this connection, Visva-Bharatis plea to the thieves to return the artefacts in exchange for amnesty is futile. Had the thieves any regard for Rabindranath Tagore, they would not have committed the crime. Instead of criticizing the lapses of the state government, and administrative failures, everyone, especially residents of Santiniketan, should work together to trace the stolen goods. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  Senior security officials at the Tagore Memorial Museum are to be condemned more than the robbers. The loot will most likely land up with collectors abroad who will silently hoard the items for their personal satisfaction. Thus, the chances of recovery are slim. Ironically, the robbers seem to value the stolen items more than the Visva-Bharati authorities did.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

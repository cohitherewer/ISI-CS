The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 							 																						WHAT DO WE DO TO GET REAL? Gouri Chatterjee																					However momentous the events, stomaching the relentless onslaught of killings, beheadings, abductions, prisoner abuse, terror alerts and other such soul-curdling news that have been dominating the American papers and airwaves for months on end hasnt been easy. Even the clamour over the Clinton book has more to do with current politics than past peccadilloes, it seems. 																					What a relief it is to escape to a world immersed in delightfully ephemeral issues like BJP infighting, fees of management institutes, elections of the rich and famous to the upper house, NRI weddings and celebrity divorces. No grim headlines from which there is no escape every which way you turn.																					My friend wasnt being sarcastic. He is genuinely charmed by the cheery, quite serene image of our lives that one gets from the media here. When he wants to get real, he can always turn on the BBC or CNN or go on the net. 																					Lucky him. But what do we do to get real? The Iraq war may not be our reality, but surely something is. May be poverty? Starvation deaths? Farmers suicides? Or is it that years from now, well all remember where we were when we found out Imran Khan and Jemima had called it quits? 																					Maybe we should finally get over our fusty ideal for what merits prominence from major news organizations. Lets get real. News can be justified as anything a news operation wants to put out. And if whats treated as news also provides entertainment thats really good news. Those who dont like it can take a hike to America.																					Busy wasting time																					The government it seems hasnt enough to do. So it is busy wasting time trying to find ways and means to stop the publication of the M.J. Akbar-edited International Herald Tribune. 																					Ordering the paper to cease and desist hasnt got it anywhere. It seems there is not much the government can do to prevent a foreign newspaper from being published here if the Indian version is fully owned by Indians and if it is duly registered with the Registrar of Newspapers in India. The Midaram Publication-owned International Herald Tribune is in the clear on both counts. 																					Still, the law ministry is labouring away to clap the perpetrators of the Hyderabadi Herald Tribune into irons while the information and broadcasting ministry is mulling over a new law to plug the loopholes and make sure others dont take the IHT route. 																					Why? Because the fear that had led to the 1956 cabinet resolution banning the entry of foreign publications into India lingers. We could be brainwashed if the floodgates of foreign media are opened. As if it needed the Herald Tribune at Rs 30 a copy to win over Indian hearts and minds to the American way of life. 																					Caution with sources																					Last week, the public editor (a sort of auditor of the editorial content) of the New York Times, Daniel Okrent, reported the findings of a before-and-after (the memo) census of anonymous sources in the stories appearing in the papers main section. The result: anonymous sources had gone up slightly in the post-memo period. The story at the Washington Post was no different at all. 																					Indian editors are much smarter. They would never even bother issuing such memos. The public protestations and on-record statements of the BJP leaders alone wouldnt make the Modi imbroglio half as exciting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 17, 2004 							 																						ORIGINAL CUNNINGMr Vajpayee seems to have spoken the last word on Ms Gandhis foreign origin. But this might be just a rhetorical sleight of handIt is fascinating, as ever, to get lost in the maze of the prime ministers public utterances on Ms Sonia Gandhis foreign origin. It might even be argued that Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayees rhetorical mazes are the only verbally polished entertainment provided by the pre-poll scenario which a decent Indian voter might allow himself to enjoy without feeling politically and intellectually degraded. Indians are usually at their ugliest when they are being xenophobic. And Ms Gandhis Italian origin occasions a vicious brew of xenophobia and sexism. It inspires, in her male political opponents, an order of public speaking usually characterized by bad taste and bottomless ignorance. Mr Narendra Modis references to bovine miscegenation, and Mr Vinay Katiyars benighted muddling of epic and history (Helen of Troy caused World War II) are surely two all-time lows in democratic oratory. So the stately unfolding of Mr Vajpayees High Hindi pronouncements on the matter come as a welcome infusion of civilization and sense in the entire dispute. 																														But, like most of his public statements, the sense of having spoken the last word on Ms Gandhis foreign origin in the prime ministers Lucknow interviews is the result of a rhetorical sleight of hand. Mr Vajpayee has dissociated himself from the Modi-Katiyar brand of low, racist calumny without at all foreclosing the debate on Ms Gandhis racial origin. He has urged an end to personal attacks on individuals in the name of decency. But with bravura ingenuity, and with all the gravitas and good faith of an elder statesman, this very injunction on personalizing the issue elevates it to the level of a general principle. It takes a while to work out that this is hardly a dismissal of the matter as a non-issue. In fact, Mr Vajpayee infuses it with a new, and apparently more dignified, life by giving it the status of a national debate that must be settled in a properly democratic manner. This is what he had told a largely tribal audience in Maharashtra earlier this month  that the subject should be debated in a calm and composed manner. In New Delhi the next week, he refused to take a question on the issue, and let his finance minister clarify the difference between a commitment and a grievance against an individual. The National Democratic Alliance and the Bharatiya Janata Party are both  and the congruence is significant  committed to it, without reducing it to a personal hostility against Ms Gandhi. Mr Vajpayees Lucknow injunction on the matter is therefore in no way in conflict with either the BJP Vision Document or the NDA election manifesto. Both of them believe that the high offices of the India state should be occupied only by those who are Indias natural citizens by their Indian origin.																														To admirers of Mr Vajpayees rhetorical prowess, this will not be an entirely unfamiliar ploy. When releasing the NDA manifesto earlier this month, he did something similar with the Ram temple agenda. He said that the NDA did not wish to make it an election issue, because it was a national and public issue. This is and is not a disavowal, is and is not a closure. It takes a rare cunning to pull it off.

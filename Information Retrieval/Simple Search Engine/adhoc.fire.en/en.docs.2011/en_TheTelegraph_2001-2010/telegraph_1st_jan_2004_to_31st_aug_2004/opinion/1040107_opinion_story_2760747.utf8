		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004  DOCUMENT GENDER ANGLE TO AN EPIDEMIC  - Document  Extracts from the UNDP report HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 Changing perceptions  Specifically, indicators such  as income, asset holdings, quality of housing, occupation  and the level of educational achievement were all strongly  and positively associated with awareness of HIV/AIDS. The  study also found that the use of disposable needles for  injections in the sampled households increased with socio-economic  status.  Studies of the general population,  sex workers, overseas migrant returnee workers in Sri Lanka  all showed that HIV/AIDS awareness was much lower among  individuals with lower levels of economic and educational  achievement. Sex workers in Sri Lanka who earn higher wages  (and who were also relatively better educated) were much  better informed about HIV/AIDS than brothel-based sex workers  and streetwalkers who serve the lower end of the sex market.  This was reflected in condom use  only 44 per cent of the  streetwalkers used condoms always, compared to 87 per  cent for those who earned more.  Another study, using data from  a 1993 survey of nearly 600 sex workers in Calcutta, India,  found that condom use is negatively linked to the price  of a sexual act and positively associated with the level  of education. This suggests the key role that economic returns  and education play in the implementation of HIV prevention  policies. It is not always clear to those  engaging in multi-partner sex that sexual activity can be  safe if condoms are always used. Education and awareness  levels matter, as indicated in a recent survey of the literature  on the roots of HIV. School enrolment rates and illiteracy  rates in the majority of the developing world, and particularly  in Africa, are substantially lower than in richer countries.  Analyses of household data from Cambodia, Vietnam, Nicaragua  and Tanzania shows a strong correlation between both wealth  and education on the one hand and knowledge that condoms  prevent AIDS, of where condoms can be obtained, and use  of condoms on the other. Gender inequality: Living as they  do on the margins of society, poor men, women and girls  have to cope with vulnerable environments. Gender discrimination  and inequality express themselves in many forms across societies.  It is also established now that vulnerability to the infection  is not random, nor is the impact. These inequalities not  only facilitate the spread of HIV but they also get reinforced  in those infected and affected. There is a growing recognition  that the disempowerment of women  because of which they  have no control over decisions about their bodies or sexual  health  is largely responsible for the pace at which the  infection is spreading in this group. The United Nations  secretary general, Kofi Annan, summed up the problem in  his Report of the Secretary-General, 2001:  The gender dynamics of the epidemic  are far-reaching due to womens weaker ability to negotiate  safe sex and their generally lower socio-economic status.  Girls and young women show a higher rate of acquisition  compared to men of similar ages. The gendered face of HIV/AIDS  is integrally connected to the fact that women bear the  major brunt of the psychological, social and economic onslaught  related to loss of livelihoods, poverty and care of the  sick. Gender norms impact the way in which infected men  and women are perceived, thus influencing ways in which  individuals cope with HIV/AIDS. Effective implementation  of gender sensitive programmes in HIV/AIDS requires an analysis  of the differential political economy of risk in the region. TO BE CONCLUDED

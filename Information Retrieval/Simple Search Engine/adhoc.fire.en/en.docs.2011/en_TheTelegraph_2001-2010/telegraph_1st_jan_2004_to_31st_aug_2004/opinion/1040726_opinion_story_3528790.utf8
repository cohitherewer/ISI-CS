The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																In the name of honour				 																																																				Sir  The custom of honour killings is, to say the least, heinous (Pak row over honour killings, July 24). It is a shame that in this day and age some people are killed by their own family members when they engage in any act which may be considered shameful. It is even more shocking that learned scholars of a community condone this evil practice. We must hold on to our traditions, but at the same time, traditions need to evolve because society is not stagnant. In some tribal societies, headhunting was a common tradition even a few years back. But does that mean we can go headhunting today? If people like Sardar Salim Jan Mazari, the member of the Pakistan national assembly from Jacobabad, support murder in the name of honour, then what about the honour of human life itself? When the so-called guardians of society feel that they have the right to kill others for the sake of preserving honour, they should also remember that honour should not be at the cost of criminality.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Faizi Afzal, Hyderabad
				 																Clash of wills				 																																																				Sir  Immediately after Priyamvada Birlas death, obituaries including some from the Birla family poured in, singing paeans to the dead womans courage, talent and philanthrophy. The fact that the Birlas were raising doubts about Priyamvadas sanity a few days later, after being literally cut off without a cent, is ridiculous. It only reflects their desperation. The deceased undoubtedly had many laudable qualities. Under her stewardship, the M.P. Birla group crossed the Rs 1,000 crore-turnover mark for the first time; presently it has a turnover of Rs 2,000 crore. She has also been credited with the groups successful foray into areas like healthcare and education. 				 																																																				The fact that none of the Birla brothers was on the board of any M.P. Birla group company is a clear indication of the way the wind was blowing. Steeped in tradition, they probably thought that Priyamvada would ultimately leave the companies to one of them. But Priyamvada may have decided to give such archaic traditions the boot and pass on the reigns to someone she felt was more capable of taking the group forward. Given that most of the present generation of the Birlas have not made a success of their own businesses, she can hardly be blamed for her decision.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raja Sen, Dhanbad

				 																																																				Sir  Priyamvada Birlas stunning will has opened up a Pandoras box (Birlas pit might against outsider , July 14). But the allegations levelled against R.S. Lodha are surprising. He is a chartered accountant and knows the nitty-gritty of law. It would be ludicrous to imagine foul play on his part, since Lodha would not want to make a fool of himself. Also, there can be no problems of a moral nature since the relation between Lodha and the deceased was not just one of client and CA, but involved trust. Presumably, Priyamvada too knew the law well. 				 																																																				Perhaps the hoopla generated by the will stems from the fact that this is the first time in the history of Indian family-run businesses that the heir is an outsider. But the law does not forbid it. Why then is the media giving this issue so much importance? Is it simply because it involves the Birlas and a fortune of Rs 5,000 crore, which has been bequeathed to Lodha, despite the presence of blood relations?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

				 																																																				Sir  Legally, a person can leave her property to anybody she wants to; there is no law that the inheritor must be a blood relation. The only issues the court should concentrate on are whether the will is genuine and whether it can be executed legally.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Sanjoy Banka, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir  It is really surprising that Priyamvada Birla did not have any favourites to bestow favours on in her will. Even if the other members of the Birla clan earned her displeasure, there was her family on her maternal side who would presumably have endeared themselves to her. It would have been natural of her to leave something to them. It is on this account that the short will must be viewed with suspicion.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Birla patriarchs are unnecessarily peeved at the will of M.P. Birlas widow. They should not treat the will as a prestige issue or be swayed by the media interest in the will. Most of the clan was not much interested in the business and other interests of Priyamvada in her lifetime. Thus they should accept that Priyamvada chose to bequeath her entire estate to a professional who had stood by her side for the last two decades, won her confidence and trust by protecting and promoting her business and other philanthropic interests. If the Birlas are not unconvinced about the authenticity of the will, they should treat the matter as closed, otherwise the whole issue is likely to boomerang on them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Kumar Khemka, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Birlas anger over Priyamvada Birlas will, which has its roots in jealousy, is disrespectable to the departed soul. By moving court over the will, the Birla family has proved that it cares for money more than it does its own self-respect.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vijay Jain, Calcutta

				 																Eye candy				 																																																				Sir  The sari is in obviously because the blouse is out. Also, as is evident from the Etc article, The sari storms in (July 4), the revival of the sari, minus the blouse  or with the barely-there blouse  makes the media far happier than the wearer.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mrinmoy Prasad Goswami, Nagaon

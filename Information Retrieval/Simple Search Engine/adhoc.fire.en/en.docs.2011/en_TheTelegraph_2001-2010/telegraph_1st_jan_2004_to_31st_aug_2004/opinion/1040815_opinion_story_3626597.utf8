The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 							 																						KNOWING IS BELIEVING																														There is a peculiar irony about the right to information in this country. The Freedom of Information Act was passed in 2002 and has lain in uninformative silence ever since. The presidents assent was apparently not enough to have the act notified for 18 months. The national advisory council of the new government has decided to have a look at the amendments proposed to the legislation. There is hope in the air: the amendments will be debated and incorporated into the law soon. 																														All this sounds promising. The enactment of the act has behind it a long history of campaigning, drafting and redrafting through the years. The draft bill was presented in parliament in 2000. That came as the culmination of a determined but repeatedly frustrated struggle to have a legislation regarding the right to information, because that is one of the hallmarks of democratic functioning. The Official Secrets Act, 1923 was the bogey that for years managed to keep all thoughts of freedom of information at bay. That attempts to make amendments to this law were also foiled repeatedly speaks volumes about the lack of political will in this matter. Perhaps this lack should be construed as a presence, an active and complicit resistance to transparency. This seems to stem from a combination of attitudes, as for example, papa knows best how much information is good for them, or, secrets boost the dignity and mystery of governance, or, the security of the nation will be threatened if the uninitiated come to know too much, or even, there are just too many things better kept out of the sight of the voting populace. The feudal and colonial heritages permitted this quiet burying of a democratic right for years. The freedom of information bill was thus a triumph of sorts for the citizens groups and non-governmental organizations who had fought hard for the repeal of the Official Secrets Act and the enactment of a freedom of information legislation.																														Goa and Tamil Nadu have had similar laws since 1997, which shows that all that is needed is political will. It is possible to ask, though, to what use the laws are put in these states. But that question, of course, could come at a later stage. It is more interesting to see what is happening to the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. The amendments proposed by the council are major ones, including a change of name to the Right to Information Act. This would give the law just the right touch of constitutional correctness. The other amendments entail clarifications  of terms and phrases. The fear is that such exquisite punctiliousness may not amount to very much more than clever evasion. A government will only be convincing when it actually gives the citizen the right to access and use information independently.

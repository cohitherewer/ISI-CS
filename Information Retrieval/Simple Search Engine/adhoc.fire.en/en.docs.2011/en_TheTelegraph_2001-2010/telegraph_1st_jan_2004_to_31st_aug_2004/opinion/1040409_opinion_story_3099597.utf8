Edited by P.R. Chari, M. Joseph amp; S. Chandran, Manohar, Rs 450 
South Asia constitutes roughly 14 per cent of the total world refugee population. The causes behind their displacement range from armed conflict to political instability and economic motivations to environmental hazards among others. A comprehensive study focusing on several dimensions of displacement in south Asia was undertaken by the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in March 2002. The papers presented in the conference have been compiled into a book. 																														P.R. Charis essay in the book focuses on the conceptual aspects of refugee discourse. He makes a distinction between involuntary and forced displacement of people and their voluntary movement. This differentiates refugees from the migrants. Those who emigrate within the borders of a country are known as the internally displaced persons. But unlike the readily available international assistance for refugees, there is some reluctance among the international humanitarian agencies to provide relief to help IDPs.																														V. Suryanaryanan uses statistics and analyses the different categories of Sri Lankan refugees who enter India. The larger issues relating to their repatriation are also addressed. T. Bose offers an insight into the deplorable living conditions of the Bhutanese refugees who are stranded in Nepal, where the refugee issue remains stuck in a political quagmire. C.R. Abrar highlights on the old problem of the Burmese Rohingya refugees entering Bangladesh. He argues that Bangladesh needs to enact national refugee legislation to remove current ambiguities about their rights and relief entitlements.																														The plight of the Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh is read in Z. Ahmads essay. They had migrated to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) during Partition. But the language factor did not help them to develop an amicable relationship with the Bengali-speaking Muslim host population. Problems became more serious when the ruling elite of West Pakistan declared Urdu as the state language in 1948. Matters came to a head during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1970-71. East Pakistan split from West Pakistan and a new state, Bangladesh, was carved out on the basis of Bengali nationalism, greatly affecting the Bihari Muslims. 																														T. Ananthachari talks of the absence of national legislation for refugees in the south Asian countries. D.R. Kaarthikeyan assesses the role of various human rights organizations in India, particularly the National Human Rights Commission, in addressing issues of the refugees. 																														Causes of migration are complex and it is unlikely that population movements within the region will ever stop, especially with growing globalization which encourages the flow of both capital and labour. This book, with its specific focus, is of great relevance in the circumstances.						SUHRITA SAHA

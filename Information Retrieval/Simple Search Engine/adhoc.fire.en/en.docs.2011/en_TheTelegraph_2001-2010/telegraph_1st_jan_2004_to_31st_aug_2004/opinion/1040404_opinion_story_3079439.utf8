The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 04, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Viewership rights				 																																																				Sir  The curious regulation that entrants into the Miss India pageant should be unmarried (not even divorcees are eligible) highlights an aspect of the beauty business that Indians often overlook. And that is the frankly soft-porn nature of beauty pageants. While the objections of agitating feminists may be dismissed as out-dated or puritanical, it is only honest to admit to the sexual nature of the display of nubile women. Does the unmarried clause then relate to the inability of male spectators to fantasize about women who are clearly marked as being possessed by others?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Supriya Guha, Therwil, Switzerland
Sales pitch Sir  The television commercial for a popular bike has a lion almost attacking a boy who has come to the zoo with his father. The commercial highlights how zoos are not the places for children, for families or for animals. Looking for an afternoons entertainment, parents take their children to zoos and gaze for a few moments at the animals. Then they move on, perhaps never again thinking about the animals. 				 																																																				But consider the plight of the animals  taken away from their natural habitat, and placed in a cage a little bigger than their bodies, with nothing to do all day but have people gawk at them and tease them. Even in the best of zoos, captivity is very hard on the animals. But the animals misery is the last thing on the minds of those who visit zoos. Many zoos claim to be educational facilities, but what can we learn by observing animals who stare out at us from concrete boxes because they have been denied everything that is natural to them? Lets draw a lesson from this ad and promise never to visit a zoo.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The television commercial of a carbonated drink being telecast during the ongoing India-Pakistan cricket series, has the word, friendship, falling off a banner saying, Indo-Pak Friendship Series. Those who conceived of this advertisement were either completely irresponsible or ignorant of the role of this series in initiating the long-stalled peace process between India and Pakistan. Those who run TV channels should not be swayed solely by material interests, ignoring all social values and responsibilities.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Reshma Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why is Doordarshan telecasting this popular cold-drink ad which will embitter the masses, and is also in very bad taste? After all, in sports there are no enemies, only rivals. Besides, thus far, Pakistan has proved to be a very good host.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Tech-savvy				 																																																				Sir  Its not surprising that the young are increasingly using cell phones (Cell India grows young, March 29). This phenomenon can be attributed to many causes. The first is, of course, peer pressure, which Gen-Next finds hard to resist. The second is the SMS facility on mobiles which youngsters have found is an easy way of keeping in touch with friends and getting information like the latest news or stock market rates. On the positive side, a cell phone is a professional asset in this fast-changing world. For instance, one can always keep in touch with clients and bosses when travelling. 				 																																																				Of course, a cell phone can be a mixed blessing. Parents, especially, find it a nuisance because their children keep it on their tables even when they are studying for an exam.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

				 																																																				Sir  Getting a cell phone to do Cupids job is akin to replacing human intelligence with artificial intelligence (Cells to do Cupids job, March 18). I wonder what happened to age-old ways of expressing love like bending on ones knees with a rose in hand in front of the lover? Cells may be an aid in dating, but how will it help in loving? There are some things in life that are timeless and tech-proof: love, undoubtedly heads that list.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Suresh Behera, Ranchi

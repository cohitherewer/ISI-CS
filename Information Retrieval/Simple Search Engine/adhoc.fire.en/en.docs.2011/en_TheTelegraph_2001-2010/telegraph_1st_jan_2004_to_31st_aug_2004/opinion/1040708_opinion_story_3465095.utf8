		 Thursday, July 08, 2004 							 																						HELP LIES CLOSE AT HAND Rural development has to be achieved through depoliticized village panchayats, not apolitical NGOs, argues Ashis Chakrabarti				 	 Sign of the times																														The World Bank and bargadars. In the heyday of ultra-leftism in Bengal some 30 years back, it would be sacrilege to link the two. Now, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government sees no wrong in taking a Bank loan to enable the poorest of bargadars or sharecroppers to buy plots of land they have been tilling for their masters. 																														In fact, so anxious is the government to get the loan that it has accepted a World Bank condition which would have been an absolute no-no until recently. The Bank does not want the project  identifying the beneficiaries and reaching the loans to them  to be left to the elected panchayats. It suspects that the panchayats are so packed with members of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) that they are bound to be partisan in implementing the project. 																														So the Bank wants non-government organizations to take over the task. And the government has meekly agreed. But in a last-ditch show of defiance of the Banks conditionality, it has put forward its own condition! NGOs yes, but they have to be local. Let the unemployed local boys and girls earn some money, says the land reforms minister. 																														For all their public posturings, Bengal Marxists have come a long way since the time they would bristle at the mention of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Like most other states, Bengal now routinely receives loans and grants from the Bank, the Asian Development Bank or the Department for International Development of the British government. 																														And the conditions for such loans are accepted. It was an exceptional situation when the government turned down, three years ago, a Bank proposal to pre-judge the budgetary proposals as a condition for a Rs 2,000-crore loan for the public works department. 																														It would be fair to argue that any lender would like to know how the loan would be repaid or how the loan-induced project would be implemented. It would thus be logical for the Bank to bypass the panchayats if it is not satisfied with their credentials or capability to do the job. It is also known that NGOs figure prominently in the international donors scheme of things. There is a political philosophy that deeply distrusts governments and political parties, and would rather depend on NGOs to clean up much of the worlds mess. 																														There was a time when Bengals Marxists would smell an imperialist plot in the international promotion of the NGO movement. The fact of the matter is that, as in every other thing, there are also bad apples among NGOs. There are dedicated and efficient NGO workers slugging it out in remote corners where no governments reach. And there are NGO activists whom one usually meets at airports because they are constantly travelling  at home or abroad  at their promoters expense and there- by adding to their profiles as social workers. 																														But the Banks condition for the project to give land to bargadars brings in a much larger issue. If the Bank objects to the panchayats being controlled by the CPI(M), it should have precisely the same problem about any lendings to Bengal which has been ruled by the Marxists for 27 years. Obviously, that cannot be the Banks real objection. 																														It is more likely that the Bank is not convinced that the elected panchayats can identify the beneficiaries in a non-partisan manner. So the Bank thinks the NGOs can do the job better than the panchayats. This is precisely where the big question arises. Do the Bank and other donors want apolitical NGOs to gradually push the panchayats into irrelevance? And, are the Marxists quietly falling in line with this approach in their anxiety to get money for the badly-needed regeneration of the rural economy? 																														Some trends in other states point to this possibility. Take, for instance, the rural livelihood programmes that are being financed by the DFID in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. There is a tendency to implement these programmes with the help of agencies other than the panchayats. 																														Or the World Bank-funded projects that are being executed by the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty in Andhra Pradesh. Self-help groups from two or three adjoining villages run these micro-credit programmes by forming village organizations. A larger umbrella would be formed under the SERP with about 25 village organizations in a mandal or bloc. 																														Nothing unusual about it, one would think, if more and more people are involved in such self-help groups. The rub is that the village organizations increasingly run parallel to the elected panchayats. What is more, they are used as parallel centres of power, both economic and political. Some recent reports suggest that Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys new government is considering a proposal to close down the village organizations and hand over their functions to elected panchayats. 																														It is being said that the village organizations have become synonymous with the Banks model of rural development which bypassed elected panchayats and failed the poor farmers, and thereby N. Chandrababu Naidu in the last elections. This may or may not be one of the reasons for Naidus fall, but the popular perception about the Banks prescription for rural programmes seems to have mattered in the Andhra polls. Naidus preference for unelected village organizations over elected panchayats is now believed to have caused a disconnect between his government and the people. 																														It cannot be anybodys case that panchayats in Bengal are the epitome of efficient local government. It is no secret that the Marxists treat panchayats more as a base for political power than as administrative units. Overbearing members have often reduced panchayats to little oligarchies which serve private or party interests more than public causes. 																														The result often is very little peoples participation in the panchayati raj, except at the time of voting. The most glaring example of this is the absence of a quorum at the meetings of the gram sabha, which enables members to take decisions without having to consult the villagers. 																														That this is increasingly becoming a major problem was accepted by the Left Front government when it enacted a law last year to facilitate the formation of the gram unnayan samitis, apparently to involve more people in rural development programmes and to enlist experts in their implementation. Interestingly, these unelected bodies too would work parallel to the elected panchayats. 																														Then there is the problem of the panchayats inability to execute some projects, or to maintain the basic account books or to do other technical jobs. I am sure there are many other deficiencies of the system. 																														But I am not sure if the remedy is to undermine the importance of the panchayats. On the contrary, panchayats have to be made more participatory and more efficient in their functioning. If the domination of the CPI(M) is robbing the panchayats of their democratic character, the answer lies in exposing the Marxists misdeeds. That needs more  and not less  politics of the truly democratic variety. The supposedly apolitical NGOs are not the answer to panchayats problems.

		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 							 																						METHOD IN THE MADNESSGwynne Dyer																					The defining image of the Vietnam war was the naked little girl running down the road crying, her clothes burned off by napalm. The defining image of the Iraq war will probably be Private Lynndie England in a corridor in Abu Ghraib prison, holding a leash attached to a naked Iraqi man lying on the floor. It is the picture that best conveys the contempt that ordinary American soldiers (and the government that sent them) feel for Arabs.																					Maybe Im wrong. The American defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, told the Senate armed services committee last week that the worst is yet to come. There are a lot more pictures and many investigations underway...Its not a pretty picture. 																					But the symbolism of this one will be hard to beat. Iraqis must understand that what took place in that prison does not represent the America that I know, said George W. Bush, and he was right. Americans do not generally do this to other Americans. But it did happen in Abu Ghraib, and things like it have probably happened in American prisons in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo too. Private England and her friends may have been enjoying it too much, but the systematic humiliation of prisoners is probably policy.																					Chamber of horrors																					R2I is short for resistance to interrogation. Its a course that most military people whose jobs put them at risk of being captured  pilots, special forces, and so on  have to take. They are exposed to the full battery of techniques that enemy interrogators might use against them (keeping them naked, sexual humiliation, anything that will prolong the shock of capture and weaken their will), but only in small and manageable doses. 																					The US and British interrogators also know these techniques, and so do the thousands of ex-special forces people who now work in Iraq. Do they employ these techniques in Iraq and elsewhere? Pierre Kraehenbuehl, director of operations for the international committee of the Red Cross, said: We are dealing here with a broad pattern, not individual acts. There was a pattern and a system. The ICRC has been warning the US of mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq for over a year.																					General Janis Karpinski, who commanded Abu Ghraib prison when those pictures were taken, is being set up to take the fall for all this. She was a reservist, reluctant to challenge regulars, so she didnt protest when military intelligence officers at Abu Ghraib discouraged her from visiting the cell block where they interrogated prisoners, or went to great lengths to keep the Red Cross from visiting their wing of the prison.																					Blueprint for Iraq																					When General Geoffrey Miller, then the commandant at Guantanamo, flew into Iraq last September to offer suggestions on how to make interrogations more efficient and effective, she didnt ask exactly what he meant  even when he talked of making the prison an enabler for interrogation and said that the guards should set the conditions for successful exploitation of the internees. Now she has been relieved of her command  and replaced by the very same General Miller. This is a system, not an individuals aberrant behaviour.																					The American troops in Iraq are not cultural, political or historical experts. They are frightened and far from home, and a hundred Hollywood movies have taught them that Arabs are dirty, sly, cruel enemies of all that is good. The deliberately misleading propaganda of their own government has persuaded most of them that they are in Iraq as part of a war on terror. (Even at home, 57 per cent of Americans believe that before the war Iraq was providing substantial support to al-Qaida, and 65 per cent believe that experts found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.) And so all the rest follows.																					The pictures that have shocked the Arab and the wider Muslim world are not just about isolated instances of abuse. They are evidence of something bigger and uglier: a wilful ignorance and patronizing contempt that disfigures the entire US intervention in west Asia. We will all be paying for this for many years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 08, 2004 							 																						NO GOODIES, NO FUN Gouri Chatterjee																					Its that dreaded day again, when ordinarily enlightened adults like me will be made to feel small and ignorant. There will be P. Chidambaram painstakingly reading out Parts A and B of the Union Budget 2004-05 in his not-so Tamil accent, there will be the talking heads on the various television channels waxing eloquent on the finance ministers pronouncements and there will be me feeling a fool for not understanding what they are going on and on about. It doesnt take that long to figure out if my taxes or cigarette prices are going up or down. 																					But it must be making sense to one and all, things like fiscal, revenue and primary deficits, current account convertibility and other arcana. Surely, the mass media wouldnt devote so much airtime and print space to something that captivates only a few. Or would they?																					Id like to believe Im not alone, that most people find budget intricacies eye-crossingly dull. (Certainly few journalists really understand or even want to understand it all.) And the enormous hoopla over the budget is a huge con by the media for their own profit rather than the nations. 																					But this may be the year the balloon will burst. The noises made by the UPA government so far have been all about delivery mechanisms for the rural poor, education cess and other such worthy details that will not capture the imagination of the urban middle class the way the earlier budgets of Manmohan Singh and his finance minister did. And what price budget specials without the enthusiastic participation of the burgeoning consumer class? 																					The credit for transforming something as dreary as budgets into popular entertainment goes of course to Prannoy Roy, who did it way back in 1986, long before the mould broke in 1991.																					Manmohan Singh did it, by announcing the radical New Industrial Policy on the same day as his first big bang budget on July 24, 1991. Budgets no longer remained a mere statement of revenue and spending but became a major instrument of policy announcements too. The sort of policy the middle class simply lapped up.																					So much so that TV and newspapers were soon at loggerheads over the timing of the budget. Television was quite happy with the earlier evening speech, the legacy of the raj, with prime time audience watching the FM live, while newspapers wanted a daytime speech that gave them enough time to print larger editions and rake in more revenue. For once, print won.																					But the middle class is like me, with neither the training nor patience to fathom a budget that has no goodies for me. The moment the budget becomes a real budget, the remote will become handy.																					Profile worry																					Why are some editors (Outlooks Vinod Mehta and Shekhar Gupta of Indian Express to name two) so anxious about Manmohan Singhs low profile? Recent articles seem to be provoking the prime minister to be his own man (shrug off all the diffidence and be prime ministerial, says Gupta), to be a politician and not get so bogged down in detail, that he becomes an absentee prime minister, warns Mehta.																					This sudden concern for the politicization of a scholar prime minister is quite perplexing. Especially since they are worried the prime minister must not only govern, but also be seen to govern and be seen to be disciplining those cabinet colleagues who tend to run away with the ball. Are they worried the prime minister is not up to his job or his image managers are not up to theirs? 																					Both correct																					In Hollywood, they say, there is before Brando and there is after Brando. And the two are worlds apart. Such has been the thrust of all the obituaries of actor Marlon Brando. But Al-Jazeera website mentions an aspect of Brando that no one else does: that Brando had once accused Jews of controlling the media and particularly Hollywood. Even the Jerusalem Post is quiet on this point, mentioning instead that Brando was the first public figure in post-World War II America to speak out about the failure of the Allies to aid Europes Jews during the Holocaust. Both are correct.

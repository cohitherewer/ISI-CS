The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 09, 2004 							 																						TOO EARLY TO EXIT																														When Ms J. Jayalalithaa and Mr M. Karunanidhi agree, it is time to sit up and take notice. These two leaders from Tamil Nadu represent an unusual unity being manifested by political parties across the board. All parties, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, are against the publication and propagation of opinion surveys and exit polls once the election process is under way. There are two ways to look at this rare unanimity. In India, where elections are spread over time, the quick propagation across the country of opinion surveys and exit polls can be imagined to have a snowballing effect. One party or side may grow quickly in stature as the favourite, inducing a change of preferences  or perhaps just apathy  in those who had wished to vote for the less favoured. It could be, in a sense, an involuntary media build-up insidiously interfering with free exercise of choice. But it is not clear whether such changes really do occur, and if they do, whether they are substantial enough to influence the results. There is a further problem, and that is the other objection that political parties have. Interpretation of the survey results often varies wildly, sending out confusing signals to both voter and candidate. Even if vote-share speculations manage to come close to the mark sometimes, seat-share predictions tend to fall flat on their face. From this point of view, the suggestion of the Congress spokesman, Mr Kapil Sibal, who is against survey publications anyway, is quite fair. He would allow such publication only with full declaration of sample selection method, size, questions, together with past records of accuracy in election surveys conducted by the same agency. Fair, but complicated. It is not clear whether it is worthwhile taking so much trouble. On the other side, though, it is a real possibility that party workers may begin to feel the strain of being projected as the losers long before the actual results. 																														The BJP feels specifically that exit polls should not be published until the last ballot box has been sealed. But the general ban that the Election Commission had introduced earlier against publication of opinion surveys during elections, would obviously be welcome to all parties. But the Supreme Court had overruled the ban in 1998. According to the court, the survey sponsors were not doing anything illegal, and a ban on election research obstructed the peoples right to information and freedom of expression. There is also a question of simple logic. The same parties rooting for political advertisements in the media cannot object to opinion polls, whenever they are conducted.

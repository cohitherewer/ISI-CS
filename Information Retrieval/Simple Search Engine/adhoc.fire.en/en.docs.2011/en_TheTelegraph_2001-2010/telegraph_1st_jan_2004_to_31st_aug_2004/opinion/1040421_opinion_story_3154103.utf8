The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The son rises				 																																																				Sir  A father reviling his son as a nalayak because he feels the latter is becoming a little too popular among voters and may upstage him is not just sickening, it is unnatural (Bangarappa hurls mud, son grins amp; bears it, April 18). But it seems quite par for the course for Indian politicians. S. Bangarappa and his son, Kumar, are not the only fathers and sons who are also political rivals. Two other instances come to mind  K. Karunakaran and his son, Muraleedharan, who belong to different factions in the Kerala unit of the Congress; and M.K. Stalins struggle for control of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham whose president is his father, M. Karunanidhi. Then there is the celebrated case of Vijayaraje and Madhavrao Scindia. Even siblings have not been proof against political rivalry  take Digvijay Singh and his brother, Laxman. The nepotism and dynastic politics in Indian politics are bad enough  but one can understand favouring someone because he happens to be your relation. What is difficult to understand is such open washing of dirty linen.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ramnath Saha, Calcutta
				 																Rice in the cooker				 																																																				Sir  Condoleezza Rices much-awaited testimony was an anticlimax, especially after the tension built up by Richard Clarkes allegation that George W. Bush had been so obsessed with Iraq that he had not paid heed to the warnings of terrorist attacks that intelligence agencies had been passing on to him just before September 11, 2001 (Rice clashes with Democrats, April 10). Given the fact that Iraq hardly featured in the three-hour-long question-answer session, perhaps it seems not too far-fetched to suggest that Bush bargained with the 9/11 commission  his national security adviser would appear before the commission in public, but in exchange the commission would do nothing to damage the war effort in Iraq in the eyes of the American public. Time and again, the members of the commission alluded to a later private session with Rice. Only one member asked Rice whether she had considered tackling the terrorist problem arising out of the Muslim world through diplomacy. In answer, Rice washed her hands off any conciliatory approach, saying it would take decades to work. Perhaps, the American leadership thinks such diplomacy  which would signal to its adversaries that the United States of America was ready to see reason  is a sign of weakness. But it is also a sign of weakness to say, as Rice and Clarke have done, that 9/11 could not have been prevented. That flies in the face of commonsense. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Colin Powells admission to the 9/11 commission that his February 2003 speech to the United Nations security council was based on flawed intelligence does not exonerate the US of war crimes against the people of Iraq (Beyond belief, April 5). The UN had remained a silent spectator when Iraq was being systematically destroyed and its innocent citizens killed by the US-sponsored war on terror. Has might is right become the basis of a new world order, one which is subservient to the US? If so, is there any need for the UN to exist? Iraq was a prosperous country until the UN sanctions were imposed on it. True, Saddam Hussein was a dictator who was guilty of many wrongs. But what international law allows a country to be destroyed to remove its leader? The US is no epitome of morality to decide what is right or wrong. The people of Iraq alone can change their leader. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Colin Powell has added his name to the long list of high-ranking officials in the US who could not take any more the pressure of having to protect one great lie with scores of other lies. Evidently, the lies were meant to fulfil the Bush administrations foreign policy goal of ensuring American hegemony over Arab oil  by hook or by crook. But it remains to be seen whether the American public can digest the high cost of occupying Iraq.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The Bush administration seems to be trying to shift the blame for its blunder in Iraq on to the intelligence agencies. But the US cant hide the truth  that its war on Iraq was unjustified. The weapons of mass destruction are now acknowledged to be pieces of fiction cooked up by the war mongers. The true purpose of the invasion, it is clear, was to reshape the strategic equation in west Asia so it would suit the interests of US and Israel. There are also Iraqs oil reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia. But, the US cannot hope to achieve all this in a hurry. It cannot take the Iraqis for granted. The Iraqis want peace , stability and independence. The growing violence in the country shows this.

				 																																																				Sir  Colin Powells testimony to the 9/11 commission perhaps signals the Bush administrations resolve to withdraw from Iraq. Nobody need be surprised if, in the near future, George W. Bush apologizes to the world for his sins. He has two very good reasons for this. First, the November election and second, the April 4 encounter with Shia fighters, in which 7 American soldiers were killed. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Jaswant Singh, L.K. Advani, and others in the Bharatiya Janata Party must thank their stars that their suggestion that Indian troops be sent to Iraq was turned down by the prime minister. They must be hoping that the notoriously short public memory bails them out. For there could have been no greater folly than participating in the Iraq misadventure. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  George W. Bush resembles the director of a C-grade Hindi film  not knowing where and when to end. By staying on in Iraq, the US is further alienating the Muslims and sprouting potential US-hating terrorists. Ironically, this was supposed to be a war against terrorism!				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Richard Clarkes allegations bear out Americans intuition that there was some lacuna in the administration that led to 9/11. Knowing the painful truth will help mental and emotional healing. In future, perhaps the authorities will show greater wisdom.Yours faithfully, 
Robert E. Griffin, Pennsylvania, US Sir  The quagmire that the American faces in Iraq has an uncanny resemblance to the conundrum that India experienced in the Thirties and Forties, with these words Pratap Bhanu Mehta begins his Empires and identities (March 31). But the question is whether the US authorities felt they were bound to find an amicable solution to the question of Shia and Sunni representation in the Iraqi government, or rejoice in the hatred between the two groups which would keep the Iraqis from working unitedly to drive out the invaders. Mehta is right to hark back to British India to draw a comparison between the two scenarios. But in India too were the British unhappy that the Hindus and the Muslims were not united over the question of who would rule the country when they left? Perhaps it was just the reverse. The greater the disensions among different religious and ethnic groups in India the more breathing space they would get. Let us think for a moment what Saddam Hussein would have done to form a representative government in USA had he invaded that country. Surely we would have found him bothering to give logical representations to the Black Americans, Mexicans, Asians and the indigenous people along with the majority of white Americans. The writer voices the pain of the Indians that the representation conundrum in India ended in a tragedy. It is because the hatred between peoples there is not confined between two major religious groups only as it appears before us. In post-independent India too there have been conflicts other than Hindu-Muslim conflicts, caste conflicts for example. But does present Iraq have anything to tell the world? Perhaps. Despite provocation, the Shias and Sunnis have refused to fight each other. The writer has very aptly mentioned the empire as one which has become deeply illegitimate and concluded that we will be grateful if the (empires) dilemma in Iraq ends in a farce.Yours faithfully,
Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

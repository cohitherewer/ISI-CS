 							 - The feel-good factor is rubbing onto the car market The new big cars are the rage on the roads. And its not just the rich and the famous who are behind those wheels. Debashis Bhattacharyya reports on how even the average buyer is looking to up his image Wheel deal: More and more of such gigantic models can be seen on the city roads PHOTO: Subhendu Chaki 																														Prakash Dutta always thought that a car was just a car  no more, and no less. In the Nineties, when the 74-year-old retired government officer bought his Maruti 800, his first and only car, the last thing he worried about was its size. To him and his wife, residents of a middle-class neighbourhood in south Calcutta, the car was the ultimate status symbol.																														But that was then.																														Nearly a decade later, a car is no longer just a four-wheeled mode of transportation for his son. A car has to be big enough and comfortable enough for Prasun Dutta. Whats the point of having a car if it doesnt stand out in a crowd? Almost every other family in our apartment building has a Maruti 800 or Omni, says the upcoming executive at a multinational company in Mumbai.																														Big is in. For the upwardly mobile Indian racing to catch up with a lifestyle that had so far been confined between the covers of glossy foreign magazines, big is a sign of success. As in the US, successful Indians are increasingly getting identified with the objects they display, especially big cars, says Anjan Ghosh of the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences. Its becoming a social barometer to measure your worth in monetary terms, he says.																														And for the status-conscious  or just the comfort-loving  Indian, big is no longer beyond reach. Prices are down, loans are easily available and choices are abundant. Little wonder that the sales of big, luxury cars are on the rise in all major cities in the country.																														Cars are classified broadly into four segments. While the A and B segments, made up of small cars, have grown over the last one year by around 23 and 34 per cent respectively, the sales have jumped by 55 per cent in the C segment and by a whopping 150 per cent in the D group, comprising the likes of Hyundai Sonata, Toyota Corolla, Opel Astra and Skoda Octavia.																														Not a single month passes without some new model or variant of an existing one being launched. While Toyota Kirloskar has recently launched Camry, Daimler Chrysler has brought out S-class and C-class sedans. General Motors will soon come out with an improved version of the Chevrolet. The strong growths of the higher segments are amazing, says Vijay Chandorikar, a Mumbai-based auto analyst. Its a combination of factors including a strong economy that is responsible for this.																														If the sales of big cars are any guide, India is clearly shining, at least in metropolitan cities. The feel-good factor is definitely rubbing onto the car market, believes P. Balendran, vice-president of General Motors Indias corporate affairs.																														The car market is egging on a burgeoning middle class with rising disposable incomes and aspiring for the trappings of a higher lifestyle. A sharp fall in the prices of luxury cars, coupled with an equally steep drop in interest rates, is the main reason behind the boom. Never has it been as easy to keep up with the Jains next door.			More and more people want their cars to be different from those owned by their neighbours. All these price cuts and cheap loans have really come in handy for them, Chandorikar says.																														The buyer, clearly, is no longer only the super-rich living in the splendid isolation of a high-walled bungalow with a fleet of luxury cars and pedigree dogs. Today, it is the middle class  executives, professionals and working couples  which is buying the luxury sedans, taking advantage of the easy loans that the countrys car market is swamped with. Many of the new buyers, industrywallahs say, are ordinary people who have made good in life.																														Barely five years ago, interests on car loans, provided by different banks and financing companies, were as high as 15 per cent. It has now hit rock bottom. Private banks like the ICICI and Standard Chartered, aggressively competing in the car loan segment, are now effectively offering cars at three to four per cent interest for a maximum period of three years. They interest rate rises, but nominally, for a five-year loan. People now buy cars with EMIs in mind. They often dont mind paying a bit more for a bigger and better model, Bijoy Kumar Y, editor of Business Standard Motoring, says.																														More and more people are signing up for big cars because, as Bijoy Kumar stresses, car loans no longer burn a big hole in the pockets of buyers.																														To woo the customers in a fiercely competitive automobile market, manufacturers, too, have pitched in. They are not only slashing prices of the high-end models to make them more affordable to the buyers, they are even subsidising a part of the interest. For example, Hyundai has been giving financiers Rs 1500-2000 per car, known in auto parlance as manufacturers subvention, to help them make a little bit more money.																														But since profit margins have gone down for car dealers, aggressive marketing is on the rise. Its now a volume game for the car dealers in the country. The more you sell, the more money you make, says Manoj Mehta, deputy general manager of Bengal Hyundais showroom on Park Street, Calcutta.																														The prices of high-end models have been falling steadily for the last three years or so. An Accent, from the Hyundai stable, is available for less than Rs 6 lakh  down from Rs 8 lakh two years ago. Similarly, Marutis top-of-the-line Baleno, which was upwards of Rs 9 lakh a couple of years ago, now costs less than Rs 6 lakh.																														For those eyeing a big car, things couldnt get any better. With the fall in prices come goodies such as free insurance and free registration. The manufacturers are also ready to pay a customers road tax for five years. Little wonder old small-car faithfuls are exercising an option that they never had before. Rajesh Bhansali, a textile merchant from Calcutta, had always been devoted to small cars such as the ubiquitous Maruti 800 or the equally popular Santro. He found them convenient  the cars were affordable, easy to drive and park and consumed less fuel.																														The 44-year-old alumnus of St Xaviers College stresses that he had absolutely no plans to buy a big car in his lifetime as his Maruti 800 was in mint condition. But his resolve melted when he saw an advertisement in a newspaper last December. Hyundai was offering a discount of Rs 80,000 on the Accent to celebrate the production of 5,00,000 cars by the company. And Bhansali was sold.																														As it is, the price of an Accent had come down. So I found the offer irresistible. I lapped it up, Bhansali says.																														The charms of a big car are manifold. Not only are they more affordable than ever before, Bhansali finds that they also open up doors that the Maruti 800 driver found steadfastly barred. A member of the Calcutta Swimming Club, Bhansali says he had always hated that look of snooty contempt that some members bestowed on his small car whenever he drove up there. Now they give me an approving look, says Bhansali, only half in jest. I really relish it, he says.																														Peer pressure also forced a caf owner in Park Street to go for a bigger car. A member of the elite Tollygunge Club, he says he found the sniggers unbearable every time he drove in there in his old but good Maruti 800.																														Finally, one morning, I decided to give up my Maruti 800 for an Esteem, which has the size and therefore prestige, the caf owner says.																														In a society where every rung of success is more cushy than the one below, people are also getting used to the comfort of big cars. Just as those with air-conditioners find it difficult to endure an air cooler, or those accustomed to coolers cannot bear a ceiling fan any more, those who have tasted the comfort of a big car find that they can no longer cope with a small one.																														Businessman Bhansali, for instance, finds the bigger car much more comfortable than his old vehicle. An Accent is not just roomy and sturdy, it also gives me a sense of achievement, a feeling that I have finally arrived, Bhansali says, with a tinge of pride in his voice.																														If he ever grows tired of his Accent, he may exchange it for a bigger, but newer model in the future. But there is absolutely no question of buying another small car, Bhansali says.																														The line between the small and luxury cars  once drawn because of financial compulsions  is getting increasingly blurred. For instance, the price of a no-frills Ford Ikon is in the same range as that of Santros top-of-the-line, fully automatic model  both roughly about Rs 5 lakh. 																														Why should you buy a Santro when you are getting a Ford Ikon at the same price? reasons Bijoy Kumar. So, not surprisingly, many B segment buyers not greatly in favour of add-ons such as power windows or child-locks are now going in for the basic C segment cars that are much bigger and a lot more comfortable.																														True, the C and D segments are growing much faster than the A and B segments put together. But dont write off the peoples cars especially the Maruti 800, auto analysts warn. Since the day Indira Gandhi handed the key of a Maruti 800 to its first buyer on December 14, 1983, Maruti Udyog Limited, now owned by Suzuki, has rolled out nearly two million cars. Being the cheapest car on the Indian roads, its hold on the entry-level market remains. Small cars accounted for 77 per cent of all cars sold last year.																														Though the higher segments are poised for more growth, Maruti 800 is likely to continue its strong run in the coming years given the huge base of two-wheeler owners and a very low four-wheeler penetration in India compared to other countries, Balendran of General Motors says.																														The big cars have their downsides as well. They consume more fuel than the small cars and parking in congested cities is a headache that can only grow.																														But what amazes me is that despite the downsides, these big, luxury cars are doing so well in our country, Ashok Sinha, a senior public sector executive and a car enthusiast, says. Even Sinhas old neighbourhood in north Calcutta now boasts of cars such as the Ford Ikon and Hyundai Accent. It defies logic, Sinha, 56, says.																														The big car market, no doubt, is on a roll. Despite the fall in prices, manufacturers are making more money because their overheads remain the same. 																														Dealers are happy with the increasing sales. And the buyers are the happiest  getting luxury at economy rates. Its a win-win situation for everybody. Whoever was it who said small was beautiful?

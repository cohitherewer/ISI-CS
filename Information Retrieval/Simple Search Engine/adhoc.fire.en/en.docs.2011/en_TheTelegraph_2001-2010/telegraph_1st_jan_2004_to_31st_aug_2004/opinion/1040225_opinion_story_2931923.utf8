The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 							 																						STAY TO VOTE																														The best time for some revolutions is just before the elections. The prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has chosen precisely this opportune moment to take certain revolutionary steps. Combining startling magnanimity and equally startling self-praise, the Centre had recently released an advertisement detailing how the prime minister had restored land rights to tribals staying on forest land before December 31, 1993. A Supreme Court bench  while hearing an application by amicus curiae, Mr Harish Salve, objecting to this advertisement  has issued a notice asking the government not to implement its apparently arbitrary decision to dereserve forest land in Madhya Pradesh and Tripura. The Supreme Court has also registered its surprise at the government not bothering to approach the court before issuing these land rights, when it had been in the habit of doing so regularly when diverting forest land for public purposes like building dams. This was even more irregular in the eyes of the apex court since it had earlier refused the environment and forests ministrys request to permit regularization of all pre-1980 encroachments on forests. The courts reasons are very clear. The Centres latest bounty would have seriously adverse ecological consequences. Around 200,000 hectares of forest land may be affected by dereservation, possibly causing hydrological imbalances, water famines and other damages to agriculture. Hence, the decision  which upsets and overturns various previous decisions  will have to be stayed. 																														The problem here is not, of course, purely environmental. Those in this country who can read newspapers are being targeted by the government, with a sort of systematic, relentless and unabashed extravagance, in its media campaign to highlight the extraordinary promises and achievements of the National Democratic Alliance. An entire version of reality is being spectacularly recreated in word and image through the sheer power of publicity rhetoric. Campaigning is a normal part of electoral foreplay. But the amount of public money being spent to promote this particular assault on, or through, the media must naturally provoke ethical outrage. The entire issue of encroachments has a long and complicated history, involving a tricky balancing act between conservation and human rights. To ignore the various stages of this history and strategically announce a series of regularizing decisions not only carries opportunism beyond acceptable limits but also trivializes the very notion of tribal welfare.

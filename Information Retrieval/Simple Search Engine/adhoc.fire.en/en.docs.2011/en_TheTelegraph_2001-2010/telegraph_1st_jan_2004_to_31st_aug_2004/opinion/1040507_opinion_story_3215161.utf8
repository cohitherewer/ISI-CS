		 Friday, May 07, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Lifes many trials and errors Always Unreliable (Picador,  4.50) by Clive James brings together the three volumes of his memoirs  Unreliable Memoirs, Towards England and May Week was in June. All three are so side-splittingly funny that several critics have advised readers to desist from reading the book in public, lest attempts to suppress laughter leads to physical harm. James modestly describes himself as one who, deficient in natural wisdom, has had to learn everything by trial and error. But those familiar with his literary output and television persona would not want to trade Jamess ridiculous chain of trials and errors for anything in the world. The quality of the Australian-born Jamess humour brings to mind the Hungarian author of How to be a Brit, George Mikes, who famously observed that Continental people have sex lives; the English have hot-water bottles. Jamess years in Cambridge are his best, his inspiration is no less than Lord Byron: Byron kept a low profile in Cambridge, confining himself to booze, broads and leading a live bear around on a string. I was less inclined to hide my light under a bushel. The days of our youth are the days of our glory. He said it, and I believed it.The Craze (Century,  5.80) by Paul Southern is a tale of three lives, one night, no future, set in Manchester of the new millennium where youre only a road away from being mugged, a house away from being burgled, a pavement away from the next stolen car. This prepares the ground for a gruesome murder, which leads the reader into the maze that is the Asian underworld of kidnap, drugs and killings. The biographical note describes Southern as a founder member of the indie group Sexus and... now half of progressive bubblegum group Psychodelicates. The goings-on in gay-and-lesbian nightclubs, cab-sex, and four-letter expletives all appear, therefore, to be very authentic.Wolf trails (Oak Grove, Rs 195) by Nick Sawe is born, one understands, out of the need to reduce the gap between man and his fellow creatures  a gap that widens with every step we take to becoming more civilized. There is an agenda behind the project: to contain the irreparable damage that Brothers Grimm and other tale-tellers may have done by making the wilderness into a hostile and terrible place. Is it fair to burden young readers with such agendas, particularly since both wild-life stories and fairy-tales of the Brothers Grimm kind have their mutually exclusive appeal to them? Has anyone heard of a child refusing to keep a pet after reading Little Red Riding Hood?

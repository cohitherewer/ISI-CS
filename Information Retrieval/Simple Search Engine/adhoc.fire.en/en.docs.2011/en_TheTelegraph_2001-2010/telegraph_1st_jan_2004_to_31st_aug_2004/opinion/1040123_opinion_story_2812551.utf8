The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 23, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Fairness over pity				 																																																				Sir  Winnie Mandela boldly marched in where most women activists would be loath to tread  to the defence of the South African judge accused of raping a countrywoman and delegate at the World Social Forum in Mumbai (Winnie wades in to stand by judge in rape row, Jan 21). When it comes to rape, or allegations to that effect, women, particularly feminist activists, tend to blindly side with the woman, often without feeling it necessary to know the details of the case. In fact, it is considered politically incorrect to express ones sympathies for a man accused of rape, although the charges may not have been proved. This is not to suggest that Mandela has sided with the accused after weighing the two sides, and not because he happened to be a personal acquaintance. But Mandelas stand in a way reminds us that we need to consciously aim at fairness so that our pity for the lot of women does not come in the way of justice.

				 																Crossing the bar				 																																																				Sir  The recent thaw in the icy relations between India and Pakistan is a major breakthrough in the post-1947 history of the subcontinent (Long road to peace, Jan 14). If this development is seen from a theoretical perspective, it is clear that it points out the failure of neo-realism to explain the nature of international politics. The neo-realist contention that the anarchical system will be reproduced indefinitely and that conflict will remain endemic to the relations between sovereign states have been at the centre of recent disputes in international relations theory. The idea of reductionism, first proposed by Kenneth Waltz, maintains that international anarchy embroils all states in an endless struggle for security and power which often culminates in war. But the latest development in Indo-Pak relations proves that the international system can be transformed by reconstituting exclusionary political communities. And to bring peace it is necessary for people to rein in their tendency to resort to violence at the slightest provocation. Pratap Bhanu Mehta is correct in saying, therefore, that the organization of power in Pakistan needs to be transformed because power in Pakistan is still institutionalized with those who have a stake in violence.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  There is room for scepticism on Indo-Pak relations, because peace moves have proved deceptive on several occasions in the past. To expect a speedy solution to the problems that exist between India and Pakistan will be nothing less than dreaming of a utopia. Right now, Pakistan faces a lot of international pressure, especially from the United States of America. But Pakistani hawks, many of them in the army, are not likely to egg the peace process on. Besides, there is the possibility that the fundamentalists might scuttle the moves. The jihadi groups operating from within Pakistan have links with international terror networks and do not function at the sweet will of the moderates on any side of the border. Though Pervez Musharraf is trying to promote his image as a peace broker in the hope of earning plaudits from the West, he cannot ignore the anti-India lobby in Pakistan for too long. Therefore, India needs to be cautious and realistic at the same time. For the time being, however, common people in the two countries can take heart from the fact that Indo-Pak relations are moving.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K. Basu, Calcutta.

				 																																																				Sir  Besides Kashmir and terrorism, India needs to capitalize on four secondary issues with Pakistan. These are the issues of fishermens maritime boundary in the Arabian Sea (ideally it should be fixed at 24 degrees north latitude), Sir Creek (the dividing line needs to be shifted to the Indian bank of the creek), Wullar Barrage (it should be constructed as a joint venture), and Siachen glacier (India must unilaterally withdraw its forces from this much-hyped glacier of little actual value). As the four named issues get resolved, the atmosphere for discussing Kashmir will gradually become conducive. This can finally lead the two countries to accept the only pragmatic solution, that is, to convert the line of control into a formal border. The Shimla Agreement needs to be trashed since it is something of a glorified fraud. The Track Two initiatives should be intensified at the same time through student exchange programmes, resuming sporting ties and so on. The combined effect of all this is bound to strengthen the people-to-people contact, which can in turn put pressure on the political establishments of the two countries. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Pakistans decision to invite the deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, to work out an extradition treaty between India and Pakistan has made the clock come full circle. While it is heartening to know that Pakistan is ready to take action on the list of 20 terrorists (which includes Dawood Ibrahim, Masood Azhar, Hafeez Saeed and Syed Salauddin) wanted by India within the ambit of a mutually-agreed extradition treaty. 				 																																																				Ironically, Pakistan had prepared its own list of Indias Most Wanted about a year ago which included the name of Advani, allegedly for having conspired to assassinate Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan and other top leaders of the Pakistani movement in September 1947. Now that Pakistan has put the United Nations resolution about a plebiscite on Kashmir on the back-burner, will it also delete Advanis name from the most wanted list? Given Advanis role of spoilsport after the Agra summit meeting between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf, Pakistanis may still bear a grudge or two against him.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

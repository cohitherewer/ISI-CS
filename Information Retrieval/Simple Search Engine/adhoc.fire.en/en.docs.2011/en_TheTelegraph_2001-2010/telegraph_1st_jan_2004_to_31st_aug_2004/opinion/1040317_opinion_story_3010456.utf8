The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 							 																						MAN WITH A MISSION In the South, as elsewhere, L.K. Advanis yatra has been tuned to the partys aim of garnering more votes among the liberal Hindus, writes M.R. Venkatesh				 	 Road show																														If the senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, felt elevated at Kanyakumari, the countrys southernmost tip, before setting off on his Bharat Uday yatra on March 10, it was for more reasons than one. The feeling was probably inspired not merely by his visit, earlier in the morning, to the Vivekananda rock memorial and the Thiruvalluvar rock memorial. It also had a lot to do with the strategic re-thinking going on within the BJP in the run-up to the most crucial general elections it has faced.																														Advani took everyone by surprise when he ignored security concerns and took the regular ferry to both memorials to pay homage to Vivekananda and the great Tamil bard. Unwittingly, it helped him send out the signal that the BJP, at least from the pragmatic viewpoint of fighting the elections, was not confining itself to its core nationalist Hindutva agenda. 																														Replying to questions from reporters on whether he thought Vivekanandas teachings were still relevant, Advani pointedly answered that although each philosophy had its own context, Vivekanandas views had a lot of content which is perennial. The sage was, Advani said, a kind of supreme philosopher, whose philosophy had an everlasting and universal applicability. 																														In the same breath, Advani did not fail to mention how Eknath Ranade, founder of the Vivekananda Kendra, had taken the initiative in the Sixties to build a memorial on the rock on which the preacher had meditated for days before setting sail for America in 1893. In a subtle way, Advani thus sought to act as a bridge between the hardcore Hindutva constituency of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the more liberal sections of Hindus. 																														This tenuous balancing act was again in evidence when, before commencing his yatra in a luxury bus, the deputy prime minister paid glowing tributes to the great Tamil nationalist poet, Subramanya Bharathi. 																														Referring to the Vivekananda rock memorial, Advani said that it was a symbol of Indias unity and her priceless spiritual heritage. The words, undoubtedly, were carefully chosen. Soon, Advani had moved on to hail the Tamil tradition as being an integral part of the Indian heritage. C.N. Annadurai was declared the greatest leader to affirm Dravidian pride. M.G. Ramachandran, and the present Tamil Nadu chief minister, J. Jayalalithaa, as a courageous inheritor of the legacy of both Annadurai and MGR, also came in for generous praise by Advani. The reasons for structuring Advanis discourse in the South in a certain order are not hard to seek when one remembers that the yatras primary political goal is to project the BJP as the party of governance and development which is destined to come back in the next Lok Sabha. 																														Another interesting fact was that despite M. Venkaiah Naidus perception that the deputy prime minister was re-inventing the tradition of the yatra undertaken by the Adi Shankaracharya from Kaladi to Kashmir, Advani did not strain the metaphor by over-use. Instead, Advani preferred to recall his earlier Swarna Jayanti ratha yatra, undertaken in 1997, during the course of which he had visited the birthplaces of patriots who had fought in Indias struggle for freedom. Advani recalled how in Tamil Nadu he had paid homage at the birthplaces of Veera Pandiya Kattabomman, Subramanya Bharathi, V.O. Chidambaram Pillai and Kamaraj Nadar. Significantly, Veer Savarkar was mentioned as just one of the many patriots in that long and illustrious list.																														Knowing full well that in Tamil Nadu the politics of alliances works more along caste lines, Advani refrained from touching on any of the contentious national issues like Ayodhya in his roadside meetings in the state. His focus was on the achievements of the Vajpayee regime in the last six years. He also cited how the Congress, despite having the peoples mandate for half a century, had failed to translate swaraj (self-governance) into suraj (good governance). The issue of the foreign origin of the Congress president was used only sparingly. In Nagercoil, famously known as the Kamaraj constituency, Advani was more enthusiastic about pointing out how the BJP had come to represent the nationalist sentiments of Kamaraj in the Lok Sabha.																														Again in the textile city of Coimbatore, rocked by a series of bomb blasts in February 1998, Advani pointed out how the BJP was able to rise to the challenge of religious fundamentalism and extremism by politically winning over the constituency. In places like Dharmapuri, Advani was more at home discussing cricket. He likened the parliamentary polls to a cricket match between Australia and Bangladesh whose results were a foregone conclusion.																														While defending the inclusion of a host of film stars and cricketers in the BJP, Advani even argued at one place that the BJP was not trying to rope them in. They wanted to join the BJP as it was seen as a good party, just the way the Congress was looked upon during the freedom struggle.																														The occasional high-decibel rhetoric notwithstanding, the tone and tenor of Advanis campaign in Tamil Nadu were a clear indication that the BJP was wooing the liberal-minded sections of society. But what has prompted this new line of thinking in the BJP, a party whose strength in the Lok Sabha rose from two seats in 1984 to over 181 in 1999, primarily on the basis of Ram and Ayodhya? 																														A senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader from Tamil Nadu threw some light on the question. Since 1984, when the Ayodhya issue was on the boil, the BJP had steadily improved its representation in Parliament, and won a maximum of 181 seats in 1999. However, the party was entangled in a coalition with regional allies at the Centre. The only way to expand the party base and aim for a majority was to look to the Hindu liberal vote. And that is what Advani is doing now, explained the VHP leader. What remains to be seen is whether this search for more votes and the larger concerns of development and governance are mutually exclusive.

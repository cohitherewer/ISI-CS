The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 10, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Spotting glory where there is none				 																																																				Sir  Ruchir Joshi is absolutely right about English scribes (Reversing the swing, July 4). In a country desperate for sporting glory, minor achievements tend to be lionized in the press, often with disastrous results. Henmania is nothing but hype over a player who has never reached a Grand Slam final. Most ridiculous is the analogy between a footballing neophyte like Wayne Rooney and Pele. Not surprising that a series victory over a depleted Caribbean team is enough to guarantee England the third place in test cricket ratings, so what if the team hasnt won the Ashes in two decades. Let the British press bask in their imagined glory, British sports will continue to languish.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Abhinav Dasgupta, Calcutta
				 																Road to hell				 																																																				Sir  Feroze Ahmed and Yasmeen were my neighbours. The whole neighbourhood mourned their death, part of a divine plan or cruel twist of fate, but inevitable, as we all inexorably move towards the same absolute (Wheels of death roll on young couple, July 3). Twenty years ago, when I came to live in Miajan Ostagar Lane after I got married, my immediate neighbour on the south had a bubbly girl of five or six named Yasmeen. She grew up before my eyes, got married to a handsome, hardworking man and had two lovable girls. Her diligent father converted their tiled hut into a beautiful three- storeyed house, one of the few legal buildings in an illegal concrete jungle, like an oasis of pure sparkling water amidst the scrub and thorn of an ash desert.				 																																																				As she was the only girl among four siblings, Yasmeen and her husband and kids were much adored, and she mostly spent her days at her parents. Their elder daughter, Afreen, is a bright, chirpy girl and has got admitted to Loreto Entally. The younger daughter, Ayesha, is a sweet, cuddly baby. I would see them throughout the day, through my bedroom windows, playing, watching TV or calling out from their first floor balcony for their Papa, who worked just below. While I write, I still catch glimpses of them playing around. I can hear their joyful laughter and the pitter-patter of tiny feet, or Afreen reciting her alphabets. Early mornings and late nights are now marked by little Ayeshas heartrending cries for her mothers loving caress. Yes, since last Friday, everything has changed. Their parents are no more, the children are orphaned. Behind their laughter and games, there is a sadness. A dimness has descended upon the neighbourhood. Many are oblivious to it, but they are not to blame. A pitiful eye is all we can afford to give, each clutching on to what one holds dear, helpless before forces beyond us.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asma Mohiuddin, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Lives of ordinary citizens are being snuffed out with alarming regularity on Calcuttas roads by demons which are private buses. Most of us are not aware of a system introduced by private bus unions which penalizes any bus which deliberately slows down to pick up more passengers, and thereby denies the second bus following it on the same route its due share of passengers. The first buss driver and conductor have to pay some money to the unions who hand it over to the driver of the second bus. The amount may be as little as Rs 50, but that is enough for both sets of drivers to race against each other. The media need to make the public aware of the dangers of this system. It is not without reason that more private buses run over or fatally injure people than state-owned ones do. Also, the punishment for running over a person needs to be more stringent than three years in jail. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vandana Rathi, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Till the end of June this year, some 212 lives were lost on Calcuttas roads. Not that this has made the state administration sit up and take note. Cant we have exemplary punishment for a few killer-drivers so that it puts the fear of god in the minds of their fellow-drivers?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The death of a young couple under a speeding bus is a grim eye-opener to the pathetic state of traffic and transport on Calcutta roads. The root of the problem is that unlike in other metros, traffic rules are seldom observed  or strictly implemented  in this city. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S.S. Adhikary, Uttarpara

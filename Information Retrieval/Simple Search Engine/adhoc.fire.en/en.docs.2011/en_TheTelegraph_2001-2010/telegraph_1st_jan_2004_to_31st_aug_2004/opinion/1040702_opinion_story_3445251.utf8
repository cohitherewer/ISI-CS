		 Friday, July 02, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Surely that was Tuscan sausage?The bride stripped bare (HarperCollins,  3.99) by Anonymous is an elaborately framed  an anonymous writer writing about a woman presenting her vanished daughters secret journal/novel  piece of fiction on sexual candour. The matter is further complicated by the book disclosing its writers identity as N.J. Gemmell at the end, and appending a great deal of publicity material about her. What relationship can survive the harshness of absolute candour? Gemmell asks in her final letter to the reader. She also reveals here that her book was inspired by a mysterious 17th-century feminist text called Woemens Worth and by the answers she got on asking her 15 closest (presumably female) friends a single question: Whats one thing you absolutely love a man doing to you during sex and whats one thing you cant stand? The result was a book about about a Good Wifes sexual awakening outside marriage. This is a Vogue novel with a Fifties feel to it  Brief Encounter gone rather out of hand. Fun to read, but ultimately predictable.A place to live: Contemporary tamil short fiction (Penguin, Rs 250) edited by Dilip Kumar compiles short stories from Tamil Nadu written over four decades, 1960-90. The translator, Vasantha Surya, invokes, in his note, a picturesque Tamil word purloined from English, adjistment, which reflects both the contents of the stories and his principle of translation: This Tamilized term evokes not only flexibility in the practical world, and making the most out of of a given situation, but also a whole philosophy and rationale of survival and acceptance. The chosen writers include Ki Rajanarayanan, Ambai, Sujaatha, Thi Janakiraman and Na Muthuswamy. The deceased knows nothing of it, but he is dressed in a new muslin jibbah and veshti, with three finger-streaks of holy ash upon his brow, as he lies stretched out in final slumber. (Aa Madhavan)The marshal makes his report (Arrow,  3.15) by Magdalen Nabb presents the Florentine marshal-in-chief, Salvatore Guarnaccia, smelling something distinctly fishy in the Palazzo Ulderighi. A member of one of the oldest noble families in Florence has died a mysterious death. Everybody thinks it is suicide, but if the Marchesa has not killed her husband, then who has, wonders Guarnaccia. He could smell the hot toast with garlic, oil and salt, the crisp, wafer-thin pizza with rosemary scattered on it  and surely that was Tuscan sausage?

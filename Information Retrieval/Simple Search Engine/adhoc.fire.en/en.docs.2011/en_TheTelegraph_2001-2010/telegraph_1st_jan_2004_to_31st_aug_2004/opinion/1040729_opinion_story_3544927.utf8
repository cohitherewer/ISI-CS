The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 							 																						GOING PLACES Issues like deciding on the venue for peace talks will become minor problems once the Nagas begin speaking in one voice, writes Nishit Dholabhai 				 	 All clear																														After the fuss over the venue, which has now been shifted to Chiang Mai on the Myanmar border, the 12th round of peace talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) is scheduled to begin today (barring last-minute glitches). With it, the issue of the integration of contiguous Naga-inhabited areas has once more gained centrestage, as also the public movement back home by the NGOs. But that is not all. The NSCN(I-M), apparently, also wants to gauge the public opinion in Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Ostensibly, there has been serious rethinking within its own ranks, as well as within the NGOs which have been insisting on peace and a political solution to the Naga problem. But with politicians dragging their feet on the issue, the need for a breakthrough has become all the more important.																														From the travails of the footsoldiers of the Naga National Council in the jungles of Myanmar and China, the movement has come a long way. The theatre has moved to plush rooms in Amsterdam, Tokyo and Bangkok where talks are held. Following the division of the NSCN in 1988, the power equation also shifted in favour of the NSCN(I-M), even though the Khaplang group continues to militate against both the Isak-Muivah faction and New Delhi from time to time. The ruling Democratic Alliance of Nagaland agrees with the NSCN (I-M) ideology, although the Congress continues to obfuscate the issue of the unification of Naga areas while insisting on the unification of Naga factions. 																														In all these years, however, another potent force has emerged on the scenario  the print media. Newspapers, particularly the preferred English-language dailies, have become vehicles of ideas and arenas for heated debates. Once the magic aura of the underground motivated young boys to join the movement for the freedom of the Naga nation. Not any more.																														How many governments are we going to pay? asks a government employee in Kohima, referring to the three underground governments of rebels. She insisted on being called a Naga while addressing this correspondent as an Indian. That subtle difference was perhaps also on Atal Bihari Vajpayees mind when he said Nagas have a unique history. Be that as it may, the strong will to find a solution to the complicated problem refuses to leave the Nagas.																														What is being discussed by most today is the veracity of the demand for political sovereignty by some rebel groups. Some admit that India can ill-afford to give in to the demand. But there are also others who feel that getting absolute independence for a land-locked region could be impractical, but not impossible over five more decades. They are also averse to NSCN (I-M)s brand of socialism which, they feel, by internationalizing the issue, is creating more hurdles. Incidentally, Nagas are part of the United Nations Indigenous Peoples Organization.																														Meanwhile, new buzzwords like economic independence are being heard, and they are likely to be the new agendas for the public opinion drive in the near future. The church, which has been a constant influence on the daily lives of the people, will be one of the first to be consulted while trying to gauge public opinion. 																														Last year, at the Naga Day function on May 16, a young speaker from the Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights spoke on the new world order and political sovereignty versus economic independence. Ironically, the programme was organized by the Naga National Councils Panger Walling faction which insists on political independence. Both NNC and the NSCN (Khaplang), which have been largely ignored by New Delhi, have been targetting political sovereignty. The NSCN(I-M), ever since the ceasefire agreement was signed in 1997, has been insisting on the integration of Naga-inhabited areas. This has captured public imagination though not without the attendant fears of some tribes imposing their hegemony over others. For New Delhi, the worry in this matter has chiefly been Manipur, which has been violent in its protests against the integration of Naga areas. Imphal burned in 2001, and threatens to erupt again over the issue.																														The strongest advocate against sovereignty, former chief minister and senior Congressman, S.C. Jamir, is now in Goa as the governor. It was his argument that integration is part of the 16-point agreement which included Nagaland into the Indian Union in 1963. So far, four resolutions have been passed in the legislative assembly on the integration of the Naga areas into a single administrative unit. But Jamir has been opposed tooth and nail by both NSCN(I-M) as well as many in the present government mainly for being a self-confessed Indian nationalist. 																														The NSCN thinks Jamir is a hurdle to the peace process. Politicians like the present chief minister of Nagaland, Neiphiu Rio, have castigated him for the Congress booklet which states that the Nagas were never a nation in history. Jamir has countered NSCN(I-M)s integration demand by saying that the government of India has anyway not honoured the 16-point agreement. The former chief minister insists that all sections of the Naga people should be consulted on the Naga issue, a suggestion which has invited criticism of his being in favour of the Khaplang group. Rio, on the other hand, is now drawing flak for allegedly toeing the NSCN (I-M) line. Which all means that politics and rebel politics in Nagaland continue to remain intertwined in spirit, if not in letter.																														Who will effect the breakthrough then? The NGOs who fight for peace and know what goes on in the collective mind? Perhaps. These civil rights groups will continue to be depended on by both the state government as well as political parties. Jamir may be an anathema to them, but his idea of having a convention of people of differing ideologies within the single Naga society to find a solution is well-received. It must be kept in mind that integration is dear to the Nagas, it is equally dear to the Meiteis in Manipur who have had the hill districts as part of the state for decades.																														The idea of an honourable and lasting solution may just be beginning to take root in the hill-top Naga villages. But all this will bear fruit only if there is a genuine concern in New Delhi about the honour that Nagas have for themselves deep within. As for changes like upgradation of peace talks to a political level or retaining the Mizoram chief minister, Zoramthanga, as a mediator and talking in the South Block instead of Bangkok, they will remain minor matters when the Nagas start talking in one voice and New Delhi starts to think about true federalism.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Promises to break				 																																																				Sir  Renunciation does not work in Indian politics unless one is Sonia Gandhi or a part of the sangh parivar, in which case one can even be made chief minister. Digvijay Singh is thus to be more pitied than ridiculed for going back on his vow that he would not hold public office for 10 years after his party lost the assembly elections (Digvijay learns politics too small for two sanyasins June 22). The sad part of Singhs career is that his present misfortunes has absolutely erased the memory of his earlier achievements. When he led the Congress to victory in the 1999 assembly polls, he was the only Congress chief minister to hold fort when Congress satrapies elsewhere were collapsing. Also, no one can deny that he has done a lot to pull Madhya Pradesh out of its Bimaru status. A few bad roads do not take away from that record. Singh has impressive achievements to bolster his quest for public office. A vow made in the first flush of disappointment should not be held against him.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Sumana Pal, Calcutta
				 																No one listens to Vajpayee				 																																																				Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Partys decision to continue with the Gujarat chief minister brings to the fore the gradual marginalization of Atal Bihari Vajpayee within the party (Party keeps Atal waiting, June 21). Vajpayee could have ousted Modi when he was prime minister. His sudden eagerness to oust Modi now only substantiates his detractors claim that he is seeking to divert attention from the real reasons of the BJPs defeat in the elections, which were chiefly fought on his governments achievements and his personality. In any case, Modi is BJPs experiment with the electoral politics of India. Considering the religious composition of India, the secular mindset of most of the country, and the BJPs intention of spreading its influence to the whole of India, not just Gujarat, this grand experiment was and is bound to fail. So, today or tomorrow, Modi will have to go, when the BJP considers him an experiment that has gone on too long.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dhrubajyoti Ray, Hooghly

				 																																																				Sir  Thanks to the glorious uncertainties of elections, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has not been allowed his place in history. A little over a month ago, Vajpayee had the entire BJP eating out of his hands. And yet today, minions in the party have started roaring against the man whom they had lionized during the elections. 				 																																																				But it was speculated even before the elections that the BJP wanted Vajpayee only in the eventuality of having to form a coalition government, because no other leader would be acceptable to all of its National Democratic Alliance partners. Today (and if the BJP had got a majority on its own), Vajpayee is dispensable. The hard-core Hindutva side to the party, which Vajpayee had kept covered by the secular, liberal facade for five years, is now raising its head once again. 				 																																																				It would have been better if Vajpayee had resigned as a member of parliament after the BJP lost the elections. He could have retired with his head held high, and the people of this country would have continued to hold him in high esteem. His secular and statesman-like image, the BJPs mascot before the elections, is today a liability for the party. But if Vajpayees credibility is diluted, the BJP has also harmed itself by showing its true colours.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R.B. Easwaran, Chennai 

				 																																																				Sir  Those who were rejected by the people are being made ministers or are making it to parliament through the backdoor by being nominated to the upper house. On the other hand, there is a demand for the removal of Narendra Modi  the chief minister of Gujarat. Since Modi had secured the verdict of the people of Gujarat in no uncertain terms, it is they who must reject him. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hilda Raja, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been rightly called the right man in the wrong party (Atal fedup, Advani junks moderate line, Jun 24). He should either retire peacefully, or join or form a party with like-minded colleagues. The real culprits for the BJPs electoral debacle have joined hands to make him the fall guy. If the ideologues within the BJP think that Hindutva can make them win over people, why did they fail to solve the Ram temple issue in spite of remaining in power for five years? Those who coined the slogan feel good factor which provoked such anger among the people, were responsible for the defeat. The Mahajans and the Naidus must come out of their air-conditioned rooms and go to the villages where rice is still considered a luxury. 				 																																																				It is true that the Vajpayee government did well to take the foreign exchange reserves to astronomical levels, enhance respect for India among foreign countries, improve relations with Pakistan and improve the industrial climate. But isnt it too much to expect any appreciation of this from the 80 per cent of the population whose primary concerns are food, drinking water, roads, education for their children, jobs and a roof above their heads? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
G.D. Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The BJP should realize that its Hindutva ideology has played itself out. The strategy of putting Narendra Modis dismissal on hold, so as to do well in the forthcoming elections in Maharashtra, will not work. The verdict of the 2004 general elections has clearly shown that the people of India will not back a communally-divisive agenda. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Preeti Chaturvedi, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has rightly pointed out that the BJPs electoral debacle can be explained by its loss of support among its traditional voters as a result of its deviation from its main ideology. Narendra Modis role in the BJP defeat is confined to his use of indecent language against Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, which even sensible BJP voters could not digest. In the presence of so many secularist parties, the BJP cannot expect to get the bulk of Muslim votes. The party is making its position still worse by projecting a tired and retired Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is legion for flip-flop on contentious issues, as its leader. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

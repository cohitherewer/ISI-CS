The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 							 																						DROP THE PACKAGE Malvika Singh																					Delhi is groaning under the pressure of intense heat and humidity and the government is groaning at the thought of having to waste its time dealing with the NDA and its endless boycotts. Watching the scene in the capital is much like witnessing a drama enacted by old people playing political games in their second childhood. Juvenile. Serious concerns and possible solutions to overbearing problems have no place in this arena and there is no way the people of this country will respect the present negative attitude and stance of the opposition. 																					The one relief these days is the low key image of the prime minister and his government. Thank the Lord we are not inflicted with poetry and prose, endless chatter about where our leaders are partying, pompous platitudes about breakthrough policies, a string of mindless promises, computer-generated dreams of an utopia with no root in reality. The packaging of government and its achievements, the barrage of gloss and hype had begun to pall in this struggling environment where water and electricity, even in Delhi, were huge problems, let alone elsewhere in this blighted country. Thankfully, there is no overload of those myths anymore. We are finally being treated like adults, and not morons being spoon-fed with some glib slogans.																					Different styles																					To read in the newspapers that our former deputy prime minister spoke in Gujarat about how politics and religion cannot be separated clarified the BJP-position on this issue. It is important for political parties and their leaders to spell these issues out clearly and emphatically so that constituents can make up their minds to either support or reject the particular ideology. The earlier dispensation was trying to play a game of being moderate, whatever that was supposed to mean. There was a lot of double talk, a strategy used to disorient people. The party itself got so entangled in its contrary and confused rhetoric that it lost ground. The people saw through this game. Today, Advani is at least attempting to put the beliefs and ideology of his party out there, honestly, hoping to generate support and resurrect its fortunes. Clearly, the BJP is reverting to its original agenda. Whether this country will accept its ideology or not, only time will tell.																					Delhi is grappling with a new ism of government functioning, the Manmohan Singh style. Traditional Congress darbaris are at a loose end  they do not seem to be able to get their work done for their agents through the ministries. Manmohan Singh is steadily transforming the earlier ethos and cleansing the operation of government. A sense of order and integrity seems to be entering the system. 																					Strange games																					The division of political work and governance seems to make eminent sense. Those cynics who do not know what to attack Sonia Gandhi for ever since she has rendered their animosity towards her ineffectual, have decided to spread the word that she rules Manmohan Singh from behind the scenes. The less said about this kind of petty and silly criticism, the better. Juxtaposed with this attempt to reorganize a system that had muddled the two functions over the years, the NDA is playing its own rather strange games. By refusing to participate in Parliament committees, are they are trying to subvert the democratic framework?																					If the NDA continues to behave in this anarchic manner, it will again alienate the people of India. To think that Indians cannot see through this kind of posturing is condescending and therefore insulting. Surely their definition of nationalism/Hindutva does not mean dictatorship, where dissension and contrary opinions are unacceptable? It will be a sad, ominous and dangerous day for India if the opposition defies and betrays democracy.

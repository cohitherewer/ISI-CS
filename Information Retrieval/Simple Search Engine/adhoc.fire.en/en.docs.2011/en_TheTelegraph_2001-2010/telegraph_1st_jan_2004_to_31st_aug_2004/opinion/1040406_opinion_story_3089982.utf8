The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 							 																						POISON CITY																														It is easy to underestimate the magnitude of the West Bengal governments failure and treachery with regard to pollution control in Calcutta. The government has managed to push through a regulation  based on monitoring the tail-pipe emission of vehicles  which effectively reverses the judiciarys persistent efforts to hold the state responsible for providing Calcuttans with cleaner air. The ugly combination of gross ineptitude, lowly cunning (bordering on deception) and murderous callousness characterizes the governments modus operandi in this matter. This is not only an administrative failure or a political sleight of hand, but also an act of profound bad faith. It must never be forgotten that what is at stake here is as basic as the citizens bodily health. It is, indeed, frightening to think about what it means for the people of Calcutta when the government feels nothing but relief at having pulled off its Bharat-II trick.																														Nowhere else in the world, or in India, has pollution control been reduced to simply checking tail-pipe emission. By spiriting away any possibility of conversion to cleaner fuel and technology, West Bengal has ensured that its efforts at pollution control remain farcically cosmetic. Moreover, there are still ridiculously few emission-testing centres, and most of the existing ones are under-staffed, under-equipped and corrupt, selling pollution under control certificates for a fee. It might be recalled that Bengal was the first to submit, a couple of years ago, the roadmap for conversion to liquid petroleum gas. The status quo regarding air pollution in Calcutta also represents an orchestrated failure, with the traffic police, public vehicles department and pollution control board throwing up their hands in merry unison. What is particularly shocking now is the spirit in which this is being done. There is more glee than shame, and the sense of having found the most advantageous way of getting around a nasty problem. And this is what gives to the whole matter a criminal dimension. The state government has decreed a slow death for its people, and it knows that it will be allowed to get away with it.

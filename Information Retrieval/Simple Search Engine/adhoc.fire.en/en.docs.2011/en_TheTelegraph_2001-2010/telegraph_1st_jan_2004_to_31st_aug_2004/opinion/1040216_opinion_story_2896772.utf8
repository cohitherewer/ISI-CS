		 Monday, February 16, 2004 							 																						A LITTLE MORE INVOLVEMENT 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Talk about it																														Effective responses: changing the dynamics of gender relations: As long as gender inequality exists, womens rights and opportunities to resist the infection, to assert their reproductive choices, to demand safer sex and to support their families will be threatened and the epidemic will grow in scope and impact. A range of policy-makers and service providers need to take up strategic gender interests and power dynamics to seek effective solutions. Some of these steps would include: creating gender-specific information in simple language; providing gender-sensitive individual and group counselling services; providing widespread sex education services and programmes with adolescents; sensitizing and training healthcare professionals; imparting more information to the affected groups on womens rights; empowering women through capacity building interventions; involving men as partners; and ensuring that programmes encompassing care take into account the fact that women have no support and care facilities, and providing adequate care and support services.																														Possible Policy Initiatives on HIV/AIDS...Collection and quick dissemination of relevant data: Given the current low prevalence rates of HIV in the countries of south Asia, it is most cost effective to track prevalence through selective surveillance systems that will monitor changes in HIV/sexually transmitted infections and behaviour in the vulnerable groups where the disease tends to be seen early on. Any policy intended to gather HIV data from select groups must be accompanied by confidentiality and by effective communication to the public in order to reduce stigma and to avoid the sense of complacency that the epidemic is associated only with the groups from which data is obtained 																														Demonstrate strong leadership, through commitment and action, and foster networks of leaders drawn from all levels of society, who will work together to address the underlying causes of HIV/AIDS and revolutionize responses. Pioneering leadership by governments is essential for containing the epidemic at national, regional and global levels...																														Reinforce commitments to the Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS principles. This will also involve the provision of substantive resources and support to national and regional organizations, groups and networks of people living with HIV/AIDS, as well as to civil society organizations that work to support and empower those vulnerable and marginalized communities most affected by HIV/AIDS... 																														Encouraging political, social, economic, religious and cultural leaders to openly discuss HIV/AIDS with their constituents. UNAIDS and others speak of breaking the silence that surrounds HIV/AIDS, sexuality, and inequalities that drive the epidemic...																														Adapt lessons and examples from other countries in the region and Africa. Policy- makers and opinion leaders need to be aware of the impact of HIV/AIDS on families, communities, business and nations in other countries in order to understand the grave proportions the problem can assume if not tackled.																														Learn from NGOs that have been active in prevention and care...Their experiences are invaluable guides for informing policy-makers and for strategic planning.																														Include consideration of the causes of HIV/AIDS in the design and implementation of all socio-economic projects. This will be especially important for the region where the epidemic is growing rapidly. This issue especially needs to be a part of any reconstruction programme in Afghanistan and in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran. TO BE CONCLUDED

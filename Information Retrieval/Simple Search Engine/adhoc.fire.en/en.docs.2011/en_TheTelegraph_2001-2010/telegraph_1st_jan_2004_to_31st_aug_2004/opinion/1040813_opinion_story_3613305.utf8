The emphasis on gender is not to pit women against men as special victims of globalization but to address concerns like womens empowerment, health, work conditions, food security, and so on. 																														This volume is a compilation of papers read out at a seminar on Globalizing Women, organized by the School of Womens Studies, Jadavpur University, in February- March 2001. The papers by Amiya Bagchi and Ashok Mitra, the opening lectures at the seminar, touch upon various aspects of globalization. The rest are divided into two sections titled, The Political economy of globalization and Globalization and culture.																														Madhura Swaminathan, whose essay figures in the first section, writes that the burden of deprivation  in income, food or health  is generally put on women. Food security, she argues, can be achieved only if there is an efficient public distribution system that provides a minimum quantity of food at reasonable prices. But with globalization, there is a cut in subsidies, leaving distribution to the market. Such a policy is of more concern to a woman than to a man, because the responsibility of providing food to the family falls on her.																														Asish Ghosh shows how globalization has an adverse impact on women agricultural workers. Women have traditionally wanted to increase the production of food crops. But international aid agencies and governments promote cash crop production. This has led to a change in ownership of land from community to large private or government holdings, and a concomitant process of mechanization which goes against the interests of rural women. 																														Utsa Patnaiks article examines whether globalization is a euphemism for a new kind of economic imperialism while Rama V. Baru looks at the working conditions of medical, paramedical and ancillary staff in private hospitals in Indian cities. With the increasing privatization of healthcare in a largely unregulated market, the work conditions and wages of workers are poor. This has implications not only for the employees but also on patient care. Often poorly trained persons are employed to reduce costs.																														The articles in the second section deal with cinema, music, advertisements and forms of popular culture. The articles here emphasize that globalization in culture does not mean a random one-way domination of the West. Nilanjana Gupta shows how globalization leads to a kind of regionalism or going back to the roots. She illustrates how popular Bengali cinema is a repository of values placed in direct opposition to the global set of values.																														Deconstructing advertisements, Arpita Guha Thakurata posits that the project of globalization reconstructs the image of woman so far as she is required to perform certain ascribed roles in the national economy, without violating existing gender hierarchies. In fact, advertisements are effective sites for resolution and negotiation of the conflict between nationalism and global cultural imperialism. Mihir Bhattacharya too deconstructs ad films to show how the female body becomes a commodity in the project of modernity that globalization offers. In this context, Malini Bhattacharya looks at rural cultural forms to show how the rural woman artist has to negotiate and compete with the global market.																														This volume will be of interest to those researching globalization and gender. However, since they are part of a seminar, not all of them display the same academic rigour. FInally, the editor misses out on the contributors introduction, including her own.						SUHRITA SAHA

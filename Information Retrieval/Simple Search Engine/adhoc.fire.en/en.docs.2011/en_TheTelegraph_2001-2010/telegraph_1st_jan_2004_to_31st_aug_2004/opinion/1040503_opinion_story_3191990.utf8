		 Monday, May 03, 2004 							 																						NEW BRICK																														BRIC stands for Brazil, Russia, India and China. An October 2003 paper by Goldman Sachs attracted a lot of attention because it stated that by 2050, the BRIC economies can together be larger than the Group of Six (the United States of America, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom). Much of this growth will be in India and China, with India exhibiting stronger long-term growth potential than China. Indias per capita income will cross $17,000 (in todays dollar terms) in 2050 and be around $2,300 in 2025. The Indian growth will be based on productivity gains, demographic transition and exchange rate appreciation. Goldman Sachs has now followed this up with another paper, titled India: Realizing BRICs Potential. This is presumably timed to set out Indias reform agenda. There is a virtual consensus on the agenda. Differences that remain are about priorities, focus and sequencing. Consequently, no remarkable insights are expected from the Goldman Sachs list, which focusses on openness, sound macroeconomic policies, education and infrastructure. The original BRIC report did not project a spectacular gross domestic product growth in the next 10 years. The average was around 6 per cent, lower than the 8 per cent the tenth plan projects for 2002-07.																														With improved infrastructure and education, Goldman Sachs argues that Indias growth can indeed increase to 8 per cent and per capita income in 2025 can touch $4,200. A contrast is also drawn between Chinese and Indian reform experiences, with China possessing a head-start of 10-15 years and Chinese growth being driven by manufacturing, in contrast to Indias service-sector growth. Goldman Sachs argues that Indias comparative advantage in off-shoring will continue, thanks to an English-speaking workforce (7 per cent of the population) and flow of knowledge workers. This means growth in accounting, financial services, medical services and pharmaceuticals, in addition to information technology. The point is made that expansion of the IT labour workforce, with supply outstripping demand by 2008, will keep wage inflation pressures in check. However, even if India accounts for a significant chunk of US off-shoring, that will add up to 1.5 per cent of Indias labour pool. And even if service-sector employment increases to 107 million in 2007 from the present 2,002 million, new job creation will only be 5 million and employment in agriculture will continue to be 190 million. Indeed, the complaint of omission in the Goldman Sachs reform agenda, which also covers transaction costs of doing business (entry, exit, clearances), is about the rural sector.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 							 																						WORKING AT FEVER PITCHDiplomacy / K.P. Nayar				 	 New frontiers																														The photographs said it all. They were a study in contrast, more so since they appeared on the same day. One showed an unrepentant, far from contrite Enron founder Kenneth Lay, once Kenny Boy to George W. Bush, being led away in handcuffs by the FBI to hear his indictment in a court of law. Lay is perhaps the only corporate tycoon to have threatened an Indian prime minister the way heads of conglomerates in the West often threaten and armtwist tin-pot dictators in banana republics in Africa and Latin America.																														The other photograph showed a beaming Goh Chok Tong, Singapores prime minister, as comfortable with Manmohan Singh as he was at home with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and, long ago, P.V. Narasimha Rao. When Goh steps down from prime ministership in a few months, he will do so with the satisfaction that he restored the umbilical cord that tied Singapore historically, culturally and geo-politically with India. That cord was broken in the Seventies because of the ideological and myopic policies of successive Indian governments. 																														No foreign leader since Nikita Khrushchev, who visited India in December 1955, has been able to excite his own people or Indians about a bilateral relationship the way Goh has mobilized Singaporeans and Indians into creating an enduring partnership between their countries. More than a decade ago, addressing his people on National Day, Goh promised an India fever in Singapore.																														If Goh reflected on what he had done with India as his aircraft took off from Delhi to Teheran on Sunday, he would have been convinced that his achievement has been truly remarkable. What makes the turnaround in relations historic is that, more often than not, it has been made possible in spite of the Indian government, not because of it.																														Yes, it is true, tiny Singapore is now the third largest foreign direct investor in India. The second place belongs to Mauritius, but it is no secret that very often there are aspects of investment from Mauritius which are conveniently overlooked and questions not asked about the source of funds from this offshore centre. So, it could be said that Singapore has the second place as far as genuine foreign direct investment in India is concerned, second only to the United States of America.																														Goh stirred up an India fever in Singapore when India was gingerly embracing economic reforms in the early Nineties. Some of his fellow-leaders in the Association of South-east Asian Nations warned Goh that he would regret the decision to turn to India to promote a whole new concept in regional economic integration. Today, some of those leaders regret that they did not join Goh.																														When Goh and Rao jointly unveiled their plans to open up India for business from south-east Asia, Singapores investment in India was next to nothing. By 2002, Singapore ranked eighth among foreign investors in India. This years figures place it at an impressive third.																														The new face of Singapore-India relations is not just about sound economics. Goh made it possible for India to find its political and strategic way back into south-east Asia without loss of face. The import of this is difficult to grasp for those who are not aware that full ASEAN membership was offered to India in the Seventies and that Indira Gandhi rejected it because she considered the emerging Asian Tigers to be mere puppets of Western imperialist powers.																														If it were not for Goh, India would have had to wait, along with Pakistan, until this year to become a member of ASEAN. There would have been no India-ASEAN summits either, at least not as long as Mahathir Mohamad and Suharto were in power in Malaysia and Indonesia. All this is not to say that Singapore-India relations have been a one-way street. It would be stretching credulity to argue that Singapore has not benefited from the relationship as much, if not more than India. 																														Kenneth Lay, by contrast, represents everything that has gone wrong with Indo-US relations, which too began a metamorphosis around the same time that Indias relations with Singapore became open to change. Some may argue that Lay is an extreme example of the Ugly American image, immortalized by the 1958 runaway bestseller which prompted Dwight D. Eisenhower to reform US activities abroad. Notwithstanding that argument, the contrast is important because it explains a lot about why Singapore has succeeded in India while the Americans have, by and large, failed in comparison.																														Lay is no longer Kenny Boy to Bush: he is merely Mr Lay. On Sunday, the wife of the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, went so far as to say on CNN that she had met Lay only once, in passing. All the same, a week after Lays indictment, it is illuminating to recall a threatening letter that he wrote to Vajpayee.																														The date on the letter is September 14, 2001, three days after the terrorists attacked the Pentagon and destroyed Manhattans twin towers. It would be reasonable to assume that someone in Lays position would be part of the national salvage and healing operations after the attack, but not the Enron founder.																														Our experience would indicate that contracts with governmental authorities in India really do not seem to represent anything more than a starting point for a later re-negotiation, and are broken by Indian governmental authorities whenever and as often as they prove inconvenient or burdensome, Lay wrote to the prime minister. Contract-breaking by Indian governmental authorities has become a tactical device to be used wherever and as often as commercial and political circumstances may dictateNo one should complain later if that causes severe prejudices to Indias attempts to solicit foreign investment or capital.																														Then, he proceeded to threaten Vajpayee with sanctions against India There are laws that could prevent the US government from providing any aid or assistance or other things to India going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of US companies.																														The trouble is Lay is not an exception. Robert Blackwill, when he was US ambassador to India, whined about American trade flows to India being flat as a chapatti instead of doing something about it. His successor, David Mulford, was insensitive enough to ask at a farm event  one of his first public engagements after presenting credentials  that India should open up its agriculture sector, conveniently forgetting the huge subsidies that support American farmers.																														It is impossible to imagine Goh or any of his ministers, his ambassador in India or even heads of Singapore conglomerates being anywhere nearly as insensitive. It is instructive that an early vehicle for Singapores successful capital inflows into India was Parameswara Holdings, into which the city-states government had put seed money, but it was entirely controlled by Singapore Indians. Singapore, moreover, has been patient, nudging India, but never putting pressure. Not even when Indian attitudes to business proposals have sometimes been maddeningly frustrating. Which is all the more reason to celebrate the present state of Singapore-India relations, which could easily serve as a model for bilateral engagements elsewhere.

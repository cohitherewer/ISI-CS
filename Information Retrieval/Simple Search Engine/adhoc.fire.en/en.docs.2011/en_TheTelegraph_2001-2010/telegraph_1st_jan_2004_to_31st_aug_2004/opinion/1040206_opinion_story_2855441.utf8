The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 06, 2004 							 																						AIDS NO HELP FOR WOMEN Peter Piot amp; Emma Thompson Peter Piot is executive director of UNAID; Emma Thompson is an Oscar-winning actress and a steering committee member of the global coalition on women and AIDS																					Mrs Nyakumabors husband died of AIDS in 1998 and left her HIV-positive with five children. Her in-laws grabbed household items and took over the house and land she had helped pay for. Mrs Nyakumabors father-in-law called a family meeting, told her to choose an inheritor, and ordered her to be cleansed by having sex with a fisherman. She refused, causing an uproar. She now struggles to meet her familys needs, and her slum landlord has threatened to evict her because she cannot always pay rent on time.																					Mrs Nyakumabors story (her name has been changed) is one of the hundreds collected by Human Rights Watch and other organizations documenting the stripping of property rights in the wake of AIDS among some of the most vulnerable people on earth.																					The global fight against AIDS has been endorsed by all UN member states, and declared a high priority at countless summits. Resources are being mobilized, programmes to extend life-saving HIV treatment to the developing world are being mounted and HIV prevention, which currently reaches fewer than one in five of those who need it, is also on the agenda.																					But as long as women and girls are unable to enjoy education, property rights, freedom from violence and economic security, progress on the AIDS front will pass them by. Women make up about half the global HIV epidemic, and in Africa, they are well over half.																					The ABC slogan  abstain, be faithful, use a condom  is the mainstay of many HIV prevention programmes. But for many women, this message has no purchase. Where sexual violence is widespread, abstention or insisting on condom use is not a realistic option. 																					Nor does marriage provide the answer. Across the developing world a majority of women will be married by age 20, and have higher rates of HIV than their unmarried, sexually-active peers.																					Burden of care																					Women also bear a disproportionate share of the burden of AIDS care. In poor households, the presence of an AIDS patient can absorb a third of all household labour, most of it by women.																					The knock-on effects of the plunge in household income caused by AIDS is often to pull children out of school  and girls are the first to go. 																					The answers to reducing womens vulnerability to AIDS clearly lie deeper than the use of slogans. To address AIDS effectively, we first have to understand how women are being treated and why. A comprehensive strategy is needed to boost girls access to education, strengthen legal protection for womens property and inheritance rights, eradicate violence against women and girls, and ensure they have access to HIV care and prevention services.																					Tackling these inequalities is not just a matter for women. Men too need to declare zero tolerance for violence against women, be committed to their daughters education and help alleviate the burden of care.																					Moves are under way, for example the global push to achieve education for all or the campaign by the World Health Organization and UNAID to ensure that three million people in the developing world have access to HIV treatment by 2005 and that half are women. But more is needed, and more urgently.																					To this end, UNAID has pulled together the high profile Global Coalition on Women and AIDS, which gathers activists, government representatives, celebrities and community workers committed to improving the lives of women and girls.																					The call to empower women is not new, but AIDS makes it more urgent. Millions of women around the world were already facing a lifetime of hard labour. AIDS has turned it into a death sentence.																					The skills, knowledge and resources to relieve women of the devastating burden of AIDS already exist. What is needed now is the political will to see that they are applied.

		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 							 																						RUPEE TRICKS																														What does the Reserve Bank of India propose to do about the rupee? Since the exchange rate is market-determined, this may seem a meaningless question, but it is not. The market is still a narrow one and subject to Central bank intervention. Barring sporadic episodes, for several years, the RBI has indulged in one-way intervention  that is, buy dollars to prevent the rupee from appreciating, but to preserve Indias export competitiveness, allow the rupee to depreciate. This is for secular trends, as opposed to short-term intervention to cushion volatility or curb speculation, although the difference between the two is not always evident. Such RBI intervention has led to a build-up in reserves, with foreign exchange assets (minus gold and special drawing rights) now crossing $105 billion. Forex assets are held in different currencies. Since the dollar has depreciated, cross-exchange-rate changes also affect the reserve figure, expressed in dollars. The RBIs analysis of increase in forex assets by $26.4 billion from April to December 2003 shows that $ 5.4 billion is because of such valuation gains. The rest is driven by a current-account surplus and capital-account inflows through foreign institutional investments, non-resident deposits, external commercial borrowings and short-term credit. 																														Some of these flows can be perceived to be volatile and speculative, and are, in principle, capable of reversal if the rupee appreciates. However, no matter how one defines the volatile component, the magnitude is not more than $50 billion. Hence, the balance of payments is comfortable. The issue of efficient use of these forex assets is distinct. Assets have often been boosted with offered rates of return in excess of 8 per cent, but have to be invested in safe avenues with returns less than 2 per cent. Purchase of dollars by the RBI implies pumping rupees into the system. Given the paranoia about inflation, this is an unattractive policy option, and sterilization has involved sale of government securities. But the RBI has run out of marketable government securities and there are not enough market-stabilization bonds. While dollar demand can be increased through further trade and capital-account liberalization possibly after the elections, in the short-run there is no option but to allow the rupee to appreciate.																														The finance minister seems to want this, since rupee cost of oil (and non-oil) imports will be reduced. However, there are question marks about whether the 13 per cent dollar growth in exports will be sustained if this happens, although what is important is not the rupees behaviour vis--vis the dollar, but against competing currencies. With rupee appreciation, trade liberalization will also become more difficult, especially because tariffs are also being reduced through free trade agreements and in the absence of value-added tax, complete countervailing duties to compensate industry for domestic indirect taxes are not possible. There are thus no easy policy options. As a consequence of India Shining in the external sector, the country has to learn to live with an embarrassment of riches.

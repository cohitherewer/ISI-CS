		 Sunday, July 25, 2004  Fare enough!
- Government has promised a policy to boost LCAs Its a dogfight up there in the skies  as Air Deccan spreads its wings. And the real victor will be the passenger. Debashis Bhattacharyya reportsIt was a little after tea-time, and H.K. Patel was feeling a little peckish. So when the air hostess, resplendent in her pale-blue airline uniform, wheeled the food trolley down the aisle, Patel viewed it with some interest. The passenger on an Air Deccan flight to Vadodara early this week picked up four items and was about to tear open the wrapping of a cake when stewardess Natasha intervened. Sir, she said. The Bhavnagar-based businessman, returning from a visit to Mumbai, looked up, knitting his brows. The flight attendant held out her right hand and asked for Rs 100. What for? the middle-aged man barked. He looked stunned when she told him he would have to pay for the snacks. Patel refused. All airlines offer food free on board, he argued. Not true, countered Natasha. In any case, she pointed out, she had announced minutes after take-off that the airline would provide food or water only at a cost. The businessman wouldnt hear of it and refused to pay or return the food items. A row broke out  the kind you often witness on a crowded train. On a plane flying at 16,000 feet, however, the sight of a passenger squabbling with the crew over a piece of cake was novel. But then, you cant really blame the businessman for not knowing what a low-cost, no-frills airlines  such as Air Deccan  is all about. The LCAs  as the low-cost airlines are known in aviation parlance  may be a major hit in the West, but Indians are only just beginning to get to know about them. For Air Deccan is the first such airline to hit the Indian sky. The LCAs fly you cheap in smaller aircraft  and as fast as any full-service commercial airliner  without providing the passengers with amenities. No food, no drinking water, no newspapers on the flights. If you are looking forward to being warmly tucked into a blanket with a soft baby pillow, look elsewhere. For when LCAs say no frills, they mean no frills. A slew of low-cost airlines, in the pipeline now, is expected to take off the ground in six months to a year, altering the conventional wisdom that only the rich and elite can travel by air. The sky  slowly but surely  is beginning to open up to the Indian middle-class. And the engine of change is the low cost airlines. And for the passengers, air travel can only get cheaper. As the Bangalore-based Air Deccan, the first Indian low-cost airline to hit the sky and capture popular imagination, spreads its wing across the country, murmurs of change can be heard across the aviation industry. The leviathans have begun to stir. Indian Airlines, Jet Airways and Air Sahara have all started slashing their fares one way or another. When a new entrant disturbs the existing fare structure in the industry, incumbents always move quickly to protect themselves, says Cyrus Guzder, CEO of Air Freight Limited and an aviation expert. By cutting prices  so far restricted to apex fares targeted at leisure passengers buying tickets in advance  Guzder says the full-service carriers are issuing a warning signal to the low cost airlines that it would not be easy for them to corner the market. None of the airlines, of course, ascribe the fare cuts to the arrival of low-cost airlines for obvious business reasons. Airline executives, however, acknowledge that the low cost airlines could drive down prices further and would play a major role in determining the fare structures in the entire industry in not-too-distant a future. They are not yet a threat to us as only one of them is in operation now, a senior Indian Airlines executive says. But they could become a potential threat in a few years since several low-cost airlines are expected to operate in the country by then, the official says. In both Europe and the United States, new low-cost airlines are attacking the big incumbent network carriers. Experts believe that some of the bigger, high-cost airlines may not survive in the long run. Most of the LCAs have a common modus operandi: they have a single-type fleet of planes, fast turnarounds, they use cheap and secondary airports, have no frills on board and offer enticingly low fares that rise only as a flight fills up. In the United States, years after the deregulation in 1978, low- cost carriers have seized control of the domestic market. The cost advantages enjoyed by low-cost carriers are striking. The US aviation industry was badly hit after September 11, 2001, with six of the largest network carriers struggling to stay afloat as they slashed costs even as capacities were reduced by one fifth.Though the number of passengers has risen since then, revenues remain flat. Airlines find that they cannot raise prices despite an increase in fuel costs in the face of stiff competition with the LCAs. Only the low-cost airlines, including Southwest, JetBlue and Frontier, are expanding in the US. Its no different in Europe, where Ryanair and EasyJet reign supreme. Network carriers like BMI and British Airways are trying to reinvent themselves, offering low seasonal fares. They have also taken to selling tickets directly through the Internet like the low-cost carriers, cutting out to some extent the travel agents and their commission, which account for nearly 15 per cent of an airlines cost. Its started happening in India as well. Both Jet Airways and Air Sahara have just slashed fares by 30 to 40 per cent for apex fare passengers compared with last months prices. Passengers would have to buy tickets in advance and meet some other requirements to avail of the cheap fares on offer, but tickets have never been this cheap. A Calcutta-Delhi return ticket, for instance, only costs Rs 4,500. We wanted to make air travel affordable for the middle class. Now even these big full-service airlines are cutting fares. It only helps our mission, Raju Srinivasan, chief business coordinator of Air Deccan, says with a chuckle. Announcing the fare cuts, Rono Dutta, president of Air Sahara, said recently that he wanted to position Sahara as a high-quality, low-cost carrier. Thats our goal, the former president of the United Airlines, one of the largest carriers in the US, says. Aviation experts stress that the high-cost airlines across the world are now trying to bring their cost down and pass on the benefits to the passengers in their efforts to compete with the low cost airlines. Though India has not completely deregulated its aviation sector, a shift in policy has taken place in recent years, benefiting private airlines. The most significant measure was the Centres decision to waive landing charges for aircraft having less than 80 seats a few months ago. The Centre also reduced by 40 per cent the route navigation facility charges for an aircraft with less than 80 seats. The low-cost airlines are the biggest beneficiaries of the move since they mostly use 48-seat aircraft such as the French-made ATR42. The government decision definitely gave us a boost since the landing and parking charges in India were among the highest in the world, Srinivasan says. The crucial Naresh Chandra Committee, formed to reform the aviation sector, recommended special measures to boost the low-cost airlines to popularise air travel in the country. You could never popularise air travel unless you encourage the LCAs, Chandra says. As of now, India does not have any specific policy on low cost airlines. But this could change come December. Civil aviation minister Praful Patel has promised a new aviation policy by year-end, based largely on the Naresh Chandra Committees report submitted last year.But it may not be easy. The proliferation of LCAs is fraught with difficulties in India which woefully lacks infrastructure, especially airports in different cities. Congestion is already a major problem in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore airports. Even Air Deccans first flight to Surat could not land early this week because the airport was not fit for landing.Curiously, aviation was the last thing on his mind when Capt. Gopinath, CEO of Air Deccan, quit as an army officer in 1978. The next two decades, he devoted his time and energy to farming silk in Karnataka, his home state. The idea for an airline came to him in 1998 during a chat with a former army buddy, Capt. A.K.Samuel, who was in the armys aviation unit. Air Deccan was born in last August, modelled on UKs Ryanair. Its a great business model and has worked in both Europe and in the US. Theres no reason why it wont work in India, Gopinath says. The airline, now operating at half the normal fares in south and western India, plans to expand to the other regions in a month or two with the arrival of the aircraft its ordered. Its fare structure is similar to Ryanair. Air Deccan now sells 25 per cent tickets of an aircraft for anything between Rs 500-4,900. The earlier you buy the less you pay. Gopinath says they hope to bring down the fares further, with a corresponding increase in the load factor or number of passengers on an aircraft. He calls the vast, untapped Indian market highly potential. Vijay Mallya, chairman of UB Group, agrees. His Kingfisher Airline will hit the sky by mid-January. Mallya says his motto, too, is to make the flying affordable. We will be cheaper than Jet or Sahara, but we are not going to sell tickets at Rs 500 like Air Deccan. Ours will be an airline not a bus, the liquor baron, with a deep interest in aviation, says. Ministry sources say at least four other low-cost airlines are expected to launch their services in the country next year. They include Royal Airlines, Modilufts new avatar, and AirOne, to be launched by a group of former Indian Airlines pilots.Sure, the big incumbent network carriers are not going to take the invasion of their spaces lying down. In the ensuing price war, the sky will be the limit.

		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 							 																						THE EAGLE AND THE OX The US seems determined to modernize the Royal Nepal Army, but the project is flawed in more ways than one, writes C.K. Lal Ceremonial roleIn the mid-west Terai region of Nepal, locals call an aircraft, a chil-gadi  literally, eagle-like vehicle. Two weeks ago, they saw a symbolic eagle  an aircraft of the American air force  land at the Ranjha airport in Nepalgunj. It had brought in a serving general of the army of the United States of America, presumably on a reconnaissance mission for some joint exercises with the Royal Nepal Army. Soon after, the American ambassador to Nepal, Michael E. Malinowski, went on an evaluation trip to the mid-west hills. From the way the Americans have been making their presence felt in Nepal, it is hard to believe the RNAs assertion that there is nothing special in this new-found conviviality. Especially now, when the army has been engaged in a fierce battle with the Maoists, which has reportedly left 500 of the rebels dead.																														On March 2, the assistant secretary of state for south Asia, Christina Rocca, told members of the US foreign relations committee that her government was extending full support to the Nepal government in its efforts to defeat the Maoists. Echoing her statements, the US ambassador-at-large, J. Cofer Black, criticized the Maoists the next day in Kathmandu, and promised to strengthen the RNA. It bears emphasizing that Black is a former intelligence officer of the Central Intelligence Agency and presently, coordinator of the state departments counter-terrorism unit.																														Since the mobilization of the army to fight the Maoist insurgency and the take-over of state powers by King Gyanendra, Rocca has already visited Nepal twice. She has heard all the Thapas  the premier, Surya Bahadur Thapa; the home minister, Kamal Thapa; the foreign minister, Bhekh Bahadur Thapa; the commander-in-chief, Pyar Jung Thapa; the inspector-general of paramilitary forces, Sahabir Thapa; the inspector-general of police, Shyam Bhakta Thapa  who are running the country for the king.																														Given all this, when the soccer team of the Diplomatic Corps in Kathmandu defeated the Secretaries Eleven of His Majestys Government of Nepal, seven goals to two, in a charity match on March 13, there was no disappointment among the audience. The Nepalese have come to accept the fact that Malinowski, the captain of the diplomatic corps team, prevails over the government in whatever he deems fit. Instead of rancour, media reports the following day expressed pity at the helplessness of the chief secretary, Bimal Prasad Koirala. The match reflects the influence that diplomats, particularly the Americans, have on the government of royal nominees in Nepal.																														Independent estimates put the number of US defence personnel working in Nepal at any given time at around 500. All of them may not be in uniform, and they may not all be there all the time, but there is little doubt that their principal assignment is to contain the Maoist insurgency in the country. The US embassy contests these figures, but doesnt deny the presence of an unspecified number of troops on a regular basis for joint training exercises. 																														The Maoist chief, Prachanda, has denounced the US-Nepal defence cooperation in the name of fighting terror. In a statement early this month, he said, The Royal Army has so far survived due to the economic, political, and technical support of the Americans. That is why our party has been calling it the Royal-American Army.																														But the Maoists have been uncharacteristically silent about the moral and material assistance that the RNA has been getting from its traditional allies  India and the United Kingdom. Apologists for American activism say that Indias role is wilfully ignored in order to vilify the US support and to alarm the Chinese. But the Chinese ambassador has consistently refused to be drawn into any controversy concerning the military-Maoist confrontations.																														Many in Kathmandu strongly believe that US and Indian strategists are working together to modernize the RNA. The Maoist insurgency has given them a convenient excuse to do something that they had intended to do in any case. Strengthening the army of a buffer state bordering China may be a part of long-term US policy. However, strengthening the RNA, which suffers from a few serious structural defects, is no easy task. 																														One, the RNA is a non-representative force. Nearly two-thirds of the population  the Madhesis, Muslims and Dalits  do not identify themselves with the RNA in any way. The force is drawn primarily from the ruling Brahman-Chhetri-Newar elite and their select tribal loyalists  the Gurungs and Magars of the mid-western mountains and the Rais and Limbus of the eastern sector. The political will to make the army truly national in character is sorely lacking.																														Two, the RNA has remained a ceremonial force for far too long. Sandwiched between the billion-plus Asian giants  India and China  Nepal never thought it necessary to prepare a war machine. Offering a guard of honour at official ceremonies and escorting the royal entourage have been the primary occupation of RNA personnel. The RNA is sometimes disparagingly compared to Shivas ox  resplendent, but harmless and useless. 																														Three, owing to the class background of the officers, RNA soldiers do not identify themselves with their commanders. There has been a welcome change lately, but the dominance of the Shah-Rana clan in the officer corps remains. The RNAs egalitarian values of the days of the unification in the 18th century were replaced by the codified hierarchy of the Rana oligarchy within half a century. Ever since, the command of the force has remained with the Shah-Rana extended family. The change from the days when Rana newborns were made generals has been too little too late. 																														Four, groomed in the culture of hosting shikars for visiting royalty and corrupted further by the long spell of relative peace in the Cold War years, RNA officers have been accustomed to travelling with toilet tents and separate sets of crystals for before- and after-dinner toasts. As long as the force remained small, such a lavish lifestyle did not make much difference. But if the current expansion spree continues  from less than 50,000, the RNA is already 72,000 strong funding this profligate force will be a real problem for one of the poorest countries in the world.																														Five, decades of peacekeeping duties for the United Nations have made the RNA even softer. RNA soldiers have found it so lucrative to don the blue helmets that charges of nepotism and favouritism fly thick and fast every time a battalion goes abroad. Soldiers trained for peace-keeping duties are ill-suited for ruthless guerrilla warfare.																														The mission to modernize the RNA is thus a flawed one on all counts. If the Americans and Indians really wish to help Nepal fight insurgency, they would have done better to shift their attention to the Nepal police and Nepal armed police force. Police functions in a buffer state are far more important than the adventures of the military. What Nepal needs are not lethal weapons, but equipment for relief and rescue operations, and communication facilities. The police, and even the army, do not need combat training at high altitudes with the American forces  they need training in intelligence-gathering techniques.																														The Americans also need to re-configure their strategies and focus attention on the governance of the country. Re-activating the democratic process by bringing political parties centre-stage is the best bet to check the cycle of violence and counter-violence that is slowly leading Nepal towards anarchy.

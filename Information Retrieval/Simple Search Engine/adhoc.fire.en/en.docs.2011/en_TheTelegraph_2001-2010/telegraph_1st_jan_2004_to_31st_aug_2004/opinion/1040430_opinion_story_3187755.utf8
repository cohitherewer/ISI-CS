The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 30, 2004 							 																						FAILING THE STUDENTS Parimal Bhattacharya																					The discovery of a packet containing higher-secondary answer scripts in a Bongaon-bound local train did not come as a surprise. In fact around this time every year, after the board and council examinations are over, there are reports of answer scripts surfacing in garbage vats, telephone booths and other unlikely places. Given that close to one million students and thousands of teachers and other officials are involved in the examinations exercise, such incidents are not entirely unexpected.																					But one must not forget the emotional impact of such news on the millions of boys and girls who go through the grind of preparing for one of the most important exam of their lives, and wait for the results with trepidation. Thus, the recurrence of such incidents is a blow to the credibility of the institutions which conduct the exams.																					The gravity of the matter is apparent if one considers the number of suicides by examinees every year after the results are out. While such desperate acts may have complex causes, the sense of being let down by the system, which most young people feel, is very real. This is also reflected in the dramatic increase in the number of court cases contesting the marks awarded in the examinations in recent times.																					But the question is  were things better in the past? And is the situation in our state any different from that in other states? Also, are the boards and councils the only ones to be blamed for examination-related lapses?																					Over-burdened																					As a result of the spread of education in rural areas, the number of students at the secondary and higher-secondary levels has increased manifold. This has put pressure on the bodies conducting the examinations.																					The Board of Secondary Education and the Council of Higher Secondary Education in the state are statutory bodies run by academics and officers deputed from state educational and administrative services. Despite some streamlining in recent times, both are manpower-heavy organizations, plagued by a number of maladies typical of the public sector. To conduct the examination and to evaluate scripts, these organizations employ the services of teachers of government and state-aided schools.																					This is what differentiates the examination system in our state from that in other states. While the all-India average of government schools and state-aided ones is 68 per cent and 22 per cent respectively, in West Bengal the corresponding figures are 20.5 per cent and 78.5 per cent. No wonder a majority of school teachers in West Bengal are not state employees but their salaries are paid from the state exchequer. Thus while the state feels entitled to enlist their services whenever it needs them, the teachers find this an infringement since they are not directly employed by the state.																					Payback time																					West Bengal was one of the first states to introduce enhanced pay scales for school teachers and bring parity between state-run and aided institutions. But the political dispensation tends to drumbeat this as a gesture of its munificence and makes it a prerequisite for greater accountability. For example, two years ago, the school education department tried to get teachers to give an undertaking against private tuition failing which their salaries would be stopped. Not only did the proposal end in a fiasco but it also exacerbated the strained relationship between the teachers and the state.																					No wonder the majority of teachers do not see themselves as part of a larger academic system that trains young minds, frames syllabi, conducts examinations and evaluations. For them, checking answer scripts of board examinations is a chore with paltry monetary returns.																					Answer scripts lost and found; examinees committing suicides; teachers assaulted  all this points to a rot in the system. This may be symptomatic of the general decline of standards in our society. But to say this does not absolve those who leave answer scripts in train compartments. A packet of answer scripts is not just a bundle of paper  it is someones future.

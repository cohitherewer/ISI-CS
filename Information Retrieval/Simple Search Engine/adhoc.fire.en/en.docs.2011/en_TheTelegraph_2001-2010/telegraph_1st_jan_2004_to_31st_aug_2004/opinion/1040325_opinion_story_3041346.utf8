The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 							 																						NO SCRIBES FOR THIS ROYALTY GOURI CHATTERJEE																					It should be a matter of grave national concern. We have our royal family, have had one for decades now, but where are our royal reporters? Those dedicated souls who toil away to chronicle every royal happening  from bulimia to betrayals  as if they were Second Comings? 																					If we had had our Andrew Morton (the royal reporter who not only got what he modestly calls The Scoop of the Century but has also earned around 3 million from his book, Diana: Her True Story), the investiture of our peoples prince this week wouldnt have been limited to an official CV and a few weak conjectures. 																					Hes the Gandhi people know least about, so it was possible to get away by saying Rahul Gandhi is intensely private (Hindustan Times). Weve barely heard him speak, so he can be the deep one (Outlook editor, Vinod Mehta, on NDTV 24x7). Hes 33 years old, so it cant be wrong to say, he identifies with the younger generation and its issues (Times of India).																					Sadly, time will make little difference. After all, how much more than, may be, the extent of her wardrobe do we know about Sonia Gandhi today than six years ago, when she took charge of the family business? 																					The question is not one of time but of approach, an approach that is long past its sell-by date. In keeping with past history, the media continue to leave the coverage of the House of Gandhis solely to the not-so-tender mercies of their political correspondents. 																					But these days, the Gandhis also run a political party. And political correspondents, with an inflated notion of their own self-importance, thanks to their daily proximity to the high and mighty of the land, are particularly unsuited to assume the less confrontational role that a court correspondent demands. 																					Desperate times require desperate measures, and the time is surely nigh for the Indian media to have their own royal press corps. That may well not be a wholly unmixed blessing (Prince Charles could fill books on the subject)  but nor, it could be argued, is royalty. 																					House of yawns																					Imagine a television channel that shows parliamentary proceedings the whole day, unedited, unexpurgated, every day, as many days as the House sits. What a yawn.																					Well, in the US they dont think so. Rather, sizeable numbers watch a network called C-Span, described by one admirer as the TV equivalent of a plain brown wrapper: no showbiz, no commercials, no sports, no weather, no hurry  and no ego. With four channels (two of which are for the two Houses of the US Congress), C-Span celebrated its 25th birthday last Friday. A great achievement since it is not government-owned but a privately funded non-profit body spawned by the cable operators for public service. 																					The great thing is one gets to see all the select committee hearings, which we still cant in India. Whether its a JPC hearing on Coke-Pepsi or a standing committee meeting, its all behind closed doors, away from the voters eyes. And if you happened to see parts of the Senate hearing on the September 11 investigations shown on BBC and CNN this week, you would know how fascinating live governance can be. And its an old rule of politics that the publics business is usually done better if its done in public. 																					The Osama within																					Osama bin Laden has done it again  escaped the US and Pakistani armies into the caves of Tora Bora. Or so it seems. But not if you believe The Onion, a weekly newspaper many in America swear by. The Onion carries an announcement by Donald Rumsfeld that Laden has at long last been found hiding deep inside the darkest recesses of each and every one of our souls. 																					In trademark Rumsfeld style, he adds: He evaded us for so long because he had such an ingenious hideout. Only someone as evil as bin Laden would think to crawl down into that hole inside every one of us, the one that makes us hate instead of love, forget birthdays, and ignore alternate-side parking rules. The Onion, a parody newspaper, never fails to bring tears to ones eyes.

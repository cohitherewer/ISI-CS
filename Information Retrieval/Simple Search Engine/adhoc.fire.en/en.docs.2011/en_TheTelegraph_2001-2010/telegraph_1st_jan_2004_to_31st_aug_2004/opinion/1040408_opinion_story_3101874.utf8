The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 08, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Dip into troubled waters				 																																																				Sir  The incident in which hundreds of devotees in Tarakeswar flouted court orders to take a dip in Dudhpukur, is reminiscent of the film, Ganashatru (Dip drowns court bar, April 6). Hindus and their unshakeable faith  just the way the film portrayed it  remain unchanged. Which is why neither a high court order, a pollution control board bar nor an administrative injunction could prevent the Tarakeswar devotees from taking a dip in the disputed pond. The Tarakeswar estate committees complicity in this drama is even more disconcerting. The argument of its lawyer, who tried to persuade the district administration to revoke its ban on grounds that it was hurting religious sentiments, shows how the temple authorities will never miss a chance to cash in on religion (the Gajon Mela was then only days away). The committee manager thus seems to fake helplessness when he pleads that devotees will do what they like despite protests from the temple managers.Yours faithfully,
Asit Samanta, Calcutta Beauty has another face
Sir  The editorial, Ms Pandits beauty (April 4), and the report, Home truths for single women in Mumbai (April 3), show how hypocritical and conservative Indian society still is. This is not so evident in Bangalore or Calcutta as in Mumbai, where the discrimination on the basis of sex, religion and profession becomes palpable when one seeks accommodation in the city. The prying questions one has to answer in the process are an invasion of privacy. But in a country where the government, as the self-appointed moral guardian of the people, decides what is to be seen on the television and on the screen, respect for ones privacy would be too much to ask. 				 																																																				It seems absurd that even in the 21st century, the marital status of a person, particularly a woman, should become the sole determinant in deciding whether he or she has the right to inhabit a rented space. Laxmi Pandits landlady might have been honest while informing the media about the dubiousness of her tenants marital status, but did she have the right to interfere in Pandits life in the first place? The landladys self-righteousness has done irreparable harm to Pandits career. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The controversy over Miss India-World highlights three important contemporary issues (Miss, but no longer Miss India-World, April 1). First, in Mumbai and pockets of some other cities, one is forced to lie about ones marital status, religion or profession in order to get a decent accommodation. So much for our social progress. Second, looked at from a different angle, one may conclude from this episode that the present generation of youngsters will not think twice before adopting unfair means if that gets them somewhere in their career. Third, the medias complete disregard for privacy when it comes to getting a story. The ruthless manner in which television channels covered Pandits case proves this fact.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Laxmi Pandit is one of the many single women in Mumbai who befriend the city to achieve their dreams and see no reason not to tell a white lie if circumstances so deem it. And the quandary a city like Mumbai places them in, sometimes merit such a lie. Pandits lying about her marital status was one such.Why was Pandits discretion made into such a high drama then? If it is a crime to aspire to a goal, then we are all complicit in it. Why was Pandit made to pay with her much-desired crown for it? In acknowledgement of the difficulties single women face in the city, the state government should try to address their specific needs. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is strange that one of the fastest developing metros like Mumbai should have no place for single women aspiring for a career in the glamour world. While certain uptown areas like Colaba and Bandra are exceptions, prohibitive rents and shortage of rented spaces make it difficult for single women to access them. Middle-class Malad, Kandivili and Andheri are thus preferred, although the barrage of questions asked to single women would embarrass the toughest of interview boards.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sayan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Forget the controversy over Laxmi Pandits marital status for a change and concentrate on the fact that she won the Miss India-World title by defeating scores of other contestants with her beauty and brains. This alone should have made the issue of her marital status pointless. But no. Organizers of beauty pageants seem to presume that a woman loses all her beauty and charm after marriage. Perhaps organizers should ask participants to go through a virginity test to make the contest more authentic. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph should verify facts before printing them. Soham Guptas contention in Declaration drama (April 5), that India has lost every time Sachin Tendulkar scored a double century, is incorrect. India won against Zimbabwe in the 2000-01 test, and drew against both Australia (2001) and New Zealand (1999), despite Tendulkar scoring double centuries.

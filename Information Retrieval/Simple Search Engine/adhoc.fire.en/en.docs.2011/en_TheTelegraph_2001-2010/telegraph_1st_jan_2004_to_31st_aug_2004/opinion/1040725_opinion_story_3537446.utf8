				 																																																																														 The Mumbai high court does not seem to have taken into account, lets call it, the straw factor. For people like didi, desperately trying to save themselves from sinking into political oblivion, bandhs are the last resort they cannot let go, penalty or not. Which is why August 2 stands, at least for now. But there are other desperations Mamata is being driven to  for example trying to save the Central PWD bungalow on Mahadev Road, New Delhi, the party was given some time ago. Having lost its room in Parliament House and, reportedly, left to conduct business from a sofa in the Central Hall, the TMC cannot but hang on to the bungalow which it was asked to vacate last week. For this prized possession, the TMC had had to fulfil certain conditions  contest elections from a requisite number of states (the reason why the TMC went national?) and win a certain number of MPs and MLAs. But its an evil hour for didi now  the TMC has only one MP, zero presence in other states, and a vanishing support base even within its home turf. The signboard of the National Trinamool Congress outside the bungalow was taken off a few days back, and unless Mamata pays the establishment a visit soon in New Delhi, the party might soon be needing two more sofas in the Central Hall to accommodate it  lock, stock and barrel. 				 																																																																														 Having put a distinctly grey(ing) ministry in place, madam, on the lookout for a fresh face to head her youth Congress, has reportedly zeroed in on Jatin Prasada. The trouble is that this handsome son of former speaker Jitendra Prasada does not want to take on the responsibility. And this not because he is over-age, but because like the younger brood in the party, he dreams of making it to the council of minister some day. But Jatin, seemingly, cannot muster the courage to say no to madam. Which means that in the coming days we might see another north Indian (with the right lineage) becoming Youth Congress chief. Wonder why a pan-Indian party cannot look east-, south-, or west-wards to spot talent!				 																																																																														 Nothing succeeds like failure. Take it from the Telengana Rashtra Samiti leader, Chandrasekhar Rao, whose political fortunes seem to be on the rise ever since he sacrificed his gaddi for the DMK. Rao has clearly become a Sonia-favourite and this was evident when the UPA chairperson attended a dinner at his residence recently. Those who had initially stayed away were at his gate the moment they heard madam had arrived. Looks like it wont be long before Rao gets his prize for listening to the outer voice.				 																																																																														 Unique selling proposition. And the Doon school owes it to Kamal Nath. At a discussion in the Central Hall of parliament on the school, each speaker waxed eloquent about the quality of education and the values the famous school inculcated in its students. That was until Nath intervened with his own theory  the strength of the school was its secularism. Look at the composition of the present day politicians who had a Doon background, he said. Karan Singh, Mani Aiyar, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jatin Prasada  all were Doon products committed to secular formations. There were exceptions  Naveen Patnaik, for example. But they only proved the rule. Any buyers?				 																																																																														 Bengal seems to be worrying the BJP, particularly Tapan Sikdar. He is reported to have lately acquired a friend, who also acts as his minder. Which means anyone seeking his audience has to have her clearance. And that includes M Venkaiah Naidu, who was told recently (when he called up Sikdar) that the leader was sleeping. Naidu is believed to have later confided to his own friends that if a senior leader like Sikdar was found sleeping despite his party having lost the polls, then Ram help the BJP in Bengal. Also elsewhere.				 																																																																														 Saffron CMs have apparently been asked to accommodate scribes who did the party a good turn. But only two are showing enthusiasm  Uma Bharti and Raman Singh. Uma has given one employment as head of a state-run university and promised to help another. Meanwhile, Raman is using the services of a Hindi-language scribe who was once a part of Vijay Goels media team. The journo will soon reach Bangkok to showcase Chhattisgarh as a land of unlimited possibilities. A true symbiosis.				 																																																																														 The impeccable track record of former revenue secretary MR Shivaramans may make him the Sebi chairman or economic adviser to PC, but not the principal secretary to the PM. He is, apparently, too straight a man for that. 				 																																																																														 Whos the Pramod Mahajan of the UPA? You guessed right, Ghulam Nabi Azad. This suave operators brokering of the pact with the saffronites, which stopped them from fielding Najma Heptullah for the post of the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, has left the BJP much impressed. Mahajan had better watch out. But it is not the political top brass alone who now look up to Ghulam for mediation. Scribes on the Congress beat also keenly watch Azads movements to get an inkling of likely changes. They were there at the party headquarters, hoping to hear of the possible Congress revamp of the cabinet when there was news of a press conference shortly before Sonia left for the AIDS meet at Bangkok. But Azad had only come with a Jammu and Kashmir minister who was joining the Congress. However, sensing the disappointment, Azad quoted Ghalib with a broad grin, Suna tha humne bhi, Ghalib ke urenge parkachche,/ Dekhne hum bhi gaye par tamasha na hua. Confidence, minister! So long as he makes no tamasha of himself, that is.

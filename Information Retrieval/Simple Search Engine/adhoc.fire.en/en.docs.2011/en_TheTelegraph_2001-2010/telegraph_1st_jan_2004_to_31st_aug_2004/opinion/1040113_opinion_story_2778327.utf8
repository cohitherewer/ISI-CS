The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Farming is fun				 																																																				Sir  By agitating against the proposed imposition of taxes on livestock by the Left Front government, Mamata Banerjee is only perpetuating the myth that in rural Bengal, people indulge in agriculture and animal husbandry more out of philanthropy than for earning a livelihood. Vernacular literatures have nurtured and glorified this idea. Everyone knows that agricultural income is till date outside the purview of income tax for reasons political. A visit to the bazaar would prove that no one grows vegetables or rears goats or chicken for fun. Had they done so, there would be plenty of ownerless chicken or goats about. Indian farmers belong to that idyllic world where one is free to pursue an economic activity without paying taxes. Even the Left Front, whatever its good intentions may be, has had to stall its plans (Front shelves rural tax plans, Jan 8). But Banerjee had better not make the mistake of thinking that her opposition had anything to do with the decision.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Chameli Pal, Budge Budge 
				 																Won and lost				 																																																				Sir  Both India and Australia have emerged winners in their own way in the recently-concluded test series Down Under. India seem to have learnt how to come back from a potentially hopeless situation, while Australians have learnt that a near-600 total does not necessarily give them an edge over the opposition. 				 																																																				But in the first one-dayer of the triangular VB Series, India again went back to its old losing ways from a winning position. When will our team grow up and learn from their mistakes? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arijit Ghosh, Shyamnagar

				 																																																				Sir  The Indian team deserves to be congratulated for managing a respectable draw in the overseas test series against Australia. Perhaps what would give the Indian cricketers maximum satisfaction is that they have been able to silence all the pundits who had written off India at the beginning of the series.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Angsuman Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Steve Waughs retirement from world cricket will create a vacuum which will be difficult to fill. His legacy is not just limited to cricket, he has been working for the cause of the poor and underprivileged for long. 				 																																																				He was probably the last of the gentlemen cricketers, with a nearly spotless career. For a member of the Australian team, famous for their sledging, this is not a mean feat. Young and aspiring cricketers have a lot to learn from Waughs career, both in terms of cricket and in terms of social responsibility.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sourav Ganguly is perhaps the only captain in contemporary cricket who can believe that his team can beat the Australians in Australia even without the services of his two bowling mainstays. Of course, he would not have dared to dream the impossible dream if he was not convinced of the abilities of his batsmen like Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Virender Sehwag.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sujit De, Sodepur

				 																																																				Sir  What has distinguished the 2003-2004 series against Australia from Indias point of view is that possibly for the first time in recent history, all the components of the famous Indian middle order came good. Even Sachin Tendulkar, who looked destined to have a disastrous series, redeemed himself in style in the final test in Sydney. Earlier, the Indian middle order, which has been the worlds best on paper for quite some time, has frequently crumbled against mediocre bowling attacks, leading the followers to hesitate before reposing their faith on them. Will this picture change for good after Australia 2003-04?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.R. Rajan, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Doff the baggy cap (Jan 8), pays tribute to one of the greatest role models cricket has produced. Even in his last innings, Steve Waugh showed the stuff he was made of, top-scoring with 80. He was always someone who preferred to lead from the front. In Waughs life after cricket, we in Calcutta can hope to see more of him as a social worker. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Sayan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Although the test series Down Under ended in a draw, it was anything but tame. Had India enforced a follow-on, who knows, the series may have ended 2-1 in Indias favour. But conjectures apart, Indias performance has been worth every word of praise being written about them. David has finally managed to extract a draw from Goliath. That is surely not bad for a start.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dinabandhu Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  A fine batting performance by the Australian captain and Simon Katich denied Indians a chance to make history. Without taking away from the credit of Waugh and Katich, it must be said that no Indian bowler, with the sole exception of Anil Kumble, bowled up to his potential. The outcome of this series should serve as a timely reminder of the need of some quality fast bowlers and spinners in a post-Kumble scene.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramesh Chaurasia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  A win against Australia is such an unexpected event that once it happened, it immediately put the television channels and newspapers into a tizzy. It is important that with the team, the Indian media too learn to take victory in their stride, lest it proves to be a flash in the pan, and makes every one of them appear foolish.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jyoti K. Patwari, Lakhimpur, Assam

				 																Memories of an association				 																																																				Sir  Reading and re-reading the timely article on Sachin Chaudhury by Ashok Mitra on the occasion of the formers birth centenary, has made me relive my formative days in Bombay from the early Fifties to the mid-Sixties (A weekly is born, Jan 1). During my long sojourn in Bombay, after having spent the day in the Central Library housed in the massive Town Hall building, I would often walk down to the office of the The Economic Weekly, obviously not to participate in any way in the affairs of the publication, but simply to have a darshan of a Bengali-speaking bhadralok editor working in Bombay. Of course, it never happened that I could escape Chaudhurys affectionate attention. 				 																																																				Mitras tit-bit information on Chaudhury in Bombay is interesting. But it appears to me that one interesting information is missing. For a short stint, Chaudhury happened to be on the editorial staff of Sakal, one of the oldest Marathi dailies of the then Poona. And, is Mitras economist of repute who also edited a weekly economic journal for a leading business house E.P.W. DCosta of the now-defunct Eastern Economist?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ren D. Ghosh, Calcutta

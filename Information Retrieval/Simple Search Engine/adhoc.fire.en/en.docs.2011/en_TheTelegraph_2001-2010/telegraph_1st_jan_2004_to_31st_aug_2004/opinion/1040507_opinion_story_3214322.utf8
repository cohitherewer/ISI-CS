The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 07, 2004 							 																						CHILDREN OF EMPIRE 							 - So many ways of seeing India, so few people who see beyond the obvious 				 	 Close encountersONE LAST LOOK By Susanna Moore, Penguin, pound; 9.10One Last Look has all the languor of a summer siesta. The tale is told in the diary of Eleanor Oliphant, sister of the governor-general, Henry, posted in Calcutta in 1836. One learns as much about her story through what is written as from what is left out.																														Four characters make the arduous journey by sea to Calcutta  Henry, who is to take up his duties at Government House (now Raj Bhavan); Eleanor and sister Harriet, both unmarried; and cousin Lafayette, who works with Henry. Eleanors tone of snobbery in the first passages of the book is enough to convince the reader that she is heartily unpleasant. The context  colonizers on a mission to improve the lives of the natives  seems all too familiar, and one expects at any moment to see the protagonist fall under the spell of the exotic land and its brown-skinned people. And to some extent this does happen. But Susannah Moore is one of the rare writers who manage to treat this overplayed theme with originality.																														The tale unfolds with all the alacrity of a Merchant-Ivory film. In fact, Moores novel, In the Cut, was made into a disastrous movie of the same name, directed by Jane Campion. It is not far-fetched to think that Moore had another screenplay in mind while writing this novel. Although the events which take place in the course of the seven years  the duration of the stay in India  are momentous affairs of government and empire, Eleanors narrative is intensely private. Descriptions of Calcutta are few, as are those of the numerous other places she takes the reader to. However, domestic spaces and servants are drawn in great detail. Moore rarely lists public events in her journal, and seldom relates personal episodes.																														It is more a journey through Eleanors mind  an exploration of her ways of seeing  to a place and time when she takes one last look and acknowledges, not the error in her ways, but her errors in perception. She writes in the last leg of her stay: My craving for moral certitude is diminished now  I, who once flattered myself on my code of conduct and my proud acceptance of its obligations, now pride myself on my paganish equanimity: I, who concerned my Whiggish self with flower shows and guild school prizes.																														It is clear from the outset of the journey that the relationship between Eleanor and Henry is not platonic. There is great filial love and respect, but the two are also sexually involved. Through Eleanors shrouded and secretive accounts, she does pen some of their encounters, however fleetingly. The thirty-something is travelling to India, despite all reservations, because she loves her brother deeply.																														Harriet at first comes across as a silly, beautiful girl. This is, of course, because Eleanor sees her that way. This view changes when they arrive in India. Harriet takes to India with a natural ease, unlike Eleanor who is miserable in the first days of the stay. The British settlers amuse her and she is distanced from the natives (who are mainly servants and attendants). Harriet, on the other hand, forms relationships with the people and the animals of the land, gathering a menagerie around her. Not only does Harriet grow, but also Eleanors altering view strengthens their relationship, even as it weakens that with her brother. Lafayette is a dashing charmer who finds in India a haven with nautch girls, and a brown-skinned mistress. This is acceptable behaviour from a man, as Eleanor remarks  more than a womans (Harriets) friendly attachments.																														A journal is always written for another, no matter how much we pretend otherwise, writes Eleanor at the end, when she reads parts of it to Harriet. Even the elements of the personal that creep in are shrouded in wit. She writes with a light hand, carefully documenting the foibles of the people around her, relating conversations she has on politics and religion. Conversations are meant to delight, and those without the gift of the gab are deemed dull. Moore captures the cloistered womans spaces with subtlety. Eleanor tries to break out of the straitjacket of the benevolent hostess, but can never inhabit the larger male realm.																														There are long periods spent on the roads ahead of an ill-fated Afghan campaign when Eleanor writes less than once a month. This time is filled with hunger, misery, death and desolation, yet the grit is largely left out. There is a constant sense of anticipation that something momentous will occur. When it finally does, details are scarce. It is left to the reader to fill in the gaps that Eleanor carefully leaves. Could it be the fear of leaving incriminating evidence  both political and personal  behind? Could it be a fear of putting them down on paper, as this would require her to break out of the haze she has built around her world?																														Moores silences enrich the novel, stirring the imagination, more than her words. 						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

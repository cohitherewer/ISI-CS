		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 							 																						NO TO BILL																														The widespread outrage over the passage of the permanent resident (disqualification) bill in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly was only to be expected. The bill seeks to disqualify women from the status of permanent resident of the state if they marry a non-resident. This is a retrograde piece of legislation. The law defining the right of a state subject in Jammu and Kashmir was enacted in 1927, during the regime of the then monarch, Hari Singh. This law deprived women of their right to be a state subject if they married outside the state. A non-state subject cannot own or inherit immovable property, get a government job or fight elections. Interestingly, according to this law, a non-resident woman who marries a state subject is automatically granted this privilege. This discriminatory law was challenged by some affected women in the high court of Jammu and Kashmir. The high court, in 2002, declared that the law was discriminatory and, therefore, women should be granted equal rights. According to the judgment, women would not loose their rights even if they married outside the state. 																														In 2003, the state government filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the high court judgment. However, even before the Supreme Court could pronounce judgment, the government withdrew the appeal and enacted this legislation. This may have been done because there was the feeling that the Supreme Court would uphold the stand taken by the high court. The state government wanted to assuage the perception within a section of the Kashmir valley that the high court judgment diluted the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. There was also a feeling that the judgment may be the first step towards creating a new category of state subjects. Given the forthcoming elections, the state government, quite obviously, did not want to give leverage to the opposition on this issue. Interestingly, however, the team which drafted the bill had members from the whole spectrum of parties in the assembly. They included the Congress, the National Conference, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Peoples Democratic Party. It is ironic that a couple of days after the bill was passed, the PDP government has had to retract after the intervention of Ms Sonia Gandhi. An earlier reaction from her would have saved some red faces in the Congress.

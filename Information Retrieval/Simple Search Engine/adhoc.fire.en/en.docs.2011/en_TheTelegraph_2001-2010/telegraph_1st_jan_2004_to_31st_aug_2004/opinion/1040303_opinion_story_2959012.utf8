In 1989, the Illustrated Weekly magazine...said, among other things, that more people seem to be braving societal scorn to indulge in sex with greater freedom. Pelto quotes Nag for the survey of the Family Planning Association of India in 1989 in 16 major cities. The survey found that less than a third of both male and female respondents agreed with the statement that it is a sin to have premarital sex (FPAI, 1990)...Responses to other items in the survey indicated that permissive attitudes towards premarital sexual behaviour were prevalent, compared to earlier, more conservative views (Nag, 1996b).																														Evidence of changing attitudes led to questions on the extent of premarital and extramarital sex in communities not usually considered high risk. In the early Nineties, surveys were conducted among college students, middle and upper class men and women and readers of glossy magazines to assess the frequency of premarital and extramarital sexual encounters among various population groups (Pelto).																														At least two of these surveys  the questionnaire in the mens magazine Debonair, to which 1404 men responded, and in the womens magazine Savvy (383 responses)  showed a high prevalence of premarital experience. Of the men reporting premarital sexual activity, 22 per cent said their first sexual encounter was with a sex worker, while 23 per cent married women said they had sex with their husbands before marriage...Yet, the picture that emerges from the surveys is that there is considerable premarital and extramarital sexual activity in respectable middle class and upper-middle class populations.																														Research on sexual behaviour in the Nineties, using predominantly qualitative methods, largely focussed on finding patterns, contexts and conditions under which premarital and extramarital sexual practices take place (Pelto, 2000)...Similarly, quantitative data on what is considered socially inappropriate behaviour is difficult to find or is inaccurate (Pelto, 2000). For example, survey data on the number of unmarried girls indulging in premarital sex are likely to be gross underestimates as girls are often unwilling to talk about sexual behaviour even under conditions of anonymity...																														In a survey of girls in non-elite institutions, only 1 per cent of students in Class 11 and 5 per cent of the young women in the third year of college reported sexual activity (Abraham, 1997). In the studies reviewed by Jejeebhoy (1998), the percentage of girls reporting sexual activity ranged from almost none to 9 per cent. Systematic research into sexual behaviour in India had to await the mid-Nineties... 																														The study of sexual behaviour is essential to under stand important social issues...it can explore how sexuality and sexual relations play a key role in the maintenance of patriarchal, male dominated patterns in society.

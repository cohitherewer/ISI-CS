The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 04, 2004 							 																						TALE FROM A SICILIAN SMALL TOWN				 	 Step by stepThe terracotta dog By Andrea Camilleri, Picador,  pound;15.99The figure of the private detective from Sherlock Holmes to Hercules Poirot has dominated the imagination of thriller writers. In contrast, the investigating police officer, plodding and methodical, has often been held up as a figure of ridicule. One has only to think of the bumbling Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard defeated always by the scintillating deductive powers of Holmes. There are exceptions. The name of Adam Dalgliesh, P.D. Jamess unforgettable poet-detective from Londons police force, comes immediately to mind. To this must now be added the name of Inspector Salvo Montalbano.																														Montalbano is an unassuming but unusual police officer in the town of Vigata in Sicily. He is unusual because in a region dominated by the mafiosi, he is incorruptible. He is also unusual because he is deeply loyal to friends and his fiance. He is a policeman with a fine sensitive mind: he reads and is fond of good food. He is unassuming because he consistently refuses to be promoted to the rank of assistant commissioner as that would take him away from Vigata and the charm of routine detective work.																														A well-known mafia don makes the sudden offer, through a trusted intermediary, to give himself up to Montalbano. This is how the novel opens. But very soon and without quite realizing it, the reader is gripped by a different set of events which go back into the history of Vigata during the last stages of the Second World War.																														A number of things come to be linked up as the drama unfolds. There is the discovery of the loot, abandoned in a truck in a parking lot, from a supermarket heist. This is followed by the unearthing of an old cave which is used by the mafia as a hiding place for smuggled arms. A search of the cave reveals, startingly, a small grotto containing the bodies of two young lovers caught in an embrace and guarded over by a huge terra cotta dog. The case of the supermarket heist and of arms smuggling is easily solved by the assiduous Montalbano. In the process, he also solves the murder of an old man whose death was taken to be accidental. But what fires his imagination and his actions is the discovery of the bodies of the young lovers.																														The solution of this case takes the inspector into Sicilys past and into the study of myths and ritual. Montalbano is relentless in his pursuit and he brooks no obstacles. Andrea Camilleri creates his detective almost with loving dedication. His sardonic wit, his eccentricities and his love for food are all made to come alive. The writing is vibrant without being racy. The inspectors house faces the sea and the house has a verandah where he sits to ponder the larger issues of life and his work: He went out onto the veranda, sat down on the bench, put the telephone beside him, and stared at the sea. He couldnt do anything else  read, think, write  nothing. Only stare at the sea. He was losing himself in the bottomless well of an obsession, and he knew it.																														But Montalbano is not the philosopher-detective. In the field he is agile. This is a book to enjoy and you can even take home a few good recipes.

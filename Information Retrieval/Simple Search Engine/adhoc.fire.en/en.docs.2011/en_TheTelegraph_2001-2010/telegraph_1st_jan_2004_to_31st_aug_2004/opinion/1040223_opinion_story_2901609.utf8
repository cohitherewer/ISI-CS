The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, February 23, 2004 							 																						WRITTEN IN THE BONES Gwynne Dyer																					We should be learning from skeletons, not reburying them, said Robert Foley, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies in Cambridge, England. They are the remains of people still contributing to humanity and its knowledge of itself.																					Foley was remarking on the recommendation to the British parliament to create a national panel to decide on the return of bones from British museums to various aboriginal groups in Australia and North America. But the case that really mattered was the one in a court of appeals in Oregon, United States of America, where the eight-year struggle over the fate of Kennewick Man was settled in mid-February by a ruling that science is more important than peoples feelings.																					There were strong feelings on both sides. If I could do handstands, I would do handstands, said Paula Barran, one of the eight anthropologists who went to court in 2000 to dispute the US governments decision to hand over the archaeological find of the century  an almost complete set of human bones found in the Columbia River in 1996 that was 9,300 years old  to the local Indian tribes for reburial without any proper scientific examination.																					Many Native Americans, however, feel raped by the judgment. (The Native American graves protection and repatriation act) ...gives tribes the right to prevent the study of remains, said a lawyer for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. What the 9th Circuit seems to have done is to require the tribes to prove the remains are Native Americans before the statute applies.																					Mythical ancestors																					Fair enough, you might reply. If the bones arent really their ancestors, why should they have any right to it? But this is to ignore how mythology has mutated into ideology in the minds of many Native Americans. As far as they are concerned, any ancient human remains in North America are their ancestors, because they have always been there.																					There is no human being on Earth who can say with any confidence who his ancestors were 9,300 years ago. The claim that the four tribes who live in the Columbia river basin today are in any meaningful sense the descendants of the middle-aged man who died with a spear in his guts 9,300 years ago on the banks of the Columbia is simply incredible. There has been far too much coming and going in human history, too many invasions and migrations and victories and defeats. So why is the claim made at all?																					Most aborigines have creation myths that explain how they have always had an intimate relationship with the land they now occupy. Yet it is virtually impossible that the Native Americans ancestors always lived where they do now: there were no human beings in the Americas until the first migrations across the Bering Straits, probably no more than 14,000 years ago.																					Science, not sentiment																					In the younger generation of Native Americans, however, myth often becomes ideology and dogma. There were no migrations; we were always here; we are not just descendants of an early wave of immigrants who eventually got overwhelmed by later waves. It is a position based on pride and desperation, not on history. It cannot be used as a basis for laying claim to 9,000-year-old-bones and denying scientists access to them. 																					We live in an extraordinary period when scientists are finally piecing together the true history of the human species: where we come from, how we spread across the planet, even what kind of animals we really are. It is an important project, and we need all the evidence we can get. It does not rely on the remains of those who have died in the past few hundred years, and those remains should be returned to their people if they can be identified. Normal human respect for the dead demands it.																					But handing over truly ancient bones to the people who were the local inhabitants just a couple of centuries ago, as the US administration tried to do in 2000, is political cowardice and political correctness run mad. The court made the right call, and with any luck it will establish a lasting precedent.

Better halves of billionaire industrialists are usually happy flashing solitaires and being featured now and then on Page 3. Not Sudha Murthy. While husband .R. Narayana Murthy was building Indias top software company, Infosys, Sudha made her mark as a social worker and a prolific writer. Now, the 54-year-old computer science teacher is out with her latest venture, How I Taught My Grandmother to Read. This collection of heartwarming stories will be released by Biocon boss Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw in Bangalore on May 20. Yet another lesson to be learnt from Ms Murthy? 
 Nadia ComaneciShes beautiful. Shes perfect. Shes oh-so-wonderful. Shes Nadia Comaneci, one of our living legends, who created history with that perfect score of 10 in the gymnastic events at the Montreal Olympics in 1976. Now 28 years later, former International Olympic Committee vice-president Dick Pound begs to differ. In his forthcoming book, Inside The Olympics, Pound claims the Romanian gymnast was awarded slightly higher than normal marks at Montreal by the Soviet bloc judges. He reasons that since the Soviet bloc had control over the world gymnastics federation then, it had come up with such a strategy to avoid the embarrassment of losing in team events. Nadia is fuming. Small wonder.  Brett LeeMove over, Enrique. Brett Lee is all set to croon for us. The Australian fast bowler, who was in India this week, says he plans to return soon, and NOT to ensnare Indian batsmen. Lee and his band, Six And Out, are planning a music tour to India with Mick Jagger of Roll-ing Stones. The proceeds will go to charity. Heres hoping the music will be as good as the bowling.

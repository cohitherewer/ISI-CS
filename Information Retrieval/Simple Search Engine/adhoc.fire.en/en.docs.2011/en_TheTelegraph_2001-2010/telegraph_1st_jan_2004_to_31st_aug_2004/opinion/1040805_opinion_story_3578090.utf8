The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 05, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Stuck in the past				 																																																				Sir  The views published in the document, On the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World, only show that the Vatican is yet to understand the meaning of feminism (Vatican paper irks women, Aug 2). The document states: Many women felt that they had to be adversaries of men in order to be themselves. This is not true. The feminist movement strives to make women equal to men, not to make the former surpass or hate the latter. The document concedes that women should be respected and have equal rights in the workplace, but differences between the sexes need to be recognized and exalted. But arent these very differences carefully nurtured to perpetuate the social discrimination against them? In defending tradition and deriding homosexuality, the Church has only displayed its failure to keep abreast of the changes in todays world.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Victor D Souza, Calcutta
				 																Cup of woe				 																																																				Sir  Indias loss to Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final can be attributed to the lack of commitment on the part of the players. Indian academics and scientists strive to give their best at international seminars, as the prestige of their institute and the country is at stake. Our cricketers blame their below-par performance on something abstract called poor form or bad patch. On tour, players are busy with dinner engagements, shopping sprees and commercial shoots as they know that their iconic status would not be dented even if they lose a final. This is the time for implementing the performance-based payment contract with the cricketers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Abhijit Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  When a team knows that it is the second best in one day cricket, it becomes complacent and arrogant. There can be no better example of this than the Indian eleven which lost the Asia Cup finals in Colombo. Some other factors responsible for this were Sachin Tendulkars inability to carry his bat through the innings, an inflexible batting order and repetition of strategic errors. But is John Wright and Co. thinking about these?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amber Warsi, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Although some overzealous columnists insisted that India would soon replace Australia as the world champions, the Asia Cup final clearly proved that the Australians are far ahead of India in every department of the game. The Australians bat, bowl and field better than the men in blue and have the ability to win matches no matter whether they bat or field first. India still are poor chasers, something which cost them the matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The selectors also need to drop some big names like Virender Sehwag and V.V.S. Laxman. There was big fuss about Laxmans injury. But when he took the field in the finals, he did not do much more than what Parthiv Patel did in the earlier match. Had Patel played in the finals, he surely would have performed better than Rahul Dravid behind the stumps and reduced the number of extras. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  According to some experts, India was done in by the slowness of the track. But then how could Zaheer Khan, a tail-ender at that, hit Muttiah Muralitharan for a couple of sixes and a four in a single over? What was the real reason behind Indias failure? Was it over confidence, especially after the series victory in Pakistan? Or was it the injudicious shot-selection by a few players who appeared rusty after a long lay-off? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Saket Yadav, Durg 

				 																																																				Sir  For India, the story at this years Asia Cup has been one of lost opportunities. After tasting success in Australia and Pakistan, this was a perfect opportunity to beat the Lankans on their home soil. This would also have erased the tag of chokers against their name. Sachin Tendulkar too lost the chance to win a game for his country and prove his critics wrong.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
D.K. Saha, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Leaving aside the two victories against minnows, United Arab Emirates and Bangladesh, India managed to scrape through and win one match against Sri Lanka. Even that victory would not have been possible had Sanath Jayasuriya not got out to a silly shot. For the season ahead, the Indian think tank and selectors must ask themselves why players like V.V.S. Laxman and Parthiv Patel must be automatic choices in the one-day squad while Hemang Badani and Ajit Agarkar are left out. Yuvraj Singh should replace Sourav Ganguly in the number three position because the former plays quick bowlers better. These, and an overall improvement in the other departments of the game, should see Team India perform better in the future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rahul Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Asia Cup match between Pakistan and Bangladesh was reduced to a formality since the finalists had already been decided. But it was not without its share of comedy. For starters, the match was watched by some sea gulls, a few pigeons, and a handful of human spectators. The Pakistani speedster, Mohammed Sami, got his team an early breakthrough but what followed was one of the most bizarre overs in the history of one-day cricket. Suddenly, Sami lost his control, bowled a spate of wides and no-balls and took as many as 17 balls to complete his over. The Pakistan skipper, however, put an end to the comedy show by taking him off the attack.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Ashiwani Kumar Singh, Durgapur

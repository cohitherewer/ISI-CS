The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 09, 2004 							 																						ALL IN ONE CUP Novy Kapadia				 	 Viewers delight																								Scandals, Controversies and World Cup 2003 By K.R. Wadhwaney, Diamond, Rs 195																								Off-the-field incidents hogged the headlines as much as the splendid cricket played in the 2003 World Cup, staged in the African continent for the first time. The boycott of matches in Zimbabwe and Kenya by England and New Zealand respectively, Shane Warnes banishment just before the start of the tournament for using drugs, the accusations of racial slur by Australia against Rashid Latif and the dramatic black arm-band protest by Andy Flower and Henry Olonga mourning the death of democracy in Zimbabwe were major media events. 																								After a tentative start, India reached the final, for a second time. Incidentally, 80 per cent of the sponsorship money for the tournament came from India. Though India lost to Australia by 125 runs in the finals, it was the Indian fans with their catchy slogans who ruled the show. No sporting event has brought so much international publicity to India as the 2003 World Cup final at the Wanderers in Johannesburg.																								The amount of follow-up literature on World Cup 2003 has been surprisingly low, considering how closely the matches were followed, especially by Indians. The grand old man of Indian sports literature, Kishen R. Wadhwaney, was the first to the post. He wrote not just about the game but also offered an investigative insight into the scandals, controversies (13 of which are listed here), organizational lapses and inside stories of this World Cup. 																								Four of the 13 chapters of the book contain details of the matches, including scorecards, and one on the opening ceremony. One chapter is devoted to Sachin Tendulkar (the man of the tournament with 673 runs from 11 innings) and other Indian batsmen, and another to a comparison among the leaderships of Saurav Ganguly, Ricky Ponting and Stephen Fleming. Another interesting chapter is on the notable fast bowlers of the tournament, Brett Lee, Shane Bond, Shoaib Akhtar and Javagal Srinath. The most interesting chapters, however, deal with cricket and sex, sponsorship deals and the organization of Indian cricket. 																								The chapter on sponsorships and money is full of valuable albeit little-known information. Besides listing how more than Rs 1,000 crore were spent on marketing the World Cup, Wadhwaney delves deeper into how and why the four main sponsors  Hero Honda, Pepsi, LG Electronics and South African Airways  spent more than $22 million each. It was a cup of joy indeed for the television companies and their sponsors, Nimbus gained about Rs 100 crore, Sony Set Maxs subscription grew to 50 million households and Doordarshan bagged Rs 20 crore. 																								Mandira Bedi and her noodle straps get as much attention as John Wright, Adrian Le Roux, Andrew Leipus and Sandy Gordon who worked in concert to better the performance of Team India. 																								Wadhwaney is all praise for the Indian cricket boards decision to go international in team management. Wright, Le Roux, Gordon and Leipus were successful, thinks the author, because they did not suffer from regional bias. 						NOVY KAPADIA

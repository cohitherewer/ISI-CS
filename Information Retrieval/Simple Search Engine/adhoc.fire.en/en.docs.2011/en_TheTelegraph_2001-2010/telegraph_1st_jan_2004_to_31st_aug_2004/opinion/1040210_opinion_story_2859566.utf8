The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 							 																						COST OF PACKAGING A NATION PARIMAL BHATTACHARYA																					India is shining  well, at least on the pages of newspapers and magazines. Whether the beaming faces and radiant assertions are real, or just electoral mirages coming out of the government of Indias publicity mills, can be fought over by politicians and economists. The fact is, with a Rs 250-crore budget and an army of top-notch ad agencies, the National Democratic Alliance government has unleashed an unprecedented image-building exercise.																					The ethical and legal aspects of the exercise, with the elections a few weeks away and better ways of spending the Rs 250-crore sum, can be argued over. But let us leave aside these hard issues, and focus instead on the semantics of the campaign and its impact on the culture of advertising.																					First, we must concede that the present government is not the first to drumbeat its image in professional corporate fashion. It was Rajiv Gandhi who had roped in private advertising agencies in the Eighties to sell his persona and the vision of India progressing towards the 21st century. P.V. Narasimha Rao followed in his footsteps. He took advantage of the multiple television channels in the new era of liberalization of the early Nineties. One still remembers those ads showing the wizened ex-prime minister, dressed in uncharacteristic shirt and trousers, walking down beaches or toggling a computer, as the Mera Bharat Mahan tune plays in the background.																					Here and now																					So, what is so new about the colourful India Shining advertisements splashed across the pages of newspapers and glossies?																					One fundamental difference seems to be this: while most such advertisements, from a government department or a party in power, tend to hinge on the promise of a better future, especially on the eve of a general election, the thrust of the India Shining campaign is on a vibrant and glorious present. The accent is on here and now, rather than on the future. It is Weve done it, rather than Rajiv Gandhis famous, and much parodied, hume karna hai (We have to do).																					The promise of a rosy future is an inalienable part of our electoral culture, notwithstanding the perpetual differance or postponement that occurs between the promises and their fulfilment. From the Bharatiya Janata Partys Ram Rajya to N. Chandrababu Naidus e-governance, the rhetoric and imagery of the promised futures are varied. The anti-incumbency trend seen in the recent general and state elections has forced the political parties to latch on more to the future than to the past or the present.																					Attitude problems																					Seen in this context, the India Shining campaign stands out as a tour de force. The full-page colour advertisements not only sell a shining present rather than a future, but more important, they sell a buoyant attitude popularly known as the feel-good factor. And therein lies the catch. One can fight statistics with counter-statistics; but fighting an attitude is a complicated proposition. Whether the opposition parties really wish to fight the feel-good attitude generated by certain economic indicators, is another matter.																					The cleverness of the ad campaign becomes apparent if one takes a closer look at some of the photographs accompanying the texts. One is struck by the ordinariness, even banality, of the settings and characters. In one such photograph of an old farmer with a hookah and an old woman, the woman has several teeth missing and probably cataract in her eyes. Without touching up or glamorization, it seems to say: Look, we know things havent really changed at the ground level; that unemployment is rising in spite of economic growth; that people still go hungry while foodgrains rot in godowns; that the state has relinquished its duties to its poor people. But India is Shining, and you will betray the cause of the nation if you do not believe in it!																					The images succeed, riding on a four-letter word: hype. The people who created them sell tooth-pastes and potato chips. The India Shining advertisements show that even an unhealthy nation can be sold with proper packaging and a right slogan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 							 																						WITHOUT A STATE																														Every country has its laws to decide how migrants can become citizens. It is a pity that for forty years, New Delhi has been unable to decide what to do with the Chakmas of Arunachal Pradesh. The result is a bizarre situation which has made these Chakmas a people without a state. They have lived in Arunachal Pradesh since 1964, when the Indian government settled them there after much of their land was inundated by a dam. The Chakmas were thus neither illegal settlers nor migrants who could have expected a raw deal from the government. Yet successive regimes in New Delhi and Itanagar have not only ignored their plea for citizenship and voting rights but have also worked overtime to stifle it. And every government, irrespective of its political affiliation, has used the bogey of local sentiments to do so. Every political party in the state has surrendered to xenophobic arguments that oppose the granting of citizenship and voting rights to the Chakmas. Elections are obviously the time when the issue resurfaces, prompting the parties to repeat, predictably, their known positions. 																														What is overlooked every time is the subversion of justice by both the Union and the state governments. A ruling by the Supreme Court in 1996 granted the citizenship right to Chakmas born in India between January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987. Another court judgment in 1997 asked the state government to register the Chakmas as voters. Instead of abiding by the court directives, successive governments in Itanagar did their best to block the Election Commissions efforts to enroll them as voters. The ECs decision to suspend all electoral activities in Chakma-inhabited areas in the state until the issue is sorted out is clearly an indictment of both the Union and state governments. The supposed political risk of granting citizenship and voting rights to these people cannot be an excuse for this blatant violation of the law. But politicians are known to bend the law to suit their ends. If the previous Congress government in New Delhi had reneged on its responsibility on this, the record of the Bharatiya Janata Party has been just as opportunistic. The Union home minister, Mr L.K. Advani, had once championed the cause of the Chakmas inside and outside Parliament. The ministry had once recommended that the issue be settled once and for all by creating three additional seats in the state assembly reserved for the Chakmas. Now that the party rules both at the Centre and in the state, it has decided to go the way of previous governments. It is one more example of political expediency riding roughshod over law and justice.

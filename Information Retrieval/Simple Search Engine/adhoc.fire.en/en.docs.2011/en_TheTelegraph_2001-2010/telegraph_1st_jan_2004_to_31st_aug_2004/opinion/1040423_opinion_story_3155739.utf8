The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 23, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Reflections on love and truthThe mirror makers (Arrow, 3.95) by Clare Colvin is fun for anyone who likes a rollicking tale of love, intrigue and danger set in a remote historical period. This is the story of Andrea Allegri, a mirror-maker seduced from Venice into the colourful and sinister world of Louis the XIV, among beautiful women and scheming men who inhabited the regions in and around the Palace of Versailles. The themes of reflection and illusion run through the novel, bringing out the deeper conflicts not only between truth and falsity but among the many faces of truth as well.The good hotel guide 2004: Continental Europe (Ebury, 10.95) edited by Adam and Caroline Raphael has unsurprisingly run into its 27th edition. This is Volume II and it contains write-ups on 1,000 hotels in 18 countries. Volume I, published in 2003, covered the United Kingdom and Ireland. This is really far more than just a guide, although it is immeasurably useful as one, especially for the traveller who likes peace and the personal touch. Instead of chain hotels or famous urban ones, the guide looks for smaller places, often in rural areas, but never with less than three rooms. Guest-houses, inns, B amp;Bs and hotels with striking character and surroundings are preferred. The recommendations come from correspondents and inspectors who have stayed in the hotels. For the armchair traveller, too, this is an enjoyable and unusual read. Chile: The other September 11 (Left Word, Rs 85) edited by Pilar Aguilera and Ricardo Fredes is a slim but explosive reminder of another Tuesday, another September 11, that in 1973. That is the day on which Pinochet led the Chilean armed forces to oust the democratically elected government of Allende in a coup. The Chilean people will overthrow fascism! promises Fidel Castro in the last line of the book, which contains writings, poems and speeches by Salvador Allende, Ariel Dorfman, Pablo Neruda, Matilde Neruda, Joan Jara, Beatriz Allende and others. The horror of betrayal, the sense of dishonour and misery, the fury against US involvement and revolutionary passion have been captured in this unusual collection, which seeks to reclaim this earlier September 11 against the Americans aggressive claims for their very own September 11 in 2001.The heart divided (Penguin, Rs 375) by Mumtaz Shah Nawaz is both intellectually challenging and emotionally moving, telling the story of two sisters struggling to find the right path that undivided India should take after 1930. The self-searching faith of Zohra, the heroine, reflects the brilliant authors own travails, and her painful but considered evolution from belief in an undivided nation to the hope in the birth of a new one. Unconventional in its approach, this pre-Partition novel, published outside of Pakistan many years after its young authors untimely death, also raises uncomfortable questions about the received notions of wise marriage in this part of the world.The bride from Odessa (Harvill,  6.60) by Edgardo Cozarinsky has a disturbingly contemporary theme, that of travellers without a country, while its form is comfortingly old-fashioned: it is a collection of short stories. The stories are different in time and place, set in Buenos Aires, Lisbon, Vienna, Budapest and Odessa, before and after World War II. But together they seem to form one larger, yet untold, tale, told from ever-new points of view. The background being the diasporas of, not just Jews, but many displaced or immigrant peoples all over the world, the breaking of old frontiers and building of new ones, the stories have acquired the sharpness and immediacy of everyday desolation and pain.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 29, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Promises are meant to be kept				 																																																				Sir  It is a pity that the vice-president of the Andhra Pradesh unit of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Muralidhar Rao, thinks that the five per cent reservation for Muslims in jobs and education in the state is a religious quota and an unhealthy academic practice (Court puts minority quota on hold, July 23). The quota for Muslims is one of the electoral promises made by the Congress and there is no reason why it should not fulfil it now that it has come to power. Does Rao know that, as per a minorities report, 65 per cent of Muslims in the state are below the poverty line and that the literacy rates are abysmal too? In the face of it all, surely there is no reason for Rao and his supporters to feel insecure? Socio-economic differences have become more pronounced in the state as it has in most other places of the country, and the reservation is a move intended to iron them out. Besides, it would also help ensure that the voice of the minority community is heard. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S. Hossain, Calcutta
				 																Penalty call				 																																																				Sir  The Bombay high courts order directing the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena to pay compensation for the public loss caused during the bandh they called in July 2003 is an exemplary measure (Court slaps penalty for bandh, July 24). The Supreme Court and several high courts have time and again asserted the democratic view that citizens lives, earnings and access to emergency services must be protected. Political parties need to understand better what, and whose, democratic rights of disruption they are invoking. We have peculiar instances of small groups, including a party with just one member in the parliament now, egging people on to protest and disrupt. The slogans used reveal a skewed notion of democratic rights. The right to protest is all very well, but the masses cannot be held hostage while the raucous few hold up roads and transport. The right of assembly (not protest, which is frequently a consequence of it) to push for social justice needs to be exercised with greater caution.				 																																																				It would be better if the bigger political parties were to draw up a code of conduct, enforceable in court, limiting large assemblies to, perhaps, Sundays, and to locations where they would cause little disruption. But the courts and the political class seem too engrossed in incidental issues for a common view to emerge. Being a relatively new democracy with much diversity of political thought, there is yet no clear consensus on such issues. But such a consensus will have to emerge soon.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Conscientious citizens should support such stringent measures as the recent Bombay high court order against bandhs (Ban architects support fine July 25). In fact, they should call for such orders on bandh organizers from other high courts. For there is no doubt that if the leaders and cadre of political parties were made to pay for calling and enforcing bandhs, there would be no bandhs in India. Surely, parties can express their grievance without upsetting normal life? In the West, people and organizations take out peaceful processions and stage demonstrations in public areas without disrupting traffic or daily life. Why cant political parties in India, especially West Bengal, do the same? Most people are forced to stay home on bandh days for fear of the consequences if they went out. Political parties should not misread fear for respect. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Ohio, US

				 																																																				Sir  Those who filed the PIL as also the Bombay high court judges who awarded huge fines on the BJP and Shiv Sena, need to be thanked. The two political parties have hopefully been taught a lesson. Perhaps the fine will also serve as a warning to other political parties who have similar ideas. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nilin Bhaduri, Durgapur

				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjee has once again cleverly called a bandh on a Monday so that she and everyone else can enjoy a long weekend (Bandh cry on day of double whammy, July 22). I am sure that nobody in West Bengal supports this unnecessary bandh. But many will stay indoors for fear of the Trinamool cadre. Why does Banerjee not realize that the people have rejected her party? She has no right to disrupt the lives of ordinary people, many of whom stand to lose their daily earnings because of the bandh. Far from being a wounded tigress, Banerjee is behaving like a cornered cat.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Political parties may be justified in saying that the ban on bandhs is an attack on their democratic rights since Article 19 of the Constitution allows every citizen the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. Choosing not to work, voluntarily, cannot be an offence. But political parties frequently use coercive tactics to enforce bandhs. It is this the Bombay high court has ruled against.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dhrubajyoti De, Indore

				 																																																				Sir  Bandhs are despised by most people, except for political activists and employees who only need an excuse to stay away from work. While those who support bandhs say they are an expression of their political rights, in most cases, bandhs are marked by a rise in crime, looting, arson and so on. 				 																																																				It will thus be interesting to see whether the Bombay high court order is obeyed. In this regard, the August 2 bandh in West Bengal, which will give the state three consecutive holidays, should be called off as a mark of respect to the high court ruling.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

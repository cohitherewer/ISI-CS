The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 01, 2004 							 																						IT TAKES																													A																													VILLAGE If there is one plank that H.D. Deve Gowda has underscored, it is the plight of the farmer. Fortunately for him, it is the rural vote that will make or break many electoral fortunesOther sons of the soil
Chaudhary Charan Singh: The Jat leader was the first farmer-Prime Minister of India 
	Mahender Singh Tikait: The west Uttar Pradesh farmer shot into prominence after storming Delhi in 1989
	Sharad Joshi: The former leader of the Shetgari Sangathan is now with the NDA.																														Some phrases stick on. Years after a Prime Minister of 10 months called himself a humble farmer, the epithet still best describes the man who was never greatly humble, nor ever just a farmer. But in a world where bulls and bullocks represent two different and seemingly conflicting realms, Haradanahalli Dodde Gowda Deve Gowda has opted for the latter  and brought the former crashing down.																														The results are a long way off, but it seems as if out in the states, a fast-moving hi-tech India is being overtaken by a snail-paced rural Bharat. Farmers  pushed into the margins of development  are elbowing out the high-profile faces of the cybercities. And like Aesops fabled tortoise, H.D. Deve Gowda appears to be plodding ahead of Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna. 																														If the assembly election results follow exit poll forecasts, it will be the fistful of seats won by Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) party that will decide on the next ruler in a hung assembly. Round one has gone to Deve Gowda and his band of farmers.																														If there is, apart from secularism, one plank that Deve Gowdas eponymous party has underscored, it is the plight of the farmer. Three years of drought in Karnataka have squeezed the life out the peasant community. The government admits that about 800 farmers have killed themselves in recent years, though the unofficial figure is somewhere around 2,000. And this is the issue that most moves Deve Gowda, the 71-year-old leader of the Vokkaliga community  a predominantly peasant caste. It is the issue that Karnataka observers believe Krishna  also a Vokkaliga  failed to take note of.																														Its also the issue, they stress, that pulled Deve Gowda out of political oblivion two years ago. The former Karnataka chief minister, who faced a humiliating defeat from Hassan  his home-town  in 1999, won a by-election from the Kanakapura Lok Sabha constituency mainly on the strength of his campaign for farmers.																														Just before the by-election, coconut farmers  badly affected by the drought  were out on the streets, agitating for a license to sell coconut liquor, or neera. The police fired at them, killing two farmers.																														Deve Gowda carried the bodies to the collectors office, demanding justice. And he won the election.																														In this election, Deve Gowda has fought from both Kanakapura and Hassan and single-mindedly espoused the cause of the farmer. His colleagues in the Janata Dal stress that he has visited every home where a farmer has been killed. He has organised padayatras and led a dharna to New Delhi. He travelled in the general compartment with the farmers, says Janata Dal (S) general secretary and spokesperson Kunwar Danish Ali.																														This time round, too, he has mostly been travelling by car or train for his extensive campaigns. He is the only former Prime Minister I know who couldnt afford to hire a plane, says Ali. He has campaigned for 17 or 18 hours at a stretch  and he is now nursing his badly swollen feet, he says. It is said that he even mortgaged his house to take a loan of Rs 1.5 crore for the election.																														Its this aspect of the man who calls himself manninamaga  or the son of the soil  that his supporters swear by. When Deve Gowda led the Centre, he liked his ragi mudde (ragi ball) for it gave him energy as well as helped him control his serious blood sugar problem. When he was in 7, Race Course Road, the official cooks of the Prime Ministers residence had to learn how to make steamed ragi dumplings with sambhar tempered with chillies.																														But despite his air of humility, Deve Gowda is not a man who forgets his enemies. Among the first things he did on becoming Prime Minister was to expel his old friend-turned-foe, Ramakrishna Hegde, from the party. Not surprisingly, S. Jaipal Reddy  then with the Janata Dal  had this to say about Deve Gowda: If the party is like a house, then Gowda starts early in the morning every day to build it, brick by brick. And every night, he starts to dismantle it, brick by brick.																														Deve Gowda didnt make too many friends while in New Delhi either. Many still recall him merely as man who spoke no Hindi, or the one who embarrassingly dozed off in the middle of meetings.																														He was also the man who reposed enormous faith in astrology  which is something that he still bows to. Reports from Karnataka say that Deve Gowdas favourite soothsayers have told him that he stands a chance to make it to the High Table in 2004  as in 1996 when he was made the Prime Minister of the United Front government because its more powerful leaders couldnt reach a consensus.																														Deve Gowda is biding his time. As a true son of the soil and a humble farmer, I will rise from the dust and prove my detractors wrong, he says. The cooks at the Prime Ministers residence, however, are not quite making a sprint for the old recipes of ragi mudde.

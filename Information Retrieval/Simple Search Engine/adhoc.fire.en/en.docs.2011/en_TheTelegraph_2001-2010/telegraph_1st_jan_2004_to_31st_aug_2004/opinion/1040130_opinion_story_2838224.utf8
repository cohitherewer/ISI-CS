		 Friday, January 30, 2004 							 																						NOT ALIEN TO THE GAME OF POLITICS 				 	 Rising to the challenge Sonia: A biography By Rasheed  Kidwai, Viking, Rs 399  It is Atal Bihari Vajpayee versus  Sonia Gandhi in the battle for the fourteenth Lok Sabha.  Once again, the Bharatiya Janata Party is focusing on the  disparity between the swadeshi septuagenarian, with  over 50 years in public life and the videshi widow  who arrived in politics through the family route six years  ago.																					A common grouse against Sonia is that she avoids the media, and even after six years at the helm of the Congress and over four as leader of the opposition, she remains an enigma. Not much is known about the 57-year-old widow who is offering herself for the top job in the country of one billion.																					Rasheed Kidwais Sonia fills this void with a ringside view of the functioning of the woman the BJP is so afraid of that it is willing to change the law to block her rise to the prime ministers office. Kidwai, a journalist who has for 13 years been telling the Congress story as it unfolds, traces Sonias transformation from a widow grieving behind the high walls of 10 Janpath into the head of Indias oldest party, who clocks 16 hours a day despite being an asthma patient.																					The book starts at the tragedy in Sriperumbudur and travels through the Congresss search for a successor, Sonias refusal to take Rajiv Gandhis place, the rise and fall of P.V. Narasimha Rao, and then Sitaram Kesris exit, Sonias first steps in politics at Sriperumbudur, her taking charge of the Congress in 1998, the rebellion of 1999, Sonias retreat and finally, her thumping return.																					Along the way, it goes back to the time Sonia was the favourite bahu of Indira Gandhi  choosing sarees for her and cooking for the family  and traces her not-so-good equation with her sister-in-law, Maneka. In a balanced account, Kidwai examines the question of Sonias faith, the charge that she is guided by a coterie and the many controversies  her Italian origin and the Bofors issue, among others  that continue to dog her.																					As he traces Sonias rise, Kidwai offers a view of the Congress backroom and the game of musical chairs played out inside. He also throws light on her equation with Narasimha Rao, Kesri, Arjun Singh and Sharad Pawar, always the source of much speculation.																					But perhaps of most interest and relevance is the account of Sonias grooming as a politician. Her inexperience troubles even those who have no quarrel with a person of foreign birth taking the countrys highest office. The question is: Is a woman who was a housewife only six years ago equipped to lead India?																					Kidwai reveals how Sonia the student  who regularly interacts with experts, taking copious notes  and Sonia the fighter  who, when challenged or humiliated, prepares to get even  has been learning the ropes. He examines her three-step management style  consulting the maximum number of people, formulating a policy and then taking the party along  and points to the changes she has brought in the Congress, making it more gender-sensitive and financially transparent. And he sets at rest any speculation that Sonia is not serious about taking a shot at the top job, asserting that if the Congress were to return to power, she would be the sole claimant to the prime ministers post.																					A fair but sympathetic account of Sonias progress as politician, the book is obviously handicapped by the fact that it is not an authorized biography, a limitation Kidwai admits. It is a portrait drawn from accounts of Congress leaders and workers and from the authors own observation of the party in the 13 years that he has reported on it. Written lucidly, spiced with anecdotes and offering an inside view of the Congress, Sonia is a very readable book.						HARSHITA KALYAN

		 Friday, February 06, 2004 							 																						AN ACT OF BAD FAITH				 	 Playing a different game Batting for the Empire: A Political  Biography of Ranjitsinhji By Mario Rodrigues, Penguin,  Rs 299 What if someone were to write a cricketing biography of Jawaharlal Nehru? He occasionally did turn up for the annual MPs match in Delhi and as a boy he must have been forced to play in his school, Harrow, which has a strong cricketing tradition. It would be absurd, isnt it? For Nehru was not a cricketer at all. So how does one justify a political biography of Ranjitsinhji, the famous cricketer.?																					Ranji  as he was known throughout the cricketing world  had no claims to fame outside the cricket field. As a cricketer, he became a legend in his own lifetime. He was an outstanding batsman and a superb slip fielder. His success in test cricket was limited but in English county cricket, playing for Sussex, Ranji was unstoppable. But the cricketing career of Ranji is not the subject of this book. One could even add that there is no need for another book on this subject since all the important aspects of this part of Ranjis life are now well-known to lovers of cricket or more correctly, to lovers of the history of cricket.																					Mario Rodrigues chooses to concentrate on Ranji as a ruler of his little kingdom. What he has to say is hardly earth-shattering. Ranji was a whimsical despot, he was exploitative and oppressive and he was a toady of the raj. He wanted the perpetuation of British rule and of his own privileged lifestyle. Which Indian native prince, major or minor, was any different from this? What point is being made here by Rodrigues by emphasizing these features of Ranjis life and personality? Whoever expected him to be any different? It is indeed ridiculous to expect that just because Ranji was a good cricketer, he would be a good and fair ruler, completely atypical of his class and social upbringing. It is as absurd as expecting Nehru to be a good cricketer just because he went to Harrow. It is perfectly possible for an outstanding batsman to be a degenerate ruler especially if he happened to be born a native prince in India.																					It is true that Ranji, even though he was the first cricketer from India to achieve international acclaim, did nothing to promote cricket in India. He even stopped his nephew, Duleep, from representing India. Ranji considered himself to be an English cricketer. It probably was beneath his dignity, as a player, to consider himself as an Indian cricketer since the game was in its infancy here. Here, he was different from the maharajas of Porbandar and Patiala. But it is also important to remember that Ranji was a much better cricketer than the other two.																					It is difficult, therefore, to find the major point of this book unless it is the most banal one which says that Ranji was utterly loyal to the raj. This is a pity since the book has an enormous amount of well-researched details about the relationship between the princes and the British government. This is by itself an important subject but the same cannot be said about Ranjis political life and career as a ruler. The author rather trails his coat in this regard by providing an appendix about Ranjis cricket statistics and none pertaining to his political life.																					The book is an act of bad faith because the project of writing a political biography of a great cricketer is an absurd and an impossible one. It cannot rise above the puerile. It might be radical chic to criticize a native prince for being a bad and exploitative ruler or for being loyal to the king and emperor to whom he owed his allegiance. But all this is very predictable stuff and carries very little interest. A cricket lover will be bored stiff by details of Ranjis so-called political life, and a historian will find most of the analysis to be old hat. And a historian-cum-cricket lover can only bemoan the ahistoricity of the analysis and the attempt to badmouth a great batsman.						RUDRANGSHU MUKHERJEE

		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 							 																						BLACK INK ON YOUR NAIL Gouri Chatterjee																					MTV is doing it, so is Channel V. Now the Indian Express is joining the bandwagon. All have launched programmes to egg on young India to think politics. The underlying assumption, of course, is that todays youth have to be press-ganged into their social responsibilities. 																					Channel V has started the The Big Vote that has two funky VJs shouting slogans like It means a lot to get the dot, Choose or lose and Generation Next! Your vote is the Big vote on Mumbai campuses. MTV has celebrities saying much the same things on Rock the Vote.																					The Indian Express group, declares a press release, has initiated the Black Ink on your Nail campaign to motivate and mobilize todays youth to cast their vote and make the voters black mark a sign to be proud of. It too is roping in film personalities, sports persons and celebrities from all walks of life to get the message across.																					In other words, the media wants the MTV generation to get real. And therell be photographers lining the polling booths this April-May to capture Gen Next rising to more than the Thums Up challenge. In a country where 56 per cent of the population is below 25, the youth have to be the story of the first general election of the new millennium.																					Thus are media myths perpetuated. First the media feeds us the image of the urban Indian youth interested in only the good life. It then launches a campaign to reform them, which could of course help to catch em young as elections are famously known to raise circulation figures and rating points. Finally, the media can either pat itself on the back for a job well done or, if not, throw up its hands in despair. 																					The question is, where did the media get its stereotype of the Indian youth in the first place? All journalists dont look so old.																					Women in print																					Women journalists may be out there fighting for truth, exposing the corrupt and the criminal, holding the government to account, and committing other acts of derring-do. But when it comes to their own workplace, women journalists become just women.																					This may not be quite what the national commission for women will say when its report, Status of Women Journalists in the Print Media is released. But this is the inescapable conclusion from the findings of this novel study that the NCW commissioned and the Press Institute of India executed.																					One out of five women journalists acknowledge being passed over during promotion time solely because of their sex, but one has never heard of any protest movement on this ground. Almost half (40.2 per cent) hesitate to speak out or lodge a formal complaint when they are sexually harassed because it might appear trivial or an over-reaction. One of three (31 per cent) are blissfully unaware if any equal employment policy existed in their organization. 																					But few are prepared to even fill out a form telling the world or at least the NCW of their sad state of affairs. As the report laments, the response rate to questionnaires distributed among women working in the print media was a dismal 11.5 per cent. 																					Spinning Boris																					Last Sunday, even as Vladimir Putin sailed to a second term in the Kremlin, Americans watched Spinning Boris, a TV film that chronicled the hair-raising exploits of three political consultants from California in a much more closely fought Russian presidential election eight years ago. It was not all make-believe.																					Early in 1996, three American campaign consultants were actually summoned to Moscow, where they spent the next few months in a hotel, almost as prisoners, until Boris Yeltsin won. The American tricks worked.																					With elections in so many parts of the world this year, the California sages are likely to be hugely busy. (Their most recent client was Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Still, they might consider a trip to the worlds largest democracy. Is anyone in Delhi listening?

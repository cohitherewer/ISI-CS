The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 							 																						CORRUPT LOGIC																														If power corrupts, it also desensitizes. The manner in which West Bengals transport minister, Mr Subhas Chakraborty, reacted to a road accident in Calcutta was not just appalling; there was something sickening about the arrogance and insensitivity of his reaction. Worse still, the minister seemed to be savouring his own perverse logic on the unavoidability of accidents on the streets or in life. The least that the families of the victims could expect from the minister are some words of comfort. The public would have expected him to express the governments anxiety to try and prevent such accidents in future. But Mr Chakrabortys remarks betrayed a cynical disregard of both public sentiments and a sense of responsibility expected of an elected representative of the people. Long years in power seem to have so desensitized the minister that he failed to see the ugliness of his own words. More disturbing for the people would be the ministers refusal to be accountable for the failures of his own department. It would be futile to expect officers of his department to measure up to their responsibilities if the minister himself refuses to admit to their failings. Mr Chakraborty has not only showed himself in a poor light but also set a bad example for the administration.																														Yet, he had much to answer for. The accident tragically brought to light the dismal state of administration in state transport corporations. The fact that it happened because the brakes of a state bus failed points to a dangerous drift. In any civilized society, people responsible for the lapse would be promptly identified and taken to task. Mr Chakraborty, however, presides over a system which has clearly gone to seed. State transport units are over-staffed, ill-managed and notorious for the employees lack of a work-culture. Perennially running at a loss because of an inept administration, they are also huge drains on the public exchequer because of the subsidies on which they survive. The accident should have motivated Mr Chakra- borty to start clearing up the mess. But the way he sought to shirk his own  and the governments  responsibility holds no hope for better and safer public transport.

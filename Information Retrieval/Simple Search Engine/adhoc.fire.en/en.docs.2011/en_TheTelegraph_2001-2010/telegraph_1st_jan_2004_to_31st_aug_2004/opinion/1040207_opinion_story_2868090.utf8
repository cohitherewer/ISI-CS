The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 07, 2004 							 																						A MAN AND A GUN Bofors is yesterdays news. Ms  Sonia Gandhi will be well advised not to spend her life  staring into the rear-view mirror A week is a long time in politics.  Seventeen years, by the same reckoning, marks an era. Indeed,  in the light of contemporary politics, the years that Rajiv  Gandhi was at the helm of affairs seem like an era in the  distant past. So the announcement from the court that he  has been exonerated in the Bofors case does not create much  of a stir anywhere. The Bofors scandal does not even cause  a flutter today, and the amount involved in it is small  beer compared to scams of more recent vintage. The long  legal process and the labyrinthine nature of the case itself  have taken away from the excitement that was originally  present in the very name Bofors. It is difficult to imagine  now the enormous turmoil that led to the unseating of Rajiv  Gandhi because his name was associated with the scandal  surrounding the Bofors gun. It did seem then that political  power flows from the barrel of a gun, although not in the  sense that Mao Zedong originally meant that comment. The  Delhi high court noted the fact that Rajiv Gandhi had been  tried by the media and pronounced guilty even before the  court had actually begun to hear the case. Every newspaper  and magazine carried stories on Bofors, even though very  few understood the nature of the case. Very few of the stories   if any  were in favour of Rajiv Gandhi. His involvement  in the kickbacks was kind of taken for granted. His exoneration  can hardly serve to remove the stain on his integrity, which  he bore to the grave. The court judgment can only bring  some relief and satisfaction for his wife and children.																														The lack of interest regarding Rajiv Gandhi and his lack of involvement in the Bofors money only underline the wellknown fact that yesterdays news does not even raise an eyebrow. Bofors has been overtaken by new concerns and debates: liberalization, religious fundamentalism, Indo-Pak relations, new equations with the United States of America and so on. These, and not the Bofors gun, will determine the future of India. Even from the narrow point of view of Indias security and defence, the Bofors gun is pass. The fickle nature of public memory might appear too cynical to some people but that is part of the reality of political life. Scandals, like a fashion models glamour, are by nature fleeting in character.																														Without gainsaying the pain that Ms Sonia Gandhi suffered because of the allegations against her husband and by his brutal death, she will be well advised not to spend her life staring into the rear-view mirror. The past might serve to mould her inner persona, but her political personality must look forward. Her vision of India must be grounded in present concerns and not on past grief. India is poised on the brink of momentous changes and is now preparing to take on the world in economic terms; the pull of the past is irrelevant to the transformation India is now experiencing. To an entire generation, Rajiv Gandhi and Bofors are no more than two names, if that. As the leader of the Congress and as the prime-minister-in-waiting, Ms Gandhi must look beyond her own grief and relief to present and future concerns. That will be her best tribute to her husband  a man who dreamt of a new India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 							 																						BULL FIGHTING																								The euphoria over the Indian economy extends to the sensitive index, which has crossed 6,000, and is still climbing. Some bullishness about the economy is indeed transient and will eventually come down to earth. Instances are the 8.4 per cent growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2003-04 or the belief that the state elections have demonstrated that governments are all about governance. Other elements of bullishness are more permanent. However, does the behaviour of the Sensex reflect such fundamental strengths? Had the index climbed by 30 per cent a year, one might have argued that the capital market reflected macro fundamentals. But not when the increase is more than 100 per cent in six months. Understandably, the spectre of two earlier bubbles in the Nineties is being raised. Stock market analysts are right in arguing that the rally this time is more broad-based and is not concentrated on a few scrips. But in addition to the issue of correction, there remains the question of governance and regulation, highlighted in the two earlier scams. The Reserve Bank of India has rightly asked banks to increase margins on funding against shares and initial public offer financing. Banks also have to collect a minimum cash margin on bank guarantees. In addition, through stock exchanges, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has tightened the risk taken by brokers.																								However, as the two earlier scams demonstrated, the problem does not always lie in the absence of guidelines and norms, but in their effective enforcement. Today, the upward movement in the Sensex is driven more by foreign institutional investors, since returns in India are far more than anything obtainable elsewhere. Retail investors have generally stayed away, thanks partly to the caution the two earlier scams generated. But sooner or later, retail investors will sense lost opportunities, especially since correction doesnt seem imminent. When a bull run seems to continue unabated, cautious retail investors turn foolish and equity mutual funds yield to investments in individual equity. No amount of governance and regulation can adequately address problems of individual greed and foolhardiness. The high return is desired, but the high risk is not.

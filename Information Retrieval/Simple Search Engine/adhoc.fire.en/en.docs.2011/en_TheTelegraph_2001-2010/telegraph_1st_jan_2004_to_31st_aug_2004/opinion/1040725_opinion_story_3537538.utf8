The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 							 																						FINELY IN TUNE																														India is that storybook land where nobody is ever responsible for anything. And since fixing responsibility where it belongs is the least popular activity here, the Bombay high courts decision to fine two political parties for the bandh in Mumbai on July 30, 2003 should be greeted with relief. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena had called the bandh in protest against the cowardly action of the terrorists who caused the blasts in Ghatkopar and some blasts before that, and to draw the attention of the Maharashtra government to its dismal failure in this regard. The parties must pay up Rs 40 lakh to compensate the people for the economic loss inflicted on them. The ruling came in response to a public interest litigation filed by some individuals and non-governmental organizations, who felt that it was time to object to such a senseless form of protest.																														Two aspects of the complaint are particularly important. It focussed on public loss to the city, estimating it at Rs 50 crore. By translating the issue of civil and individual rights into money, the PIL struck where it hurts. It pointed to the loss in productivity. As a result, it not only emphasized the damage to Indias image at a crucial time  and Mumbai is seen as the finance capital of the country  but it also underlined the irresponsibility of political parties whose job it is to look after the interests of the people. In every way, it was a more forceful argument than one purely dependent on the violation of civil rights in terms of obstruction of movement. At another level, the PIL has exposed the coercive tactics of all political parties. It is clear that, in or out of power, parties are barely in touch with the general mood of the people. In insisting that the bandh was spontaneous and not enforced, the political parties in question have further undermined their own credibility. All bandhs are enforced, even if there is no visible turmoil, simply because people cannot do very much in the face of a complete disruption in transport and the threat of violence. Fines had been introduced in Britain by Ms Margaret Thatchers government during its drive in the Eighties against trade unions. The Bombay high court has imposed a fine on the political parties responsible, for this was not an industrial strike, and the money is to go towards the toning up of the citys transport system.																														The ruling is important in another way as well. The continued irresponsibility of politicians and the abdication of authority by the executive are giving rise to a new form of empowerment, that of the people. The route is not the expected one, but court rulings against bandhs  made repeatedly over the last few years  would have been evaded without the people coming up with a specific complaint. The myopia of politicians is best exemplified by the reaction of Ms Mamata Banerjee to the Bombay high court decision. The Trinamool Congress is determined to go ahead with its bandh in West Bengal on August 2, although this state too has its share of activists from the public who have been protesting against bandhs. With the courts behind them, perhaps the people of West Bengal will be able to activate the ban against bandhs soon.

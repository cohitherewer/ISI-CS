The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 02, 2004 							 																						NOT THE BEST WAY																														One instance of reversal in earlier government policy is in the United Progressive Alliances stance on the privatization of airports. Foreign direct investment equity has been capped at 49 per cent, unlike 74 per cent under the National Democratic Alliance, and scheduled Indian carriers have been allowed to pick up 10 per cent in the joint venture. However, this is only for the restructuring of Delhi and Mumbai airports. The Airports Authority of India and other public sector units can jointly hold 26 per cent in the joint venture and the remaining 25 per cent can be held by Indian entities, that is, companies incorporated in India and owned by Indians. Other changes involve increasing the mandatory deputation of AAI employees to joint-venture companies from two to three years and the requirement that bidders submit a human resource plan for absorbing the maximum number of existing employees in the joint venture. While Air Sahara and Jet Airways are reportedly interested, and the restructuring of Delhi and Mumbai will finally take place, this is not the best of ways to privatize or restructure or attract investments in infrastructure projects. The common minimum programme talks of doubling or trebling FDI inflows from present levels, without attaching a precise quantitative target. This means annual FDI inflows of anything between $ 10 and 15 billion. Soon after taking office, the finance minister argued that FDI policy would become completely transparent. Discretionary clearances through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and the FIPB itself would be disbanded. A separate authority would be set up to fast-track clearances and ensure that approvals were converted into inflows. While this makes eminent sense, the decision by the Empowered Group of Ministers on airport privatization hardly reflects this. 																														Presumably, the left opposition outside the CMP received much more importance than left support to the CMP from inside. The left argued that there was an implicit understanding that profit-making concerns would not be divested and these airports were certainly not loss-making. While Delhi and Mumbai airports will now ostensibly be privatized, there are concerns about the form this privatization is going to take. For instance, the argument that existing labour must be absorbed and bids evaluated on the basis of their human resource plans is not only illogical, it also smacks of the discretion that the finance minister has wanted to avoid. There will be further discretion when one begins to figure out what is strategic and what is not, from the point of view of allowing FDI or deciding equity caps. Whether it is FDI or privatization, however defined, the UPA governments pronouncements or actions do not inspire confidence.

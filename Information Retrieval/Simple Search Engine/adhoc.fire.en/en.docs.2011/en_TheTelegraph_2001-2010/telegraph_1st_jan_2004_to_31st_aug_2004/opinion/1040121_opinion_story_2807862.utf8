		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 							 																						MAKING AMENDS																														Polls and promises come together, only to be separated in no time. Little wonder, therefore, that another brave new world is promised for the North-east to coincide with the coming general elections. But for this element of scepticism, the business summit for the region, organized in New Delhi, could have generated great expectations. It is not the first time that tantalizing economic prospects have been projected for the region. There have been other times and occasions when promises were made to develop the North-east as the bridgehead to Indias new frontier of commerce with south-east Asia. But the regions resources and its proximity to countries like Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand and China have so far meant little for its development. The reasons for this have been known to generations of Indian planners  industrial backwardness and an abysmal lack of infrastructure. Also, the North-easts political insignificance contributed to its marginalization in New Delhis scheme of things. That this neglect of the region has been a costly mistake is proved in the unending saga of local mutinies and ethnic insurgencies. The regions economic story could have been very different if part of the money spent on fighting these militancies were utilized for its development.																														Some beginnings have been made though. The department of development of the north-east region, set up by the National Democratic Alliance government, raised hopes of a new approach. To give the NDA government its due, Central allocations for the region have risen sharply in the past five years to almost Rs 44,000 crore. But a new department or additional funds may not quite add up to a new policy perspective. After all, the North-eastern Council has existed for several decades for much the same purpose. The important thing is to plan and monitor the progress of the ambitious development projects. The story of two hydel power projects  in Arunachal Pradesh with an estimated cost of Rs 6,000 crore and in Sikkim, worth Rs 800 crore  underscores the need for a change in attitudes both of New Delhi and the state governments. A sense of urgency is needed to compensate for lost time and missed opportunities in the North-east.

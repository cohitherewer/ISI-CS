		 Monday, July 05, 2004 							 																						SHIFT FOCUS FOR BETTER RESULTS						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the West Bengal Human Development Report, 2004				 	 Bright horizons																														Material conditions: West Bengal is a middle-income sta- te, ranked ninth among the fifteen major states in terms of both per capita income (state domestic product) and per capita consumption expenditureIn 2000-01, the per capita SDP in WB was 64 per cent of that of the highest among the major states (Punjab), and was nearly three times that of the lowest (Bihar)...																														The most remarkable acceleration of growth occurred in agriculture. In the early Eighties, observers were talking of an agrarian impasse in the state, but in fact it was precisely from that period that agricultural output took off, making crop output in WB the most rapidly expanding in India for the Eighties as a whole. Most of this expansion occurred in foodgrain, especially rice. The moving force of this agricultural output expansion has been small cultivators, unlike the rest of India, and this was substantially due to the fact that productive forces were unleashed as a combination of land reform and greater power to decentralized elected bodies																														This reduced several institutional fetters to growth, making for more efficient use of land as well as greater utilization of groundwater resources, affecting both area and yield. However, the high rate of foodgrain output growth was primarily the result of yield expansionToday, WB is the largest rice producer among the states of India, accounting for more than 15 per cent of all rice production. 																														The introduction of boro rice (high-yielding rice variety), which was itself enabled by the spread of minor irrigation and the greater availability of rural credit, played a major part in increasing rice yields. There was significant shift of cultivated area away from aus towards boro, although aman remains the most important rice crop, accounting for more than 60 per cent of rice production... There is still scope for improvements in rice yields in the state...However, it is also true that there are several emerging problems associated with boro rice cultivation in terms of greater requirement and consequent effects on the water table, and tendency to monocropping in the boro areas. These in turn may have adverse implications for soil quality, such as greater salinity.																														Agricultural growth decelerated in the Nineties, although WB still had the highest rate of growth of food production in India. Some of this deceleration reflected the fact that boro rice, which had expanded extremely rapidly at more than 12 per cent per year in the Eighties, slowed down to around 5 per cent per annum, largely because the area under boro expanded much less rapidly.																														There was substantial crop diversification in WB in the Eighties and the Nineties. Both wheat and potato production increased...in the Nineties. WB is the second largest producer of potato (after Uttar Pradesh) and is first in terms of average yields. Jute output also accelerated to 5.4 per cent per year in the Nineties...																														Some of the most significant crop diversifications relate to horticulture. WB is now a major producer of vegetables accounting for around 17 per cent of total vegetable production in the country. It is worth repeating that all this has been the result of small to medium cultivators operations, and that there remains a lot of scope for further expansion of horticultural production. 																														Nevertheless, it must be recognized that the earlier expansion in crop output has slowed down in the Nineties, eventhough there is still potential for increasing yields in many crops. Many of the adverse features of greater market orientation and external liberalization at the national level which have affected farmers across India also impacted negatively on peasants in West Bengal. Thus cultivators in WB over the Nineties were hit by higher input costs, especially for seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, water and electricity; highly volatile, stagnant and even falling farmgate prices of foodgrains and some cash crops; sharp declines in access to formal credit and crop loans; inadequate investment in physical infrastructure such as roads as well as irrigation and water management; and declining access to agricultural extensions services run by the public sector. 																														Of these many adverse processes, the effects of rising input costs, falling output prices and declining access to institutional credit were probably the most serious. Even as farming became less economically viable, cultivators found it more difficult to access loans to continue their operations. By 2002, the credit-depost ratio of all banks in rural WB (commercial banks, regional rural banks and co-operatives) was as low as 26 per cent. The performance of co-operative banks has been far better than commercial banks in terms of providing credit to small and marginal farmers; also co-operative banks have significantly improved upon their ability to raise deposits. This suggests that future strategies of government concerned with improving conditions for agriculturalists, may now need to focus on these issues, especially the revival of rural extension services and credit to agriculture, in particular small farmers.

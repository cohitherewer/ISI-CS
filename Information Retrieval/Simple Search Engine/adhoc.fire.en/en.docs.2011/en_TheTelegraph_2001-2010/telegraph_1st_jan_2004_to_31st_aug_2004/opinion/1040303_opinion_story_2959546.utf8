The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 							 																						MAKE THEM PAY																														Bills are presented. Bills have to be paid. This is an unwritten rule by which everyday life is conducted across the world. In India a special class of people have to be reminded that they have unpaid bills. In a remarkable order, the Delhi high court asked the Election Commission to give full publicity to members of the 13th Lok Sabha who have piled up dues on civic amenities. It is estimated that altogether 656 sitting and former members of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha owe Rs 11.18 crore to the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and Rs 6.32 crore to the New Delhi Municipal Council for water and electricity. There is the assumption among members of parliament that they are above the normal conventions and that ordinary rules do not apply to them. There is also the propensity to take things for granted and to entertain the delusion that things come free for them. Elected representatives of the people do enjoy certain perquisites, among them are a number of free telephone calls, a certain amount of water and certain units of electricity. Invariably, MPs overshoot their free quota and then refuse to pay their bills for the services that they have enjoyed. The Delhi high courts order will help expose defaulting MPs and will inform voters about the irresponsibilities of their representatives.																														It is a telling comment on the state of politics and of the provider of utility services that the latter had to be told by the court to treat all citizens as equals. Civic bodies were instructed by the high court to disconnect phones, electricity and water supply of defaulting MPs. The fact that this simple thing has to be reiterated by the court suggests that not only do MPs consider themselves above the common run of people but they are treated as such by certain sections of society. Civic authorities who pamper MPs by not forcing them to pay their bills actually fail to do their jobs. Legislators should be aware that they cannot squander the tax payers money which pays for their perquisites. If they cannot live within the perks provided to them, they should pay for what they use like other citizens. The beneficiaries of democracy should be more sensitive to the idea of equality.

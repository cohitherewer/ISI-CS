The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Labour charges				 																																																				Sir  One cannot help being sceptical about Manmohan Singhs pious intentions of guaranteeing employment for hundred days, at the minimum wage, to at least one able-bodied person in rural, urban poor and lower middle-class households (Chambers all praise for progressive policies, May 28). Two things have to be kept in mind here. The National Employment Guarantee Act might have proved to be a trump card for the Congress in this general election, but it can also put it on a knife-edge. There can be a lack of funds, or the usual red-tapism may hinder the government. The party might even fail to create adequate employment opportunities for the able-bodied it has promised work. Another point. The Congress, in going overboard about guaranteeing employment, has not clearly stated whether it intends to start by imparting specific skills to the targeted unemployed. In an increasingly competitive economic environment, there is little scope for unskilled labour. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Aashish Mazumder, Calcutta
				 																Pristine hills				 																																																				Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray seems to have done extensive research before arguing why Ladakh needs to be preserved (Paradise under threat, June 5). However, there are a few factual errors in the article. Pinto Narboos fathers name was not Sonam Wangchuk but Sonam Norboo, who was also the engineer who constructed Leh airport in a very short period of time during the Pakistan-backed tribal invasion in 1948. Tsering Angmo, All India Radios station director, was never associated with the Congress, but she was a staunch supporter of the National Conference when the party was in power, although she was not supposed to support any party as a government servant. 				 																																																				The author writes that there are no media in Ladakh other than the radio. But Doordarshan exists there, as does a local English-Ladakhi bilingual magazine called Ladags Melong (Mirror of Ladakh). Also, the Hill Development Council was conceded in 1995 and not in 1993. Prior to the formation of the Autonomous Hill Council, politicians and bureaucrats sitting in Srinagar and Jammu would take important decisions for the Ladakhis without even having a proper idea of the ground-level conditions. The Hill Council, working closely with different non-governmental organizations, has taken up issues faced by the people, who can now hope for development in Ladakh. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Tsewang Rigzin, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Why is Sunanda K. Datta-Ray under the impression that Ladakh stands to lose its charm and cultural heritage because of the presence of the security personnel posted there, as well as the Sindhu Darshan festival that Lal Krishna Advani has foisted on Ladakh? As for the presence of the soldiers, there is no viable alternative to keeping surveillance over a sensitive area. Ladakh is not the sole exception in this regard. There are many other places in India where the presence of the police and security forces has disrupted everyday life. 				 																																																				The Sindhu Darshan festival is a great draw for tourists across the globe. Being present at the time of a local festival is probably the best way to get a taste of the local culture, and Sindhu Darshans popularity can be attributed to this. Besides, the steady stream of tourists to Ladakh during the time provides a source of income for many in that barren land. Datta-Ray has overlooked this important fact.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunanda Maitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is true, as Sunanda K. Datta-Ray points out, that roadside hoardings in Ladakh blight the wild beauty of the land. However, Datta-Ray is being a bit too harsh in his criticism. These hoardings, seen at every tourist destination, are few and far between. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manisha Poddar, New Delhi

				 																Empty threat				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjees threat to launch a statewide agitation over the proposed shifting of Coal Indias headquarters from Calcutta to Ranchi is unlikely to fetch any result (Mamata sees red over Soren remark, May 31). Neither would her friendship with the coal and mines minister, Shibu Soren. Instead of Banerjee organizing a stir in Calcutta, it would be more effective if the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which is part of the United Progressive Alliance, takes up the issue with the government at the Centre.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The decision of the Union defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, to invite Mamata Banerjee back into the Congress fold is a step in the right direction (Comeback call to Mamata May 30). The two parties should renew effort, without saffron support, to oust the left in West Bengal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  While Sonia Gandhi fought against all odds and managed to form a Congress-led government at the Centre, Mamata Banerjee, despite her popularity, could not translate her support into votes. The Left Front has romped home and the Congress has bettered on its earlier record. Banerjee does not realize that her political ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party has cost her dear.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manzar Imam, New Delhi

				 																Last word				 																																																				Sir  Though it is true that a large proportion of sexual abuse on girls is committed by family members or others known to and trusted by the victim, other facts should be noted (Still too many screens, May 30). Most victims of sexual abuse are children who are trafficked or forced into prostitution, sometimes by their own families as seen in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Radical socio-economic changes are needed to minimize abuse of children, but the role of relevant legal reforms is no less crucial. Unfortunately, the matter does not get the attention it deserves from social activists. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Moni Nag, New York, US

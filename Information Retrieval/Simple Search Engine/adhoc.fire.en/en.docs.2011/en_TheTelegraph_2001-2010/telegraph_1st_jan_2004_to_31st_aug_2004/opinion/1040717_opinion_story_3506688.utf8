		 Saturday, July 17, 2004 							 																						A WILL																													AND																													A WAY Rajendra S. Lodha was a family friend, much trusted and respected for his straightforward nature and knowledge of law and accounting procedures. Until he crossed the line...BIGGEST LOSERSYashovardhan: Grandson of Gajanan Birla, brother of M.P. Birla, Priyamvadas husband, could have legally staked claim to the Rs 5,000-crore empire in the absence of a will 
	Nadini Nopany: This daughter of K.K. Birla was known to be very close to Priyamvada, who made her a director of the group flagship, Birla Corporation
	Sudarshan Kumar: The son of Laxmi Niwas Birla learnt the tricks of the trade from his uncle M.P. and was close to Priyamvada.																														At Birla Park, the cluster of sprawling mansions at Ballygunge that senior members of the Birla clan had built, where some of them still live, the sound of the Honda City crunching up the graveled driveway is so common that it is hardly noticed. Also familiar is the silhouette of its owner, Rajendra S. Lodha, clad in a dark suit and starched white cotton shirt, with a muted silk tie, who would stride confidently through the gate of the house at the corner. Thats where Priyamvada, the 76-year-old widow of the late Madhav Prasad Birla, lived till her death a fortnight ago.																														Everyone knew that even though Lodha, the high-flying chartered accountant, was a family friend who sat on the boards of a dozen Birla companies managed by clan members other than Priyamvada, it was with her that the man had a special tie of trust and respect. It stretched way beyond the client-professional relationship. 																														She had made him the co-chairman of the companies in her command, including Birla Corporation, the flagship, and was thinking aloud that after her exit, the groups businesses and its schools, hospitals and philanthropic organisations should come under a trust, with Lodha, affectionately called Rajen by the older Birlas, as its sole trustee. The discerning Birlas appreciated the difference between an outsider managing companies within the family empire, and owning them, and thus remained unfazed.																														To them, the sound of the incoming Honda City never seemed as intrusive as on Thursday, when Lodha visited Birla Park to attend the 12th-day (barwah) observance of the death of Priyamvada. That was two days after he had read out to the Birlas the summary of her will, bequeathing her empire with Rs 5,000-crores assets to him, not to any relative. Though civilities were exchanged, the atmosphere of mourning was Teflon, at best, on the war plane. Family solicitors Khaitan amp; Co. had by then served a legal notice on Lodha, demanding a certified copy of Priyamvadas will and the right to inspect the original, all within 24 hours. The notice had been signed by three generations of the clan, including patriarchs G.P., B.K. and K.K., G.P.s son Chandra Kant, B.K.s grandson Kumar Mangalam, nephew Sudarshan and grand-nephew Siddharth, and M.P.s grand-nephew Yashovardhan. 																														Even the two sisters of the late M.P. Birla, Lakshmi Devi Newar and Radha Mohta, never on the best of terms with Priyamvada, had put their signatures on the notice, making it a picture of complete family solidarity against the assault of an outsider. Before serving the notice on Lodha, it was left to B.K., or Basant Kumar, to outline before the media the familys strategy: There is perfect harmony within the family. Unitedly well move the court we have the moral and legal right to challenge the validity of the will.																														While it is natural that the Birlas, particularly those who felt deprived of their due shares after early patriarch G.D.s death in 1983, feel that theyd be cheated twice if the holdings of the childless M.P.-Priyamvada couple go to an outsider, there are Birla-watchers who feel that Lodha is suspect because of his close knowledge of the internal workings of the familys businesses. 																														A second-generation professional and a gold medalist in his CA examination, Lodhas involvement with the Birlas is of a somewhat different nature than that of several old family retainers. It is said that, of all the Birlas, it was Adityavikram who appreciated Lodhas straightforward manners and his knowledge of both the law and the accounting procedures, even though hes not a lawyer. His Lodha amp; Co. therefore soon became the auditors to the B.K.-A.V. duos top-line companies such as Indo Gulf Corporation, Grasim, Mangalam Cement and Mangalam Timber. Besides, he became Adityavikrams right hand in Birla Global Finance, the arm that made a slew of highly profitable investments abroad in the 1980s, when the dollar was as precious as life. It gave him a rare insight into the family style of business post-G.D. 																														The Birlas usually do not approve of their surrogates cutting high public profile. But, with Lodha, it was a different matter. The entire clan stood by him as he was made, first, a vice-president, and then, senior VP and president, of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FICCI). He was the first professional to hold the post. Sudarshan Birla, who led the family chorus against Lodha last week, reportedly cooperated with him on FICCI matters as never before, contributing generously to its coffers during his tenure. Though Krishna Kumar Birla is a signatory to the notice served on Lodha, his daughter, Shobhana, who manages the Hindustan Times, agreed to head the FICCI media cell.																														Lodhas bonhomie with the extended family continued even after 2001, when Priyamvada made him the co-chairman and began talking aloud about her plans with him. 																														It was after his elevation in the M.P. Birla Group that India Smelters, one of the group companies which had originally belonged to the G.P.-C.K. group (which owns, among other companies, Hindustan Motors), was graciously handed back to it. 																														Besides, as Lodha rose in public life, holding positions in high-power committees for policy reforms, the family relished having him as one more of its voices in the government. The honeymoon ended last week.																														Lodha may be the man who knows too much. But he understands the Birlas just too well to underestimate their strength. His clients in Calcutta, most of whom are stalwarts in business, say that the man knows his onions and is the unlikeliest of candidates to send an infirm will for probate, something that the Birlas are obviously hoping will happen. 																														However strong a legal wicket he may stand on, the cloud of moral greyness will not lift so easily. Lodha, after all, was so unquestioningly accepted within the family precisely because he accepted the family on its own terms. He forgot however, being like a family member is not the same as being one.

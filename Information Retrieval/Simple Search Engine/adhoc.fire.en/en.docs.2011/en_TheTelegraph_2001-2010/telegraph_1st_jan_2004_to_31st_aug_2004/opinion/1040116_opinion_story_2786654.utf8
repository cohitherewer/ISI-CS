		 Friday, January 16, 2004 							 																						THROUGH A DARK CHAMBER OF SECRETS Arunjyoti Basu THE KING IS DEAD By Jim Fish, Flamingo,  15																								This novel is about relationships. Relationships between fathers and sons, between mothers and daughters. There are relationships complicated by the sons knowledge that their mother was part-coloured, a fact revealed to the sons only when their mother was on her deathbed. In America, towards the end of the 19th century, this mattered. The King is Dead is a book which moves between generations till it brings us to the present with the protagonist of sorts, Walter Selby.																								The other main character is Selbys son, Frank Cartwright. Cartwright is the name he got from his adopted parents, who adopted Frank and his sister, Gail. Their real father, Walter, killed their mother, Nicole. Nicole was killed because Walter had discovered her secret.																								There are a number of secrets in The King is Dead which makes the task of reviewing difficult  one has to be careful that one does not give anything away. The book is in two parts; if the first part revolves around Walter, the second part undoubtedly belongs to Frank Cartwright.																								There are interesting secondary characters. There is the man in New Jersey who wins a lottery. He disappears and his wife becomes a maid in a hotel. There is also a delightful smuggler (coyote), and a singer, the inspiration behind whose character can be easily identified. These secondary characters not only illustrate the range of Jim Fishs art, but they also make for very interesting reading.																								An issue that is raked up every now and then in the novel, though not overtly, is that of racism, a contentious issue in modern America. But even though it remains in the background, never threatening to barge into the forefront, it is clear that discriminating on the basis of complexion remains a fact of American life. It cannot be wished away.																								Readers get a glimpse of the South, though this is not a typically Southern novel. In fact, the second section moves away from Tennessee, where the first section is set. Neither is the novel particularly faithful to history.																								Fish writes fluently, which contributes to the readability of the work. The reader does not falter at any stage. In the end, it is a good story well-told, with all the strands woven together in a logical pattern.						ARUNJYOTI BASU

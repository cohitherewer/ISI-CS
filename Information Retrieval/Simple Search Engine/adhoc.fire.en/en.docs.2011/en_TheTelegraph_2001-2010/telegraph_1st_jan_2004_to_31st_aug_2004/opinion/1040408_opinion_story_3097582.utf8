The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 							 																						NOW ITS TIME FOR THE BLUES Gouri Chatterjee																					It is turning out to be shorter than an Elizabeth Taylor honeymoon. After rooting so full-throatedly for the cause of the management institutes, the media appear to be shattered by the IIMs surrender to Murli Manohar Joshi and his diktat on fees. 																					The media, especially the English language media, believed the faux war the headlines promised: IIMs prepare to strike back/ gear for battle/ fee countdown. When reality did bite, the tune changed to a disappointed capitulation, sell out and even deserter. Even the offer of talks with the minister by IIM Ahmedabad was dubbed compromise and climb down. After all that fire-eating, negotiated settlement sounded too tame.																					The medias inherent need for drama would have been enough to script a masala Western out of this classic struggle between the magnificent IIMs and the minister with the mindset of a clerk. In this case there was an added incentive: you could side with the good  and reader aspirations.																					What is less clear is why the dons, unnamed but ubiquitous in the press in the last two months, have lapped up the medias generosity. In fact, their only visible plan of action seems to be exposing the ministry through the media.																					Taking the issue to the peoples court helps the weaker party, one of them pointed out. But does that matter with a minister who has gone out of his way to show he revels in riding roughshod over academic bodies and moulding them in his own image? 																					Baldly put, as Joshis hatchet man, joint secretary V.S. Pandey, has: We are not bothered about your public opinion. What public opinion is this? Do you read any Hindi newspaper? Let me tell you, the public is hailing the decision.																					Yes, the media spotlight simply hardens positions, making it that much more difficult to work things out, if not amicably then at least across the table. The IIMs are at last waking up to this danger. An IIM Ahmedabad don has told reporters, the discussions with the ministry will be conducted away from the media glare. The medias embrace can be worse than its assault.																					In camera																					Its all the fault of the cameras. If there had been no cameras in Fallujah that day, then four Americans would not have been stoned, shot, burnt, dismembered, dragged through the streets and strung up on a bridge by a joyous mob. So Rupert Murdochs New York Post wrote last Thursday. 																					And dont think, it continued, that Associated Press Television just happened to turn up at the right place at the right time for the burning and hacking of corpses. After all, last week the AP had dramatic on-the-spot, perfectly timed, close-up photographs of insurgents firing at coalition troops. Clearly, someone at AP has a mutually beneficial relationship with the insurgents at Fallujah. 																					No one of course has ever accused the New York Post of impartiality. Still, this marked a new high in partisan journalism. Never before has one news organization made such an accusation against another. (For the curious: the Post too carried those photographs supplied by AP.)																					We all know that events are conceived only for the benefit of film  and exacerbated by the very presence of those filming it. Mamata Banerjee has long been considered a past master at such antics. Every day, serious as well as wholly inconsequential incidents are, in part or whole, designed for the cameras. But it is usually left to rival politicians to indulge in such accusations. New York Posts comment shows how Iraq has divided the media in America. 																					Not just toast																					Balasaheb Thackeray sipping his white wine from a silver flute, Jyotiraditya Scindia confidently breakfasting on toast and scrambled eggs, Mani Shankar Aiyar slurping up sambhar with his hands, Sachin Pilot having a wholesome lunch of sabji and raita these sights and sounds of our politicians on NDTV 24x7s Follow the Leader may not determine how you vote but they sure make for great viewing. And what is wrong with humanizing our politicians? And if they sound like characters from Rich and Famous, that would be right too.

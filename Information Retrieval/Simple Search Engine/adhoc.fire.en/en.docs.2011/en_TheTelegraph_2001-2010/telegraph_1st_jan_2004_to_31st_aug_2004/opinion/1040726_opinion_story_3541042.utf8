		 Monday, July 26, 2004 							 																						SO FAR SO GOOD																														There is a new Kelkar task force and this has submitted recommendations to the finance minister on the implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. The scope for expenditure reduction is limited. If anything, given the national common minimum programme, there will be greater need for public expenditure. Hence, fiscal consolidation following FRBM must be revenue-driven. In addition, fiscal consolidation must be front-loaded. So argues the new Kelkar task force, like the Economic Survey before it. If their commendations are followed, there will be a revenue surplus of 0.15 per cent of gross domestic product in 2008-09 and a fiscal deficit/gross domestic product ratio of 2.8 per cent. 																														So far so good, and the new recommendations follow the principles of the two earlier Kelkar task forces on direct and indirect taxes and are unexceptionable. First, on personal income taxation, there will be no exemptions barring those for housing loans and senior citizens. Standard deduction will be scrapped and savings instruments will be rationalized into what is called a single EET  exempt, exempt, tax  formula. That is, contributions and accumulations will be tax exempt, but withdrawals will be taxed like ordinary income. Investments under schemes like public provident fund will be grandfathered. Interest on existing deposits will be exempted, but new investments will follow EET. The personal income tax exemption limit can be raised to 1 lakh and there can be two slabs of 20 per cent and 30 per cent. Second, on corporate income taxation, two models are proposed. In one, existing tax incentives are grandfathered for existing units and scrapped for new ones. The general depreciation rate and the corporate tax rate are both reduced. In the alternative framework, incentives are phased out over two years instead of being grandfathered. Third, customs duty on manufactured goods is pegged at three slabs of 5, 8 and 10 per cent. Fourth, goods and service sector taxation is integrated, with all other indirect taxes eliminated. The standard Central rate will be 12 per cent, and the Centre and states will have concurrent power to tax services. The proposed Central rate of 12 per cent is meant to replace the Cenvat of 16 per cent and the comprehensive goods and service tax is likely to be around 20 per cent. These recommendations have been articulated several times before. The problem lies in their political acceptability, and there is the inevitable danger that the more palatable recommendations will be implemented and the difficult ones junked. That will be disastrous, because the recommendations form an integrated package.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 19, 2004 							 																						FLAT FEAT																														There is an unthinking link still made between sports and national pride. Sports is perhaps the only sphere of human achievement in the postmodern age where it is not politically incorrect to feel some sort of patriotic afflatus. (The only other comparable activity is, significantly, war.) Naturally, the Olympic games always bring about a resurgence in such sentiments  particularly after Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores silver in double-trap shooting. The nation still awaits the performances of its star tennis players, weightlifters, athletes and hockey team. So, it is still premature, and would be unwarrantedly severe, to attempt to put pride in its place. But Rathores silver is, after all, a silver. And even a cursory survey of Indias performance in the Olympics since the Twenties reveals a profile which, judging by dispassionately international standards, is increasingly undistinguished, to say the least. This, in a country which celebrated the birth of its billionth baby in 2000. That year, at the Sydney Olympics, Karnam Malleswari won a bronze  the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal; another athlete got eliminated in the 400 metre semi-finals, finishing eighth in the heats; the hockey team, on a downward swing since the late Sixties, finished seventh. Leander Paess 1996 bronze came after 44 years. The only relief came from the hockey team, between 1928 and 1964.																														This is a profile worth pondering in its uninspiring flatness. The Nobel record, with its two Bengali beacons (one of whom works mostly abroad, as did most of the other scientist-laureates), is a comparable feat. And in both arenas, Indias ability to create and worship its national icons is inversely proportional to the frequency of their emergence. Is India then witnessing the death of excellence, and with that a willed indifference to standards of excellence in most spheres of original achievement and creativity? This might explain the increasingly parochial tone of the nations self-congratulation. (Cricket is, perhaps, an exception, although by no means above self-examination with regard to its contemporary national ethos.) Not only in sports, but also in the arts and in the professions, the best minds find their most congenial environments for self-realization outside the country. Whether the fault lies in unambitousness or inadequate nurture (are they distinct?), patriotism is not a good excuse for the glorification of mediocrity.

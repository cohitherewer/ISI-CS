The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 							 																						THE DARK SIDE OF THE TALL TALE A.D. MITRA																					In a recent seminar in Calcutta, the Union education ministers comments about the contribution of Indian Institutes of Technology to the growth of the country has drawn flak from several of the institutes alumni. In this era of market economies when at least in the Indian context, the services sector has grown faster than the manufacturing sectors, the reaction of the alumni need be examined from the proper perspective.																					Murli Manohar Joshi, the Union education minister, said that the contribution of an educational institution should be judged from the contribution of its students to the growth of the nation and to the world of knowledge. He also said that the quality of the teachers in these institutions must be judged from the technical articles published by the faculty in the journals of repute. Joshi is not too far off the mark.																					Where then do the IITs stand? It is a fact that they get more funding from the government than any other institution in the country, besides having one of the highest teacher-student ratio. Perhaps the only ground for the teachers to complain is that the service and discipline conditions of the IITs do not permit the teachers to fight elections, as Joshi had done without resigning from the post of professor at the university of Allahabad. The students taken into the IITs through the undergraduate admissions are drawn from among the best students across the nation.																					How to judge																					An educational institution providing training in a specific branch of science has to be judged by the performance of its students. And how are the students to be judged? By the number and quality of research publications, not merely by the number of PhD degrees. If this is a parameter, then the education minister doubtlessly has a point. 																					It is a trifle disappointing that the contribution to the world of knowledge by IIT alumni happens not while they at the IITs, but mostly from institutions in overseas countries, leading among which is the United States of America. And even if some of the alumni were to return to their alma mater as faculty, their contributions are rarely of a high quality; the best research contributions from the IIT faculty happen to come from its non-IIT educated members.																					When it comes to contributing to the industry outside the ambit of IITs, can the IIT alumni associations explain the huge inflow of foreign technologies to our industries in every conceivable field of science including information technology? 																					Not encouraging																					The IT sector has flourished in the country, but simply because India has an abundance of cheap English-knowing labour, but India has gained nothing in terms of technology. Every new technology arrives in India in terms of components from countries like China, Korea and even Taiwan which are assembled here. Premier scientific institutes like the IITs have made little contributions in this area. 																					Again, if we consider the emerging field of biotechnology, the contribution of the IITs is negligible. Consequently, Indian companies can go no further than providing service support to the giant multinational companies. Sadly, India is also emerging as a prime market for conducting trials on humans, a phenomenon that advanced countries have stopped by imposing stringent conditions.																					Finally, the so-called feel-good factor which is of late being sold by the Union government following the unprecedented growth in all sectors of the economy has hardly been brought about by the engineering or manufacturing sector, but by the growth of the service sectors, where the IITs have made little mark, although several IIT-ians may occupy positions in such companies.																					But of course, it would not be fair to blame it all on the IITs. It is true that the best brains are nurtured in India, but are of use only to other countries. The policies of the government must be ultimately responsible for this. Joshi should not complain.

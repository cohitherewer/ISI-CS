The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 							 																						PLAYED OUT																														The dead must also have the right papers. Enyilord Lawrence had come to Calcutta from Nigeria to play football for some of the local clubs. He died more than a week ago in Calcutta, but his body has been lying in a morgue because he is still regarded as an illegal immigrant in the eyes of the law. He had never officially registered as a foreigner in the city, and had stayed on illegally even after he failed to get a contract with a club since last year. So the Nigerian high commission is not entirely willing to take responsibility for transporting his body back to Nigeria. Lawrences parents live in penury in Nigeria (his father is a farmer), and cannot afford to pay the passage for their sons body. His sister, who lives in London, is unable to leave Britain and come to India to take her brothers body back to Nigeria because she is also probably an illegal immigrant in Britain. So Lawrences burial will have to take place in Calcutta, and even for that the cemetery needs the permission of his family. But his parents live in a village from which it is impossible to send a facsimile. His posthumous fate is therefore entirely dependent on the charity of his other African footballer friends in the city and some of the clubs he has worked for, although the latter and the various local regulatory bodies seem to be under no official obligation to pay for his burial. Nor did the clubs that he had played for have any responsibility to ensure that his papers were in order when they employed him.																														This incident points to the problematic grey area  in terms of immigration laws and employment contracts  in which foreign players work and live in the city. The influx of African players of varying standards of sportsmanship  from Nigeria, Ghana or Kenya  is not a new thing for the local clubs. But neither these clubs (especially the smaller ones Lawrence used to play for) nor their regulatory bodies have any clear-cut and standardized rules of contracting players, or ensuring that their immigration status as foreign professionals is in order. Many of the players come in with student or tourist visas, and stay on to play, often moving on to other parts of the country as well. The solution is not only to form some sort of foreign players association or union, but also to standardize the legal and contractual aspects of their professional status in the country according to strictly professional international guidelines.

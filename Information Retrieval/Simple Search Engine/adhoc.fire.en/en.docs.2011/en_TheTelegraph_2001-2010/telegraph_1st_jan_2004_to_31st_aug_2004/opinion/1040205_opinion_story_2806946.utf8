The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 							 																						ROUGH SAILING Notwithstanding his optimism, J.B. Patnaik may find the upstaging of a younger Naveen Patnaik an uphill task, argues Debabrata Mohanty 				 	 Never say die																														The reception of J.B. Patnaik at the airport, as the Indian Airlines flight from New Delhi carrying him touched Bhubaneswar on January 18, was in stark contrast to the way he was unceremoniously shown the door five years ago by the party high command. Loyalists and sycophants of the Orissa state Congress strongman converged in hordes as a near-stampede ensued to garland him. Having manoeuvred his way to the presidentship of a faction-ridden Orissa Congress, Patnaik let off his trademark smile, a sign of his growing confidence.																														We will soon overthrow the corrupt the BJD-BJP government, the 78-year-old Patnaik crowed before a gathering of partymen at the Congress Bhawan which wore a festive look. With his we will win pledge, the army of lackeys and loyalists went delirious.																														For the countrys second longest serving chief minister after Jyoti Basu, the comeback could not have come at a better time. With everyone in the state as well as the all-India Congress committee general secretary in charge of Orissa, Kamal Nath, writing him off, Patnaik ran the risk of becoming a footnote in history. Just about five years ago, he had to put in his papers after becoming a political liability for his party in the wake of the Anjana Mishra gangrape case, Graham Staines murder and a slew of allegations about his moral turpitude.																														The events that unfolded also became a cause for severe embarrassment for the Congress at the national level. The killing of the Staines and a nuns rape at Baripada had caused further embarrassment to Sonia Gandhi at a time when attacks against Christians were on the upswing in the state. During his eventful reign, Patnaik had been unable to check lawlessness in the state, nor was he able to do much about a people caught in the throes of hunger, poverty and deprivation.																														As the prospects of a comeback seemed bleak with every passing day, Patnaik did his own back-room manoeuvring in 10 Janpath, the time being opportune after the assembly defeats had lowered Sonias morale. Since the Orissa Congress president, Sarat Patnaik, had become a lame duck anyway, JBs task became easy. 																														However, though Sonia found it easy to dump Sarat Patnaik, she could not discard him altogether. With the rank and file solidly behind him, this former member of parliament from Bolangir had taken over as the party chief in the state in October 2001. But his leadership over the 27-month tenure was hardly inspiring, particularly after his sankalp yatra turned out to be a damp squib. For the better part of last year, Orissa Congress leaders tried to convince the high command about the futility of retaining Sarat Patnaik. 																														However, even now, very few in Orissa seem to share Patnaiks optimism about a victory as Orissa prepares to go to polls to elect a new 147-member assembly along with the Lok Sabha polls in April. The opposition does not give him much of a chance. I think after his discredited performance in the last century, nobody in Orissa will believe him. He has no relevance in the new century. It makes our task that much easier, says the chief minister and Biju Janata Dal leader, Naveen Patnaik. He went on to remark that JB was like old wine in old bottle.																														Having run the state Congress unit as his fiefdom since 1978, J.B. Patnaiks tentacles in the state Congress surely runs deep. But with less than three months to go for the polls, Patnaik faces the unenviable task of rejuvenating the Congress rank and file that has gone into a long stupor. With senior leaders like Hemananda Biswal, Kanhu Charan Lenka, Sarat Patnaik and Srikanta Jena staying away from the function at Congress Bhawan, Patnaik may no longer command unquestioned loyalty from his party. Even without, his plans of uniting anti-Naveen Patnaik forces may come a cropper if other parties remain indisposed to an alliance with the Congress. Witness the recent revolt of the Orissa Gana Parishad leader, Tathagat Satpathy, over his partys allying with JB. 																														However, old faithfuls seem to be counting on JBs brand of manipulative politics. With JB, anything is possible, says a senior Congress leader. After all, did he not successfully hijack the chief ministership in the 1995 assembly polls even though he was nowhere in the picture during the campaign? With immense resources at his disposal and his skills, Patnaik could spell trouble for the chief minister, who seems to have been unnerved a bit despite his recent remarks.																														Having announced assembly polls along with the Lok Sabha polls, the BJD chief is thick into electioneering and has already started touring constituencies in a government chopper to coastal as well as remote areas of the state to lay foundation stones for river bridges. With a report card as dismal as his, Naveen Patnaik has little to show except a few lakh Indira Awas houses for the states deprived. By the time the code of conduct comes into force, the chief minister will have toured about 60 to 70 of the 147 constituencies in his official capacity.																														But there are several factors that may weigh against JB. First, there is no visible anti-incumbency wave. With age not on his side, the veteran leader may find it difficult to put up with the physical exertions of a poll. On the other hand, Naveen Patnaik-baiters like Bijoy Mohapatra, Nalinikanta Mohanty, Ramakrishna Patnaik and Dilip Ray have limited appeals and are seen as opportunists who may ally with the Congress for personal gains. 																														Though BJD leaders are worried, in private they want the assembly election to turn into a personality clash between JB and Naveen. In fact, Pramod Mahajan at a recent public meeting even advised the BJD to put up a poster having both Naveen and J.B. Patnaik and let people choose their leader. 																														With J.B. Patnaik getting ready to unleash a shock and awe campaign on the chief minister, the signs are visible that the battle will not be an even one. Patnaik has already announced that he would circulate a chargesheet against the chief ministers corrupt deals. It is another matter that his government was allegedly among the most corrupt regimes in Orissa with his ministers were either accused of amassing disproportionate assets or dubbed as habitual bribe taker by the Orissa high court. The Orissa that J.B. Patnaik passed on to his successor after a 14-year reign was on the verge of financial bankruptcy, weighed down by a debt burden of Rs 17,000 crore.																														I have never touched wine in my life while the chief minister has a lasting relationship with it. But he must know that old wine is costlier. Naveen would have to pay a hefty price for it in the coming polls, said J.B. Patnaik to Naveen Patnaiks barb about he being old wine in old bottle. But with an electorate not ready to oblige, JB runs the risk of becoming as stale as some old wine do in a bad oak barrel.

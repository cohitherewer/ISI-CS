The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 							 																						ALL FOR A FEE																														Public interest and government interests are not necessarily the same thing. Only seldom do they converge, often they do not. Mr Y.C. Deveshwar, the chairman of the board of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, might consider it his misfortune to be caught in a situation where the two interests are actually in conflict. With the two in conflict, the chairman of the IIMC had the delicate and unenviable task of demarcating the public interest from the government one. Mr Deveshwar was given the responsibility by the board of IIMC to draft a resolution on the issue of accepting the governments order reducing the fees of IIMs across the country. The IIM in Ahmedabad, the premier business school of the country, refused to accept the governments order. But Mr Deveshwars draft resolution acquiesces to the order. He averred that there was no other option save accepting the cut in fees. Mr Deveshwar, obviously, believes that he had no choice because he sees the IIMs as serving the interests of the government. The reality is exactly the opposite. As the chairman, Mr Deveshwar represents the public interest since the IIMC performs a public function. The function of a public director in a government-funded institution is to maintain the distinction between the two interests and to uphold the public one. It could be argued that the government also serves public interests and performs a public function but as is well known, the government, because it is often driven by political and party considerations of the day, has its own interests and motives. The matter of the IIM fee-cuts is one such instance in which the government is being driven by one ministers personal agenda.																														There appears to be a widespread misconception that the IIMC is part of the government domain and therefore bound to abide by whatever fiat the government passes. The government set up and funded the IIMC, but from the very beginning it has been run as an autonomous body which performed an important public function in the realm of higher education. Public interest and the proper functioning of the institution have always had priority over the policies and whims of the government and its ministers. The closest parallel is the one with the BBC, which is a government-created body that functions as a public body in broadcasting. The fame and the credibility of the BBC rest on its refusal to be the governments poodle and on its commitment to serve what it considers to be the public interest and the best for broadcasting. The IIMs  at least the ones in Calcutta and Ahmedabad  have been trying to become self-financing and to free themselves from government subsidies. This attempt in Calcutta now stands aborted.

Lynn, Westview, Rs 895																														The collapse of the taliban regime in Afghanistan and the more recent American intervention in Iraq reflect the supremacy of Western warfare. Historians are still debating the origin and characteristics of the Wests conduct of war. And there exists little unanimity among academics on the timing of the shift of the worlds military balance in favour of the West. In this book, John A. Lynn throws new light on this contentious issue. 																														In the Seventies, historians believed that the genesis of capitalism had helped the West push the marauding barbarians  Vikings, Magyars and Arabs  to the periphery of Western civilization. This argument waned in the Eighties, with the publication of Geoffrey Parkers The Military Revolution, which modified the early theory of firepower revolution and the emergence of a disciplined infantry being the reasons for the Wests success. Parker argued that trade, supplemented with organized violence was what pushed the Wests boundaries forward. Later, Victor Davis Hanson, traced the argument back to classical Greece and the virtues it infused into the Western soldier. 																														Lynn challenges the unilinear progression of Western war from Athens to Washington. Selecting several societies from Europe and Afro-Asia during different stages of history, he compares and contrasts their military organizations. He contextualizes different military establishments in their varied social and cultural milieu.																														Lynn says that there is no similarity between Greeco-Roman warfare and the battles fought by medieval European knights. While the knights, like the Rajputs, fought on horseback, the Greek phalangites and the Roman legionaries were heavy infantry soldiers. It is even difficult to point out similarities between the 19th century American military culture and that of now. While America was willing to incur heavy loss of manpower before, it now squirms at the bodybags being flown in from Iraq.																														And this unwillingness to risk casualties, Lynn argues, might end Western military supremacy, even in the war against terrorism that challenges the Wests political domination. Lynn continues that cultural ethos, rather than technology might be the crucial feature in all future warfare. After all, it is the concept of jihad that enables a terrorist to look at death in its face.																														Lynn argues that history is the product of social dialectics. Unfortunately, Western scholars know little about non-Western societies. Which is why Lynn guards against the tendency to generalize. He argues that in order to fully comprehend Western military supremacy, it is necessary to analyze non-Western societies in detail. This opens up a new dimension in historical research. Breaking out of the trap of Eurocentrism, Lynn provides a new perspective on military history.						KAUSHIK ROY

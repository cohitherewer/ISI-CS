		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 							 																						FRIENDSHIP VISTA																								A new phase of Indias engagement with Pakistan has begun. The decision by Indias prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to meet Pakistans president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, and its prime minister, Mr Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, has, as expected, overshadowed the rest of the proceedings of the summit of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation countries in Islamabad. Ever since the prime minister, Mr Vajpayee, took the decision to visit Islamabad for the SAARC summit, expectations that the visit could lead to a breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations have been very high. However, India, till the very last, had maintained that bilateral talks were not on the anvil. This caution may have been exercised to prevent the kind of hype that was generated before the Agra summit and also because New Delhi was not clear, till the eve of the summit, if an engagement with Pakistan would be fruitful. A variety of factors have obviously played a role in ensuring that the SAARC summit did not remain a mere setting for a multilateral dialogue. 																								 India seems to have realized that the policy of no talking with Pakistan has not yielded any results. Mr Musharraf no longer needs Indias endorsement to secure his legitimacy. There has been an ongoing process of normalization, since April last year, leading to a gradual warming of bilateral relations. The extraordinary level of enthusiasm at the civil society level had created the right atmosphere for the revival of official talks. The recent decision to observe a cease-fire at the line of control by both sides has also proved to be a catalyst for talks. There has been some pressure from the international community, especially the United States of America, for some time now. Washington and its interlocutors, who have visited south Asia, have been seeking to ensure that India and Pakistan begin bilateral talks before another crisis erupts in the region. If India was still cautious about the engagement with Pakistans military regime, it is because there was still a great deal of apprehension about Mr Musharraf. While most Pakistanis who visited India have argued that Mr Musharraf is a leader with whom India can do business, New Delhis own experience has been different. 																								Mr Musharraf has been blamed for the war in Kargil and the failure at Agra. However, it seems the prime ministers closest counsellor on foreign policy, the national security adviser, Mr Brajesh Mishra, reassured Mr Vajpayee on this count. Mr Mishra travelled to Pakistan before the SAARC summit and met Mr Musharraf as well as the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence. The break through in Islamabad should not suggest that there will be a dramatic resolution between the two countries. The best that can be hoped is that both Islamabad and New Delhi will continue to engage each other even while recognizing the certainty of encountering several hurdles on the road to peace.

		 Sunday, February 29, 2004 							 																						THE STRAIGHT AND NARROWJudicial conservatism requires the judiciary to restrict itself to the legality of a particular act. The health of the state should not be the courts concernA state that fails to protect and uphold the rights of individuals is best described as a failed state. The notion of failure grows out of the inability to carry out the first and foremost duty of the state, the maintenance of law and order which is another phrase for the preservation of individual rights. There are degrees of failure. In Bihar, the state has failed utterly or, as the joke goes, the state has withered away. In Maharashtra, it would appear from the way the Shiv Sena wields the stick against citizens that the state is occasionally ineffectual. In Gujarat, during the pogrom in 2002, the state had ceased to exist. In West Bengal, when nuns belonging to the order set up by Mother Teresa are robbed or when political parties stall ordinary life, the state fails to perform its duties. Within the interstices of the failed state, violence lurks. A symptom of the failed state is the tendency of individuals to take law into their own hands to right perceived wrongs. Thus even terrorism, as the philosopher John Gray has argued, is a manifestation of the failed state. One of the dilemmas of democracy is to bolster up the state without infringing upon the rights of individuals. It is an impasse and it is one of those situations where the process is as important as the end result.																														In India, one route out of the impasse is gaining ground. This is the judicial route. The courts are passing verdicts to strengthen the functioning of the state. Witness the banning of strikes, the prohibition of rallies and so on. This raises very fundamental questions about the role of the judiciary and about its relationship with the two other pillars of the state, the executive and the legislature. Judicial conservatism would argue that the judiciary should confine itself to things legal in the strict technical sense. The business of the judiciary is to decide whether a particular act is within the laws of the land or does it violate the existing legal framework. The judiciary is not there to decide whether a particular act is good or bad for the state or society. The health of the state is not within the purview of the courts. If the state has failed, the judiciary should not help bolster the state. The Indian judiciary has been trying to do precisely this by attempting to make up for the dysfunctions of the legislature and the executive. The court has thus far exceeded what should be its brief. Its intentions are laudable but it is important to remember that an overactive judiciary erodes the internal balance that prevails within the state and its three pillars.																														One of the features of an overactive judiciary is the preponderance of public interest litigations. Built into the idea of the PIL is the belief that an apparently non-injured party has the right to take recourse to the court and stop something. PILs often force the judiciary to wander far away from its remit. It is time perhaps to review aspects of the judicial system by appointing a law commission to look into the entire idea of PILs and their utility. An executive action should not be stalled by the judiciary unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the executive action is in violation of the existing laws.

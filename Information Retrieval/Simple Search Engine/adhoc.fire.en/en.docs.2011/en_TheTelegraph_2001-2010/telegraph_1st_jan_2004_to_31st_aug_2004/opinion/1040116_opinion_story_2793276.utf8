		 Friday, January 16, 2004 							 																						WILD CATS OF MASAI MARA																								BIG CAT DIARY: LEOPARD (HarperCollins,  10.99) by Jonathan and Angela Scott accompanies the BBC television series about the leopards of the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. But there are also superb photographs of the other wild cats in the area  the cheetahs and the lions. An inhumanly beautiful cheetah stands vigilant over her cubs, looking out from a termite hill for the predatory lions and hyenas, and also perhaps for the migratory Thomsons gazelles, which are the cheetahs main prey in the Mara-Serengeti. When the mother hunts, the cubs usually sit and watch, waiting for a gazelle or impala fawn to be brought back to them. Sometimes, the mother would even call out to her cubs with that high-pitched, bird-like whistle that carries across the plains and prompts them to rush towards her, eager to begin feeding. Only five per cent of cheetah cubs escape the lions and hyenas to reach maturity.

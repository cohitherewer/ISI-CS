		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 							 																						NOW FOR AN OPEN SECRET  Abhijit Bhattacharyya																					Almost two decades have passed since this writer wrote a piece on Indian combat aviation after a fair amount of research from open and unclassified sources on its history, technology and deployment. A true disciplinarian and loyal citizen, I thought it necessary to seek approval from the powers that be for the publication of the article. In response, I received a drubbing for being speculative and tendentious. There was only grudging acknowledgement of the fair amount of research that I had undertaken. 																					The article was then aborted, notwithstanding the verifiability and authenticity of every secret information  obtained from easily available and accessible published material. Dabbling in and discussing top secret subjects like combat aviation were overtly discouraged. Things did not stop there. The secret and sensitive paper was placed before the highest authority with the hope that it would proscribe discussion on the subjects in the future. Thankfully, it did not do so.																					But can understanding of defence possibly be the monopoly of a chosen few, especially in an age when information technology pervades every sphere of our lives and few things can be kept secret. Information about almost all frontline fighter squadrons of India and Pakistan (and other countries) as well as of their deployment are easily available in the open market for a few hundred rupees. 																					Free for all																					Impossible? No longer. Books on air forces of the world categorically mention if the information has been acquired from official sources or gathered during officially sanctioned visits, or if the information has been compiled from a wide variety of open sources. This is notwithstanding the varying degrees of speculation where it concerns those air arms which maintain heavy security around their operations and inventories.																					One just has to go through the veritable mine of information on different sectors of the Indian air force  training, transport, helicopters, surface-to-air missiles, new and upgraded aircraft, the re-equipment plans and also the legacy of the MiG-21  to realize how unfair the earlier clamp down on information was. Open sources today categorically pinpoint the deployment of at least 48 IAF combat squadrons along with their inventories and bases, barring a few units like squadrons 26, 36, 37, 45, 52 and 226 whose assignments are unknown. That the doctrine of the Pakistan air force is essentially to train, equip and prepare itself for confrontation with the IAF is also free information. Its acquisition of F-16s was to maintain a qualitative edge over the IAF, now much eroded by Indias induction of Jaguar, Mirage-2000, MiG-29 and Sukhoi 30 MKF.																					Figure this																					A significant revelation from open source pertains to the Pakistan Army Aviation Corps, which consists of some 15 squadrons, flying a large variety of rotorcraft and a few fixed-wing types. Today, the Pakistan air force stands at the crossroads, owing to depleted strength of an old fleet and the high operational cost of the vintage F-16 A/B, which is of American origin. Post-9/11 events have further complicated Pakistan-US relations since the mainstay has been the American war against terror and the search for al Qaida. Al Qaida presence in Kabul and Mullah Omars influence over the common people in the region have enhanced Pakistans geo-political and military importance to the United States of America, similar to the time of the communist invasion of Afghanistan in 1978. It is now fairly well-known that the present Pakistani air force comprises three squadrons of F-16 A/Bs, five squadrons of Mirage III/5s, squadrons of Ian (Chengdu) F-7P/Ms, three squadrons of A-5s and two squadrons with T-6s, a total of 18 combat squadrons with around 385 aircraft.																					Such information are enough to prove that contemporary information system and technology can virtually make a mockery of the top secret classified information which we Indians are unnecessarily obsessed with.

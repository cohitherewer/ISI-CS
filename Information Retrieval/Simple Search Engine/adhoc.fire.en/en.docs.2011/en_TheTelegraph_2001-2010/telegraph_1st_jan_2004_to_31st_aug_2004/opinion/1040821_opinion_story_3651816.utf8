The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, August 21, 2004 							 																						WITH STICKS AND STONES																														The moment of trauma is never the time to absorb its full implications. When crowds of women pounced upon Mr Kapildev Rai, alleged to have raped a woman in Hasnabad station, the premises of the Barasat court were in complete disarray. The women were armed with shoes, sticks and brooms. They beat up Mr Rai in spite of his heavy police protection, and insisted that he be handed over to the public. Under any circumstance, such a happening is unthinkable. For one, it is men who are normally associated with manifestations of public anger. And such anger is quite often turned against women. It can be non-institutional group violence as displayed in the stripping and beating up of a woman in public to punish her for any imaginable or imagined offence. Or it can take the form of a judgment with traditional or political backing, as in village committees. There too, women may have to pay through physical humiliation for having offended village society in some way. These expectations were reversed in Barasat, but there was an even more alarming rupture. Women stormed the court  the space demarcated for justice meant for all. But their demand proposed a different sort of justice, of which they were to be the arbiters.																														Behind this looms the murder of Akku Yadav in a Nagpur courtroom, by women determined to go the whole way in protest against the criminals reign of terror in the region, made possible by his closeness to the police. Rape and molestation were his specialities. The parallels are striking, and frightening. The fact that the five women arrested as participants in the violence have been granted bail, only because an enormous crowd  again dominated by women  compelled the court to do so, is a remarkable development. The concept of popular justice may be inspiring, but the trend raises serious questions about the role and consequence of violence in civil society. This is a backlash against the violence women face in everyday life, from men, familiar and unfamiliar, and from institutions. It is also a reckless protest against the failure of the justice system that threatens the very foundations of society itself.																														For these women in Barasat and Nagpur may have found a model for their actions in the extraordinary and unforgettable protest against the army by women in Manipur. It is noticeable that the women who burst into the court premises were not organized under a political party or womens group. There is only one lesson to be drawn. It is dangerous to push victims so far over the edge that they feel they have nothing more to lose. That is when no space is sacrosanct, no action impossible. The breakdown of all traditional inhibitions and fears also means that violence becomes the only weapon. The women of Manipur turned the violence upon themselves by stripping publicly, the others are directing it outwards.

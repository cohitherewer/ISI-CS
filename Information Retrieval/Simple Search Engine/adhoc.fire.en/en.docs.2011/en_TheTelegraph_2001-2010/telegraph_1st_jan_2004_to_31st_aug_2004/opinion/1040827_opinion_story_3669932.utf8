		 Friday, August 27, 2004 							 																															TO MAKE IT SELL				 	 The end product																														Have our editors abandoned the old skills of revising and/or rewriting the copy to make it more suitable for the reader? Instead, have they only specialized in fitting the copy in the minimum space available on the page? Is it because the picture is more important than the text, because we would rather see than read? What are the reasons for this change of tack in recent years?																														There is no doubt that there has been a sea change in editorial functions in the last few decades. Two distinct types of editors are found now in publishing houses. There are the desk editors, now being called fact checkers. They check details like names, dates, consistency of spelling, italicizing foreign names and phrases, and so on. The more experienced ones make changes in language, style and matter. The second type is the field or acquisitions editor whose job is to commission authors and chase them up to stick to deadlines. They also keep a tab on what kind of books are selling and would be required.																														For both kinds of editors it has become necessary to know the basics of costing and have a clear idea where the book would sell and at what price. This determines the number of copies to be printed in the first instance and how and where the book should be promoted. Editors had to learn how much it would cost in terms of composing, printing, paper and binding for producing a certain number of copies, how to cut costs and work out the unit cost of production.																														Till the Seventies this function was slapped on the production department but with decisions having to be taken quickly, editors were expected to figure out the costs themselves and take a holistic decision keeping both editorial quality and marketing factors in mind. 																														These factors still apply but what remains most important is adjusting the copy within the print area of a page that has also quite often to accommodate pictures. This has to be done not by cutting out whole chapters but by purging sentences of useless words and paragraphs of useless sentences. This exercise requires a complete understanding of the text. Good editing does not mean what needs to be put in but what can no longer be taken out. There are not many editors who can do this without mutilating the copy. 																														There are two main reasons why the text should be close to the bone. First, readers are targeted by powerful forces to get their attention. As Saul Bellow says, the more leisure we have, the stiffer the competition for eyes and ears and mental space. Therefore make it short and sweet. The second factor is cost: the heavier the copy the more it costs, the higher the price and lower the sales. The fact that publishing today is a sub-division of the entertainment business cannot be forgotten.						RAVI VYAS

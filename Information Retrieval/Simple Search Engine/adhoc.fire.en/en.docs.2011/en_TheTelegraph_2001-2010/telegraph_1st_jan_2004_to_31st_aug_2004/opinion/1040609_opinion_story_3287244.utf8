		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 							 																						TWO WRONGS DO NOT MAKE A RIGHT Unlike the prison guards in Abu Ghraib who had fun on their minds, Nick Bergs beheaders were driven by a ruthless rationality, argues N.J. Nanporia				 	 Iraqis sit outside Abu Ghraib, waiting for information on prisoners																														There is no difficulty in denouncing the beheading of the American businessman, Nicholas Berg, in Iraq late last month as barbaric. But if one switches off at that point, the verdict is left hanging in the air, divorced from its context and therefore from the meaning it can otherwise have. Like the abominations perpetrated at Abu Ghraib, the Berg tragedy cannot and should not be looked at in isolation. Nor can the United States of Americas feeble attempts to establish a moral equivalence between the two be taken seriously. Berg was not sodomized, stripped naked, mocked at and humiliated in the many disgusting ways that have been captured in photographs and on video tapes. There is, in his case, a qualitative difference which doesnt justify the decapitation but distinguishes it from what a senator has called the stomach-turning scenes from Abu Ghraib.																														One particularly incredible thing, among many others, is that the Abu Ghraib saga was recorded in more than 1,600 photographs without, it appears, any attempt at concealment or the slightest acknowledgment of guilt. There is in them a celebratory air, with smiles and thumbs-ups as a gruesome counterpoint to the brutalization of prisoners, the sexual abuse and the snarling dogs. Nothing could be more remote from the routine business of extracting information from detainees. And this disconnection has been made all the more apparent by a Red Cross report that 70 to 90 per cent of the prisoners were arrested without evidence of wrong-doing. Many of them have now been hurriedly released, lending credence to the view that the softening up theatricals were, intentionally or otherwise, staged for fun.																														No one has suggested that information of any value was obtained by thus making prison hell. The incidents of brutalization were arranged, apparently, for their own sake, and with no political objective or larger cause as motivation. As against this, we have only one visual shown on an allegedly al Qaida-linked website of Berg about to be beheaded. It is unmarred by any trace of jubilation on the part of the captors and none of humiliation on the part of the victim. From the earliest days of the Iraq-cum-al Qaida resistance, it was made clear by word and deed that anyone, local or foreign, associated with the occupation or seeking to benefit from it, would be killed. 																														There is in the visuals of Bergs decapitation, a stark, impersonal quality that serves to underline its purpose as a message that is seriously intended. Unlike Abu Ghraib, it has running through it a ruthless rationality, inspired by a cause in which, right or wrong, the killers fully believe. What has this in common with a picture, lately released, of smiling prison guards holding up their thumbs over the body of a dead Iraqi who never had any information to provide? 																														This is not a justification of the killers but an explanation of how dangerously misleading an equation can be between Abu Ghraib and the Berg beheading. Dangerous because it is yet more confirmation of how the Americans havent understood the realities in Iraq. Coming back to the 1,600 photographs, another question begs answer: how could so many outrageous happenings have taken place over so many months without the knowledge or acquiescence of top people in the army and Pentagon hierarchy?																														Official inquiries have so far been restricted to the level of who knew what and when and what he did about it. There is a great to-do about which particular set of rules was followed or ignored, who were responsible for it or authorized the many exceptions that reportedly occurred. Reports and verbal warnings by the Red Cross, Antonio Taguba, a member of the governing council, and even Paul Bremmer were unread or ignored. Both George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, like television viewers in any part of the world, allegedly got to know what was going on only when the photographs and tapes were leaked.																														What is one to conclude from this? Incompetence? Foreknowledge? Duplicity? Connivance? Indifference? Some or all of these are embodied in the person of Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, whose performance during the inquiries has been a mix of abasement, arrogance and simulated insouciance. Asked whether he had read the Taguba report, his answer was: I have not. It is a mountain of paper and investigative material. Odd at the very least that a high official should so flippantly dismiss his failure to do something he should have done. 																														On TV, he claimed that the system was in perfect order and it was beyond him why anyone should complain when, on hearing of the shenanigans in the prison cells, the army had ordered an investigation immediately. At the cell level, guards and reservists have spoken of receiving instructions from superiors. But the what, the when and the who remain obscure and will probably never be known. The phalanx of grim-faced army officials at the congressional inquiry put up an exhibition of stone-walling and finger-pointing that testifies to their skills in this department. All that can be deduced is that the interrogators, and through them the guards and reservists, were told what was expected of them with appropriate nods and winks. The implied assumption that traces of this can be found in files and memos is no more than another fable intended to conceal rather than to reveal. So, as Seymour Hersh and the presidential candidate, John Kerry, have realized, the softening-up process had behind it the entire weight of systemic approval.																														No surprise then that a New Yorker article linking Rumsfeld to a secret plan to upgrade interrogation methods has been received with relative calm. The president has rebuked the defence secretary, as he had rebuked Ariel Sharon, in both cases to no effect but with a compliment for Donald for having done a good job as intended. Yet the damage has been done, if only because the transfer of the former commander of Guantanamo Bay to Abu Ghraib is open to only one interpretation. 																														In a sense, Abu Ghraib was un-American. Fortunately such eruptions of sadistic behaviour are rare. Yet the fact there is something in the American psyche that makes them possible in conditions of stress is an unsettling thought. Americas vaunted mission of civilizing the Iraqis doesnt quite square with the 1,600 photographs reproduced throughout the international community.																														And now two footnotes to the Iraqi affair. First, the case of Ahmad Chalabi. This is in line with Americas established policy of picking the wrong man in the first place, ignoring criticism of its protg, and then eventually dropping him as no longer marketable. If, as alleged, the fast-talking Chalabi misinformed and duped the Americans, one must ask how the blame is to be apportioned. Should the deceived be blamed more than the deceiver? The Americans project themselves as knowing all the answers. But this cynically conducted affair seems to prove otherwise.																														Second, we have a charade  for the benefit of anyone credulous enough to swallow it  of a transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis, scheduled for the end of June. Americans, it is said, will remain guests of the Iraqi government. But most of the important ministries will be controlled by handpicked Iraqi collaborators, already in position. The element of unrealism here is so large that the US governor has had to deny that the new American ambassador-designate will be the real and only source of power. The gap between reality and fiction in Iraq has always been wide, and it is growing wider by the day.

Out of the reach of traffic and noise, a lone temple stands in the middle of a forest; high on a hill, a lonely fort looks out over a deserted landscape. However, wherever one went there was always someone who had been there before. Bats, our nocturnal friend, have occupied many a cave and ancient habitat. Bat droppings are especially acidic and take their toll on the most beautiful of monuments. 																					At the temples of Khajuraho, where the village once had thick forests and groves of trees that have been cut, the bats have no where to nest or sleep, and so they inhabit the roofs of the sanctum of the largest temples. What we thought were water-marks and signs of leakage on the solid stone blocks that made up the shikhara, were actually the droppings of bats that had accumulated over years. Or centuries?																					Pigeons have a real problem. They have become resilient and have adapted to our polluted treeless cities but have no where to sit and roost. Their droppings are no less acidic and harmful, and it is difficult to find a way to prevent them from perching anywhere they find a ledge. At the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi, where the president lives, and in the North and South Blocks, one can see an ingenious way of mounting every ledge, however narrow, that runs along the walls, even in the interiors of the halls, with wire projections to prevent the pigeons from taking a rest on Lutyens ledges. It is very difficult to reach high places to clean the droppings of these gentle creatures, and so one has to find ways to maintain and care for the building as regularly as possible. 																					Rattles and clappers																					In the old days, there were all types of rattles and clappers, and one person was put in charge of making a sufficient noise to shoo away the resting pigeons. The other alternative to this would be to plant trees that these birds specially like to perch on. In Ahmedabad, the cross roads had a pigeon coup designed as a tall tower beautifully carved with rest perches and holes so that visiting birds knew that they were always welcome. 																					In Orchha in Madhya Pradesh, where the environment is still pure and clean, we can still find vultures and kites swooping down to rid the farm land of rats and other creatures that eat the crops. The kites sit on the top of the pinnacles of the domes, and stand so still as they watch for prey that they are often mistaken by visitors to be part of the statuary.																					Rats are great burrowers and also have the most harmful excreta that can corrode and eat into tables and valuable antique furniture. Rats like to burrow into the stuffing of furnishings and snuggle up into areas where it is difficult for us to find them.																					Into the woodwork																					Silver-fish and termites that eat into the woodwork and destroy valuable collections of books is a nightmare for the conservator. Many Indian libraries have lost part of their rare and irreplaceable collections to these tiniest of creatures.																					Monkeys play havoc everywhere they go. I remember at Sariska, when once we were out bird-watching, a gang of monkeys destroyed the wipers on the wind screen of our car and broke the car mirrors  just for fun. At temple sites like Tirupathi, there was a time when taking your offering into the temple was one of the hazards of being a pilgrim as the monkeys would step on your shoulder, as you stood obediently in line waiting for darshan, and pick up your offerings of banana and coconuts. At Vrindavan, monkeys have been trained by some to pick your spectacles off your nose or run off with your camera, and a helpful boy nearby will always offer to get them back for a fee. There are many ways to make a quick buck in this country.																					Monkeys galloping over tiled roofs and delicate structures are also known to cause havoc. So one needs to find ingenious ways of harming wild life in the name of protecting our heritage.

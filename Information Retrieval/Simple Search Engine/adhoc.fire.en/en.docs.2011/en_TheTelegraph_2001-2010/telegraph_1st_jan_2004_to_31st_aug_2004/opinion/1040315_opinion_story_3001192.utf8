		 Monday, March 15, 2004  FLYING ON THE ASIAN MAGIC CARPET 
Instead of shoring up the US economy, Asias central banks should finance their countries own infrastructural and industrial needs, writes S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve Bank of India Time to call their bluff It is an irony of history that the clash of civilizations between the United States of America and the rest of the world has left the victor US being held aloft by an Asian magic carpet  the foreign exchange reserves owned by Asias central banks. The deficits of the US  both in respect of its current account and its budget are bridged by contributions from the relatively less developed countries of Asia, including Japan. True, the problem of imbalances of the world has been discussed in various circles. In particular, G-7, the group of rich countries of the world  Japan, the US, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Canada  has discussed it.Recently, G-7  the finance ministers and central bankers of the group  met at Boca Raton, Florida, US, to consider the global macroeconomic situation. The conference concluded with a predictable recommendation to various countries to adopt more flexible exchange rate policies. Obviously, the advice offered at the earlier meeting held in September 2003 at Doha has been reiterated.The advice has had little effect on target countries, particularly China, which refuses to change its dollar peg policy for fear of destabilizing its fragile banking structure and also hurting its exports. The USs problem is, however, that since July 2001 the dollar has declined sharply by nearly 50 per cent against the euro. European manufacturers are squealing that their exports are hurt. It also hurts the US that its dollars decline should lead to further loss of confidence and shift of investment away from America.Ever since World War II, the US has had a history of global problems emerging from the way it is managing its currency. First, the world faced a problem of dollar shortage. The other countries of the Western Alliance were in deep distress after the war, importing heavily from the US. The US had remained unhurt by the depredations of war. Its industrial structure was intact and its productivity high. It started exporting at a hefty rate. A strong surplus of the US came about in both its trade and current account. The world was after its dollars. The global economic problem was one of dollar shortage.During this period, the Bretton Woods system of exchange parity had come into existence. Established after World War II, the Bretton Woods system involved each member-country committing itself to a fixed exchange parity, which it could change only in consultation with International Monetary Fund. Any balance of payments problem would involve the IMFs intervention, with advice and help, subject to conditionalities. The IMFs aid was subject to members agreeing to change conditions. It was the US, however, which supplied the reserve currency of the world, which was the dollar. During the Seventies, the US trade deficit started increasing. Japan, Germany and France were growing stronger. Surpluses of these countries increased. The dollar started declining. The US, however, could not sustain its primary position as the bulwark of the world. In 1971, it went off convertibility to gold. That is to say, Richard Nixon announced a breakdown of the condition under which the US had committed itself to converting dollars to gold at $35 to an ounce of gold. The Bretton Woods system, which had predicated itself on a convertible dollar, was in disarray.The USs transition from a position of strength to its current status where the dollar is still a reserve currency, but a weak one, was gradual. During the Seventies and the Eighties, the US engaged itself in a number of discussions with the other members of G-7 to help arrange for support to its own reserves. It also attempted to persuade countries like Japan, Germany and France to keep their exchange rate high so as to prevent the dollar from becoming too strong and affecting US export competitiveness.The saga of the Seventies and the Eighties was also one of the US using its power of market dominance to persuade the other partners in G-7 to modulate their exchange rate policies. The story has been graphically told elsewhere. An especially impressive account is that of Paul Volcker and Toyo Gyoten in their book, The Changing Fortunes, which depicts the commencement and growth of the G-7 set up and the various discussions that were held with member-countries, trying to influence different countries in their exchange rate policies.The current situation is, in a sense, a throwback to the decade of the Seventies and Eighties, which Volcker and Gyoten so graphically describe, except for one variation. The fire-power of the US is now directed not against Japan, Germany and France, but against China. It is, as before, indirectly threatening to resort to protectionism to shut down its market access unless China behaves in respect of its exchange rate management policies.The paradox is that the very policy which the US protests against  Chinas exchange rate policy  is giving it cheap imports and thus helping in part to keep its inflation low. Also, the forex reserves of China, Japan and India are among those, to count only three in Asia, which go to support the fabric of USAs massive consumption  both governmental and private.An interesting analysis of the emerging imbalance appeared recently in the Financial Times, which depicted the Japanese support to US fiscal deficit as a new experiment in monetary policy. Japan and the rest of Asia have nearly $ 2.5 trillion to $ 3 trillion invested in US government securities. In effect, Japans recent resort to printing yen in large quantities and to buy dollars thereby was depicted as a case of variation on Keynesian monetary expansion. It was as if Japan was resorting to the printing press to stimulate the USs economy.The Financial Times correspondent drew attention to a report by an expert of the US Federal Reserve, which had claimed that the US Fed had not run out of bullets even though its interest rate was near the 1.0 mark. While any further reduction in interest rates would be infeasible, Alan Greenspan had said he was not ruling out of the classic economic solution of showering the populace with greenbacks as if dropped from a helicopter. The vision has been realized. The only difference is that what has happened is slightly skewed in fundamentals. The manna from heaven has dropped from a helicopter, which displays not the American emblem of stars and stripes but the Japanese emblem of the rising sun. And what a gift it is!Since the beginning of 2003, Japans central bank has obtained the approval of its ministry of finance to create 27,000 billion yen with a view to intervening in the currency market. The reserves so gathered by the Bank of Japan are invested in the US. In total, this amounts to $250 billion  $2,000 per every single person in Japan. Globally, this amounts to $40 per every man, woman and child alive. Japan has thus contributed by buying up dollars and investing in US government securities, which have funded almost half of the USs $ 520 billion budget deficit this year. Interestingly, the amount of yen printed and converted into US dollars in the month of January 2004 alone was enough to finance 13 per cent of the USs fiscal deficit.It is indeed strange that the IMF, a stickler for fiscal and monetary orthodoxy, is a patient observer of all this perversion of economic fundamentals. Here, one cannot do better than quote from Volcker in the book cited above. He says, I was told once by a Finance Minister of a developing country  when the IMF consults with a poor and weak country, the country falls in line. When it consults with a big country, the Fund falls in line. When the big countries are in conflict, the Fund gets out of the line of fire. We have now the spectacle of the IMF getting out of the way, while the US is advising its creditor nations  which are in the pink of financial health  how to behave better (to suit its interests).Obviously, the situation is one of disequilibrium in the global financial system. There is one law for the politically strong and one for the politically weak. But this state of affairs cannot last forever; when the politically weak but economically strong countries turn to realize that they have hidden strengths, the bluff will be called. Then, the confidence of the US that the world will finance its deficits will come to an end. Thereafter, the dollar, which is the USs currency, will truly become the worlds problem. That will be the time when Asias central banks start shying away from investing in the tepid low interest-bearing securities of the US and start financing their own infrastructural and industrial needs through a well-structured Asian bond market. It is a pity that such an obvious solution is being avoided for fear it will hurt the present hegemon  the US. It is time that Asia recognizes what is best for its own interests rather than feeding the insatiable appetite of the Squandervilles of the world.

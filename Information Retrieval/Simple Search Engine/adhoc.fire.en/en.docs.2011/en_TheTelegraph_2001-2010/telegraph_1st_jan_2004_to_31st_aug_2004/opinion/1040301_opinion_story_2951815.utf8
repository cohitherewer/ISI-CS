		 Monday, March 01, 2004 							 																						UNITED STRAIGHTS																														Between Messrs Arnold Schwarzenegger and George W. Bush, heterosexual marriage seems to have found its sturdiest custodians. An important insight into the moral universe of the American Christian right, and its muscled anxieties, has been provided in the last few weeks by the reactions of Mr Bush and his men to the issue of same-sex marriage. The possibility that a loving god may not be angry with two men or two women caring enough for each other to want to get married (like any other normal man and woman) seems to have shaken the foundations of Republican certitude. For Mr Bush, a fundamental institution of civilization has been undermined by what has been described as the sheer unfettered anarchy unleashed in some American states. The mayor of San Francisco, and a heterosexual at that, has presided over a few thousand same-sex marriages this month. This was preceded by some activist judges in Massachusetts legalizing same-sex marriage last autumn, the state of Vermont having already legalized homosexual civil unions in 1999. Moreover, in June last year, the American Supreme Court swept aside an antediluvian Texan statute that made gay sex a crime, thus decriminalizing sex in private between two consenting adults of the same sex. These progressive judgments  old hat in most European and Scandinavian countries  look at this issue purely as a matter of principle. To discriminate against men and women on the basis of their sexual orientation is unconstitutional, and therefore unjust. Such a concept of sexual justice has recently divided Anglicans worldwide. It has persuaded even the Tories  including Mr Michael Howard, the Conservative leader  to plan a gay summit in the British House of Commons that would endorse same-sex civil partnerships.																														But Mr Bushs solution is unique. If preventing gay marriage is unconstitutional, then the natural thing to do would be to change the constitution. This is the first serious initiative to amend the American constitution in 25 years, something that requires a two-third vote by the house and senate as well as ratification by three-fourths of the states  which is unlikely to happen in this case. But if it does, then it would not only keep gay couples from marrying, but also undo the basic legal battles gay Americans have won in recent years. These battles, and the protection ensured through having won them, touch upon some of the basic rights of individuals in the workplace, and in the spheres of healthcare, taxes, adoption rights and the owning and inheritance of property. And this is the nation that calls Europe old.

		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 							 																						DUTY OVER POLITICS Although a loyal partyman, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has to remember that the burden of both politics and governance is his, writes Ashis Chakrabarti				 	 Full stops in Bengal																														Coming from a senior leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), it was quite a stunner. If you go to sector V of Salt Lake and see those bright young things working in the IT companies, he told me, you can rest assured they would never join a union. On February 3, when Mamata Banerjees call for another Bangla bandh predictably shut down most of the state, the IT companies in Salt Lake set a new trend by staying open and working to capacity. I had no doubt that he felt good at this sign of change in Bengal. 																														Then came the general strike on February 24, sponsored by the CPI(M)s labour wing, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. This time even the IT firms were deserted, like government offices and other establishments. In their old, familiar style, CITU men in Haldia kept some 300 port workers confined to their office in order to punish them for defying the strike call and reporting for duty. It was obvious that the CPI(M) lent full support to the CITUs strike plan. 																														So what has changed? Is the CPI(M) still the prisoner of CITUs militant trade unionism that it once was? Was the party leaders pride in the new work culture, symbolized by the IT sector, deceptive? Are we then to assume that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may be a man of reforms but his party remains largely unreformed? 																														Some answers are obvious enough. We are told that it was an all-India strike and its impact naturally was the strongest in Bengal. One should not see the strike, we are also told, as a negation of the chief ministers reforms regime. It is also argued that the CPI(M) threw its full weight behind the strike as it wanted to use it as a show of strength before the coming general elections. It is the old argument of using strikes and bandhs as a political weapon. After all, this strike was mainly against the Supreme Court verdict that held strikes by government employees as illegal, immoral and unconstitutional. 																														Now, not just the communists, but many other parties, including the Congress, criticized the Supreme Court ruling for taking away the government employees fundamental right of protest. But no other organization thought it fit to call a national strike on the issue and shut down its areas of strength. 																														It is easy to draw two conclusions from all this  that the CPI(M) and the CITU remain the leopard that cannot change its spots and that Bhattacharjee remains more committed to his partys old politics than he is to reforms and a new work culture. Appearances notwithstanding, both these conclusions are wrong. 																														There is no doubt that the CPI(M) has changed dramatically. Ignore the party rhetoric and there is very little of the old party that one can see in its functioning today. It is much less of a social democratic party that it always was. In fact, one important reason why the party has managed to stay in power in Bengal is its ability to change with the times and adapt to changing political scenarios. Old ideologues call it opportunism, which probably it is, but anyone who says the party has not changed is obviously not following the partys transformation closely enough. 																														The same is largely true of CITU. Some musty, old practices, like the one seen in Haldia on the day of the strike, remain. Small entrepreneurs in Bengal are still terrorized at times by CITUs strong-arm tactics. But think of CITU of the Seventies, Eighties or the early Nineties, when a show of musclepower was a matter of both policy and pride, and you would see how it has changed in recent years. 																														Employers who had to deal with CITU leaders of an earlier generation such as Niren Ghosh or Monoranjan Roy, would know that most of its present-day leaders are virtues of moderation in comparison. The moderation was forced on the party by its being in government, much like the Bharatiya Janata Party holding rabid Hindutva forces in check after it came to power.																														Even so, Bhattacharjee has often complained against CITUs disruptive tactics, sometimes in public. There still are leaders who believe more in the politics of protest than in his new-found politics of development. Those who know him well know that the chief minister was happy when Chittabrata Mazumdar was removed as general-secretary of CITUs unit in West Bengal. To him, Mazumdars ways were out of sync with the new direction that he wants to give both the party and his government. 																														How does then one explain CITUs action on February 24? The answer is generally like this. For all the changes that both CITU and the party have undergone over the years, two strains run simultaneously in them. 																														It would be unrealistic to argue that the partys development politics is fake. The CPI(M) leadership is one with the chief minister in thinking that the days of disruptive politics are well and truly over. The party has come to realize that development, rather than polemics, has become the key to retaining its mass support. CITU too is desperate to keep factories open, even if that means compromising on wages or other benefits for workers. 																														At the same time, the party remains as committed as ever to the primacy of the organization. Bhattacharjees image may be a bonus, but the CPI(M) is in no doubt that nothing matters as much in politics as the organization. Strikes and bandhs thus remain central to the Marxists organizational politics. On this, the party and CITU continue to be on the same wavelength. That is why, although Bhattacharjee himself wanted some restrictions on rallies in Calcutta, the party reacted so furiously when the Calcutta high court sought to do the same. 																														Investors, businessmen and even employees with no political stake would like bandhs and strikes to disappear for good. It would be absurd to expect political parties to think so because the political process does not mean only the elections. Like it or not, street politics is part of democracy everywhere. 																														The problem arises when, as in Bengal, you have the politics of only bandhs and strikes and little else. Even Bhattacharjee, trying to defend the latest strike, cited the example of strikes he had witnessed in Italy during his recent visit there. It was a laughable attempt  the Italian labour unions do not shut down everything once in two months, like the Bengal communists have done for decades. 																														But I have my suspicion that the chief minister was merely trying to behave like the loyal partyman when he defended the strike. I am sure he fumed in private at CITU leaders for holding Bengals economy  and his new image  to ransom once again. It is also a fair bet that he was angry more with the central leaders of CITU such as M.K. Pandhe for forcing it on the Bengal leaders, much in the manner the CPI(M)s Bengal comrades resent decisions imposed on them by the partys politburo leaders who do not have to run a government but engage in ideological sabre-rattling. 																														But the burden of both politics and governance in Bengal is ultimately Bhattacharjees and not that of the politburo apparatchiks like Sitaram Yechuri or Prakash Karat. The people may rail at CITU or the CPI(M) for bandhs and strikes. But after everything has been said, it is Bhattacharjee who will be held responsible for what these do to the states economy and image. 																														The people are still prepared to give him the benefit of doubt. Entrepreneurs and even political opponents say he is a good leader in a bad party. But he cannot hope to retain this trust if CITU is seen to be more powerful than him.

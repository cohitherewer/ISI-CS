The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 							 																						THE ROADS LESS TRAVELLED						A DAY IN THE LIFE OF In Calcutta, some people always have a smooth ride, while the rest skid into the potholes				 	 Ferry man																					If it is the monsoons, then it must be time to dig up the roads in Calcutta. Travelling is an ordeal, and at the end of the day, one is left feeling as mucky as the mud that is dug up and refuses to disappear long after the work has been completed. One tries to console oneself with the thought that everything has a price. Only I didnt know how steep the price is till last week. 																					Caught between a dug-up road and a tearing hurry, I was left with little choice but to take an auto-rickshaw back home from the Metro station. These three-wheeled contraptions have a way of slipping between larger vehicles and getting to the head of a traffic jam. But one is always scared on a potholed, rain-drenched road that they will overturn. 																					We sped on the dug-up roads, the rain coming down in torrents. My thoughts ran smugly from the plight of those rain-drenched creatures at the bus-stops to my sheltered comfort inside the auto. And then the auto came to a rude halt, stopping just short of skidding into a mud hole. It refused to move after that. My co-passengers  a schoolboy probably returning home from tuitions, a young girl and her picture-perfect bhadralok father and a natty young man  seemed immediately unnerved. The harried driver tried his best to restart the vehicle  in vain. His silence told us what we did not want to hear. But he was not giving up so soon, and crawled out to tinker with something at the back of the auto. 																					The schoolboy, sitting in front, jumped out quietly and disappeared. Nobody said anything, and it was assumed that he had already paid his fare. As the rest of us sat in wait, the father launched into a monologue about the utter callousness of the public works department and the sorry state of affairs. The young man busied himself with his mobile phone. 																					In a minute the picture changed. A private bus seemed to smell something and made an unscheduled stop ahead of our auto. In seconds, the young man was climbing its rear entrance. The father followed, ushering the daughter in  she cast a furtive glance at me as if to check my reaction. It was obvious that getting into the bus without getting wet was more important to them than paying the driver of the vehicle they had just deserted. The bus, their partner in crime, rolled on. And took with it all sense of propriety and dignity. 																					While the driver spluttered outside in helplessness and rage, I was left sitting stupidly inside. Three sets of people had just taken advantage of the helpless driver. The student possibly wanted to use the money for an extra smoke. If confronted, all three men would probably have argued that the auto hadnt even taken them halfway to their destination; the girl did what most young Bengali girls would do in her situation. All Calcuttas attempts at sprucing itself up cannot hide the uglinesses that are on display on certain rainy evenings. 																					Another bus approached. I handed the driver a 20-rupee note as indifferently as possible, starting to walk lest he return the change. He tried to protest feebly, but fell silent as I climbed onto the bus. It was a revelation how Calcuttas roads exact a price from those who tread on them. No less revealing was the fact that most of us have evolved mechanisms to evade the payment. 						SAYANTANI BISWAS

		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 							 																						FANTASTIC NOTIONS S. Venkitaramanan asks if the UPA government can find the resources and managerial skills necessary to implement the CMP with maximum efficiency The author is former governor, Reserve Bank of India				 	 Costly programme																														The common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance had frightened the market out of its wits. The market has, however, since realized that the CMP is not too dangerous. It only tries to achieve as a minimum the common goals of the various members of the coalition. By and large, it takes over the manifesto of the Congress with bows to the preferences of the left.																														The CMP aims at a rate of growth between 7 to 8 per cent of the gross domestic product, a goal which seems to be within reach. But like all compromises, it has to accommodate severely conflicting goals. For instance, the CMP incorporates the Employment Guarantee Act. The act will provide a guarantee for at least 100 days of employment on asset-creating public works programme every year at minimum wages for at least one able-bodied person in every rural, urban, poor and lower-middle class households. 																														This is an ambitious target, which will involve provision of government funds for undertaking public works programme. This will conflict with the goal of fiscal balance. The success of the programme calls for a great deal of preparatory work in respect of the list of projects and also local collaboration by the organs of the democratic set-up. A guarantee of employment may lead to public works being undertaken for the creation of jobs. There is a great deal of scope for job creation in rural areas, but caution is necessary in the preparation of lists and implementation of the projects, lest the scheme becomes a guarantee of profiteering by local contractors and political bosses.																														In its emphasis on investment in infrastructure, the CMP stresses that public investment will be enhanced even as the role of the private sector is expanded. The mandatory date of June 10, 2004 for unbundling and replacing the state electricity boards has been extended. Are there second thoughts on power sector reforms? Granted, subsidies will be made explicit and provided through the budget. But reduction of subsidies is not promised. Obviously, populist pressures for cheap power to select sectors have succeeded.																														The emphasis on augmenting rural infrastructure, including irrigation, roads, electrification and market outlet, is in the right direction. While there is an ambitious target of completion of all existing irrigation projects within 3 to 4 years, there is not much about the need to maintain the existing systems. There is also need for undertaking a revision of the user charges in respect of irrigation, as also to avoid over-use of depleting water resources.																														The CMP rejects the idea of automatic hire and fire. While it recognizes the need for flexibility of labour laws, it also emphasizes the case for protecting the interests of workers and their families. The enthusiasts for automatic hire and fire do not recognize the lack of safety nets for displaced labour in the Indian economy. It is worth mentioning that foreign investors in India have been quite enthusiastic about additional investments, notwithstanding the gaps in labour reform. True, state administrations need to respond to requests of employers to be allowed to close their units. But recent experience shows that both domestic and foreign investors have not experienced any serious problems in the closure of their units. It is more important to ensure a proper industrial relation atmosphere than the stress on the automatic hire and fire policy.																														The CMP stresses that the public sector will be enabled to become autonomous. The statement that profit-making companies will not be privatized should not come as a shock, especially considering the earlier stance of the Congress on this subject. The CMP also opens the way for the Navaratna companies to raise resources from the capital market. The fallacy in the CMPs privatization strategy is that it emphasizes on the divestment of loss-making units only after all workers have got their legitimate dues and compensation. While this is a legitimate condition, such units may find it necessary to draw on the fisc even meeting this claim. Who will be willing to invest in loss-making undertakings is also a legitimate question. If privatization is undertaken primarily with the goal of making the industry more efficient, autonomy will be a better answer. But experience has shown that privatized public sector units can become more profitable if the private sector steps in. There is need for debate here.																														On fiscal policy, the CMP commits itself to eliminating revenue deficit at the Centre by 2009. It states that subsidies will be targeted at the poor and truly needy. Targeting subsidies has always been an administrative problem. How the government cuts deficits without decreasing investments and resorting to adequate privatization is questionable.																														The government proposes to introduce cess on all Central taxes to balance the commitment to universalize access to basic education. While this is a desirable step and is not too heavy a load on the tax-payer, it is doubtful that funds alone are the question in education. Management of the elementary education system has been a problem. Experiments by Digvijay Singh in Madhya Pradesh showed a way out by involving the local community. The CMP does not indicate any concrete step in this regard, although it emphasizes on the role of the panchayati raj agencies for improving the quality of primary education.																														The CMP has taken on a big commitment by offering the improvement of the public distribution system. The government needs to implement the well-considered recommendation of the Abijit Sen task force.																														The CMP is right in stressing the need for increasing the flow of credit to farmers. It does not adequately dwell on reviving the cooperative credit structure. What we lack is a political will to depoliticize the cooperative credit structure and to use the cooperative credit institution in conjunction with the marketing operations as well as the commercial banks. That there is need for improving the rural structure is recognized by the CMP. How to find resources is a question. As finance minister before, P. Chidambaram had introduced a rural infrastructure fund, which now is a pale shadow of what was originally intended. It is necessary to revive the idea of funding rural infrastructure from bank resources. 																														The CMP has frightened many unnecessarily. It emphasizes the goals of the new government, which are on the right lines, though some of them have been put forward by the left. It is necessary to emphasize here that the goals of the CMP are about the minimum that a country needs to break out its poverty trap. I cannot do better than quote the Financial Times of May 28, 2004: The CMP errs not because it is a minimalist platform which all nine members accept but because it verges on optimistic fantasy. The question is how the government can find the resources and the managerial skills to implement the CMP with maximum efficiency.																														In this context, the suggestion of the CMP for establishing an administrative reforms commission deserves mention. That there may not be the need to have another commission when there are so many reports awaiting examination is a matter for discussion. Quite often, new task forces and committees tend to postpone essential reforms on agreed lines. They have become excuses for delay rather than change. This has to be guarded against.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A formula that works				 																																																				Sir  Probably the realization is yet to dawn on Mulayam Singh Yadav, but getting an Infosys managing director into the committee for Uttam Pradesh development might prove to be much easier than making Infosys get to work on his state (Infosys muscle for Mulayam, March 4). For one, the coming elections are likely to be an unsettling influence on a state that has hardly settled down with its new government. The next few days will see alliances being made, broken and repaired, all for the sake of the politicos interest. The development of Uttar or Uttam Pradesh per se will be of little consequence here. If the elections give the Bahujan Samaj Party even a few yards of its lost space, it will be mayhem again in UP. Meanwhile, Amitabh Bachchan and Anil Ambani may manage to stick on, given their personal equations with Yadav and Amar Singh. But Nandan Nilekani? Unlikely. He runs a more responsible company, we hope.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Ritual in blood				 																																																				Sir  The report, Religious fervour turns to grief (March 3), was painful reading. After years of repression, hundreds of Shiite devotees had flocked to Karbala, the holiest of Shiite shrines, to mark the end of the Ashura period. What a pathetic end it was for many of them. There seems to be substance in the allegation that the carnage was perpetrated by Sunni extremists who are eager to see the country plunged into a civil war. Yet it is difficult to believe that Muslims could indulge in such a heinous act for Islam does not preach the taking of innocent lives. 				 																																																				This is the occasion to look the Bush administration in the face for the needle of suspicion also points to it. Given the fact that the West is notorious for indulging in proxy wars, is it not possible that the massacre was another ploy of the Americans to divert attention from its own failures and extend their own stay on Iraqi soil? Why do the allied powers have to resort to such ugly tactics of divide-and-rule? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Syeda Kulsum Khan, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  The conclusion of the editorial, Memory of blood (March 4), that the intention behind the killings is not a simple one cannot be debated. Massacre of Shias in Iraq is becoming a daily routine. The killings started gaining momentum ever since June 30 was decided on as the deadline for the transfer of power. It goes without saying that the Americans alone have a lot to gain by a civil-war like situation in Iraq for they know well that if the majority Shias are determined enough, they can drive off Uncle Sam from Iraqi soil. That is probably why the occupation forces are trying to play off the Sunnis against the Shias. Paul Bremer, the United States of Americas Iraq governor, describes every killing as terrorist attack. But then, Americas war against terrorism is a never-ending story, which also indicates that it will never have enough reason to end their occupation of Iraq.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  The recent terrorist attack on Shia mourners on the 10th day of Ashura was partly occasioned by the failure of the world leaders to understand Shiism today. The perception of Shiism as militant may have influenced the American governments policy towards the Iraqi Shiite rebellion against Saddam Hussein in February-March 1991. The reluctance to support the rebels stemmed from the US governments fear that a fragmented Iraq might become an appendage to the Islamic republic of Iran. The fear is not entirely unreasonable: the majority of Iraqs population is Shia and there has been been a call for the establishment of a Khomeinist Islamic administration in Iraq. The US missed its opportunity by not taking up the Shiite cause in 1991, an act which would have won it the gratitude of Shias throughout the world and gone a long way in healing the distrust that prevailed since the Pahlevi era.				 																																																				To the Shias, Husains death is no historical datum from the remote past; it generates a sense of injury, of something gone wrong with the world. Over the centuries, Shias have passed on the responsibility of lamenting Husains death. The massacre in Karbala will give further substance to that lament and complicate Iraqs politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nanak Ganguly, Calcutta

				 																Criminal connections				 																																																				Sir  The prime minister and deputy prime minister should order an inquiry into what role money played in the much-publicized entry of D.P. Yadav into the Bharatiya Janata Party, a decision reversed later. The episode gave a bad name to the party, especially since its top leaders went to great lengths to justify the decision. An honest confession of guilt would have served the partys interests better. After all, no political party can survive without criminals today. But the BJP could have avoided all this controversy by making Yadavs entry into the party more low-key. Yours faithfully, 
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 				 																																																				Sir  D.P. Yadavs induction into  and subsequent expulsion from  the BJP shows how our leaders take us for a ride. The BJP says it is difficult to ascertain the antecedents of every contestant in the Lok Sabha polls. True, but Yadav has as many as 30 criminal charges against him. Let the BJP leaders not give lame excuses. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ajit Mukherjee, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  Verifying the character and antecedents of applicants before appointing them is a common practice in professional circles. But the recent case of the BJP admitting D.P. Yadav to check Mulayam Singh Yadavs hold over the backward classes in Uttar Pradesh shows that political parties, desperate to win elections, could not care less. More and more criminals are joining politics because they feel politics can help them save their skin. The only way to counter this is to strengthen the judiciary in order to disabuse anyone of the feeling that they are above the law.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  D.P. Yadav was right to ask, What crime did I commit over the last three days for the party to suddenly wake up? The prime minister should expel all such dubious characters and save his own image before he saves the BJP and the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Das, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Public censure may have prevented the BJP from welcoming D.P. Yadav in its ranks, but is there any guarantee that this is enough to prevent criminals from gracing Parliament?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Halder, Calcutta

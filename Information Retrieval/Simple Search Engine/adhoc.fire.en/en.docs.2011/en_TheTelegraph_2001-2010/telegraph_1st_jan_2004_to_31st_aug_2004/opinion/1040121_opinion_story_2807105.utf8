The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 							 																						A BAN ON REASON																														If anything is shining in India today, then it is certainly not the lamp of learning. But a great deal more than learning is at stake in what has been going on in Maharashtra since Oxford University Press published Mr James Laines historical study of Shivaji lore. After banning the book, the state government has now declared that the police are planning to arrest its author and publishers. For Maharashtras home minister, insulting a national hero amounts to a cognizable offence. Therefore, these arrests would be a matter of both law and honour, even if the police have to start a ridiculously elaborate procedure to arrest an American scholar residing in America. The brutishness had begun with the Sambhaji Brigades attack on the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune. Mr Laine had called it his scholarly home. The state government then took over the cause of regional pride from this barbaric fringe of the Hindu right by banning the book. The fact that it did so out of electoral panic does not make the ban any less brutish. But then the prime minister went to Mumbai to unveil a statue of Shivaji and told everybody gathered there (including Maharashtras chief minister and Mr Bal Thackeray) that it was very wrong to ban books. He also reminded his audience that there were more human ways of objecting to scholarship. Those who still trust in the effectiveness and sincerity of such reprimands from the prime minister felt somewhat assured by his words  only to hear, a few days later, of the governments plans to arrest Mr Laine.																														Mr Laine has been trying to explain to his objectors the difference between writing a biography of Shivaji and examining the ways in which the story of Shivaji has been told over the last 300 years. His book has not questioned who Shivajis father might have been, but only records local stories that do so humorously. Mr Laines faith in human reason is laudable. But he perhaps needs to be reminded that his objectors  those who savaged the Pune archives as well as those who banned his book and now want to arrest him  are driven by energies which are very different from those motivating historical inquiry or any intellectual endeavour, for that matter. The ignorance and bigotry of those who have the power in India to decide what Indians will think, study, read, watch, wear and get sexually aroused by could well baffle the imagination of a civilized historian. Insecurity regarding freedom of expression and related civil liberties is noticeably and dangerously on the rise in India. This cuts across political affiliations (witness the banning of Ms Taslima Nasreens latest book in West Bengal), and affects higher education, scholarship, cinema, fashion, television, literature and the other arts. 																														Arbitrary censorship, John Milton wrote in 17th-century England, is a kind of homicide or massacre, stifling the breath of reason itself. That is why it will leave, not just archivists, scholars and writers, but every rational member of a republic and democracy feeling profoundly violated and abused.

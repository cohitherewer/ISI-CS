The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 19, 2004 							 																						BULLYING AS A FINE ARTSubhajit Banerjee																					If a company has made huge investments in acquiring exclusive intellectual property rights of a product, then it is only natural for it to expect profits from the investments. But if these transactions are taking place in India, and that too in an election year, the government may just ask the company to forget its business interests. The case in point, of course, is the last-minute move to bully Ten Sports into handing over to Doordarshan the terrestrial telecast rights of the ongoing India-Pakistan series.																					The chain of events would appear curious by most standards, but where the national broadcaster is concerned, such things are the norm rather than the exception. Already involved in the imbroglio are three high courts, the Supreme Court, senior government officials, two television channels, and hundreds of confused cable operators.																					In a special hearing of a public interest litigation at the residence of a Supreme Court judge the night before the first one-day international, it was decreed that Ten Sports should hand over the telecast rights for free to Doordarshan, but for only the first match. On the eve of the second one-dayer, the court again directed Ten Sports to provide the feed to Doordarshan for that match. This set the tone for the rest of the series, as the third ruling (on Wednesday) directed Ten to share the telecast rights for the entire series. Doordarshan has been asked to beam Ten Sportss logo and all its advertisements and deposit Rs 50 crore with the court for future computation of loss and damages to parties. The final hearing is scheduled for April 15.																					Raw deal																					The crux of the issue is quite simple: Ten Sports is finding it difficult, and justifiably so, to part with its hard-earned rights. In 2003, the Dubai-based company, Taj Television (Ten Sportss parent company) bought the telecast rights to all cricket played in Pakistan upto 2008, at a cost of almost Rs 230 crore. (Incidentally, Doordarshan did not even bid for the rights then.) Buying telecast rights wherever they were up for sale was part of Ten Sportss moves to establish itself in a world of cut-throat competition. More significantly, buying the rights for an India-Pakistan series at a time when a visit by India to Pakistan was almost unthinkable was a huge gamble. It would have paid off, too, had it not been for the unfair intervention by the government of India.																					But let it not be said that Doordarshan did not try. After cribbing about Pakistans national channel getting the terrestrial rights for free (something that Pakistani laws forced), it made several offers to Ten, all of which were rejected. Prasar Bharti, Doordarshans autonomous parent body, then approached the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India  the newly appointed cable trouble-shooter  for justice. But TRAI made it clear that it could only mediate, not force a decision.																					Some learn, few dont																					Curiously, all this while, the government had barely made a move apart from requesting the parties to sort out the differences. Frenzied activities began only with days to go for the first one-dayer. 																					With the Supreme Court order, Tens hopes of making the most of the rights it acquired have been all but dashed. Initial damages have been estimated at around Rs 208 crore. Ten had also negotiated with cable operators for a greater subscriber base declaration (a perpetual grey area between broadcasters and operators) on the grounds that the telecast would be exclusive. To add insult to injury, Doordarshan inserted its own commercials and did not carry Tens logo during the first one-day. 																					Ten has surely learnt its lesson from the episode. The channel, and others like it, will now think twice before making exclusive business deals in India. The government too, one hopes, has learnt that it is time to frame some rules and stop arm-twisting companies into giving up what is rightfully theirs. The Prasar Bharti, too, could do with some introspection about the autonomous status granted to it. But as for Doordarshan, it has probably missed the point  yet again.

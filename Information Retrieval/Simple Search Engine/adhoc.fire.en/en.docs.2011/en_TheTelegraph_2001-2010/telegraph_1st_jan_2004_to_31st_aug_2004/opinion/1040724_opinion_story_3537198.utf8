		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 							 																						RIGHTS GONE WRONG																														Natures revenge can take dangerous forms. A young man had been thrown out of a moving bus recently because he was trying to save his wife from a group of men who were molesting her. He was not the first such victim. There was at least one other incident a few years ago in which another young man was thrown out onto the train tracks for having objected to the molestation of a woman in his compartment. Such eruptions of murderous criminality in the middle of the mundane transactions of daily life, such as travelling to and from work, for example, are shocking in their very occurrence, apart from questions of law and order, or civil rights, or womens safety. But they become even more shocking when they occur without sufficient reason  and to someone who is virtually a child. Violence is associated with criminals, and the men who threw out the young husband turned in a moment from molesters of women into murderers, representing different facets of criminality. The women who beat up the 14-year-old vendor, Niraj Prasad, and pushed him out of the ladies compartment perhaps deserve some other label.																														It is not enough to say that violence and ruthless aggression have become ways of life. The young vendor on his daily round had missed the vendors compartment as the train started to move and had jumped on to the ladies one instead. It was a mistake, and he had pleaded he would get off at the next station. It is just his good luck that the train had not picked up speed, or he would have died. The incident exposes a terrifying distortion that the concept of rights has undergone. A compartment reserved for women is meant to ensure their safety and security during daily travel, and it is right to defend this space against intruding men. But Niraj Prasad was a young boy, and a poor, hard-working boy at that. It has to be asked here why the womens rage that was unleashed against him is strangely absent when other women are molested publicly, in trains, buses or on the roads. There is a unique power in the idea of a reserved space; apparently it is only regarding this space that women feel confident and united enough to act, even if the action is misdirected. It is enough to observe womens proprietorial attitude to ladies seats in the Metro as proof. It seems that women need to have their space in public areas demarcated officially in order to come into their own. 																														Such a psychology may be put down to frustration, to a desperate need to protect what little space is given in order to avoid the harassment that is part of womens daily experience. The constriction of the notion of rights, and the confusion over the ideas of equality that this attitude implies, could perhaps be understood from this point of view. But Niraj Prasads experience cannot be explained in this way. Too many incidents have shown that united public anger  whatever its gender  seldom expresses itself quite so frankly against persons perceived as powerful or violent. Prasad was a boy, burdened with a sack, and quite obviously poor and powerless. He could safely be made the butt of righteous anger. It is this that is frightening.

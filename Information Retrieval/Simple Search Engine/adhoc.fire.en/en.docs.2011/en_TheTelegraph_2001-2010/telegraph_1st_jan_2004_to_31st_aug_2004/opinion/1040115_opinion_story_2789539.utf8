The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 							 																						OTHER REASONS The decision of the Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam to leave the National Democratic Alliance was the  signal for smaller parties to adjust their bearings. The  Pattali Makkal Katchi, headed by Mr S. Ramadoss, has been  the latest to leave the NDA, although even a fortnight ago  the PMK had been more or less sure of its support to the  NDA. The changing alignments in Tamil Nadu betray two different  perspectives simultaneously. The perspective of the Congress  and the left parties is the same: they would like to be  part of the DMK-led front  even if they fought elsewhere   because the new front would be anti-communal. The DMK-led  front would presumably spearhead the attack in Tamil Nadu  against the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Lok Sabha elections. 																								But the PMKs argument is different. It reveals the other, regional, perspective. For the PMK leader, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with belonging to the NDA. He had good things to say about Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayees governance. Mr Ramadoss is more interested in participating in the building of a significant force against Ms J. Jayalalithaa and her All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. According to Mr Ramadoss, it is time to fight her anti-democratic, anti-labour, anti-poor policies. The argument is couched in terms of racial honour. The self-respect of the Tamils had been hurt by the closeness of the BJP and the AIADMK, and the PMK had to ensure that the anti-AIADMK vote was not split. Hence the decision to leave the NDA. The two Union ministers from the PMK will obviously no longer continue at the Centre. But the departure of the PMK has not really hurt the BJP. The NDA still sports 280 members, while the majority mark is 272. Early elections are meant to consolidate this advantage. The sudden restlessness among the opposition and would-be opposition is hardly unexpected. The BJP need not be hasty in finding new friends. Its recent glory in the series of assembly elections has contributed to its sense of solidity. It is now for the smaller parties to decide which way to go, and to settle their priorities, local or national, as the PMK has done.

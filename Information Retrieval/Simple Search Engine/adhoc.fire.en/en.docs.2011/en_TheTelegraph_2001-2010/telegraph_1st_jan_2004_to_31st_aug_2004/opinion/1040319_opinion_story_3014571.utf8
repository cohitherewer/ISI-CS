The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 19, 2004 							 																						FASTEST, HIGHEST, STRONGESTIcons from the World of Sports By Gulu Ezekiel, Puffin, Rs 175This is a typical Gulu Ezekiel production  well-researched, pragmatic in its analysis, and candid. The inclusion of interesting anecdotes add to this books appeal. Eleven contemporary Indian sportspeople, who are household names today, have been selected. These are: Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Sachin Tendulkar, Viswanathan Anand, Dhanraj Pillay, Anjali Vedpathak Bhagwat, Karnam Malleswari, Pullela Gopichand, Bhaichung Bhutia, Narain Karthikeyan and Chiranjeev Milkha Singh.																														In a country wedded to cricket, not many sportspeople from other disciplines can hope to achieve iconic status. Each one in this list is an acknowledged master at the national-level, some have also done well in the international sphere. Apart from statistical details and relevant information, the book focuses on the background of these players, the early influences on them and traces their development. The stories should inspire thousands of Indian youngsters, who want to be a success in sports, and their parents.																														The author, thankfully, does not fall back on conventional flattery, so often the case with biographers. He has the courage to say that Tendulkars batting was hampered by the pressures of captaincy; to mention, by name, people who had sown the seeds of discord between Mahesh and Leander; to accuse the Indian Hockey Federation of high-handedness in its dealings with players  particularly Dhanraj Pillay.																														Ezekiel must be commended for highlighting the modesty of Prakash Padukone, who admits that when Gopichand came to his academy he was already a major force on the national scene, thanks to his coach, the little-known Arif. How many of our high-profile coaches would have similar courage to accept that the greats of Indian sports have not been coached by them but by lesser-known coaches? 																														The chapter on Anjali Bhagwat is worthwhile for the background scenario of Indian sport it provides. The Hungarian rifle-shooting coach, Laszlo Szucsak, who worked wonders on his Indian trainees, was denied the salary promised him by the Indian authorities. Thankfully, however, Anjali later trained under him, on her own, and went on to achieve many international successes. Anjalis pragmatism in setting reasonable goals, and her modesty are qualities worthy of emulation.																														The article on Karnam Malleswari shows how a poor girl from an obscure corner of the country became the first woman to win an Olympic medal for India. Malleswaris career has been fraught with controversy and malicious charges. Yet the lady, by dint of strength of character, talent and conviction, went on to rewrite Indian sports history. It is good that Ezekiel gives the names of the people and organizations who helped her in times of need.																														A few eyebrows will probably be raised at the inclusion of Karthikeyan, Bhutia and Singh in this list. They may not have achieved genuine greatness at the international level yet, but all of them have been pioneers in their respective sport.																														Every genuine lover of Indian sports will agree that such a book was long overdue. The only problem is that its title is somewhat a misnomer. Since all the sportspeople are Indians, Indian Icons would have been more apt.						RAJU MUKHERJI

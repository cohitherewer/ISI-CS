The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 20, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Give US our due				 																																																				Sir  The United States of America is known to give an inch and take back a yard. This was once again apparent in its ban on business process outsourcing. No matter how much he tried, the US trade representative, Robert Zoellick, was unable to conceal the unfairness of the US strategy (US plays hardball on back-office deals, Feb 17). Never mind the smart talk about trade being a two-way street, the bottomline remains that the Bush administration will go to any lengths to keep its people happy. This has been proved on numerous occasions before  by US protectionism for its steel industry, its farm subsidies and even by the drive against Saddam Hussein once the pursuit of Osama bin Laden had come a cropper. Even then, Zoellick could try and explain why there should be so much fuss about outsourcing resulting in job losses in the US when plain statistics show that all outsourcing has done to the US is take away some menial jobs in the information technology sector? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Amrita Basu, Kharagpur
				 																Game theories				 																																																				Sir  Now that the prime minister has given the green signal to Indias tour of Pakistan, the press is full of praise for him and contempt for L.K. Advani (Vajpayee catches, cricket wins, Feb 15). There is no dearth of sports journalists and politicians who insist that one should not mix sports with politics, as is frequently done. 				 																																																				The advice may be sane, but it does not help the doubts over the question of the players security in Pakistan. This is not to say that one has misgivings about adequate security being provided by the Pakistan government for our players and officials. But the fact is that the threat perception is not only serious but real for all teams playing in Pakistan. In the last two years, only South Africa and Bangladesh have played in Pakistan. In 2002, the New Zealand team had to rush home after a bomb exploded near the hotel in which they were staying. One should also remember that both Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly feature in the Lashkars hit list. 				 																																																				It will not be easy to provide round-the-clock security to the players and the officials. And even if this were made possible, it will be immensely taxing for the cricketers, who, as it is, are under pressure all the time. This might even affect their performance on field.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Cricket is a game that has mass appeal in both India and Pakistan. It should never be used as a political tool, either for forging ties or breaking it. Security considerations notwithstanding, the fact that the Pakistan tour was being held up for political compulsions shows how brazenly self-interested our politicians are.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Partha De Sarkar, via email

				 																																																				Sir  The argument that any untoward incident during the cricket series in Pakistan would spoil the feel-good factor in India-Pakistan ties had been one central factor holding up the decision on the India tour. On second thoughts, the government need not have worried because feel good or not, certain factors remain unchanged. One, the Pakistani cricketers are better performers than their Indian counterparts, and Pakistan, more often than not, have walked away with the prize. Two, Indias performance on Pakistan soil has been abysmal, and it cannot get any worse. If our team loses again, the government can plead that the gruelling Australia tour has left the team with little energy. 				 																																																				Another thing the government overlooked  a country riding high on the feel good factor could take a loss more sportingly than at any other time. This could go a long way in assuaging the Pakistanis.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Politicians cannot but pollute anything they touch. The long debate over the India tour of Pakistan thus did not surprise. But what was the untoward incident that so frightened our politicians? Were they afraid that Sachin Tendulkars and Rahul Dravids batting performances will edge out the elections from media coverage? Or was it more the possibility that the magic spells of the bowlers will leave election rallies with little or no audience?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Hemant Krishna V., Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Why is cricket being involved in the furtherance of bilateral ties between India and Pakistan? Australia too had put off its Pakistan tour when the situation within Pakistan was found to be ill-suited for a cricket series. Why isnt Indias tour of Pakistan being seen as dispassionately? One should also not forget Indias last tour of Pakistan.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Indias upcoming cricket tour of Pakistan is vital for improving relations with our neighbour and building people-to-people contact. Indian cricketers are obviously worried about unruly behaviour during the matches and a possible defeat. But these are risks that have to be taken. Security concerns never worried when the prime minister visited Pakistan during the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meet, or when Laloo Prasad Yadav crossed the border, or when schoolchildren went to Pakistan recently. Why does it worry now? 				 																																																				Apart from playing for the entertainment of cricket-lovers, the cricketers will be representing their respective nations in Pakistan. Which is why the president of Pakistan should be taken for his word on the security issue. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Players themselves have started expressing their concern about security in Pakistan. After such a strenuous tour in Australia where things did not exactly go their way, their sudden scepticism about the Pakistan trip is hardly surprising. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

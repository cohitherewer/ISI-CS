The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 							 																						HOLIER 																													THAN																													THOU He has stormed out of tours and tipped off journalists to blow the whistle on match-fixing. But this time round, former Pakistan cricket captain Rashid Latif is being accused of chasing the limelightOFF THE CUFF
Rashid Latif on: V.V.S. Laxman (before the fifth ODI): I do not think Laxman should be playing one-dayers. (Laxman was the Man of the Match.)
Moin Khan (before the fifth ODI): He looks a little out of sorts. I hope it is not an issue of fitness with him. (Khan scored 72.)
Shabbir Ahmed : He is better than both Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami. (Only time will tell.) 																														Till the Nineties, match-fixing was something usually left to aunts and astrologers. Then super-sleuth Manoj Prabhakar went around the country with a suitcase hiding a spy camera and crickets worst-kept secret tumbled out in the open. And when South Africa captain Hansie Cronje confessed to the ultimate sporting sin, the gentlemans game died forever. Crickets days of innocence were over. Since then, stories of match-fixing have been as much fodder for idle gossip as a silly point for wild speculation. Like an evil ghost whose presence can be felt though no one is sure about its existence, they have haunted cricket-lovers minds.																														But last Sunday when former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif suggested that the fourth one-day international between India and Pakistan might have been fixed, the cricket world was both alarmed and amazed. Alarmed, because the 35-year-old wicket-keeper-batsman was one of the original whistleblowers in the games match-fixing scandals. Amazed, because the potentially damaging insinuations were unsubstantiated.																														Airing his view as an expert on Indus, a Pakistan television channel, Rashid said, Even a common man could observe that the players were acting on a script because the body language of the players was not as it should have been.																														It is undeniable that Rashid has been a crusader against corruption in cricket. Walking out of tours in protest, offering full co-operation to Pakistans inquiry commission on match-fixing, writing an open letter to the ICC on the matter, offering information to journalists  he has done it all. He is also writing a book on the affliction that, some believe, still ails cricket. Tentatively titled, Behind the Bars, the book will hit the stands sometime this year and will be released simultaneously in English, Urdu, Hindi, Tamil and Bengali. And his website is a treasure trove for anybody looking for information on match-fixing.																														But on this occasion, Rashid seems to have made a crucial error of judgment. Making sensitive observations without a shred of evidence has made him appear, as Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Rameez Raja says, a bit of a loose cannon whose desire to remain in the news at any cost has reached ridiculous limits. Indulging in loose talk at a time when the two sparring neighbours hope to heal their wounds through cricket, has also exposed his inability to see the big picture. Interestingly, he told a news agency on Thursday, that he had raised questions about the match only because he was interested in cleaning the game. He also added, he had never said that the match was fixed. Am I mad that I would say so? he questioned. 																														Ironically, Rashids own career isnt spotless either. A rare cricketer who smokes cigarettes, he has been punished for unfair play and accused of making racist remarks. Last September when playing against Bangladesh, he was suspended for five one-day games after being found guilty of claiming a catch when he had actually picked the ball off the ground. Earlier at the World Cup in Johannesburg, Adam Gilchrist accused him of making a racial remark. Rashid was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd who said there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegation.																														On the pitch, Rashids career resembles a yo-yo. He has been selected and sacked. He has announced retirement, then returned to captain his country. With a reputation of being a neat and reliable gloveman as well as batsman, Rashid made his Test as well as one-day international debut against England in 1992, played 37 Tests (119 catches and 11 stumpings, 1381 runs, including one century) and 166 ODIs (182 catches and 38 stumpings, 1709 runs). They are decent but not spectacular statistics.																														Maybe, he would have played more matches but for his pro-active role as a whistleblower which kept him out of the side for several years. And for his constant brush with authorities. Last November, he levelled accusations against PCB authorities accusing them of not acting in the interests of the game. 																														Those who know him well say he is one of the most humble and unassuming cricketers around. The boy who started playing cricket on the streets of Karachi was also hardworking. As a teenager, Rashid would practice for hours hitting the ball against a pitch roller and try to catch it. Like his idol, former Pakistani world squash champion Jahangir Khan, he struggled against odds to succeed. He now runs a coaching academy in Karachi where he recently played host to promising cricketers from Afghanistan.																														Few know that the former Test wicket-keeper has an enduring India connection. His father, Abdul Latif, migrated to Pakistan during Partition. But, Rashids grandfather stayed back in his ancestral village in Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh. So did one of his elder brothers, Shahid, who now works at the printing press of a Calcutta newspaper. When Shahid met him for the first time during the World Cup in 1996, Rashid hugged him and wept like a baby. 																														Fate has chosen different lives for the two brothers. One of them has a modest middle-class existence; the other lives in a plush home and drives a swank white Honda car. Thanks to the resumption of cricket ties between the two countries, his brother has been granted a visa and has finally been able to visit his home in Karachi. 																														It is for this rather than the unsavoury controversy, that Rashid Latif will remember this Indo-Pak cricket series.

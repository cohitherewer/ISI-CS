The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 24, 2004 							 																						THE RITUAL GOES ON																														This was not the best time to announce the Reserve Bank of Indias annual policy. A new government was not in place. Overall policy direction was missing and privatization uncertainty contributed to mayhem on the stock market. However, the policy already having been postponed in April because of elections, the RBI went ahead on May 18, leaving substantive changes for October 2004. It is a moot point whether the country needs to persist with this bi-annual ritual. The ritual belongs to an era when everything was controlled. With more and more left to the market, changes in bank rate, the cash reserve ratio or repo rates should be instantaneous, instead of bi-annual. With substantive changes having to wait till October, interest focusses on the projections of the governor, Mr Y.V. Reddy, of gross domestic product growth and inflation for 2004-05. When final figures are available, 2003-04 will end with GDP growth of 8.5 per cent plus, riding on the low base of 2002-03. However, this cannot be replicated in 2004-05. India Shining 8 to 10 per cent GDP growth figures are not realistic. The RBI has projected 6.5 to 7 per cent for 2004-05. This is believable. Exports are doing well. Global economic recovery is becoming more broad-based. Domestic industry has recovered and credit off-take has picked up. There are signs that investment is increasing and the meteorological department predicts a normal monsoon. The RBI is more concerned about inflation. 																														On an annualized basis, inflation is projected at around 5 per cent. In addition to existing domestic liquidity, capital inflows have contributed to liquidity and a signal is needed from the new government about what the RBI should do regarding exchange rate management and accretion to foreign exchange reserves. The extent to which global oil price increases are passed on domestically also has a bearing on inflation. All Central banks are cautious and it is therefore understandable that the RBI has decided to leave the bank rate and the repo rate untouched at 6 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively. Nor has cash reserve ratio been reduced, although long-term reduction of CRR remains on the agenda. Mr Reddy is effectively signalling that inflation concerns do not warrant downward movement in rates and in any case, there is plenty of liquidity in the system. Indeed, there is a structural problem about credit delivery and since October 2003, there have been recommendations on how credit delivery can be improved. This is especially important for agriculture and small and medium enterprises, both priority areas for the new government. Specific announcements on these will have to wait till October 2004 and one hopes the new government will not think in terms of lending at rates below the prime lending rate alone.

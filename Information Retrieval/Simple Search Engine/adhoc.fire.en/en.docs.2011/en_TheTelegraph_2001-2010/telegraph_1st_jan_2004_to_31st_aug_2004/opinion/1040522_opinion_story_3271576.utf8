				 																																	Its not always about money, sages will tell you. And Al Pacino agrees like none other. The Oscar-winning actor has been roped in to play Shylock in a film based on Shakespeares The Merchant Of Venice, and will not take a pound, of cash or flesh, to play the role. The big-budget British film, now being promoted at the Cannes Film Festival, will be directed by Michael Bradford of 1984 and Il Postino (The Postman, starring Kevin Costner) fame. Pacino said he had always wanted to play the Jew, and now that hes got the chance, he could do without the fees. Quite the opposite of what you would expect of a usurer. But then, actors dont always carry art to real life. Tata YoungShe calls herself sexy, bitchy and naughty on stage. But theres more to Tata Young, the latest singing sensation. In fact, shes just the kind of girl one could take home to mom. Young was in Mumbai this week. Guess what she made a beeline for? Not the citys nightclubs, but the Ganesha and the Shiva temples. The pretty Thai-American girl hit gold with her first English album, I Believe, this year, and was even featured on the cover of Time. Young is a Buddhist. But I am a staunch follower of Ganesha. He is my best friend. I also do aarti once a week, and listen to bhajans, she says. Straight out of a K-serial. At least shes groovy. Thank god for small mercies!  Prahlad KakkarMango lane 				 																																	Prahlad Kakkars dil always wanted more than just a campaign. This time, hes found the perfect catch(line). Kakkar is promoting Goas famous Alphonso mangoes. The ad-filmmaker, who hails from Goa, has been roped in by its government to design the Ambo Konkan campaign. Under the scheme, buyers can directly order mangoes from the farmers. Fruits of Kakkars labour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 							 																						TALKING TOO MUCH																														There is nothing the comrades love more than the sound of their own rhetoric. It does not bother them that this rhetoric is irrelevant and harmful. But talk the comrades must, and they think they have earned this right by having about sixty members in the new Lok Sabha. The harmful impact of their irresponsible public pronouncements is manifest in the way the market has reacted to statements made by Mr Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and by Mr A.B. Bardhan of the Communist Party of India. Even while the left was debating internally about joining a Congress-led ministry, the two comrades declared that disinvestment would be stopped under the new ministry and economic reforms reviewed. The comments were gratuitous and had the expected consequences: the stock market went into a tizzy and collapsed. The plummeting of the sensitive index on Monday was spectacular, to say the least. All this was utterly unnecessary. All Messrs Yechury and Bardhan had to do was hold their tongues. Not satisfied with creating disruption and uncertainty all around, the leftist boy scouts had to smell out a conspiracy behind the market crash.																														It is precisely this kind of irresponsibility and ignorance that has kept investment away from West Bengal, a state under continuous communist rule for more than 25 years. Men with blinkers and an obsession with conspiracy always find it difficult to understand reality. The Indian stock market is flooded with money emanating from overseas investors. This inflow of money is predicated on the belief that India will continue apace with economic reforms. Any uncertainty on this score will inevitably make investors cover their exposure. If the uncertainty is compounded by statements that threaten the very process of reforms, there will invariably be a flight of money from the stock market, causing a collapse. The domino effect of this collapse will lead to a fall in the rupee and a complete lack of faith in the intentions of the new government. This aggravates the lefts irresponsibility. It refuses to share in the responsibility of governance, but has gone out of its way to tarnish the image of a government which it claims to support.																														The most direct victim of the lefts so-called anti-capital rhetoric will be Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has driven himself hoarse in the effort to get investment back to West Bengal. The market will recover once it is clear that economic matters in the new government will be handled by none other than Mr Manmohan Singh, the original architect of economic reforms. But because of the likes of Mr Yechury, investors will be wary of coming to a state which is directly ruled by communists. Mr Bhattacharjees enemies are his comrades in New Delhi who do not have to rule or to win elections. Such men harm their own cause and the national one as well. Both Ms Sonia Gandhi and Mr Bhattacharjee could slightly alter John Donne and tell the comrades, For Gods sake hold your tongue and let me govern.

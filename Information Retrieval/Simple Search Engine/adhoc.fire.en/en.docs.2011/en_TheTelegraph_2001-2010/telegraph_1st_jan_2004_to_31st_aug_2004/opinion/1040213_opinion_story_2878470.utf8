The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 13, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Getting to know them better				 																																																				Sir  Our chief election commissioners scarcely know what they are up against. J.M. Lyngdoh at least knew that he was dealing with rascals; the incumbent CEC, T.S. Krishnamurthy, still seems far away from that realization. Hence his desperation even as the saffron brigade makes hay under the shining sun (PMs India will shine until code of conduct, Feb 10). Krishnamurthy should remember that he is likely to encounter the same challenge in each state going to polls. So while Naveen Patnaik of the Biju Janata Dal uses official transport to reach out to the remotest corners of his state (probably for the first time in office) in the name of flagging off river bridges, J. Jayalalithaa in the South uses the interregnum before the announcement of the election dates to shower her bounty on farmers. Instead of crying foul each time a sop is declared, CECs should endeavour to formalize a two-month bar on all such announcements before the polls are held.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, M. Samaddar, Calcutta
				 																Unkindest cut				 																																																				Sir  The foray of the human resource development minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, into the realms of management education is another of his many misadventures (Held in fee (Feb 9). The education ministry under Joshi has earned an unenviable reputation for obfuscatory governance, starting with the controversial rewriting of history text-books. Officials in the ministry are at pains to explain away the directive to the Indian institutes of management to reduce the tuition fees as something which in no way will affect the academic autonomy of the institutions. It will be unwise for the Indian academia to leave the definition of autonomy to entrenched bureaucracy. At this time, it may be worthwhile to recall an episode relating to the Harvard University. When the university celebrated its centenary some years ago, it thought it appropriate to invite the then president, Ronald Reagan, to deliver the keynote address. The doting White House staff, bureaucrats of course, wanted the university to confer an honorary doctorate degree on the president as a quid pro quo. The university, allegedly, promptly declined to do so and asked someone else to do the job. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

				 																																																				Sir  The education ministers move speaks of arrogance and high-handedness. The IIMs should explore the option of appealing to the president and the prime minister to prevail upon the minister to rescind his order. Students from IIMs have become known the world over as the best management talents. Such a foolish move will take the sheen away from the institutes. Even parents like me who can ill-afford the high cost of management education would not like to see the IIM doors being thrown open to every Ram, Shyam and Jadu who wish to be admitted there. The government should keep its hands off and instead concentrate on upgrading the lesser known institutes to IIM standards.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Ram, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I fail to understand the furore over the slashing of fees in the IIMs. Whatever the cause, the move is bound to be to the benefit of students. One is also amazed at the governments determination to disrupt the functioning of the IIMs, given that its own record at management is so dismal. 				 																																																				If the IIMs wish to be self-reliant, they should be financially independent. In fact, there is no reason for them not to be so. What is a few hundred crores of rupees for people like N.R. Narayanamurthy, Y.C. Deveshwar and M.S. Banga who manage giant corporate houses? The shareholders of their companies may even happily agree to their financing IIMs if the students serve the companies after qualifying from the management institutes. The poor students may be provided with loans covering all their expenses by these companies if they agree to sign a bond to serve the companies for the first few years during which the loan will be repayed from their salary. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Quality education always comes at a price. If Murli Manohar Joshis concern is for poor students, he should look at ways to subsidize education for poor, meritorious students and introduce scholarships for them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Kudos to Murli Manohar Joshi for slashing the IIM fees. The amount decided on is a little less than the fees charged by the Indian institutes of technology for undergraduate courses. Both IIMs and IITs are funded by the Central government and get students through highly competitive examinations. So a comparison of the fee structure between the two is not irrelevant. Post-graduate students entering IITs through the graduate aptitude test for engineering are given a scholarship of Rs 5,000 per month, whereas they pay a tuition fee of Rs 5,000 per year. So post-graduate education in the IITs is not only free, it is in fact remunerative. Since IIMs are running post-graduate courses, Murli Manohar Joshi must reduce the fees further and give IIM students scholarships. Students admitted to institutes of both these categories are the intellectual cream of our society and it is in the national interest to encourage them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
P.J. Joglekar, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Why is Murli Manohar Joshi being castigated for reducing the IIM fees? However, the objections to the fee reduction, coming from the teaching community and the present body of students, is understandable. Present students who are paying hefty amounts obviously do not like the fact that future students from a modest background can get away paying less. As for teachers, they enjoy perquisites they do not want to part with. But if the government supplements this loss by making additional grants, and does not interfere with the autonomy as assured by human resource development ministry, why should there be such a hue and cry? The All India Institute of Medical Sciences charges Rs 300 per annum for the tuition charges, the Indian Statistical Institute pays a moderate stipend to their students and the Indian Institute of Science charges a bare minimum to its students. Even IIM students will not claim that students passing out of these institutions are in any way inferior to them as they pay negligible tuition fees. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tamal Basu, Kodalia, Hooghly

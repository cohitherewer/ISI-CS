The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 07, 2004 							 																						ON A ROLL																														With the economy and industry doing well in 2003-04, the corporate sector was bound to show good results in the quarter ending March 2004. After all, manufacturing did grow by 7.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003-04. Around 1,000 companies have declared results for the fourth quarter. These show an increase in sales (over the fourth quarter results of 2002-03) of 20.55 per cent. Interest costs have also dropped by an average of 15 per cent. Consequently, aggregate net profits increased by 56.13 per cent. What is noticeable is the cumulative improvement in net profit performance across the four quarters, a trend also mirrored in sales  but for the second quarter. Dividend payments have also increased and several companies have reported turnarounds in the fourth quarter. While these results are expected, the moot question is whether the good news will carry forward into 2004-05. The overall gross domestic product growth of almost 9 per cent in 2003-04 was largely driven by a low base in 2002-03 and agricultural recovery. However, industry did not suffer from a low base in 2002-03 and most projections for 2004-05 now suggest a continued industrial growth momentum.																														This is not to suggest a replication of the plus 8 per cent GDP growth in 2004-05. But even if the GDP growth slackens to between 6.5 and 7 per cent, industry is likely to grow at 7 per cent plus and services at 8 per cent plus. The key to industrial growth in 2004-05 is private investments, growth based on exploitation of existing capacity having petered out and most sectors exhibiting high capacity utilization. Since the machinery and equipment sector has done well, one can presume that investments will pick up. As a similar indicator, the use-based classification also shows the capital goods sector to have done well. Interest rates will continue to remain low and internal cash accruals high. In its Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations estimates that savings and investment rates have both gone up to around 27 per cent of GDP in 2003, compared to around 25 per cent in 2002. Simultaneously, the Reserve Bank of India seems to have abandoned the idea of allowing the rupee to appreciate and this is good news for exports as well as for domestic industry, despite other problems that such a policy entails. Notwithstanding possible political uncertainty and the consequent uncertainty about the privatization momentum, the good news is therefore likely to continue, even if growth is not as euphoric as in 2003-04.

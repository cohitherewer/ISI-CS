		 Thursday, July 08, 2004 							 																						LOOKING SILLY																														Equivocation is a murky business; it turns the ground into a slippery mess. The British prime minister, Mr Tony Blair, has had to take another unwilling step back, and he has ended up looking, as described by the Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Charles Kennedy, rather silly. Mr Blair said before the liaison committee of select committee chairmen that weapons of mass destruction might never be found in Iraq. This comes ahead of the Butler inquiry report into the flawed intelligence prior to the war. The scope of that inquiry was put under limits by Mr Blair himself. He has allowed it to look into the intelligence concerning the presence of WMDs in Iraq, but prohibited it from examining the political and diplomatic decisions that led Britain to war against that country. The operation was unlikely to raise Mr Blairs ratings on trustworthiness charts as far as Iraq was concerned. In January, Mr Blair was saying that he did not know whether WMDs would be found. It is not necessary for the Butler report for Mr Blair to say what he has now. He is just the last to say it  ahead of the report, of course.																														The problem is Mr Blairs genuineness, an intangible virtue that, he appears to believe, has the magic power to redeem bad thinking, obstinacy, arrogance and a singular shutdown of the grey cells. He still genuinely believes that the weapons were there  Mr Saddam Hussein may have removed, hidden or even destroyed them. How that makes an attack on Iraq logical, when the presumed weapons have disappeared, is really not Mr Blairs business. Whatever the findings now, Mr Blair will not accept that Mr Hussein was not a threat in WMD terms. That is enough. The absence of stockpiles, therefore, in no way weakens the case for Britain having gone to war. It might be asked why Mr Blairs addle-patedness is showing up so much more sharply than Mr George W. Bushs evasion and occasional thunder. The reason probably lies in the firmness and forthrightness of British civil society, all of which seeps into the political arena. He looks silly now, he is likely to look sillier soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Who is the darkest of them all?				 																																																				Sir  That mainstream Hindi cinema is quite blatantly biased in favour of fair women is old hat (Rejected NRI girl lays bare Bollywoods dark side, June 22). Bipasha Basu, Smita Patil and Rekha might be the few dark actresses to have done well in Mumbai, but no one could tell from their films. Layers and layers of pancake went into hiding their natural colour. So why will Pooja Bhatt not accept that this bias exists? Perhaps it is her desire to sound politically correct. But obviously, she is not politically correct enough to approve of the dark Rivona Essop as the heroine of her fathers film. It clashes with her need to make sure that her film clicks with the front-benchers who will only pay to watch fair women, the fairer the better. Besides, Bhatt is no one to make claims about how understated Bollywood has become. There was nothing understated about Jism, which she produced. It was as exaggerated as any C-grade skin flick from the Telugu film industry. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, J. Basu, Calcutta 
				 																Guns blazing				 																																																				Sir  The Ahmedabad police seems to be as fond of fake encounters as the Mumbai police (Countless queries and probe cry, June 19). The Gujarat police claim that Ishrat Raza, who was killed in a shootout near the Ahmedabad airport, was part of a plot to assassinate Narendra Modi. There might be something in the polices claim that the three men accompanying Ishrat were terrorists from the Lashkar-e-Toiba, because of the things recovered from them  a satellite phone, two AK-56 rifles, ammunition and explosives. But even so many questions remain unanswered. The police say that the terrorists fired 42 rounds from their two AK-56 rifles, so how come no policeman was injured? Why was Ishrats family not informed of her death? Most important, when, how, and where did the 19-year-old girl train to plan the assassination of the chief minister of a state. These days even petty thieves do all they can to hide their identity. So is it not strange that Ishrat was travelling with her college identity card? If Ishrat was guilty, she met with the fate she deserved. But if she wasnt, then it again raises questions about politicians and the police who try to gain mileage by killing innocents in fake encounters.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Praveen Ramachandran, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Ishrat Raza incident highlights the trend of proving terrorists as innocent in a trial by media. For example, a television channel recently described the Ansal Plaza shootout as a fake encounter when the testimony of the eyewitness doctor did not stand scrutiny in court. 				 																																																				Ishrats neighbours and her students have told reporters that she was a good girl. What nobody has asked is what this innocent girl was doing so far from home, unbeknown to anyone. From the contradictory testimonies Ishrats family members have given the police, it seems they were trying to exploit the tendency to portray Muslims as persecuted in general. The Congress government in Maharashtra could have scotched all the speculation by ordering a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation. So why is it not doing so? 				 																																																				One can be sure that if it comes to light that Ishrat had terrorist connections, the media, which lack honesty in such things, will relegate the news to the inside pages. Remember the Jhabua nuns rape case? As long as it was a stick to beat Hindus with, it was big news. But when it was found that Christians were involved, it evaporated from the news pages. The media bias may actually be aiding criminals. Why did it not make a hue and cry when the Ghatkopar blast accused jumped custody? But all anyone can talk about is the Best Bakery case.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The controversy over Ishrat Razas death comes at a time when a military court is dealing with fake encounters in the Siachin Glacier. Such issues are very sensitive and the media should not sensationalize them further. Any premature conclusion or over-the-top response may erode the morale of the police who, at considerable risk to their lives, seek to foil the monstrous plans of terrorists. Having said that, human life is precious, and the police should always remember this. Before the guns are drawn, they should have concrete evidence so as to avoid controversy later. Otherwise, Ishrats death will play on the minds of all innocent citizens, who will live in constant fear for their lives.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

				 																																																				Sir  Four innocent young people may have died to ensure Narendra Modi continues as Gujarats chief minister. There are simply too many inconsistencies in the police version of events to take their account at face value. Also, why would the Lashkar-e-Toiba want to kill Modi now, when he may be on the way out at long last? It would only raise sympathy for the Bharatiya Janata Party. It is far more likely that the encounter was staged only to bail out Modi, yet again. But even this might not save Modi, if the BJP is forced to choose between him and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B. Purkayastha, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir  For the past few years, Islamic terrorists have been targeting BJP leaders in Gujarat. Take the murder of Haren Pandya. It is obvious that mercenaries are scheming to kill Narendra Modi. The media need to see the killings of Ishrat Raza and four others in Ahmedabad recently in this light, instead of directing all its energies into proving the innocence of those killed. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ramesh Dewan, Chennai 

				 																																																				Sir  The Gujarat police suspected that four people travelling in a certain car were terrorists, fired at the car and killed all the passengers. How can the police be expected to know that one of them was innocent? Instead of blaming the police for the encounter, the National Human Rights Commission should seek reports from the Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal state governments for the suicides and starvation deaths, respectively, in the states.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
V.A. Gopala, Bangalore 

				 																																																				Sir  The NHRC request to the Gujarat police to submit a report on the Ishrat Raza case is most likely to fall on deaf ears. I cannot recall a single case where NHRC has asked for a report or has recommended some action to the government, and its pleas have been heeded, in toto. The NHRC, in sum, is quite ineffectual.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Ahmed, Calcutta

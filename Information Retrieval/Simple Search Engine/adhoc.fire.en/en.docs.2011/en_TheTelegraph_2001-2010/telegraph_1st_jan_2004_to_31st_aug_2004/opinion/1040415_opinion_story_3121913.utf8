The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 15, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																State of disorder				 																																																				Sir  The faux pas of birthday boy, Lalji Tandon, has thrown a spanner in Atal Bihari Vajpayees plan of filing his nomination papers amid much gaiety and fanfare (Stampede snips Atal show frills, April 14). The incident exposes the cavalier attitude of politicians when it comes to paying obeisance to the Election Commission or the law courts. In Lucknow, Tandon trespassed on the ECs lakshman rekha by trying to dole out saris to the fateful congregation of women  a useful strategy to gain maximum mileage for the leader during election time. Earlier, we had the Trinamool Congress leader, Mamata Banerjee, at her histrionic best at Hooghly, violating a high court order on the use of loudspeakers (Mamata in sound bar row, April 12). Why are politicians allowed to belittle the constitutional bodies while the common man risks the severest censure if they dare to do the same? Do the inherent biases in these state agencies have anything to do with the discrepancy?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Balaram Ghosh, Calcutta
				 																Writing on the wall				 																																																				Sir  As Swapan Dasgupta points out in his article, Maximum impact (April 9), the election strategy of the Congress has gone all haywire. But it does not help if the Bharatiya Janata Party starts to increasingly resemble the Congress of yore. It has successfully hijacked the economic agenda of the Congress and taken it forward. But its projection of Atal Bihari Vajpayee shows that it has also adopted the Congresss personality cult, as characterized by the partys obsession with the Nehru-Gandhis. The BJP could have carried this off had its linking of Vajpayee with the India Shining campaign been less blatant. Unfortunately, this was not to be. If the Congress is falling behind in this game, it is because it lacks a leader of Vajpayees stature. No wonder that there should be such an air of despondency in the Congress ranks.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Swapan Dasgupta is incapable of dishing out anything new. His fare this time was also with its usual overdoze of saffron (Maximum impact). The BJP has in him its most trusted lieutenant who will continue to sing its paeans even if voters fail to realize the partys worth. Ashok Mitras lament over capitalist conspiracies in his Friday columns are any day preferable to Dasguptas coloured contemplations. Yours faithfully, 
Mrinmoy Prasad Goswami, Nagaon 				 																																																				Sir  If Swapan Dasgupta wants us to believe that the BJP is not going overboard with its plan to link India Shining or Bharat Uday with the prime minister, then he is wrong. Many readers would remember the innumerable pictures that dotted the Vision Document, 2004 when it was released. These were unceremoniously deleted after they embarrassed Atal Bihari Vajpayee no end. Also, if the intention was to link Bharat Uday with Vajpayee, the prime minister should have undertaken the yatra, and not L.K. Advani who is often projected as Vajpayees alternative. To identify the vikas purush as the sole face of the party was a BJP gambit not merely to have the maximum impact on voters, but also to lessen the effect of the personality clashes that have plagued the party in the run-up to the polls.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The cry against the dynasty rule of the Nehru-Gandhi family does not have much sense. Swapan Dasgupta argues that Congress fortunes are dictated by the priorities of the Nehru-Gandhis. But the induction of the family members is engineered by the supporters of Congress who want to capitalize on the charisma of the members of this family as an election strategy. Besides, no dynasty can survive in a democracy without facing the litmus test in elections.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Not good enough				 																																																				Sir  The print and the electronic media have given the Silchar Lok Sabha constituency in south Assam unprecedented coverage. But before the people cast their votes here, they should remind themselves of certain facts. One, Silchar town depends almost entirely on private nursing homes, given the corruption and lack of basic amenities in the Medical College Hospital and the civil hospital. Two, roads in Silchar are among the worst in Assam, if one discounts the sudden public works department activities during election time. Three, the abysmal drainage because of which the monsoons are looked upon as a curse. Four, the power situation. The Barak dam projects remains an elusive dream while power failures haunt daily existence. Five, poor communication. A 12-hour journey is required to take the people to the state capital. The railway system has almost collapsed. Six, the education scenario. It is true that Silchar has everything starting from a polytechnic to a Central university. The question is the educational standard in these institutions. Seven, there are hardly any parks or auditoriums of some standard in Silchar. This is the condition of Silchar. Yet politicians are shameless enough to flaunt their achievements to the people and to their rivals. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully

				 																																																				Sir  In her speech at Golaghat in Assam, Sonia Gandhi alleged that the United Liberation Front of Asom gained in strength during the National Democratic Alliance rule. Yet, the people of this state know for sure that the genesis of the ULFA goes back to the days of Congress rule, both at the Centre and in the state. The ULFA was a movement against the step-motherly attitude of the Centre. Sonia also came down on the BJP for using the Bofors against her children and possibly even her grand-children. Does she expect her grand-children to join the party as well? For how long will the Nehru-Gandhis rule the party? Why does the Congress need to evoke sympathy for the dynasty to survive?Yours faithfully,

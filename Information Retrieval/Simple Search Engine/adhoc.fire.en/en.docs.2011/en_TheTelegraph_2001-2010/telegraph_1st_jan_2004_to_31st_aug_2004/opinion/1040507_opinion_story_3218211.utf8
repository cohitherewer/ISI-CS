		 Friday, May 07, 2004 							 																						GETTING TO KNOW MR GRAHAM GREENE				 	 Heart of the matterIN SEARCH OF A BEGINNING: MY LIFE WITH GRAHAM GREENE By Yvonne Cloetta, Bloomsbury, pound; 16.99Yvonne Cloetta was Graham Greenes partner for 32 years. They first met in Douala in Cameroon in March 1959. It may not have been love at first sight, but there was an immediate attraction on Greenes side. He took the trouble to set up a meeting with her in Nice in the summer. It was in Nice that the relationship began to blossom, first as an abiding friendship and soon enough they became lovers.																														Graham Greene was a soul in torment. He had been through innumerable love affairs. The most passionate of these had been with Catherine Walston which became the subject of The End of the Affair, one of his truly great and moving books. But in Yvonne, he found his still centre. His emotional life lost its turbulence as Yvonne became its anchor. The relationship retained its richness and its endearing textures even after the sexual energies had run their course. Greene, in April 1990  he was to die the next year  told Yvonne, I now realize that love  real, true love  between two human beings only reveals itself once its no longer a question of sex. This realization came to him as he lived through the most important relationship of his life.																														This book is an attempt to get to the heart of the relationship through Yvonnes recollection of her life with Greene. The book is woven around a series of interviews that Marie-Francoise Allain, a family friend of Greene, took of Yvonne.																														The book tells the story of a very deep and abiding love, and this at times is somewhat cloying. But there are other aspects here which more than compensate for the overt expression of what was a very private affair. When the two met, Greene considered himself to be a burnt-out case and he was suffering inwardly for having to put up with Querry, the gloomy character of A Burnt Out Case. This was quintessential Greene who suffered terribly during the process of writing. Yvonne says, I came to understand the agony he went through, even though I couldnt possibly share it. It was like a woman giving birth. What can one do to help her?																														Greene had served in the British Secret Service during World War II. He was a close friend of Kim Philby and remained one despite all that had been revealed by Philby. He never accepted Philby as a traitor and believed that loyalty to individuals was more important than loyalty to ones country. There are accounts here of the meetings between Greene and Philby in Moscow. According to Yvonne, Greenes secret was his passion for secrecy. It was this fascination for secrecy that drew Greene to priests and the power that confession conferred on them. Even after he had left the MI6, Greene was used for secret work. He carried a letter to Ho Chi Minh, who in return gave him a film which Greene claimed (in what can only be taken as a rather obvious piece of dissembling) to have lost. Yet he passed on to the Foreign Office the letters that Philby had written to him about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. To the very end, Yvonne admits frankly, he worked with the British Services.																														This is a warm and adoring book. But one wonders if Greene, with his almost obsessive sense of privacy and his penchant for the unadorned, would have welcomed it.

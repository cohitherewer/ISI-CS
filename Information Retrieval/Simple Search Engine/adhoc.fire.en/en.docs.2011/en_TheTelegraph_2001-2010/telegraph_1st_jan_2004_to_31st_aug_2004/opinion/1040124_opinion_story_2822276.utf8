 Out and About

				 																																	Cross Bonnie Chakraborty with A.R. Rahman and what do you get? The Bombay Dreams of a Bangla rock artiste. The ex-Krosswindz lead singer, who left for the Chennai shores three years ago, has finally found his Bollywood calling. Rahman has trusted him and his mix-baul-with-rock-and-end-up-nowhere band, Oikyotaan, with the backing vocals of The Rising. Bonnie is also singing a Bengali song for Shyam Benegals Netaji Subhas  The Last Hero. Ive known Rahman for the past one year, and he asked me to collaborate with him this time, he proudly says. Heres to your krossover, Bonnie boy! 
				 																																	Oh-so-eager Bollywood seems to be cashing in on the current Indo-Pak diplomatic warmth already. After Urmila Matondkar and Pooja Bhatts trips to our neighbour, the Pakistani performers are now returning the visits. Folk singer Reshma, who crooned the memorable Lambi Judai in the Eighties hit, Hero, is in India to record her next song, after 20 years. Meanwhile, gorgeous Pakistani actress Reema Khan is visiting Mumbai to finalise her role in producer G.T. Mehras new film. The Indian media has gone ga-ga over her, especially since she cant stop talking about how similar India is to Pakistan. Now, where did we hear that one before?

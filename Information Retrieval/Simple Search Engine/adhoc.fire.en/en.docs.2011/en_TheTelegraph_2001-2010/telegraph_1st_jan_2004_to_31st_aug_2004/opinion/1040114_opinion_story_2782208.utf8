		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 OUT OF CONTROL
																								Control is the other side of munificence. The Indian institutes of management and of technology have had reason to ponder the implications of this dictum more than any other government-aided educational body in the country. They may have done so with varying degrees of resistance and acceptance. But perhaps the IIMs can now rely on the build-up to general elections for some abatement of their conflict with the Union human resource development minister. However, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi might use precisely the imminent elections to underline his concessions on this particular sector of Indian higher education. Mr Joshis pressure on the IIMs and IITs to reduce their fees by a rather spectacular amount will amount to an annual subsidy of Rs 4,000 crore for the Centre. In return, the ministry will ensure a drastic cut in the gradually built-up autonomy of these institutions, an autonomy that has become inseparable from the academic and professional excellence that they guarantee. Mr Joshis stakes in such control are obviously immense, since this huge subsidy is lower by only a quarter than the Central budget for elementary education and literacy, or that for secondary and higher education.																								The rhetoric, though, is not about control at all, but about increasing accessibility to higher education. Slashing the fees from an annual Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 20,000 for the IIMs and to Rs 6,000 for the IITs have apparently been recommended by the U.R. Rao committee. But apart from a huge hole in the Central budget, this could lead to these institutes crippling dependence on the government in everything from the nitty-gritty of administration to the content and methods of teaching, including such things as teacher-student ratios and even the mobility of the directors. Already, the pressure is being felt in other ways too. Delhi Universitys Faculty of Management Studies is engaged in a severe tussle with the HRD ministry ever since Mr Joshi has asked the faculty to cancel its February entrance test. The University Grants Commission has also been roped into this tussle, with its threats for the slashing of funds. Behind all this, is the paternalistic assumption that giving grants entitles the government to consider itself an expert on how these institutes ought to be run. The Centre will find it very difficult to take management education away from such regulatory bodies as the All India Council for Technical Education (or its subsidiary, the Board of Management Studies) and entrust it to an independent regulatory body of management specialists. In these cases, redundant progenitors must not feel insecure about letting go.

		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 							 																						PROBLEMS WITH A REVENUE WINDFALL Srinjay Chakravarti																								The past few months have seen a phenomenon so unprecedented that the Indian economy may well be on its way to notching up a record of sorts. For the first time since independence, the Centre is set to surpass its direct tax collection targets. The net direct tax collections of the government is projected to cross Rs 1,00,000 crore in 2003-04, far higher than the budget target of Rs 95,714 crore. This means a tax collections growth of 22.4 per cent, as against the budget estimate of 17.6 per cent.																								But the dazzling data conceals some truths that may temper the optimism of tax officials and policy-makers. True, tax collections  particularly direct taxes  are buoyant. And this is where the catch lies. For the first time, the Centre had fixed a realistic, achievable target for tax collections this year. In the past, such goals were practically impossible to achieve. 																								Of course, during the past year, industrial growth has edged up by over five per cent, foreign exchange reserves have crossed $100 billion and the stock market has soared. The splendid monsoon has reinforced the feel-good factor in the economy, transmitting its impact to industry. 																								Gross direct tax collections shot up impressively in the very first month of this fiscal year. But with refunds  at Rs 6,365 crore, nearly 90 per cent higher than the Rs 3,363 crore given back in the same period last year  outstripping collections, the net growth recorded was negative.  Full coffers																								By September 2003, corporate tax collections had grown by 29 per cent and the net direct tax mop-up by 15 per cent. Indirect tax collections, however, grew by an indifferent eight per cent. 																								This has been the trend since. Direct tax collections were up by 20.4 per cent till October, rocketing to 23.5 per cent  at Rs 64,230 crore  by mid-December, the result of an industrial resurgence and better corporate results. Targets were exceeded for the first time in 15 years. Now it is evident that the budget targets will probably be surpassed by March, when advance taxes start accruing. 																								Corporate tax collections until December 31, 2003, have also been phenomenal, about three-fourths of the budgeted figure. Over the previous year, it has grown by nearly 33 per cent. 																								So impressive has been the mop-up from the corporate sector that it has overshadowed the around 10 per cent growth in income tax collection. During the first nine months of this fiscal, income taxes rose to Rs 25,583 crore (as against Rs 23,326 crore in the same period a year ago).  The downside																								New Delhi estimates a mop-up of Rs 44,109 crore from income taxes alone this fiscal year. What this rosy picture ignores are problem areas like customs collection. The growth in customs, excise and other tax collections has been just nine per cent until December. Thus, only the widening of the tax net to include more areas in the service sector would keep the overall tax collections high. 																								This has been quite the trend in the Indian fiscal framework in the Nineties that while direct tax collections have improved, they have not been able to neutralize the impact of falling indirect tax revenues. Also, it puts a disproportionate burden on the industrial sector though the fast-growing services sector now accounts for over 50 per cent of the gross domestic product.																								C. Rangarajan, chairman of the 12th finance commission, observed recently that the tax-GDP ratio declined by nearly two per cent from 16 per cent in 1986-87 to 14 per cent in 2003-04. This fall was caused by the decline in indirect taxes-GDP ratio by 2.8 per cent. It was only partly offset by the rise of 0.9 per cent in the ratio of direct taxes to GDP.																								The buoyancy in direct tax collections this year, thus, is only one side of the picture. Its other aspect is the modest growth in indirect taxes. As somebody once said, You can prove everything by statistics  except the truth.

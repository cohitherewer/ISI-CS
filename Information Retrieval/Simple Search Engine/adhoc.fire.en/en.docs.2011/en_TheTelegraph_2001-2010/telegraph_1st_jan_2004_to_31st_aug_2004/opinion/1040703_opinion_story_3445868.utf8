The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 03, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Truce for now				 																																																				N Sir  There is really no reason to cheer the report, IIM fee row ends with return to old order (June 30). The Union human resource development minister, Arjun Singh, may announce that the controversy has ended, but the entire ruckus has exposed how the Indian Institutes of Management are beholden to the whims and fancies of the government of the day. One can be sure that if a future incumbent in the HRD ministry wants to play around with these institutes, he can do so with impunity. The IIMs cannot rest until they have been granted autonomy, something that Singh has, very interestingly, not promised.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Rashmi Sengupta, Calcutta
				 																																																				Spare a thought				 																																																				Sir  Why should the rabbits, pigs and stray dogs  who were released into the Sanjay Gandhi National Park to ensure that leopards did not encroach upon inhabited areas  be made to pay for the sins of human beings (Pigs and rabbits on leopard plate, June 30)? The authorities who have made this decision have perpetrated a shocking cruelty. Its we human beings who have encroached into the leopards habitat, disturbing the natural food chain and leading to a man-animal conflict that now threatens to create havoc (thanks to a comatose administration). 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Joydip Kundu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Midnight train mows down elephant (June 21), was heart-rending. Many elephants have died recently either in accidents with trains or as a result of electrocution. Most of these tragedies happen when these gentle animals, maddened by hunger, go looking for food. Clearly, the traditional habitat of the elephants no longer supplies all their needs. The Northeast Frontier Railways and the state government are to blame for these accidents. Speed restrictions near the areas where the animals live could be one measure to stop these accidents. Railway tracks may even be shifted as a more permanent measure. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Abhijeet Sharma, Gharchuk

				 																																																				Sir  It seems that the Union railway minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, is too busy with sal-leaf plates and earthen cups to care much about saving the elephants lives. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shilpi Singh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is obvious that a man who displays the tusks of slain pachyderms proudly in his house has little feeling for animals. It is ironical that the tusk of an elephant was used to murder Harnam Singh Seth and his wife in their Vasant Enclave apartment (Crime capital claims retired general, wife, June 21)? The president of the Vasant Enclave residents association was right to point to the lack of security for senior citizens. But our sanctuaries too lack security, and are open from all sides, making residents susceptible to poaching.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar.

				 																																																				Sir  The photograph, captioned Duck crossing (June 22), was simply wonderful. There was something idyllic about it; it hinted at a world where human and ducks are in perfect harmony. There is not a speck of dirt on the road, or evidence of cars honking and impatient drivers. The traffic police woman has a smile on her face as she goes about her duty; the mother duck seems to be confident no harm will come to her as she crosses the road, while the ducklings dutifully follow her lead. Like all good pictures, this one was worth a thousand words.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nirmal Kumar Sil, Calcutta

				 																Traffic diversion				 																																																				Sir  Some hoardings have recently come up in Alipore which exhort the public to follow traffic rules and give directions to a few important roads. These have been put up by a leading jewellery house and approved by the Calcutta police. But most of the hoardings are taken up by stylish jewellery adorned by scantily-dressed models. This distracts drivers especially at night, when the fluorescent lamps are switched on. Will the police bosses take a closer look at these hoardings?				 																																																				Yours faithfullyA.S. Mehta, Calcutta

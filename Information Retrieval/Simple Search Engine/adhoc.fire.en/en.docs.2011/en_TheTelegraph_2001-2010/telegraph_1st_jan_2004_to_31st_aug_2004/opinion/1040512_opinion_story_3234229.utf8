		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 							 																						MORAL FAILURE																														A good leader converts challenges into opportunities. Assams chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, faces a test of his abilities as a leader. The test comes in his handling of the corruption charges against some of his ministers and in the rebellion of some of his Congress colleagues. The allegation of the involvement of two of his ministers in the pilferage of crude oil from the pipelines is too serious for Mr Gogoi to overlook. He has clearly failed the first test by rejecting the resignation of one of the ministers. The failure is both moral and political. Even if it is an allegation and is yet to be proved true, the exit of the ministers would have made the inquiry look transparent and fair. Mr Gogoi would do well to remember that the corruption charges against the Asom Gana Parishad government were among the principal issues on which the Congress had fought and won the last assembly elections in the state. By refusing to act on the allegation, Mr Gogoi has allowed the opposition parties like the AGP and the Bharatiya Janata Party to question his governments sincerity to fight corruption. 																														It is not difficult to see why Mr Gogoi has failed to take the logical step. He is obviously anxious that any action against the accused would stir a hornets nest in his own party. Given the factional feud within the state unit of the party, his anxiety is not wholly unfounded. But he would have to face the problem anyway once he downsizes his ministry in accordance with the recent Central legislation on the size of ministries. It would have made eminent sense for him to take advantage of the new constitutional compulsion for downsizing his ministry in order to clean up his cabinet. The image of his government would take a beating if he surrendered to the compulsions of partisan politics. Such a strategy would amount to submitting to blackmail and once a chief minister does so, he would see no end of it. Mr Gogoi can still redeem himself by ordering an impartial probe, preferably by the Central Bureau of Investigation, into the charge of oil-theft. He should also keep the accused ministers out of his cabinet till they are cleared of the charge.

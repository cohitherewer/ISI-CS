The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 							 																						FOR THE RECORD																														It has become a part of political correctness for cricketers to say that records do not matter, or to utter the inanity that records are meant to be broken. But consider a situation like the one that prevailed in the ongoing test match in Multan between India and Pakistan. Two batsmen in full flow; the wicket so dead as to have not even an afterlife; the bowling barely test- level; the fielding deplorable; and captaincy non-existent. The situation looks tailor-made for creating a batting record for the third-wicket partnership. But Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar fail to reach 467, the record created by Andrew Jones and Martin Crowe of New Zealand against Sri Lanka in Wellington in 1990-91. In fact, the Indian batsmen failed to come near 451, the runs put up by Mudassar Nazar and Javed Miandad against India in 1982-83 in Hyderabad. The MiandadNazar partnership was the third-wicket record before Jones and Crowe broke it. The failure of the Indian duo meant that so far as batting is concerned, India has registered only two world records. One is for the first- wicket partnership: Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy against New Zealand in Madras in 1955-56. Mankad and Roy scored 413. The other is better known: highest number of test match centuries; Sunil Gavaskar who scored 34 hundreds.																														Records have proved elusive for Indian cricketers. And when they have been registered, their lives have been short-lived like the number of wickets taken by Kapil Dev. This must be a little more than a coincidence. Are the Indian batsmen, past or present, worse than the batsmen in other countries? The answer must be no. When Miandad and Nazar made the record, India had batsmen of the calibre of Gavaskar, Vishwanath, Vengsarkar, and so on. But they were nowhere near setting a world record for any wicket. When Jones and Crowe were totting up 467, Tendulkar was already on the scene and India had someone like Azharuddin. Again no records were established. So the issue has nothing to do with the calibre of the batsmen. It has to do with an attitude, and with a hunger for runs. The redoubtable Don Bradman once said that when he scored a hundred, he took a new guard and concentrated on getting another. This is what made him a record-breaking and record-making batsman even though he never sought to set records. In Multan the other day, with everything going in their favour, Tendulkar and Sehwag failed to set a record. There is thus a question mark over Indian batting achievements. The query is similar to the one that often follows the slogan India Shining. India is doing well but is it shining? Certainly not in cricket records.

		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 							 																						PEOPLES EUROPE																														Mr Tony Blair has been described as the Grand Old Duke of Spin by the leader of the Conservative Party. And Mr Blair has spun again. He has now swerved round to the side of a referendum on the proposed constitution of the European Union, which is quite a U-turn from what he was saying as late as last summer, sounding uncannily like Ms Margaret Thatcher: We dont govern in this country by referendum. But at Westminster, earlier this week, he declared to a fairly stunned Commons that he would let the British people have the final say about how they want to see themselves aligned to that old ghost, Europe. He also made this out to be nothing less than a matter of how Britain wanted to position itself in a modern, interdependent world. 																														It is perfectly understandable that now, more than at any other time, Mr Blair would want to project himself as fearlessly committed to democratic principles. Over the last year  through the arc of his reckless friendship with Mr Bush  democracy has begun to look increasingly shoddy in Britain. So going to the people for an opinion on Europe is both politic and profoundly risky. British popular Europhobia is thriving, stoked by the politics of the euro. So much so that many see Mr Blairs swing as the victory of the tabloids. Far from looking fearlessly democratic, Mr Blair is being seen by his opponents as a hostage making a false confession on TV because there is a hooded man with a gun at his head  in the words of a Tory member of parliament. The hooded man is Mr Rupert Murdoch, whose emissary, the American economist, Mr Irwin Steltzer, warned Mr Blair before Easter that the Sun and the other Murdoch organs would withhold their support unless he granted the referendum, which they are confident that the Eurosceptics will win. A recent poll in the Sun says that only 16 per cent of the nation will accept the EU constitution at this point of time. There is also a confusion in the public mind between saying No to the constitution and saying No to Europe. Nobody quite knows whether the two are identical. Besides, with the referendum pencilled in for November 2005, some of the other member states may veto the constitution before that, rendering Mr Blairs referendum unnecessary. For this bid for a poll to look like an authentic gesture, Mr Blair will have to present the case for Europe with a persistent clarity in the face of where he stands in the eyes of his people now. He would also have to work against the grain of an entrenched tradition of British parochialism. Otherwise, this damage control might end up doing more damage.

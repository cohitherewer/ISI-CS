		 Friday, July 30, 2004 							 																						THE HOT AND COLD OF IT NEHA SAHAY																					As temperatures touch 35 degrees, expatriates in China pack their bags and head home. The heat is too much for them, that is the whites who form the majority of expats in the Special Economic Zones of the South. Not that they have to spend too much time in the heat. In China, expats have the latest technology at their service. A fully furnished home comes equipped with air-conditioners and hot-and-cold water dispensers. 																					Then there are the exclusive villa complexes favoured by expats with families. Each villa has its own driveway, lawn, table-tennis room and swimming pool. Very few Chinese are able to afford these. It is mostly businessmen from Hong Kong and Macao who buy these mansions, either to rent them out or use them as weekend pleasure resorts.																					When summer began in real earnest last month, international schools catering only to foreigners children started cutting down on outdoor games (except swimming), and sunscreen lotions became part of their students daily kit. It was a strange sight therefore that greeted the Chinese on their way to work one sunny June morning: a large group of mostly white expats, most of them small children, walking on the pavement in full protective gear.																					Inquiries revealed they were on their way to a theme park a good 20-minute walk away. An AC double-decker sight-seeing bus, the kind kids would love, could have taken them there, but it had no seat-belts. American companies do not permit their employees to use public transport, and this particular international school was run by Americans. 																					Children special																					International schools in China end their academic year by end-June and open late August, following the Western school calendar. It makes sense therefore, for the foreigners who live here with their children, to head for the nearest international airport in July.																					But not everyone can get away. What do those left behind to cope with the heat do? Cool off in AC gyms? For 50 yuan per use, they can spend the entire day working out, swimming, playing basketball, lounging on deck chairs. The state-of-the-art facilities are almost for their exclusive use, because the Chinese dont need to spend a fortune to exercise. Many parks  and Chinese cities are full of them  have basic exercise equipment installed, freely accessible to everyone. Even Beijings disappearing hutongs (old single-storeyed courtyard houses ) offer their residents a mini-gym on the sidewalk. For those too shy to exercise in public  there couldnt be many, given the number of Chinese going through the slow, graceful movements of tai chi in the open  there are non-AC gyms, charging just 10 yuan per use. Swimming pools come even cheaper: even 4-star hotels charge just 15 yuan for unlimited use.																					Condition for comfort																					Then there are the expat bars. Outdoor seating under trees, Chinese, German or American beer, endless French fries  what better way to while away the nights while the wife and kids are away? Now if only the spaghetti Bolognaise wasnt a barely-disguised noodles-with-mince and the club sandwich had cheese instead of some mysterious white paste.																					Western-style cafs can be found in almost every south China city, but the food most of them pass off as Western is to a Westerner what Indian chicken Manchurian must taste to a Chinese. But these cafs are as tuned in to global events as the classy giants. If the latter offer all-night buffets for viewing major European sports events, the cafs too have their Euro 2004 menus. But what expats seem to like best are the Bar Streets, entire streets choc-a-bloc with open-air bars which come to life only after 9 pm and stay open till 3 am. The ambience makes up for the food. English-speaking girls are much in demand here as waitresses, though half of the clientle comprises well-heeled Chinese youth out to have a roaring night out.																					For Indians, summer in China isnt much different from back home, except that instead of sweating it out in overcrowded buses, they can travel for as little as 2 yuan in equally over-crowded  but air-conditioned  buses.

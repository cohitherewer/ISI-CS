The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 20, 2004 							 																						PEOPLE IN THEIR SPACESPRIVACY (Steidl, $30) by Dayanita Singh collects sequences of black and white photographs of the Indian rich. The money is mostly old and unembarrassed. This is a world of solid, but fading cosmopolitanism, with regional variations picked up with irony and affection by Singhs Hasselblad camera. Singh creates an archive of people, families, interiors, postures, expressions and objects  what Britta Schmitz calls in her excellent essay the accessories and details which comprise identities. Singhs precursors are Vermeer, Sargent and Ingres (without the colours, of course) as she creates a series of frames depicting the relationships between bodies, faces, clothes, shoes, jewellery, carpets, furniture, books, mirrors, pets, pictures, deities, saints and servants. These pictures are taken in Calcutta  Kuhu Choudhury and Mother-in-Law on the left, Sybil and Sunanda on the right. There are many versions of India, and this is mine.

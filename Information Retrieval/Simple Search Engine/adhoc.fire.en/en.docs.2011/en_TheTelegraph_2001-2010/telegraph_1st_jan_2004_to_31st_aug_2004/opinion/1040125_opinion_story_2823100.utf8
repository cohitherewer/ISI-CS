The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 25, 2004 							 																						GRAPES OF JOY With the relaxing of import restrictions  and increasing upward mobility, wine drinking is just beginning  to come into its own in India Time was when wine drinking was  something the French indulged in as a pastime. The English  drank ale, gin and whisky. A wee dram of the water of life  was the Scotsmans poison. In India, because it was a British  colony, drinking followed British fashions. The G amp;T  before lunch and the chhota peg before dinner was  the sahibs preference. Drinking, social or otherwise,  meant spirits or hard liquor. The occasional bottle of champagne  was kept by the very rich for celebratory occasions. There  was the odd ex-Maharaja who drank only champagne, but by  and large the drinking classes stuck to their Scotch (or  in the days of high socialism and restrictions, to that  great oxymoron  Indian Made Foreign Liquor). In Britain,  drinking habits began to change in the Seventies when the  British took to drinking wine. Pubs began to have wine bars  and the high street off-licence began to stock wine in large  quantities. Wine moved from something that the toffs imbibed  to something the man on the number 11 bus also picked off  the shelf from his local Odd Bins. This trend has taken  more than three decades to reach India largely because of  prevailing import restrictions. India has never had a wine-making  tradition. Potable  many would say barely potable  wines  grown and made in India are barely five years old.																														In that five years, the greater availability of wines has brought about a visible change in the drinking habits of people in Calcutta and elsewhere. More and more people, especially young men and women, prefer to drink wine over whisky or any other spirits. In private dinner parties and in hotels and restaurants, the imbibing patterns have clearly changed. The reasons for the change are difficult to pinpoint but certain factors do suggest themselves. One is the greater awareness regarding health; and here the medical opinion is unanimous: wine drinking is beneficial to health, consumption of hard liquor is not. Women who drink prefer wine to the hard stuff and even non-drinkers of both sexes do not mind sipping the occasional glass. Wine drinking is also aspirational. The upwardly mobile with more disposable incomes emulate their superiors and when they eat out, they find that wine goes down better with a meal than any kind of hard liquor.																														Wine drinking, like the eating of good cheese, is an acquired taste. Not everybody has the stomach for a Stilton or strong goats cheese the French so adore. Similarly, only a handful have the nose for a good wine. The rise in the consumption of wine is not necessarily a sign of discernment. Again, the art of being discerning about wine should not take away from enjoying a bottle of white or red. Wine drinking has an entire culture of etiquette and ritual attached to it  how to drink the wine, what glasses to use, the breathing time, what food goes with which wine and so on. Wine drinking has its own lore and jargon. Shrewd wine merchants say, Buy on apples, sell on cheese. In India, awareness about wine and its rich complexities has just begun to grow. The process once begun cannot be stopped. In vino veritas, they say.

		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 							 																						A NEW TRIBE OF VOTERS N.K. Pant																					This is probably the first general elections in which electoral officers will come across a tribe of voters casting ballots by proxy on behalf of serving soldiers. This newly conferred right will be exercised by the soldiers wife or the father and is modelled on British electoral laws which have proxy voting for many years. It means that the soldiers next of kin will be entitled to an extra vote in addition to his or her own franchise. Though roughly 1.5 million armed forces personnel constitute a fraction of the more than 650 million voters in the country, yet in some segments, they, together with ex-servicemen, can tilt the balance of votes in favour of a particular candidate.																					The National Democratic Alliance had in mind soldiers votes, which, despite the existing provision of casting the ballot by post, were going to waste. The government was able to get the bill seeking proxy-voting rights for armed forces personnel passed in the Lok Sabha only in February last year amid opposition protest that no consensus was evolved on the issue. Termed as Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 1999, the legislation was pushed through the floor of the house by a voice vote. The opposition claimed that the right to franchise was non-transferable and hence the bill violated not only the secrecy of the ballot but also the Constitution. 																					Urgent need																					The government tried to allay these fears by pointing to the fact that the system was being followed in several democracies around the world. The law minister also clarified that the proxy voting will be one of the three options available to soldiers. The other alternatives are the use of the postal ballot facility and casting votes in person whenever the personnel are present at their respective home constituencies.																					It is possible that the request for such a provision came from the armed forces personnel themselves or it may have been suggested by the Election Commission. Soldiers deployed far away from their homes have often felt that they are denied the basic right to exercise their franchise. The existing system of postal ballot has not served its purpose as it stipulated a time-frame of 14 days  far too short a period for the ballot papers to reach the soldiers and be sent back after the vote is cast. There were instances when the postal ballots had, to the chagrin of the uniformed voters, reached the armys field formations long after the polls were over.																					Sacred duty																					Since the army top brass seems to have strongly recommended vote by proxy, the political leadership was prudent enough to concede to the demand by making an amendment to the Representation of People Act. The defence minister, George Fernandes, known for his frequent touring of inhospitable forward areas, including Siachen, had often been asked by the troops for proxy voting rights in the course of informal chats.																					Doubts have been expressed in the ruling as well as opposition circles on the possible misuse of the provision. The timing of the legal amendment has also been questioned. These fears need to be allayed. Armed forces personnel drawn from the length and breadth of the country form a very small fraction of the electorate. Even if some of the proxy votes are misused, they may not make a significant dent in the final election results. But in the final count, the proxy votes of the uniformed men taken together might prove to be decisive for states like Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana which usually send a considerable number of young, able-bodied men to the nations fighting services.																					The newly acquired privilege of delegating voting rights to the next of kin by the soldiers, sailors and airmen deployed in remote locations should inculcate in them a sense of participation in the process of electing representatives of their choice to the local bodies, state legislatures and Parliament. As democratic governments are formed by the elected members of these august bodies, the privilege to choose legislators should instil amongst the combatants a feeling of also taking part in governance of the nation whose defence happens to be their sacred duty.

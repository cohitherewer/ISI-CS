The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 10, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Cracks in the wall				 																																																				Sir  Sadly, the Mr Dependable tag cannot be applied to Rahul Dravid. First, he stirred a hornets nest with his ill-timed declaration when Sachin Tendulkar was stranded on 194 runs in Multan. Next, he put India firmly on the back foot by opting to bat first on the green-top. Surely, Indian bowlers would have had the Pakistanis on the mat by using the seaming conditions. The fact that Dravid underestimated his bowlers, despite their heroics in Multan, justifies his stand-in skipper tag.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Animesh Ghosh, Calcutta 
				 																High disdain				 																																																				Sir  Githa Hariharan seems to have conveniently forgotten that the Hindu-Muslim divide advocated by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh stalwarts was effectively implemented by Jawaharlal Nehru when he threw his weight behind Mohammed Ali Jinnahs two-nation theory (Our forgettable forefathers, April 4). Reportedly, Jinnah was agreeable to a united country, provided he was made the first prime minister of independent India. This was anathema to both Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru. The certainty of a holocaust if India was partitioned could not subdue Nehru aspira- tions for the prime ministers chair.				 																																																				We have developed a penchant for blaming everything on the Partition, while turning a blind eye to the perpetrators of this horror. Gandhi is said to have vowed that he would rather die than see India divided. If he were serious, why did he not resist the bifurcation more stridently? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is obvious that Githa Hariharan regards the RSS with high disdain, damning the ideas of its mentors like Madan Mohan Malviya and M.S. Golwalkar as nation-breaking lessons. But like most of her tribe who have made it fashionable to attack the religion and culture of their ancestors, she betrays her scant knowledge of Indian history and current world affairs. She also wilfully ignores the fact that it is precisely the ideas of the Malaviyas and Golwalkars, and not those of the Shabana Azmis, Husains and Habib Tanveers, which have created the edifice of a nation where she can disparage the culture and religion of the majority community without fearing for her life. Could she have dared to attempt the same in an Islamic or communist country? 				 																																																				To put the record straight, neither Malaviya nor Golwalkar had ever asked for the segregation of Hindus and Muslims. On the contrary, they had urged the minorities of the country to boldly accept the truth that Hindutva and Bharatiyata are in their blood because most of them owe their ancestry to Hindus and not to Arabs. 				 																																																				The ideas and views of Malviya and Golwalkar are no less pertinent today than they were in their lifetime because the importance of racial, cultural and religious homogeneity in the building of a strong nation cannot be over-emphasized. There is no better example of this than the reunion of Germany. Hariharan could also look at Germany, Japan, China, South Korea and the Scandinavian countries which continue to be islands of peace, development and harmony in todays strife-torn world. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Moitra, Kharagpur

				 																Luck of the draw				 																																																				Sir  I recently happened to come across a ticket for West Bengal State Lottery, the draw for which is slated to be held on April 14, 2004. The prize money, which is prominently displayed, is Rs 25 lakh. But the fine print on the reverse of the ticket says that 35 per cent shall be deducted towards administrative charges. That would leave only about Rs16.25 lakh to the first-prize winner. 				 																																																				Deductions will also be made from the second- and third-prize winners at 20 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. The deduction of income tax is a different thing since it made under an act of parliament. I have a feeling that this is a case of hoodwinking the public, since few care to read the reverse of a ticket. If my hunch is correct, then the organizers should be brought to book under consumer laws.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.C. Banerjee, via email

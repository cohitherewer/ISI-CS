The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 																																																																														 If Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Sonia Gandhi can be said to be the two pre-eminent personalities in Indian politics today, nothing underlines the differences in their styles of functioning better than how they vacation. Vajpayee had turned vacationing into a fine art in political brinkmanship  think of his letters from Kumarakom or his recent muddying of the political waters from Manali. In contrast, when Sonia Gandhi vacations, she vacations. Thus it is that very few people know that she took a well-deserved break in Kasauli recently, away from clamourous partymen, fractious allies and the pressures of governance. But, of course, all of these were waiting for her when she came back to New Delhi. Hours were spent preparing the long-awaited list of AICC office-bearers. But impatient Congressmen will have to wait for a little longer to know their fate. Apparently, the list is being fine-tuned by Rahul Gandhi who is ensuring it has the modern touch and meets the aspirations of the youth. The times they are a changing. 				 																																																																														 It is far easier to win elections and influence governments than it is to live with the trappings of power  the left is only now discovering. Its Somnath Chatterjee at first was reluctant to move into the lavish speakers bungalow that was his entitlement. And when he did, he told the CPWD men that they need not add anything by way of luxuries or expensive furnishings, that he had no need for ACs or carpets. The only thing he needed was book shelves for his library. This time it was the CPWDs turn to be flummoxed  no one it seems had made such a demand of them before. Indeed, the high-thinking-plain-living left leaders must come as a real shock to the department, inured as it is to the opulent tastes of most Indian politicians.				 																																																																														 In every other measure, however, the left leaders are no better. For example, they have as much a taste for exercising power as their counterparts from other parties. In this regard, recent times have been especially kind in giving them ample opportunity to indulge this taste. Harkishen Singh Surjeet, for example, has scores of favour-seekers beating a track to his door. Rarely does he disappoint them. One recent petition was from the employees of the government-run department store, Super Bazaar, who were laid off by the previous government. They were given a generous package in compensation, but they want the wrongful closure to be over-turned. And who best to do the needful than Surjeet? He has even shot off a letter to Sharad Pawar, the food and agriculture minister. Now it remains to be seen whether Pawar jumps to attention.				 																																																																														 Defeat has a bitter taste  ask the BJP leaders who attended the Mumbai meet. There was a lot of brave talk, but little conviction. The mood was summed up best in an Urdu couplet, which, roughly translated, means the BJP came riding on the Ram rath but went back on Rahims rickshaw. What a way to go!				 																																																																														 Looked at in another way, the BJP is more to be pitied than reviled. For the RSS, its parent outfit, had threatened that unless the party returned to its basic Hindutva ideology, it would float another political party. In fact, it is under pressure from the RSS that Atal Bihari Vajpayee is being sidelined, LK Advani is being brought to the forefront and an entire line of second-rung leaders being brought into the new order. The partys offices on 4 Ashoka Road are in a flux  Advani is taking over the room hitherto occupied by Pramod Mahajan who is shifting to Sanjay Joshis room who is moving into that occupied by Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who will be moving into the media cell, and so on. There will be more changes after the Maharashtra elections, when the BJPs fate will be more clearly known, but Kalyan Singh and K Govindacharya are sure to get back their place in the sun. The RSS might approve, but what of the electorate?				 																																																																														 Now that Satish Sharma has made it into parliament, will he take over the petroleum ministry? If there is Manmohan Singhs known antipathy to tainted minister scuppering his chances, there is also Sharmas known proximity to 10 Janpath to give him hope. So should Mani Shankar Aiyar feel threatened? One argument is that since Aiyar holds charge of panchayati affairs too, perhaps he may not miss petroleum. But the problem is that the department of panchayat affairs now comes under the rural development ministry, headed by Raghuvansh Prasad Yadav. And the Bihar politician will not allow his powers to be thus curtailed. Whatever be the fate of Aiyar or Sharma, Manmohan Singh does not have the easiest job in the world.				 																																																																														 Nothing puts off Nafisa Ali. The former swimming champion-model and now do-gooder at large has all but forgotten her loss to Mamata Banerjee in the Calcutta South constituency. Thus she was her usual bright and sunny self when she ran into Laloo Prasad Yadav at a function to felicitate the cricketer, Rahul Dravid. Lalooji, will you be in Patna on July 5? A little taken aback, Laloo muttered, How can I be in Patna on that day? Railway budget pesh karna hain parliament mein hum ko. Ali, however, was not fazed at the snub. She had vowed that she would go to Ayodhya if the BJP was ousted from power, she went on to explain. But why was Ali going to be in Patna on July 5 if she was going to Ayodhya from Delhi, those listening in on the conversation couldnt help asking. Patna Ayodhya key rassta mein thode hin hain. Ayodhya UP mein hain, Bihar mein nahin. Even this did not diminish Alis bright smile. But realizing the discussion was getting nowhere, she mumbled an achcha, and left to another group of Page 3 people she could turn her charms on.

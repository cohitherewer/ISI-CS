The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 31, 2004 							 																						NOT CREDIBLE																														The common minimum programme is a political document rather than an economic one. Generating consensus on the CMP is perceived as critical to the United Progressive Alliances survival. Now that consensus has been generated, the Congress may feel like celebrating. However, two caveats are in order. First, with the left extending outside support to the CMP, and refusing to sign on the dotted line, the CMP loses its contractual validity and the left can continue to disrupt matters when it sees fit. Second, the wording of the CMP is deliberately vague and when it comes to fleshing it out through actual policies, tensions will resurface. On the high-profile issues of privatization and labour market reforms, with the latter interpreted as a revamping of the Industrial Disputes Act, there was no fundamental disagreement between the Congress and the left and both will be postponed. Profit-making public sector units will not be sold and even loss-making ones will be allowed to restructure. Given known constraints, how such restructuring will be possible is anyones guess and the definition of what is strategic is so subjective that even disinvestments, as opposed to privatization, may have gone for a six. The more serious issue is the CMP numbers. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, there is a target of eliminating the revenue deficit by 2007-08 (the CMP actually says 2009).																														The UPA is committed to increasing public expenditure on agriculture (primarily irrigation), education, health, physical infrastructure, regional development, employment guarantees and food and nutrition security. What is more, the idea of targeted subsidies is anathema to the left. While all such expenditure will not be from Central government budgetary sources and ideas of decentralization can improve the efficiency of public expenditure, fiscal pressures are certain. The left will want hikes in direct tax rates, even if it is called a cess. And even if this masquerades as a cess, the idea should be non-acceptable to the finance minister. The left will also want more service sectors to be brought into the tax net. This should be fine, as long as service sector taxation is integrated into value-added tax and is no longer turnover taxation. However, the key to boosting tax revenue lies in removing exemptions, as recommended by the two Kelkar task forces. But exemption removal, for both direct and indirect taxes, is unlikely to find favour with the UPA. That indeed is the reason why CMP numbers do not add up. Without enhanced expenditure, the revenue deficit today is more than 5 per cent of the gross domestic product. So far, the UPA does not have a credible plan of reducing this to 0 per cent by 2007-08.

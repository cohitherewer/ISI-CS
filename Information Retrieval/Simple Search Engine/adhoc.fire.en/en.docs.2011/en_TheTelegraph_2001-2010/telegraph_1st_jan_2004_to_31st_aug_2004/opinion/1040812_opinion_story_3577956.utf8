		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 							 																						MATCHING PRECISION WITH SENSIBILITY It is time scientists participated more actively in public debates over the benefits their discoveries will deliver, writes Ashok Ganguly				 	 Critical approach																														Indias dependence on the monsoon rainfall for its economic health and social wellbeing is absolute. Annual meteorological data and the incidence of droughts and floods in India have been recorded since the late 19th century. More than a century later, the meteorologists ability to forecast the annual monsoon remains fragile. Forecasts become a non-issue during years when the rainfall is either excessive or even adequate, but evenly distributed. But in years of drought and scanty precipitation, the science of meteorology becomes a subject of wide public concern and despair.																														Scientists, by nature, tend to be optimists. But good science is marked by reproducibility of experiments and observations in pursuit of a hypothesis, as well as subject to peer confirmation. Amongst all branches of science, climatology, especially long-term weather forecasting, has a higher degree of uncertainty, especially because it represents the palpable outcome of global warming due to manmade assaults on the environment. In the case of India, monsoon forecasting is the Holy Grail within which lie the nations fortunes and miseries. About twenty odd years ago, government scientists came up with a supercomputer-derived monsoon forecasting model, based on solving a complex set of equations made up of several variables. Over the years, the number of variables has grown and the Indian public eagerly awaits the forecasters predictions every year, beginning in the month of April.																														During years of good to plentiful rainfall, our meteorologists are supposed to have done a wonderful job with their monsoon model, no matter how wide the gap between the forecast and actual rainfall. In years of drought, the science of meteorology and forecasting comes in for severe questioning. So, is the multi-variable Indian monsoon forecasting model water-tight or completely unreliable? Given the high level of uncertainties in the science of long-term forecasting itself, the answer must lie somewhere in between, defined by the vagaries of statistical probabilities. While short-term weather forecasting has become more precise, long-term forecasting remains a global challenge.																														Scientists do not like being questioned or criticized by the lay public. This attitude amongst scientists arises from their belief that the pursuit of scientific research is a form of higher calling, which can neither be easily comprehended by nor readily explained to a non-scientist. One may, therefore, assume that Indian meteorologists, with their multi-variable supercomputer monsoon model, must be an unhappy lot because of public criticism during the years of poor rainfall and drought.																														India is not unique in its uncertain and uneasy relationship between scientists and the general public. Especially, in the past couple of decades, announcements of scientific discoveries and promises are being increasingly questioned in the public domain the world over. This is primarily because of better education, ready access to vast amounts of information through advances in technology and the growing investment in science education and research for a nations economic and social development. However, the demand on scientists to be more accountable to society has not been always matched by the scientific communitys ability to better communicate with the public. The disappointments with frequent promises of a cure for cancer and, in recent years, that for AIDS, have not been very helpful in raising public confidence. The path-breaking advances in agricultural biotechnology for producing commercially attractive high-yielding drought-and-disease-resistant crops, continue to face uncompromising public opposition, especially in Europe. A major international company has gone virtually out of business due to its inability to commercially exploit its investments in agricultural biotechnology. The question remains as to why the public is wary of agro biotechnology? Large sections of the public feel that not enough is known or has been disclosed about the long-term environmental consequences of this new technology, and agribiotechnologists have not been able to, as yet, provide sufficient evidence in the public domain to satisfy people regarding plant biotechnologys safety aspects and environmental impact. In contrast, starting about the same time, medical biotechnology has made unprecedented scientific and commercial progress, and the fruits of its results have had a major impact on human health and wellbeing. Its environmental impact has remained much less challenged, to say the least.																														One of the major promoters of organic farming in the UK is Charles, Prince of Wales, and he is one of the prominent opponents of agricultural biotechnology as being environmentally unfriendly. Agribiotechnologists are unhappy since they feel that Charles is dabbling in issues about which he is not adequately equipped. But Charles has taken up an issue which strikes a public chord in the UK. More recently, Charles has expressed his opposition to the science of nano-technology, things that are a billionth of a metre in size  very much the stuff of the future  to the dismay of the scientific community. He has also earned the ire of the medical profession by publicly promoting alternative medicine and, alongside, a cure for cancer by a regimen of vegetable juices and coffee enemas.																														Given the confusion, questions and anxieties in the mind of the public, there is an urgent need for scientists to address the genuine concerns of the lay public, as opposed to those who have a general aversion to technological advances. Whereas organic farming will remain the preoccupation of rich consumers in the developed world, the lack of commercial progress of agricultural biotechnology is holding back much-needed improvements in agricultural productivity for the less developed countries and the people who would benefit the most.																														It is time that scientists began to join more actively in public debates regarding the sensible benefits that their discoveries can deliver, rather than expect people to remain in hope of their promises. 																														In due course, biotechnology will find its rightful place in society to advance both agriculture as well as human health, while vagaries of the monsoon may one day be better managed by reducing over-dependence on the inherent uncertainties of supercomputer-generated meteorological models. 																														Which finally reminds me of a quote by physicist Neils Bohr, reported in a recent edition of New Scientist, in which he had famously remarked that those who are not shocked by the quantum theory have not understood it. His view of the quantum world was that it is unknowable and hence experimental results are manifestations beyond the limits of scientific enquiry. Even this long-held wisdom is now being challenged, as scientists cannot accept that any phenomenon can remain beyond scientific enquiry. Perhaps monsoon forecasting will also become reliable in India some day.

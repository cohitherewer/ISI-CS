The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 							 																						LET LENIN HANG IN THERE Gouri Chatterjee																					This is how a May 24 Newsweek story on India, Betting on Reforms, begins: An incongruous name adorns one new housing estate in teeming Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). Animikha, translated from Bengali, means so beautiful beholders cannot blinkStill, the place holds tremendous promise. Well-heeled managers employed in one of the citys new IT parks will soon move in with their families...Theres no development back home, says Bihari farmer Rupnarayan Mahato, 35, who supports his wife and two children on the $45 a month he earns breaking rocks for new roadways to service the high-tech city rising around the new apartments. But something is happening here. 																					Something sure is. Suddenly, Calcutta is all over the most stiff-necked of Western media. In the last one month, there have been articles on the city in magazines as prestigious as the Far Eastern Economic Review and as right-wing as the Economist to news- papers as respected as the New York Times and as conservative as The Wall Street Journal. 																					The last time Calcutta figured so liberally in their datelines was when Mother Teresa died seven years ago. But unlike then, the references to Mother T and poverty today are only to show how far the place has travelled to become the surprise new tech hub poised to rival Bangalore and Hyderabad. 																					Of course, thats not why theyve put Calcutta in the limelight. Their story is obvious: A bastion of Indian communism rebrands itself, crows the Economist. Indias Communists Seek Capitalist Help, the New York Times gloats. The state government is still communist, but no longer hostile to business, points out the Review. 																					Each and every report, whatever the publication, mentions the portrait of Lenin hanging in chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees room as he recants past mistakes and welcomes foreign investment. Calcutta in decline has been replaced with communism in Calcutta in decline, also a sure seller.																					But whos complaining? Certainly not our Davidoff-smoking chief minister. Rather, hes delighted at being able to put across the correct picture at last. There are no losers in this story.																					Lotus, lost and won																					Journalism being regarded by many as the second oldest profession, its practitioners are naturally the cynosure of every government. But society, being wary of the power without responsibility that journalists enjoy, has often put various checks and balances on them. In India, these are sanctified by judicial pronouncements from time to time. 																					One such came in the mid-Eighties, in the Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Private Limited v. Union of India amp; Others. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court upheld the newspapers claim that government could not impose import duty on newsprint as it amounted to transgression of the freedom of expression guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(a). But the judgment also warned the press of the price it must pay to enjoy the freedom. It reminded the community of the pitfalls of state patronage and blandishments like secret payments of money, open monetary grants and subventions, postal concessions, government advertisements, conferment of titles on editors and proprietors of newspapers, inclusion of Press barons in cabinet and inner political councils 																					However, the NDA government evidently thought this was too outdated and rewarded a loyal band of mediamen with Padma awards and Rajya Sabha posts so liberally that it shocked even as brazen a tribe of freeloaders as Delhis journalists.																					Another sort of drumroll is now being heard in the capital. Sonia Gandhis inner voice spoke to some editors first, we hear, while some others have so forgotten impartiality they they are openly saying, those of us who support the Congress 																					Will the new administration under Manmohan Singh treat his predecessors generosity as a precedent and make the lotus (padma) awards bloom on the opposite side of medias ideological picket-fence? Or, will he tell them to be content with freedom, and nothing else? Watch this space.

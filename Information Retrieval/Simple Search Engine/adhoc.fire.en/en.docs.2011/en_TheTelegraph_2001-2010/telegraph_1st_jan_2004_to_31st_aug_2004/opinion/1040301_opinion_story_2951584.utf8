		 Monday, March 01, 2004 							 																						AN IDENTITY OF THEIR OWN 															- Document  Excerpts from Sexuality, abortion and the media: a review of adolescent concerns by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi Ravi Duggal, CEHAT, and Vimala Ramachandran, Health Watch, were joint coordinators of this national project The author of this paper is Anita Anand				 	 Myths revealed																														Is adolescent sexuality on the rise? If so, are adolescents practicing safe sex? What percentage of girls and young women are experiencing unwanted pregnancies? Where are they going for termination of pregnancies? How much does the media influence their sexual attitudes? And, how does media reflect adolescent attitudes? And, how does media reflect adolescent attitudes?																														There are myths, truths, half-truths and misconceptions about adolescents. If there is concern about adolescents today, there is a good reason...The World Health Organisation estimates that about 33 per cent of the Indian population, or about 300 million, is in the age group of 10-24 years, and adolescents (10-19 years) form about 70 per cent of the 10-24 age group...																														The increasing number of young people by itself is not the concern. It is the high number of adolescent girls and young women experiencing pregnancies, births and abortions which needs attention.																														Furthermore, WHO estimates that more than 15 million young women between the ages of 15-19 give birth every year. About 10 per cent of all abortions, or about 5 million a year, are among women of this age group. In addition, girls and young women are especially vulnerable to rape, sexual abuse and exploitation. (Anand, 1997).																														Women in India tend to marry at an early age. 34 per cent of 15-19 year old women are already married including 4 per cent who are married but gauna (post-marriage nuptial rites) has yet to be performed...Although this indicates that the proportion of women who marry young is declining rapidly, half the women even in the age group 20-24 have married before reaching the legal minimum age of 18 years. 																														Since India opened its economy in the late Eighties and early Nineties, the electronic media began to provide more options to viewers via cable hooked to satellites. Western and Indian TV programming became more accessible to millions. At the same time, the quality of the programming changed as well. It became more sexually explicit, challenged Indian traditions and mores, and generated more curiosity about sexuality among young people.																														Opening of the economy or liberalization also meant a middle class boom. Families travelled outside India, and were exposed to different lifestyles and ideas. Young people were experimenting, as they do, and some were revolting  against authority, parents, schools and colleges  and seeking an identity of their own.																														Besides the social changes, adolescent and adult sexuality was finally forced out of the closet because of HIV/AIDS. While sex is only one way the virus can be contracted, the discussion waiting to happen is about the kind and levels of sexual activity in Indian society  consensual or forced, legal or illegal, premarital, marital and extramarital, heterosexual, homosexual, and the like. This has been resisted in a society that sees itself as moralistic and monogamous and is in denial mode most of the time.																														There is a widespread reluctance among adults, whether parents, teachers or policy-makers, to openly discuss issues of sexuality with young people. This lack of openness and leadership is undermining young peoples reproductive and sexual health, and in too many cases, threatening their very lives.  TO BE CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, July 18, 2004 							 																						RIGHT SPIRIT																														It is troublesome to find manoeuvring space between letter and spirit. But that is what the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government plans to do, as it seeks ways to fulfil its promise in the common minimum programme by repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act. This is a necessary political move, for the Congress, when in opposition, had objected when the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government had passed it. In its CMP, the UPA had said the POTA was being misused. But given the circumstances, the repeal is in no way simple. History is not encouraging: the tale of the repeal of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act and the coming of the POTA is a pointer to the difficulties of repealing an anti-terror law.																														The security establishment feels it needs the extra-stringent provisions of an anti-terror legislation to deal with acts of terrorism. For example, there are certain forms of evidence not normally admissible in court, such as wiretaps and satellite interceptions, which can be used against suspected terrorists. Even the UPA government must be feeling the necessity of specific legal provisions in the case of terrorist acts, for it has decided to upgrade the old Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 in order to make it into a modified POTA. Making a fresh law might have led it into the TADA-POTA trap. Also, there is another side of the political image that must be taken care of. The Congress would not like to look less effective than the BJP in fighting terrorism. So it is a matter of delicate negotiation  to delete the letter of POTA but to keep alive part of its spirit in the vestment of an earlier, less criticized, law.																														One of the suggested changes has to do with the removal of the provision that makes confession before a senior police officer mandatory. Human rights activists have repeatedly condemned this provision, since confessional methods of the police are themselves a focus of concern. More important, the principle upon which the POTA is based will be reversed. The act turns a fundamental assumption of Indian law on its head by treating all accused as guilty until they can prove themselves innocent. This has made misusing the law rather easy. The upgraded UAPA will assume the accused innocent until proven guilty. These are necessary safeguards against misuse, and more could be added. But if an anti-terror law is not to be misused, certain fundamental confusions must be cleared up. The crime itself is ruthless and there must be no let-up in the states efforts to check it. The terrorists network is widespread and often invisible, and it is here that the state agencies need to be careful not to infringe on rights. Suspicion is not tantamount to conviction: there has to be greater accountability regarding detention and encounter deaths, for example. The first task is to be sure about the definitions of terrorist and terrorism. It is equally urgent to see that the law is applied impartially, that it is not perceived as being directed only towards political enemies or particular communities. The UPA must be certain of what kind of spirit it wants to give the upgraded legislation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 							 																						HOPE REDEEMED																														A bandh in West Bengal is as boring and as uninspiring as a twice-told tale. It is also something more than that since the time the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, pressed on the accelerator to reach his goal of a new and rejuvenated West Bengal. A bandh sends out the worst possible signals about the state. It tells potential investors that work has no priority in West Bengal, and that politics holds up business for no rhyme or reason. West Bengal, irrespective of whether Ms Mamata Banerjee realizes this or not, can ill afford to project such an image. The bandh on Tuesday would have conveyed exactly that message but for what happened in the states information technology sector on the day of the bandh. Most of the offices in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex recorded between 70 and 75 per cent attendance. The companies made elaborate arrangements so that their staff could come to work. It is this development, insignificant by itself, which makes one look beyond the despairing conditions in West Bengal. The word insignificant is used advisedly, because what is so remarkable about people coming to work? This, after all, is as things should be. But in West Bengal, bereft as it is of a work culture, it is an extremely important move. It shows that beneath the appearance and outside the quicksand of sloth, there are people thinking differently and rejecting the status quo.																														It is not a coincidence that most of the professionals who work in the IT sector are young men and women. The commitment to work that they have displayed is a rejection of the bandh culture which has held this state in thrall. It is also a protest against the style of politics that has always placed protest above work and has always taken the people for granted. A very significant segment of West Bengals youth expressed themselves on Tuesday. That expression had no shouting, but it contained a demand. It was a demand to be allowed to do ones work without being subjected to mindless slogan-mongering by myopic politicians who have run out of ideas. Tuesday, entrenched though it was in the politics of yesterday, also provided a glimpse of a better tomorrow.																														It will not be erroneous to see in the commitment of the IT professionals of West Bengal a move towards making their state more investor-friendly. The chief minister can also take pride in the fact that he is the driving force behind the perceptible change that is taking place in Calcutta and its environs. But Mr Bhattacharjee would do well to take a warning from Tuesdays development in the IT sector. The tardy nature of political changes may well be overtaken by the pace of social change, especially among the young who are not steeped in nostalgia. The political parties, including Mr Bhattacharjees own party, still remain caught in a time warp. There is another bandh looming at the end of February, called by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, a front organization of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). A new West Bengal is marching to a tune different from the music of the bandhs. This is the only reason for living with hope in West Bengal.

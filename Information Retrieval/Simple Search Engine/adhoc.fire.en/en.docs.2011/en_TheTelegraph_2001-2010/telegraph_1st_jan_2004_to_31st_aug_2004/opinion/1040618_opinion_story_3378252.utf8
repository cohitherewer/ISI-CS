Yet within a year, Hitler ordered the march to Moscow which resulted in the catastrophe of 1941. More than a century before the Wehrmachts collapse during the Moscow campaign, Napoleons Grande Armee met its doom near the cursed city. Adam Zamoyski narrates the story of Napoleons fatal march.																					In 1812, Napoleon emerged supreme in Europe. Austria was humbled by the Napoleonic legions and Prussia was made subservient to France. However, the Franco-Prussian pact was coming under strain. It was proving to be economically ruinous for Russia to remain within the Continental System. Hence, Tsar Alexander was forced to renounce it. Besides, Zamoyski writes, Russia had ambitions of absorbing Poland. But Napoleon had resurrected the ghost of a united Poland by creating the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. As the Russians started to gather troops in 1812, Napoleon decided to pre-empt Alexander by launching a military campaign across Poland.																					Napoleon collected about 600,000 soldiers from about 20 nations. For the first time in history, so many soldiers were put together for a single campaign. Zamoyski writes that Napoleon had calculated that he would be able to defeat Russia within three months. Hitlers plan of 1940 was also based on the same calculations.																					As Napoleon crossed river Niemen on June 24, the Russian armies started falling back. Zamoyski shows that the Russians had no coherent plan about opposing Napoleon. The net contribution of the Russian army during the summer of 1812 was to retreat faster than the pace of French advance. Napoleons plan, like that of Hitler later, was to envelop the Russian army within 300 miles of the Russian-Polish border and to annihilate it. But due to bad roads, the Grande Armee could not advance fast and the Russians slipped away.																					After reaching Smolensk in mid-August, Napoleon decided to march to Moscow. He believed that the Russians would use their army to save their capital, and this would give him the opportunity to destroy the Russian army once and forever. Though the retreat had saved the Russians from destruction, political pressure forced Alexander to appoint Kutuzov in command of the army. 																					At Borodino, the Grande Armee clashed with the Russians. Towards the end of the day, as the Russians were cracking, Napoleon refused to destroy Kutuzovs retreating army. Kutuzov escaped towards Tula, and Napoleon entered Moscow. He was confident that after the capture of the Russian capital, Alexander would make peace with him. But, Zamoyski writes, the Russian state followed a philosophy very different from that of the European monarchies which had been defeated by Napoleon. The Russians decided to fight on.																					A frustrated Napoleon was forced to retreat from Moscow in mid-October. The whole countryside was desolate. There was neither water nor a blade of grass. Lack of fodder killed most of the artillery horses. As the temperature dropped to minus 35 degree Centigrade, men started to die in droves. Zamoyski quotes from accounts of the survivors to prove that despair drove some to cannibalism. On December 14, Napoleon crossed Niemen with only 40,000 men. Sensing French weakness, Austria and Prussia declared war against Napoleon next year. 																					Zamoyskis narrative, based on the memoirs of Russian, French, Polish and German participants of the great drama that unfolded in 1812, is thought-provoking. Perhaps one should recall Bernard Montgomerys warning in his memoirs, Never march to Moscow.						KAUSHIK ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 							 																						HAD SHE NOT BEEN SUCH A GANDHI Gouri Chatterjee																					Till Tuesday morning, life was beautiful for Raimondo Bultrini. Not only was he going to witness a fellow NRI (non-resident Italian) become the prime minister of the worlds largest democracy, but he was also the only journalist to get an exclusive interview with the Congress president since the amazing election results. 																					The latter was more of a coup, even for an Italian journalist. Rather, especially for an Italian journalist. Sonia Gandhi, never at ease with any of the press, has been particularly wary of appearing partial towards her countrymen. 																					Bultrini, who lives in Thailand to cover south and east Asia for his paper, La Repubblica, has come to India countless times in the last four-five years. This was the first private audience he or any Italian he knows had ever managed with the girl from Orbassano. And that too, only thanks to Ambika Soni, who evidently had a greater sense of occasion. It was Soni who took him and his friend, Nello Delgatto, a freelance cameraman whose wife is with the Italian embassy in Delhi, to Sonia G. after her harried, hurried news conference last Thursday night. 																					Even then, Sonia was more Gandhi than Maino. Bultrinis attempts to speak in Italian were promptly quashed: We will speak in English, my Italian is no longer perfect. The question, What do you feel in this moment as an Italian also got a firm rebuttal: Not as an Italian but as an Indian 																					It was the briefest of interviews, but Bultrini couldnt be happier. It got him a full-page spread in his own paper, the BBC took it as well as an Italian channel, La 7. Even Indian papers quoted from it. It was what makes a journalists vicarious life memorable. 																					Now, though, regret tinges his voice. Another interview with just the Congress president may not get the same play. And theres no one else in a Mother Teresa-less India to sell to editors in Italy. If only Sonia had not been such a Gandhi.																					Listen to the little men																					This too shall pass. It always does. The publics ridicule, the politicians ire, their own embarrassment  the media have got too many elections wrong to be too downcast by the failure this time. Especially since they have the satisfaction of knowing that even the parties, winners and losers, were just as stunned. 																					The trouble with elections, whether for political parties or the media, is that they demand you listen not only to the little men out there, but also to the little men closer home. In politics, that would mean workers who live far away from Delhi and are never seen on TV. In journalism, that would mean paying heed to lesser beings like state and district correspondents who live far away from the head office and never attend policy meetings.																					There are reports that state leaders (Janga Reddy of Andhra Pradesh for instance) tried to warn the BJP top brass about the lie of their land  to no avail. There are reports too of state correspondents trying to tell their editors the way things were  to no avail. The editors with their superior education and fine accents were more excited by flashing figures on TV screens.																					And so things will remain until the top-down system changes  in parties and in newsrooms. Theres no bet on who will change faster. The accountability of politicians is much higher than that of journalists.																					Daily Tehelka																					Its coming to a TV screen near you tomorrow, another 24-hour news channel in Hindi. Brought to you by televisions old faithful, Rajat Sharma, it also has Tarun Tejpal of Tehelka fame as co-anchor. If the timing could have been better, the BJP is paying for it. This was when Rajat had always planned to launch his India TV, well before the scheduled date of election 2004. If hes lost some of news televisions most dramatic moments, Rajat is on cue to take on the new government. Nothing short of a daily Tehelka will make another channel stand out.

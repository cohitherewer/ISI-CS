The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 							 																						LATE START																														A former king of England once turned around the proverb and exclaimed, Better never than late. A former prime minister of India may well accept the wisdom of that injunction. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, barely a month out of power, has announced that the leadership of Mr Narendra Modi is now under review. It would appear that Mr Vajpayee has come to raj dharma when it is no longer necessary for him to pursue that noble goal. At a time when the blood of Muslims had still not dried on the hands of Mr Modi, Mr Vajpayee as the prime minister of India visited Gujarat in the aftermath of the pogrom, and asked Mr Modi to pursue raj dharma. That was all that he had to say to the chief minister when any prime minister with a modicum of respect for the duty to his country would have sacked Mr Modi. Not only did Mr Vajpayee not do this, but he also did not issue any public condemnation of Mr Modi. In fact, everything that Mr Vajpayee did or said appeared to be pointing to the opposite of condemnation. Mr Vajpayee, on the question of Mr Modi and the Gujarat pogrom, seemed to have surrendered to Mr Modis many advocates within the Bharatiya Janata Party. The decision to review Mr Modis performance seems to be a prime case of wisdom after the event. Such belated wisdom carries with it a dash of irrelevance.																														Mr Vajpayee, when he was prime minister, tried at the best of times to push the BJP to occupy the middle ground of Indian politics. Mr Modi, on the other hand, was to the extreme right and an advocate of violence against Muslims. It surprised most people that Mr Vajpayee gave Mr Modi his tacit support. This brought forth immediate, if short-term, dividends when Mr Modi led the BJP to a resounding victory in the assembly elections. But this was only a temporary triumph. In the general elections in April-May this year, the BJP in Gujarat, under Mr Modis leadership, lost something close to half of the Lok Sabha seats. This setback, together with the loss of majority in the Lok Sabha, has forced Mr Vajpayee to rethink his position on Mr Modi. The mere removal of Mr Modi, if that happens at all, will not signal the new beginning that Mr Vajpayee is talking about. A new beginning will demand a review of the BJPs core ideology. The appropriation of the middle ground, which is the only hope for the BJPs renewed success, has no space for any kind of fundamentalism. Is Mr Vajpayee willing to take the sacred Hindu bull by its horns? The answer to that question will determine the future of the BJP.

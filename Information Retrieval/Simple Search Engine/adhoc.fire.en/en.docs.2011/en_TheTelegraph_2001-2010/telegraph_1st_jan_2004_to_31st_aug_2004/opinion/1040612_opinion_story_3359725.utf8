		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 							 																						MERIT ABOVE ALL																														In a civilized society, seniority should have claims to nothing save respect and politeness. In India, alas, seniority can result in a person getting a plum posting. In bureaucracy and even in academic institutions, years of service get precedence over abilities. Thus, Indian universities have something bizarre called merit promotion, as if there can be any other criterion for promoting a person. Actually, the term is an euphemism for rewarding someone for the number of years he has worked. In bureaucracy, it is practically taken for granted that the seniormost in service should get the number one job. The present government should be congratulated for having broken such a ridiculous assumption and appointed Mr Shyam Saran the head of the foreign service. The appointing authorities felt that in their opinion, Mr Saran was the best person for the job. This evaluation was based on Mr Sarans track record, and the fact that he would be superceding a number of officers senior to him was considered irrelevant for the appointment. This is how it should be.																														A modern society driven by the laws of the market can only be run on the principle of merit. This is one of the key features that distinguish a modern society from a feudal one. In feudal society, birth provided the access to office and privilege. It was not the best man for the job, but the best-born man for the job. The French Revolution and the American Revolution challenged and broke this. In France, the shift was personified in the personality of Napoleon Bonaparte, who rose to be a general from the rank of a soldier, a career-path unheard of in pre-Revolutionary France. Similarly, one of Bonapartes marshals, a later king of Sweden, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, was the son of an ordinary attorney from Gascony. In the United States of America, the first president was the son of a Virginia landowner. The importance of merit in US society was, of course, exemplified by the famous move of Abraham Lincoln from the log cabin to the White House.																														Even though independent India styled itself a democratic and an egalitarian society, the principle of merit has been very slow to become a part of public life. The close association between democracy and meritocracy has seldom been upheld in India. One reason for this, from a sociological point of view, is the hierarchical nature of Indian society. From time immemorial, Indian society has been governed by the caste system and its notions of higher and lower. A Brahmin, for reasons of birth and caste, is deemed to be superior to other caste members even if he is a wastrel. On this has been overlaid the idea of seniority. Seniority is the cusp in which a caste society meets a society struggling to become professionalized. Indian society sloughed the privilege of birth to adopt the skin of seniority. Both principles are spurious and utterly out of tune in a modern world. Years of service does not make a person efficient but his ability does. Experience is important, but cannot be the be-all and end-all for getting a job. Indeed, there is no worse combination than a marriage of experience with inefficiency.

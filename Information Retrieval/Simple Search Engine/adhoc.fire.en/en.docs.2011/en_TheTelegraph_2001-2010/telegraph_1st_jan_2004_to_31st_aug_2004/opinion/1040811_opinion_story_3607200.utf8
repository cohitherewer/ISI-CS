The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 							 																						TREND RATE																														The Central board of trustees of the Employees Provident Fund Organization has declared an interim interest rate of 8.5 per cent for 2004-05, after failing to arrive at decisions on June 30 and July 13. The expression, interim interest rate, is important because interest rates to subscribers cannot be delinked from returns on investments. Interest rates should therefore be announced at the end of the year rather than at the beginning, and an additional interest rate is indeed possible when 2004-05 closes. As things stand, even 8.5 per cent is high and the EPFO will have a deficit of Rs 206 crore, to be met through damages and penalties on non-payment of EPF by companies. There is also the matter of reclassifying the special reserve fund. If this is treated as a financial asset, higher payouts are possible. Barring the Indian National Trade Union Congress, other trade unions, even the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, are up in arms, and there will be national dissent days on August 20 and September 20. 																														Part of the reason for the unions resistance is the perceived 1 per cent slash from 2003-04. However, even in 2003-04, the basic interest rate was 9 per cent, and a 0.5 per cent golden-jubilee bonus was added on, courtesy of Mr Sahib Singh Verma. And in both 2002-03 and 2003-04, 9.5 per cent represented the National Democratic Alliance governments inability to work out an economic rationale. After all, interest rates cannot be delinked from returns. The unions can demand 12 per cent and more. But acceding to such demands amounts to cross-subsidizing 30 million subscribers of the EPF at the expense of the genuinely poor. Nor should one forget that the interest rate on other small savings is 8 per cent, while the average return on government bonds is lower than 8.5 per cent. 																														Inflation is indeed headed upwards, with a trend rate (not the point-to-point variety) of around 6.5 per cent. But even that represents a real rate of return of 2 per cent. And should interest rates actually harden, that will be reflected in the EPF returns at the end of the year. Therefore, the unions demands are illogical and should be resisted. Unfortunately, the United Progressive Alliance government has not always called the lefts bluff, the foreign direct investment instance being a case in point. With elections looming large in Maharashtra, there is a tendency to turn populist. Free power may be more contentious. But at least on the EPF issue, the government should be congratulated for not caving in. However, there remains the broader reform issue of completely revamping and scrapping the EPF system. As it stands, it is neither a gratuity nor a pension. And on both, investors need to be given a choice of investments, depending on their appetite for risk.

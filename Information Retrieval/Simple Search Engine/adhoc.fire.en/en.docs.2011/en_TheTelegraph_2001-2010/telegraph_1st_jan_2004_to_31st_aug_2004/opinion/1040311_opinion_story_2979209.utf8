The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 11, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																All in the game				 																																																				Sir Cricket, unlike its poorer cousin football, is yet to break free of its elitist trappings (Place to see and to be seen at: Pak pitch, March 9). The rush among page three regulars to get a ringside view of the forthcoming Indo-Pak one day series only goes to confirm this fact. The celebrities , one suspects, are going beyond the border for entirely non-sporting reasons. Vijay Mallya, a member of parliament who has more time for such events rather than his constituency, would probably be looking out for lucrative liquor deals. Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, the young faces of an ageing Congress, would do their bit of cheering too, conveniently skipping minor responsibilities like election campaigns. And for nondescript actors like Sharad Kapoor, getting noticed on television as a spectator is still better than having no roles in reel life. The tragedy of the modern game is that it makes more news off field than on it. More tickets should have been made available for the real fans of Indian cricket instead of its fair-weather supporters.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Alok Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																The second coming				 																																																				Sir  L.K. Advanis nation-wide rath yatra, the Babri Masjid demolition and the subsequent communal riots are deeply etched in public memory. The BJPs decision to hold the Bharat Uday yatra may lead to the same trajectory of events (Advanis second yatra, March 9).No party can give a communal dimension to its electoral campaign. Advanis programme thus goes against the spirit of the code of conduct prescribed for parties going to polls. Besides, the proposed yatra is fraught with enormous risks  there can be riots and even threats to Advanis life. Will it be still wise to go on with the yatra? Why is the BJP hellbent on manipulating the elections, which otherwise could have been peaceful? 				 																																																				The deputy prime minister is known for his doublespeak. The chief election commissioner should take immediate steps to force the BJP to reconsider its programme to prevent the further communalization of the democratic process. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  The medias fulminations against L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday yatra is aimed at whipping up a mass hysteria and panic (Wait and watch, March 8). Citing bitter passages of history, editorials in newspapers have tried to bring the yatra under a communal cloud. Why dont we give the Bharatiya Janata Party a chance to revamp its agenda? The party may be sincerely hoping to turn into a secular outfit. If that happens, we can manage to exorcize India of communalism and avoid a repeat of incidents like Godhra. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hemant Krishna V., Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  The Indian electorate is sick of political gimmicks. Advertisements and yatras at the expense of taxpayers money may be fashionable, but they may no longer be as effective as politicians think they are. The voter is aware that politicians arrive with their folded hands and promises only before the elections. Advertisements talking of the governments achievements and rath yatras also follow the same logic. What people want is a clean, efficient, and corruption-free government. They are not interested in statistics that cannot be verified. Meticulous planning and exhaustive use of modern technology, if used in times other than only during elections, will serve the country better. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ullas Pradhan, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  The credit for making the predominantly Hindu Indian middle class believe that Muslims are a threat and the Gujarat riots were a natural reaction, goes to L.K. Advani. Even before they knew it, Indians had become communal, thanks to the sangh parivar. If the Congress disintegrates, as suggested by the opinion polls, secularism and social justice for the disadvantaged will no longer remain a part of the political agenda of parties.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The last five years have been the worst for Indias rural economy. Increased debts, suicides and starvation deaths have become a routine affair. The rath yatra of L.K. Advani might provide an opportunity to farmers to register their grievances directly with the deputy prime minister. After all, Advani has conceded that the benefits of India Shining have not reached the rural areas of the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajan Alexander, Bangalore 

				 																																																				Sir  There are other ways than a bus yatra to reach out to the people. Under the present volatile political scenario and given Indias security concerns, L.K. Advani should reconsider his decision to go ahead with the yatra.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chitra Sekar, Angul, Orissa

				 																																																				Sir  The report, India Shining catches a Bharat bus in II stages (March 3), shows that L.K. Advani has no intention of disrupting communal peace and harmony during the forthcoming elections. Nor is his sojourn on the bus intended to highlight his political persona or promote his own political ambitions. The sole aim of this campaigner appears to be to brighten the poll prospects of his party so that it comes back to power with a thumping majority.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, 

				 																																																				Murshidabad				 																																																				Sir  L.K. Advani is a visionary far superior to the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It is unfortunate that his actions are being given a communal tag. His rath yatra in the early Nineties had cost him the prime ministers chair. A voracious reader, a principled man and a great intellectual, he is a rare gem in Indian politics. One should not be disappointed if this yatra propels him to the post of the prime minister, although he may have to perform the unenviable task of keeping everyone happy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aakyaa N., via email

				 																																																				Sir  Mani Shankar Aiyars Advanis second yatra is nothing but an anti-BJP campaign. Aiyar has been unabashedly critical of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy in most of his columns, which is unfair on the BJP since it has no chance of disputing his claims. Only if someone like Arun Jaitley was given the opportunity of answering Aiyar. It is also peculiar that despite readers objections to Aiyars vituperative comments, The Telegraph should continue to publish his columns and his tirade against the saffron brotherhood.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Prabhat Kumar Gupta, Calcutta

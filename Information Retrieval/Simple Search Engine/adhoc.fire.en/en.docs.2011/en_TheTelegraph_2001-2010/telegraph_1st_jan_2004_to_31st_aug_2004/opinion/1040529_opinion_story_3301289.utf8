		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 							 																						AN ANGRY MANWhat made a man pronounce talaaq on his wife for allowing their child to be given the 
polio vaccine?Even the most irrational fit of rage has its logic and context. A complicated set of factors came together when Mr Montaj Sheikh, a villager in Bengals Murshidabad district, pronounced talaaq  not thrice, but seven times  on his wife for allowing a health-worker to feed their child his polio drops. Benighted prejudice against the polio vaccine has long been a problem in some areas of rural West Bengal. Parents continue to believe that the vaccine would maim their children, or make them sterile. Panchayats, health-workers and imams have taken this up, with varying degrees of will and success, as an awareness-raising effort. But a consideration of Mr Sheikhs explanation of his own action, however wrong-headed, takes the problem beyond mere ignorance or bad temper.																														For villagers like Mr Sheikh, polio time is one of those rare occasions when they get to confront someone whom they can take to be a representative of the government. So the health-worker becomes a symbolic adversary embodying everything that the government has done to, and not done for, the villagers. An entire history of deprivation and disempowerment opens up behind the health-workers visit. Mr Sheikh told reporters that he had been allotted a piece of land by the government, but is yet to receive the patta. So he works as a farm labourer and also sells fish caught from the river nearby. A year ago, the oldest of his nine children had also given his wife the talaaq. The wife then filed a case against his son. So the police came to Mr Sheikhs house in his absence and arrested two of his daughters. He also explained that his name is yet to appear in the below-poverty-line list, denying him his bit of PDS rice. Many others in his village have not managed to get their BPL cards. Hence, boycotting the governments polio programme becomes a form of political protest, however garbled or self-destructive its logic may be. Some villagers in Purulia have kept their children away from the vaccine because the government has not sunk enough tube-wells in the village. Food or water, by this logic, is more important for their development than two drops of vaccine.																														The fact remains, however, that the worst brunt of this protest has to be borne by the women and the children. (A very similar incident had occurred last June in South 24-Parganas.) Mr Sheikhs sense of his own political powerlessness was taken out on his wife through the abuse of the only kind of power he has instant access to. The inequities of patriarchy create the perfect scapegoat for all the perceived wrongs of the system. In all this, then, his wifes disempowerment is twofold, political as well as sexual, and very much part of the order of things that nourishes Mr Sheikhs rage. She had held the month-old baby when her husband was shooing the health-worker off, and furtively allowed him to feed the vaccine. She knew that it was good for her child. It was another woman in the village who later told Mr Sheikh that his wife had allowed a man who was not her husband to feed the child. And then his anger erupted. An indifferent government and an errant woman suddenly became one and the same thing for him  and both had to be put in their places.

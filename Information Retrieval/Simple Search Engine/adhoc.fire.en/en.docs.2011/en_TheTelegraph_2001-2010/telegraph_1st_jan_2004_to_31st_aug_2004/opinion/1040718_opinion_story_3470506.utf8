The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, July 18, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Bad hair days				 																																																				Sir  Although a moustache-incentive of Rs 33 has been announced in Madhya Pradesh, the states where it should be really effective are Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, where Veerappan  arguably in possession of the most famous moustache in the country  and his men are hiding (Moutache mantra for money and muscle, July 13). Plainclothes policemen, sporting Veerappan-like moustaches, can then pass themselves off as his accomplices, and find a way of nabbing the dreaded bandit. But technically speaking, the clean-shaven deserve an allowance too because they require more elaborate shaving equipment than their moustachioed colleagues. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Soham Gupta, Calcutta
				 																Courting attention				 																																																				Sir  Amit Roys comments in Trophy girl launches million-dollar career (July 5), that after tolerating the sturdy Williams sisters for years, picture editors, who believe readers prefer blondes, are sighing with relief, were shockingly racist. To most in the world, the Williams sisters are a shining example of grit and courage against the most blatant racial discrimination in the sporting world, especially tennis. By demolishing the challenge of white players for quite a few years now, the Williams sisters have become anathema to the white-dominated tennis establishment, which was first challenged by Althea Gibson in the Sixties. It is both strange and unfortunate that a non-white journalist should jump to take the side of the whites. Why couldnt he think instead of exploding the myth that readers prefer blondes?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chitro Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Maria Sharapovas Wimbledon win has certainly revived interest in womens tennis, which has long been ignored by many because of its apparent lack of depth and predictable results. But now, with the likes of Sharapova and Anastasia Myskina blazing the circuit, tennis afficionados can be sure that in the coming years, there will be many other smiling faces on the victory podiums than those of the Williams sisters and the Belgian duo of Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin-Hardenne. Given her fetching looks, Sharapova should see to it that she does not follow the example of the other Russian, Anna Kournikova, who had also started with promise but makes headlines now for reasons other than her tennis. The biggest challenge for Sharapova now is to prove that she has the mental toughness to survive at the top level.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajiv Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The exit of stars like Steffi Graf, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, even Martina Hingis had created a vacuum in womens tennis. Maria Sharapovas victory in the 2004 Wimbledon championships has given many tennis-lovers a reason to watch womens tennis again as a competitive game. The World Tennis Association should provide more encouragement to younger players so that the womens game does not become a monopoly of a few.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																City quirks				 																																																				Sir  A rather impressive looking signboard put up by the Calcutta Police at the south-west corner of the Park Street-Upper Wood Street crossing announces the timings for one-way traffic on the road as 8 am to 2 pm in one direction, and, quite absurdly, 2 am to 8 pm on the other. Ironically, it is supposed to have been issued in public interest by the DC Traffic.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arnab Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why doesnt the mayor of Calcutta who is hell bent on beautifying the city think of starting a ropeway service between Kidderpore and Esplanade, over the sprawling lawns of the Victoria Memorial and part of the Maidan? This would certainly make more sense than his other pet project, the Calcutta Gate, would. For one, it would serve as an excellent tourist attraction, and for another, it can become popular among Calcuttans as an eco-friendly mode of transport over the over-crowded streets. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sandeep Sethi, Calcutta

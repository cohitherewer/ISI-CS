The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 							 																						NEW MODEL																														The best conventions are dull, because they are supposed to enact the expected. But the presidents speech this time was somewhat more interesting in content than those he has delivered since he came to the chair in 2002. Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was addressing the first session of both houses of parliament after elections to the 14th Lok Sabha. The speech was carefully calibrated, intended to address those issues perceived as the chief reasons for the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. One area of emphasis, predictably, was secularism and pluralism, with a promised model law against communal violence. The picture being projected is one of harmony: the courts will sort out the Ayodhya dispute, while the disputants are welcome to talk it over too; the government will implement the Protection of Places of Worship Act, 1992; Urdu will be promoted; the matter of affiliating minority professional institutions to Central universities will be looked into. The other area of emphasis, rather more sweeping in scope, are the farmers, labourers, scheduled castes and tribes. It is clear that the defeat of the NDA has been largely put down to its rejection by the poor. At the same time, for this government, this large segment is the whole point of reforms with a human face: it is on the farmers and labourers, the backward and the underprivileged that the dream of economic growth with fiscal discipline will be made or broken. 																														And the test has already begun. The promise of 100 days of guaranteed employment for one person in every rural household has immediately provoked questions about populist measures. More important, perhaps, is the governments promise to conduct talks with the World Trade Organization to protect farmer interests. The emphasis on the water policy and schemes to ensure water supply to arid and semi-arid areas are heartening too, especially since the speech also deals with questions of conservation and ecology. As the head of government, the president is non-partisan. His ritual addresses are untouched by politics. What is interesting in the presidents speeches, therefore, is the function of rhetoric, which must succeed in making political issues sound like apolitical ideals. So the promise of autonomy to higher educational institutions no longer sounds like an answer to Mr Murli Manohar Joshis spat with the Indian Institutes of Management, and the promised repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act prompts memories of Ms J. Jayalalithaas mistimed eagernesses. Even convention failed to dull the edge of the recent political dramas.

Sujit Basu: 2001 to dateIt was the afternoon of March 25. Sujit Basu was on a train, on his way from Calcutta to Santiniketan, when his mobile phone rang. Oh, god, the Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor (VC) gasped out as the caller broke the numbing news to him. The university registrar was on the other end, informing Basu of the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia from the university museum the previous night.																														Basu was shaken. And not just by the theft, but by its implications as well. A dark thought flashed through his mind. Was it just a burglary or an inside job designed to discredit and oust him from Santiniketan, he wondered. After all, his detractors  and they were too many now for him to handle  had already launched a campaign to remove him. For the first time since he took over as V-C in June 2001, Basu regretted his decision to accept what he had thought would be a cool job in placid Santiniketan.																														Too much trouble, not worth it, he sighs. After all, he had been quite happy in his previous jobs. A gold medallist in MSc from Calcutta University, Basu had taught operations management at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta for nearly two decades after doing his PhD from the University of North Carolina in the United States. And this was in addition to teaching at the Indian Statistical Institute as a visiting faculty.																														In 1997, Basu founded the National Institute of Management Calcutta (NIMC) at the invitation of the Army Welfare Foundation Society. By the time he left the institution as its director four years later, NIMC had an all-India ranking of 58 among the B-Schools. No small feat for a newcomer.																														It was his stint at NIMC that pushed him towards Bolpur. Basu  a suave, easy-going man  developed what he describes as an excellent rapport with Jaswant Singh, then defence minister, when he was the NIMC director. That relationship came in handy when the Centre was scouting for an academic to head the national university in the summer of 2001.																														During a conversation with human resources minister Murli Manohar Joshi, Singh had reportedly put in a good word for Basu, tilting the balance in his favour.																														Many in the tradition-steeped, hidebound Visva-Bharati, however, did not welcome the appointment. Basu was, after all, the first vice-chancellor with a B-School background. He was not from what a section of academics refers to as the mainstream subjects.																														Basus early days, not surprisingly, were spent fending off the sneers and whispers around him  He will teach you what they dont teach at Harvard and Just what does he know of Tagore? 																														Basu read up on Tagore, but the V-C of Visva-Bharati continued to get billed as the universitys employees enemy number one.																														The 57-year-old V-C, clearly, has not had it easy. His tenure has been peppered with controversies and allegations. There was a furore two years ago when Visva-Bharati authorities spent a tidy sum renovating and air-conditioning a conference hall. It wasnt necessary to waste the taxpayers money like this, a faculty member says. Hes trying to make Visva-Bharati look like a business school, but that wasnt Tagores idea.																														Little wonder, then, Basu earned the epithet of the managing director of Visva-Bharati Inc. Charges of favouritism were also levelled against him. 																														When Sunil Sarkar was appointed registrar of the university in 2002 with a basic salary of Rs 21,400, Ranabir Dutta, a physics professor, wrote an angry letter to Basu. Dutta said that Sarkars basic salary exceeded his, even though he was the senior-most professor on the campus. What made the faculty see red was the fact that Sarkar was an MBA, which they say showed the V-Cs bias in favour of B-school products.																														Basu defends his act saying the university needed to pay more to get highly qualified people like Sarkar. As for the conference hall, he says the renovation was done in the interest of the university.																														Insiders believe that trouble started in the university when Basu stopped a long-time practice of filling in vacant posts with the spouses and children of employees. Guards, drivers and sanitation workers were employed on contract. Basus corporate style of governance did not go down well with many employees.																														Resentment grew when he made teachers follow the academic calendar strictly. Examinations were held on time, which pleased the body of students. But when Basu scrapped another long-time practice  the alumni quotas for admission  he crossed a great many others at Visva-Bharati. Basu was, clearly, in the eye of a brewing storm. 																														Basus detractors have already sent a long list of omissions and commissions during his tenure to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is the chancellor of the university, demanding action against him. The Prime Ministers Office has reportedly forwarded the complaint to the human resources ministry.																														Basus closeness to Somnath Chatterjee, the local CPM MP, has not made matters any easier for him. Santiniketan residents, protesting against rampant, unregulated construction, were furious when Basu defended the Sriniketan Santiniketan Development Authority, headed by Chatterjee, for its decision to allow highrises.																														The vice-chancellor was virtually locked in a bitter feud with the local residents when the theft of Tagores memorabilia occurred. 																														This burglary also came at a time when the vice- chancellor was negotiating with the state government for a plot in Calcutta to build a small campus and start an MBA course, his dream project many in the university are opposed to.																														Given all this, Basu says he cannot help but think that last weeks burglary was not a simple case of theft. There is more to it. I am sure the arrest of the culprits will one day reveal the real plot behind the burglary, the V-C says.																														What he doesnt say is that security at the Uttarayan complex housing the museum was extremely lax, compared to his own, fortified official residence. But even in that bungalow ringed with a 12-foot-high wall and guarded by security personnel round the clock, the vice- chancellor is anything but secure.

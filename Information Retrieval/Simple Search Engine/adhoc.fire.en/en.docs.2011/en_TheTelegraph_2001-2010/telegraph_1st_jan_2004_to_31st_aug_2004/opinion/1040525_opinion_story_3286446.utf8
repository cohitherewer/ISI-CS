						DOCUMENT From the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949				 	 Not bound																														Relations between prisoners of war and the authorities  Article 78: Prisoners of war shall have the right to make known to the military authorities in whose power they are, their requests regarding the conditions of captivity to which they are subjected. They shall also have the unrestricted right to apply to the representatives of the protecting powers either through their prisoners representative or, if they consider it necessary, directly, in order to draw their attention to any points on which they may have complaints to make regarding their conditions of captivity...Even if they are recognized to be unfounded, they may not give rise to any punishment.																														Prisoners representatives may send periodic reports on the situation in the camps and the needs of the prisoners of war to the representatives of the protecting powers...																														Penal and disciplinary sanctions Article 82: A prisoner of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in the armed forces of the detaining power; the detaining power shall be justified in taking judicial or disciplinary measures in respect of any offence committed by a prisoner of war against such laws, regulations or orders. However, no proceedings or punishments contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall be allowed.																														If any law, regulation or order of the detaining power shall declare acts committed by a prisoner of war to be punishable, whereas the same acts would not be punishable if committed by a member of the forces of the detaining power, such acts shall entail disciplinary punishments only.																														Article 83: In deciding whether proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by a prisoner of war shall be judicial or disciplinary, the detaining power shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise the greatest leniency and adopt, wherever possible, disciplinary rather than judicial measures.																														Article 84: A prisoner of war shall be tried only by a military court, unless the existing laws of the detaining power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member of the armed forces of the detaining power in respect of the particular offence alleged to have been committed by the prisoner of war. 																														In no circumstances whatsoever shall a prisoner of war be tried by a court of any kind which does not offer the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality as generally recognized, and, in particular, the procedure of which does not afford the accused the rights and means of defence provided for in Article 105.																														Article 85: Prisoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the detaining power for acts committed prior to capture shall retain, even if convicted, the benefits of the present Convention. 																														Article 86: No prisoner of war may be punished more than once for the same act or on the same charge.																														Article 87: Prisoners of war may not be sentenced by the military authorities and courts of the detaining power to any penalties except those provided for in respect of members of the armed forces of the said power who have committed the same acts.																														When fixing the penalty, the courts or authorities of the detaining power shall take into consideration, to the widest extent possible, the fact that the accused, not being a national of the detaining power, is not bound to it by any duty of allegiance, and that he is in its power as the result of circumstances independent of his own will. The said courts or authorities shall be at liberty to reduce the penalty provided for the violation of which the prisoner of war is accused, and shall therefore not be bound to apply the minimum penalty prescribed. TO BE CONCLUDED

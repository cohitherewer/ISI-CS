The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 16, 2004 							 																						FREE TO MONITOR																														The question of freedom is central to most democratic institutions and processes, including the general elections. It is, therefore, the sign of a robust democracy when the actual stuff of political persuasion and expression becomes the subject of energetic debate in the run-up to the polls. The Supreme Courts empowerment of the Election Commission for the monitoring of political advertising on the television channels and cable networks is part of this debate. But it might be seen as taking the issue away from open debate towards a legislative closure. This might even appear to be somewhat inimical to the spirit of democracy, imposing on a vital form of free expression something that looks very much like pre-censorship. The EC itself does not seem to be too comfortable with the idea of having to vet the impossible flow of declarations and applications that must pour in after the court order. It had earlier tried to pass this responsibility over to the information and broadcasting ministry, which has always been remarkably free of anxiety over censorship of any kind. But the Centre did not want to take over this double-edged prerogative before the elections. So, the EC has now been left with the job, over and above its unending vigil on all manner of unruliness  from obscene slander to deadly stampedes and deadlier massacres. This is not an enviable empowerment, given the hydra-headedness of both the electronic media and the party-political machinery in India.																														But there is also the fundamental issue of the freedom of expression. Political campaigning has a life of its own, which is a part of the larger, and even more self-regulating, life of a functioning democracy. One does not have to be a jaded old cynic to give up trying to sanitize the red-in-tooth-and-claw nature of this phase of the election process. The country already has a legal system in place for all manner of libel and defamation. There are also enough checks on morality and the abuse of religious sentiments, which aggrieved parties could avail themselves of when the need arises. To burden the EC with the added duty of policing advertisements even before they have been broadcast, looks like an attempt to clean up something that is intrinsically, even necessarily, impure. The other argument that the expensiveness of such advertisements gives rise to an unfair exercising of money power by richer parties and individuals is just as restrictive. When the Andhra Pradesh government shot down the ban on political advertising last month, it did so on grounds of discrimination, leading to the violation of the right to freedom of trade and business. A mature democracy should be left to work out its own sense of decency and fairness in most things.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 							 																						FOOD 																													FOR																													THOUGHT As a child Maheswar Murmu knew what it was like to go to bed without dinner. But as politician, he has developed a wholly new kind of appetiteMAKING A DIFFERENCEInfluential tribal leaders: 
	Shibu Soren: The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha supremo was instrumental in carving Jharkhand out of Bihar 
	Dilip Singh Bhuria: A tribal leader from Madhya Pradesh, he helped script the Bhuria committee report on tribal self-rule in scheduled areas 
	Juel Oram: The former Union tribal affairs minister brought several projects to his state, Orissa.																														Maheswar Murmu knows hunger. As a child, the minister of state for forest would drink mugs of water before hitting the cold dirt floor of his mud house at night. The water filled his stomach and helped curb those rebellious pangs of hunger, even if temporarily. Murmu was one of seven children. The half-a-kilogram of boiled chickpea that his father, Lasa Murmu  a Santhal peasant from what is now Bengals West Midnapore district  brought home on most days for dinner was not enough for them. But that was all that Lasa could afford. 																														The tribal family splurged when the Janas, the local zamindar family whose land Maheswars father tilled, occasionally gifted Lasa with bowls of atta or unrefined flour. Each of us got two or three balls of atta my mother boiled for us in hot water. It was a genuine break from eating chickpea day in and day out, Murmu, 58, says. 																														But then, a couple of atta balls, like a palmful of chickpea, hardly filled an empty stomach. So on most nights, Murmu and his five brothers and a sister went to sleep after stuffing themselves with water. We were often very tired and sleep came easily, says Murmu, who heads the western regional development council of West Bengal. But we would wake up in the middle of the night, feeling very hungry. How can one sleep through the night on an empty stomach? 																														This is the question famished residents of Amlashol, an impoverished village in Murmus Midnapore district, might like to ask the minister today. If only Murmu, now a powerful CPI(M) leader, would listen.																														After a whistlestop visit last week to Amlashol, a hilly, forested hamlet where five people allegedly died of hunger in the last three months, Murmu is all but convinced that no one starved to death in the village. There were five deaths, he admits, in Amlashol, an area where barely 20 tribal families nestle in the Naxalite-stalked Jhargram subdivision. But they died not of hunger but of disease, he says. And the minister is right  at least technically. 																														From Kalahandi to Amlashol, no one starves to death; they succumb to diseases brought on by starvation. Eating too little for months  at times for years makes a human body less resistant and more vulnerable to a string of diseases, nutritionists say. Even a simple fever could turn out to be fatal for the starving. And at Amlashol, the nearest hospital is 28 km away, a distance the villagers have to cover in part on foot through a dense forest.																														Murmu, the hungry boy, knows about starvation. But Murmu, the politician, wont own up. For admitting starvation deaths would mean acknowledging the failure of the state to feed its people. And Murmu, a minister in the Left Front government since 1982, cannot possibly do that. And therein lies the problem. How can you solve a problem if you refuse to acknowledge it? G. Sriramappa, director of Oxfam India, asks. It was a typical government response to starvation deaths, he says.																														What galls many  especially those in the Opposition  are Murmus flippant remarks about the dead. People do die, dont they? he said on one occasion. No wonder the Opposition is asking for his scalp. He may be a tribal, but he does not know anything about the problems facing the tribals in Jhargram, Chunibala Hansda, president of the Jharkhand Party (Naren), says. Hes got so used to his air-conditioned car and the other trappings of power that he does not care about us.																														Hansda accuses the CPI(M) of neglecting the area since her party controls the Banspahari gram panchayat, which includes Amlashol. It is all political, she says, referring to Murmus comment that relatives of the dead would not get compensation or relief. The politics of starvation runs as deep as the malady itself. 																														In neighbouring Orissa, the Biju Janata Dal and BJP, when in Opposition, pointed a finger at the Congress each time a starvation death or a child sale was reported in Kalahandi district. In power now, the parties staunchly deny that starvation stalks parts of the state. Just as Murmu refuses to budge even after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee acknowledged that there was a starvationlike situation in Amlashol. 																														The minister, however, admits that villagers earn hardly Rs 20 a day selling firewood at the rate of Rs 5 a headload. The dirt-poor of Amlashol live off the forests surrounding their village near the border with Jharkhand. 																														Murmu lived in poverty too but pulled himself out of it. He was the first tribal youth in his village to pass higher secondary in 1967 and the first tribal MLA from Kesiari in 1982. To battle hunger, Murmu says he built a storage for paddy in his village Baroda more than three decades ago. I got the farmers to donate rice to the storage. We gave it back to them on loan during lean seasons to avoid starvation in our village. He has done some other things too, such as building a club, a primary school and a road. 																														But it was his idea to store paddy for the village that became popular in the area, giving a veritable boost to his political career. It paid rich dividends as he won his seat for five consecutive terms. People still remember me for what I have done for them, he says. Starvation or not, Murmu is confident that he will win the seat for another five terms. Amlashol, after all, is not a part of his constituency.

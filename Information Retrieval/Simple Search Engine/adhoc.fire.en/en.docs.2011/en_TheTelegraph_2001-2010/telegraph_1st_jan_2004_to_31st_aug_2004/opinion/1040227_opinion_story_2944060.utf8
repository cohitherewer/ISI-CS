The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 27, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																How safe is your chicken?				 																																																				Sir  The flippant manner in which advertising icons are trying to dilute the gravity of the bird flu threat is disturbing. What authority do these icons have to mislead the unsuspecting masses by declaring chicken roasts safe (photograph on page one, February 26)? Does a beautiful face make them more knowledgeable than virologists and biochemists who are yet to find a solution? A popular city hatchery is spreading the news that poultry chicken is safe. We are talking of bird flu, and chicken, including poultry chicken, are not safe. Again, boiled egg is safe no doubt, but only if the hen laid the egg in a saucepan of boiling water! The bird flu virus can spread through bird droppings and, remember, eggs without any trace of droppings is not just rare, they are inconceivable. A boiled egg may be safe, but think of the route the egg has taken before landing on the saucepan. We should wait for scientists to give the green signal before reaching out for the tandoori chicken.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Chinmoy Chakrabarti, Calcutta
				 																We are closed today				 																																																				Sir  Many a time in the past, I have written letters to the editor to vent my outrage at bandhs in the hope that better sense would prevail since this was, perhaps, the only avenue left to individuals for protest. But today I write convinced that nothing will change. I make it a point to go to office on all bandh days, against all odds, because I cannot let someone forcibly take away my right to work and then have the temerity to congratulate me for making the bandh a success! But the industrial strike on February 24 defeated all my efforts.				 																																																				I have rarely heard anything more absurd than the state governments declaration that the information technology industry would be treated as a public utility service and special stickers would be distributed to IT workers so that they could attend office, the industrial bandh notwithstanding. Even the Centre of Indian Trade Unions disregarded the decree. Economic development is a holistic process. The government should stop fooling itself about the IQ levels of potential investors in the IT sector and try to remedy the problems it has created for itself. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anand Kumar Jhunjhunwala, 

				 																																																				Calcutta				 																																																				Sir  In spite of court orders, rallies, strikes and bandhs continue to take place. This is dangerous for democracy. One cannot defy court orders and yet demand that democratic rights be protected. Nowadays, if the courts give a favourable decision they are called pillars of democracy but if they do not, they become enemies of the poor. 				 																																																				Strikes will never force governments to change policies. Instead, they only serve to deprive our country of thousands of crores in revenues. How many trade union leaders have offered even Rs 2 to a no work, no pay worker so he doesnt go to sleep hungry? Trade union leaders never lose anything as a result of the strikes: they are becoming richer by the day. All they do is dissuade prospective investors from coming to the state, thus causing a loss of job opportunities for the poor they claim to speak for. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Why do the CITU and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) call bandhs only in West Bengal? Why not in Maharashtra, the home state of M.K. Pandhe, the CITU president? Or Andhra Pradesh, the native state of Sitaram Yechuri, or Punjab, that of Harkishen Singh Surjit? Is West Bengal a soft target? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
D.K. Bhattacharya, via email

				 																																																				Sir  Bandhs do little to resolve the issues for which they are called. It is futile to blame the Centre for West Bengals problems when the state government, despite its bankruptcy, continues to bankroll surplus staff. But it is unlikely that the CPI(M) leaders, given their high average age, can give up their faith in outdated ideologies. The left leaders should ask themselves what they have done to improve matters. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The pulse polio immunization drive on February 22 was a significant step in the war against polio, especially since a number of fresh cases were detected in West Bengal in 2003. It was to be followed by house visits by volunteers over the next 2 days to search and vaccinate all children. But the February 24 bandh disrupted communications and the supply of vaccine to distant areas so that many children were deprived of the vaccine this time. The dates for pulse polio were fixed a long time ago and the bandh could have easily been pushed back by a day. This exposes, yet again, the hypocrisy of our politicians, who have sworn to eradicate polio from our country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Sengupta, via email

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Citu strikes, city loses jobs (Feb 25), shows how irresponsible and disgusting the CITU leaders are. It is unimaginable that any adult, educated person today does not understand the effect on the IT industry of losing one days delivery on the ground that they can work for 364 other days! 				 																																																				The chief minister looked a really sorry sight. With friends and colleagues like these he does not need enemies or detractors. He should showcause all ministers who did not turn up for work on the bandh day and if they do not respond satisfactorily, sack them. Similarly, one days salary of all government employees who were absent must be deducted as punishment. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  IT personnel do not even have 364 days left  what if other parties now take their turn to call a strike? Not many days will be left in a year for work, if the strikes era comes back. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sekhar Chandra Bose, Kuwait

				 																																																				Sir  If the leader of the largest labour union says that it does not matter that a manday was lost, then it sends very definite signals to industry leaders  Do not invest in Bengal. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should look into this first without wasting time and money on seminars and meeting industry leaders.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pratik Surray, Rhode Island, USA

				 																																																				Sir  Expectedly, normal life was disrupted nowhere in India but in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, by the CITU bandh. Left leaders do not realize that strikes have no meaning today. Earlier, the Left Front used to call strikes but criticism, within and outside the state, has made them leave the task of calling strikes to their trade union wings. No wonder the left has not extended its influence beyond West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Parthasarathi Bera, Seattle, USA

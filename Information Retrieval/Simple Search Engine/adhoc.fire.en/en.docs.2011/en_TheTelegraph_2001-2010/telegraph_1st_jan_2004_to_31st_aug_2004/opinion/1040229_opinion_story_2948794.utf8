		 Sunday, February 29, 2004  WHY MEDHA WANTS TO JOIN POLITICS 
 							 - It is a dirty business but I see it as a challenge: PatkarIt isnt just the mainstream parties discussing strategies. NGOs are also hammering out a united front for the elections. Bishakha De Sarkar in New Delhi and Satish Nandgaonkar in Mumbai report All for a cause: Medha Patkar at the World Social Forum 2004 (above); tribal women activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan at a meet in Bhopal (below) 																														Medha Patkars bags are packed. She sits in the midst of a dozen pieces of luggage, most of them filled with books and legal papers and some with clothes. She is in her suburban Chembur residence in Mumbai, just back from the Narmada Valley but ready to leave again. She shall pick up a combination of her ever-ready bags and move on to the next dusty town in India. 																														Meetings are being held in different parts of the country, bringing together social activists, villagers, academics and workers of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Patkar shall attend a few of those, travelling to Badwani, Ujjain, Rajasthan and Delhi in the next four days, before returning to Mumbai for what could be the most crucial meeting of her public life. For thats where a decision will be taken on whether or not Patkar is going to stand for the election. 																														Election dates are still to be announced, but electoral activity is peaking. And the mainstream political parties are not the only ones discussing seats, candidates, alliances and strategies. Representatives of peoples movements and NGOs are sitting together as well to hammer out a united front for the elections.																														Names are being finalised. Members of the National Alliance of Peoples Movements (NAPM)  an umbrella body of some 200 grassroot organisations  are fairly certain that Patkar will be persuaded to fight for Parliament, though the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) leader herself stresses that a final decision is yet to be taken.																														For us, it is a very serious decision, says Patkar. There hasnt been a decision yet about myself or my eminent colleagues. I know electoral politics is dirty and risky, but I see it as a challenge, she says. 																														The decision on whether Patkar should contest for a Lok Sabha seat, the election for which is slated to be held in April and May, will be taken at an NAPM meeting on Monday. But, already Maharashtra political circles are abuzz with the whisper that she will take on the Shiv Sena MP from Rajapur, Suresh Prabhu, the chairman of the task force for the Inter-Linking of Rivers (ILR), a controversial project that the central government has been spearheading and Patkar bitterly opposing. 																														I think Medha already has a constituency in mind, says an NAPM member. But, these are details that are still to be worked out, he says. There are many divisions among us, though debates would be a more appropriate word, adds Vijay Pratap, national convenor of Socialist Front  India.																														The issue of electoral politics was taken up by the NAPM at a meeting in September, 2003. A political consultative commitee was nominated which met in New Delhi in December last year. That was the time when state assembly election results were coming in. 																														And the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) victory in three states egged social activists on. There was a consensus among NAPM constituents in favour of electoral politics, says Sanjay Mangala Gopal, a member of the Samajwadi Jan Parishad (SJP), an NAPM constituent. 																														The World Social Forum, held in Mumbai in January, was another venue where the issue was discussed at length. At a stall set up by Anhad (Act Now for Harmony and Democracy), the question of a peoples manifesto came up, in aid of which the Campaign for Democratic India was launched.																														But the talks have been going on for a while. NAPM member Kuldip Nayar stresses that the possibility of credible and clean people standing for elections was first discussed before the last Parliamentary polls. It was then decided that we would work on the issue before getting into electoral politics. This time, there is a general feeling in favour of fighting the polls, he says.																														But, clearly, debates  Prataps euphemism for divisions  are still raging. In the amorphous sector of social activism  a bitterly-fractious circle  there has been no consensus on electoral politics so far. But there is consensus that globalisation and communalism have to be fought, says Supreme Court lawyer and NAPM member Prashant Bhushan.																														The activists are convinced that they have to oppose the BJP and its allies. A section is equally wary of the Congress. But there is a tremendous pressure from peoples groups to unitedly defeat the BJP and then change the Congress, says Vijay Pratap. If after six months, the Congress refuses to look at the agenda of the people, we would be ready to agitate against it, he says.																														In the last election, the dividing lines in the world of social activism were more stark. Some NAPM constiutents then felt that there was no alternative but to get into the political arena and contest all seats, says Gopal. Some felt we should not contest even a single seat and stay away from politics. After long discussions, it was decided not to enter politics, he says.																														This time, too, not many are convinced about the wisdom of the move. Though Magsaysay award-winner Aruna Roy stressed that there was no alternative to politics at a public function in Mumbai in October last year, her Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghatana (MKSS), a Rajasthan-based outfit, has now decided against contesting the elections. At a seven-day camp earlier this month, the MKSS decided to work for voter education instead and chalk out their own programme for future participation. It has been decided that they will look into the possibility of fighting elections from below  starting with the panchayat and then moving up, says Vijay Pratap.																														For peoples groups  adversaries of governments and political parties  its been a long journey. Pratap explains that unlike the generation of the Fifties that was drawn into movements because of political reasons, those who joined and led political action in the Eighties and Nineties did so as a reaction against mainstream politics. But they have now been politicised because of their own experiences, he says. 																														There are some who believe that the activists turn to politics is an admission of the failure of movements in recent times. The biggest struggle was led by Medha Patkar and her Narmada Bachao Andolan. After a series of little victories and defeats, the Supreme Court last year finally put the lid on the movement. Villages have been submerged by the dam, tribal people who were at the forefront of the movement have left their villages and its leaders have dispersed. I would have to say that the NBA has failed, says a former member. 																														But not many in the sector now looking at electoral politics admit that the move towards the ballot spells the defeat of their efforts. I dont think the peoples movements have failed. Rather power politics has failed to respond to peoples issues, says Patkar. Bhushan agrees. There is no despair. But there is an increasing realisation that the economics and politics of globalisation are getting more and more unresponsive to peoples needs, he says.																														On the ground, it is clear that governments are getting inured to popular pressure  a method used by groups advocating change. I think peoples movements realised that merely acting as a pressure group from the outside did not work if political representatives were insensitive to or not interested in these issues, says Gopal. So, the alternative of putting up people who are committed and sensitive to these issues is being looked at, he says. 																														Not surprisingly, many in the NAPM now believe that social groups will have a stronger role to play if they are in the decision-making process. Power is politics. I realised this after being in Parliament, says Nayar. 																														In the short-list so far are people such as Nayar and human rights activist Rajinder Sachchar. Subhash Lomte of the National Working Committee of rural workers is already said to have decided to contest the polls. The SJP plans to contest two seats from Madhya Pradesh and possibly two in north Bengal and one in Bihar. 																														The candidates include a Jawaharlal Nehru University topper who set up a cooperative movement in Kesala in Hoshangabad in M.P. Tribal leader C.K. Janu may fight from Kerala and candidates are expected to be fielded from Chhatisgarh, where the Chattisgarh Mukti Morcha has a base. We need to put up those people who are full-time activists, says Bhushan.																														Meanwhile, a series of meetings are being held. Vijay Pratap and former bureaucrat and head of Action-Aid, Harsh Mander, are in a group set up to prepare a peoples manifesto. Amidst unprecedented wealth and glittering consumerism, hunger and homelessness abound, the group says in a letter that has been endorsed by some 100 signatories. Ordinary people of India see the choice clearly between the politics of hate... and of social harmony. We live in times that do not allow soft and ambiguous options, it says.																														The peoples manifesto will be released on March 20 after a two-day meeting in New Delhi. Four meetings have already taken place in Delhi. Elsewhere, meetings are being held and decisions reached. The NAPM has set up a Peoples Political Front to deal with electoral politics. In Ranchi, a cultural festival will be held on March 21 and 22 where the issue is expected to come up. On March 20, a massive rally is being planned in Patna by the All India Oppressed Muslims Forum as well.																														Apart from meetings and rallies, the nitty-gritties of an election are being thrashed out. The activists say they will fund an election with the help of donations. Meanwhile, Nayar is hoping to work on alliances with mainstream parties, He has met CPI(M) leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet and CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan to urge them to give winnable seats to members of peoples movements. 																														Talks have also been held with Ahmed Patel and Salman Khursheed of the Congress. But the parties have started to announce the names of their candidates. And we are yet to finalise ours, Nayar says. 																														But not many believe that the mainstream parties will accommodate members of the social sector. Why should they? asks a political observer. They have problems of their own accommodating allies, he says.																														But hope  coupled with the knowledge that the Green Party in Germany, now a ruling partner, started as a fringe group, or closer home, that the BJP was once a party of two MPs  keeps the activists moving from one meeting to another, discussing the pros and cons of an electoral plunge.																														Winning or not winning is not so important. But fielding candidates will present the face of an alternative before the people, says Bhushan. And in the next election, something more viable will emerge, he says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 							 																						DEADLINE GAS																														It is the West Bengal government at its most shameless. The advocate-general must have, by now, got thoroughly used to being severely put down by the court at regular intervals. Such jadedness to public shame is not the only measure of the governments callousness when it comes to the miserable saga of Calcutta and Bharat II. This government, together with the various transport lobbies under its wing, has been putting off the carrying out of the high courts order regarding vehicular emission norms for around five years now, in the face of a steady and alarming rise of air pollution in the city. A ridiculous ritual is enacted every year, in which the advocate-general and the governments lawyers are hauled up in court for asking for a deferral of the deadline set the previous year by the court. Between these annual appearances in court, the government and the various transport syndicates, associations and committees think up new excuses for failing to enforce the norms. Tracing this pattern through the years shows up the extent of the states murderous lack of a political will to improve the quality of air that its citizens breathe. To call this inaction murderous is not an exaggeration  for what is at stake here must not be lost sight of in all this incompetence, equivocation and politicking. 																														The government is also getting better at fabricating excuses. After humbly submitting to the fact that the April 2004 deadline cannot be met yet again, it is now trying to shift the ground from Bharat II to the Centres tail-pipe emission norms, which will come into effect only from October. Before this, once the election dates were declared, the transport department tried to convince everybody that the confiscation of the public vehicles would be impossible since they were all needed for election work. Before that, the finance department was blamed for sitting on files and blocking the funds for buying new buses and updating engines. Besides these tactics, there are always the populist concern over unemployment, and the fact that India is a poor country in which one cannot afford to junk old cars simply because they pollute the air. Pollution control, by this logic, is a form of decadence that a communist state must disapprove of. There is also a growing tendency to shunt off disqualified vehicles to the districts, without thinking of the environmental consequences of such a strategy. The governments latest failure is more than a question of not being able to do what Delhi and Mumbai have managed in spite of similar resistance. Calcuttans have again been told by the government that it cares little for how they live or die.

		 Monday, June 28, 2004 							 																						ROUGH JOB																														Poor children make excellent slaves, especially if they are girls. And like all slaves, they sometimes get lazy. It is wise then to give them a beating. Modernity has its checks and measures against such ancient traditions. But the privacy afforded to respectable, middle-class, urban Indian homes is convenient at such times. No one needs to know, and thus no one interferes, when a child is being beaten. Twelve-year-old Rashida Khatun was punished on Saturday for sleeping late. Her employer repeatedly kicked her on her face, scratched her face and neck with her nails till Rashida bled. The womans husband, a lawyer, also did his bit in beating the girl up before she fled to her aunt, who took her first to hospital, and then to the police. She had been beaten up frequently in the last eight months, and her back is full of wounds made by a sharp knife. Rashida earns Rs 300 for cleaning the house and bathrooms, washing clothes and helping in the kitchen. In May, another child, Regina Khatun, was attacked by her employer  a primary-school teacher  by a pair of tongs until she had deep gashes in her head. Regina had dropped the teachers baby from the bed when it had been left in her charge during the mothers school hours. In January, Tumpa Mondol  also 12 years old and earning Rs 300 a month  was discovered to have been regularly savaged by her employers, a businessman and his wife. Tumpa was routinely beaten on the knuckles with a pair of scissors, scratched, denied food, her hair shorn off, and her widowed mother was prevented from seeing her. There are numerous other incidents, including one in which a child was locked in an apartment with practically no food when her employers went off on a vacation.																														Loopholes in Indian child-labour laws prevent the securing of children from domestic servitude. Roughing them up is a bailable offence, and there is no law that forces employers to educate these children or grant them their other basic rights and entitlements. Extreme poverty often makes such servitude a better option, enabling employers to regard themselves as dispensers of charity. Thus brutalizing children remains part of the natural order of things in India.

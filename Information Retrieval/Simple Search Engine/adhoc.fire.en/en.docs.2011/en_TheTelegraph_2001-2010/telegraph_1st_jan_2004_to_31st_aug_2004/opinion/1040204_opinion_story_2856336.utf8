		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 							 																						ALL HEART																														As usual, the alarm bells are ringing a little late. They always have done so, whenever it is womens health that is the issue. In 1991, doctors came to the conclusion that cardiovascular diseases had been killing more women than men throughout the past decade. Since heart disease was accepted as a mans disease, and related so easily to the stresses a man undergoes in his working life, everyone took a while to notice. It was romanticized as well. Heart disease is stress-related, men die of heart disease, so the stress men face must be far greater than that experienced by women. Even in advanced countries, many doctors are not aware that coronary heart disease and stroke are the primary killers of women, and not breast cancer or other diseases. This blindness to facts is another example of the embedded male orientation of traditional medical lore. Women who are not doctors can hardly be blamed if they do not yet know that they face as great a risk of a heart attack as men do. Recent studies suggest that it has become urgent to disseminate the right information about heart disease among women, especially since the risk factors as well as the symptoms may be different in men and women.																														The new understanding about heart disease is not entirely free of the gender war rhetoric either. The equation between stress and heart disease is being made in a different way: if women want to enter the mans world, they have to take on mens diseases, or, less politely, control comes at a price. Although this is just plain silly, such an attitude, if ingrained, cannot be beneficial for women. It is really the result of a series of intricately woven prejudices. After all, the risk factors that cannot be controlled, like ageing, family history, and race, remain exactly the same from the time of those blissful days when women stayed at home. In the matter of blood cholesterol levels, diabetes, or high blood pressure, it can be argued that added stress in a working womans life, which includes unhealthy eating, has to be weighed against greater awareness. The one obvious change may be the rise in cigarette smoking in women, but that is still one factor among many. Certainly, adding a professional working life to the multi-tasking that women have always been used to can be stressful. But given the evidence of ignorance about womens health, is it not possible to believe that women have been suffering from heart disease for a long time, only no one ever noticed?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 							 																						FATALLY POOR																														The story of HIV/AIDS in India is often one of brutal misgovernance. At least 30 children and a few adults have got infected with HIV in Calcutta after being given blood from the citys two main government hospitals. And the common factor uniting these infected or dead children is crucial. They are all poor. The father of a three-year-old to be diagnosed HIV-positive is a vegetable-seller. Most of these children suffer from incurable blood disorders like thalassaemia or haemophilia, and therefore need regular treatment and blood transfusion. Poverty leaves the parents with no choice but to take the children to the NRS or Medical College hospitals, where they have been given infected blood. Private blood banks, where the screening is more reliable, are beyond their reach. This mismanagement is more than simple ineptitude. Killing poor, incurably ill children with improperly screened blood is a form of inhumanity. In one case, the fact that the child had been infected was withheld from the parents by the doctors at NRS for months. The parents found it out on their own initiative. That children were getting infected through blood transfusion had been noticed at the hospital as early as 2001. An inquiry had been duly ordered, but nothing more has been done since. 																														It is not enough to say that the HIV/AIDS epidemiology in India is tied up with poverty. The real determining factor is the states knowing exploitation of the ignorance and powerlessness that this poverty breeds. The government does not feel accountable to the users of its healthcare system simply because they happen to be poor. It is the same attitude of natural indifference, combined with shocking stupidity, which prompted the health department to think of letting homoeopaths and ayurveds run a large number of primary health centres. And the government hopes to pass this off as a bright idea, a clever way of solving the twin problems of non-existent infrastructure and geographical remoteness. By this logic then, the government should think it perfectly in form to treat the currently 150-odd kala-azar patients in Murshidabad district with homoeopathy or ayurveda. It was also this mix of incompetence and indifference that made untrained health-workers overdose people, including children, with the filaria antidote in the districts, leaving most of them grievously ill. This was followed by a casual assurance from the chief minister that there was no cause for panic. Teaching serenity in the face of medical mishaps might be a good way of taking on HIV/AIDS in West Bengal.

		 Friday, February 20, 2004 							 																						DIRECTION FOR THE YOUTH V.K. MADHOK																					By the first week of February, jubilant members of the National Cadet Corps who had participated in the Republic Day parade returned to their respective cities and towns after a month-long stay in the capital. The shows they had put up were well-coordinated and disciplined as usual. But apart from responding to these intermittent calls of duty, has the NCC really achieved its goals? 																					The corps continues to train only a fraction of the student population of the country while a large section of Indias youth remain engaged in deviant activities. Yet the NCC is the only organization equipped to look after the personality development of the youth on a mass scale. It has been designed to promote youth leadership and create a source of trained manpower to complement the armed forces during a national emergency. 																					There is no single agency that can be held accountable for the NCCs under-performance. The responsibility is as much that of the director-general of the body as of the ministry of defence under which the organization functions, the ministry of human resource development which lays down policies, the respective states which implement them, the three service headquarters which provide staff, equipment and training infrastructure and members of the academia who provide positive responses. 																					Limited appeal																					With functions, including the allotment of funds, split between the Central and state governments, it would be a miracle if the NCC achieved its objectives. The increasing alienation of the NCC from the education system, lukewarm response from the armed services and the lack of clear direction at the Central and state levels impedes its progress.																					The national policy on education (1986) makes a mention of involving the youth in national and social development. But schools continue to perceive the NCC as a separate entity. Extra-curricular activities like sports and adventure are considered to be a waste of time. These, however, are essential to the NCC. Thus, there is a basic contradiction in aims. Perhaps the government could try and mesh academic culture with the NCCs objectives. 																					Today, the organization has to attract students with incentives. Since enrolment is voluntary, students find it easy to get away. Most of the recruits join due to parental pressure in order to get jobs or get admission for higher studies. The system has to change so that students themselves approach the NCC. For this, the NCC has to be integrated with the education system, made compulsory and oriented towards the future. It should include activities which improve the ability to cope with emergencies, promote patriotic feelings, physical fitness and train for a possible call for security duties. 																					Sound investment																					The armed forces should pay more attention to training Indias youth. This would pay handsome dividends in the future. The training should be conducted by regular army officers and not part-time NCC cadets. The cadets must train with the latest military equipment and have a glimpse of how the armed forces function in peace or in an operational environment, and the difficulties faced by them in the border areas. 																					India needs to invest in its youth wisely. The NCC is in a position to implement an effective youth programme if it is backed up with enough political will. The government should have a single, definite and long-term NCC-policy drafted by a national youth board comprising intellectuals, corporate leaders, scientists and military professionals. A parliamentary committee should monitor the boards activities. 																					The states concerned, the ministry of human resource development and the defence sector should be made accountable for any lapses in implementation of policies. The three service chiefs should advise and monitor NCC programmes. The NCC director-general should be more accountable. These steps would promote integration and weaken the roots of secessionist and communal movements. It would also give the youth a sense of direction, one which it badly needs today.

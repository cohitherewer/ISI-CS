The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 17, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																C for coal and celluloid 				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjee must be terribly excited about her new portfolio, the coal and mines ministry. So much so that she has invited Sandip Ray to make a film on the lives of coal-miners (Mamata Kala Patthar, Jan 14). There is no doubt that the plight of miners in India is pitiable, but will the new minister care to explain how a film will make things any better? Of course, this is another example of Banerjees now-famous populist gimmicks. And in this case, she has tried to make sure that her loyalty to her home state does not go unnoticed. Hence the choice of Ray, also possibly keeping in mind who his father was.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,  Anweshan Das, Calcutta
				 																Voter knows best				 																																																				Sir  India had probably the best election commissioner in T.N. Seshan, and J.M. Lyngdoh has proved himself fit to fill Seshans shoes. As a good first and basic step to the elections, he has asked his chief electoral officers to implement the model code of conduct and also to speed up the revision of the electoral rolls (Election panel gets cracking, Jan 10). This may not be possible to carry out fully. And neither may his threat to the Congress to strip it of its national party status if it failed to explain the use of state aircraft for election campaigns. But the fact that these issues were raised is a sign that at least Lyngdoh was sincere and committed to his duty.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Kingshuk Biswas, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  While J.M. Lyngdoh may be correct in upbraiding politicians, he is missing an important point. A politician is just one of us. If we really want to change the picture, it is necessary to change the attitudes and flawed ideologies of the people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
P.V. Madhu, Secunderabad

				 																																																				Sir  One does not have to follow Ashok V. Desais suggestion of importing leaders from foreign countries because he thinks there are not enough able leaders in India today (Can the Congress recover?, Dec 30). But this is not true, we still have honest leaders who have leadership qualities too. But they do not get a fair hearing because of the practice of rigging. In the current scenario, J.M. Lyngdoh is justified in feeling that politicians are like cancer with no cure as yet. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Diptendu Chakraborty,

				 																																																				Toronto				 																																																				Sir  It is clear from the way politicians make and break alliances before an election that they are driven solely by the lust for power, rather than by ideology. The chief election commissioner was not off the mark when he described politicians as a malignant growth in society. Exceptions to this cannot be ruled out, but the way in which the members of parliament voted for a rise in pay and perks for themselves shows that exceptions are few and far between. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The list of scams involving politicians, the stamp paper scam being the latest, is a clear sign that only the tip of the iceberg has been touched. J.M. Lyngdohs outburst against politicians in general is therefore justified. More so perhaps since he has had to deal with the worst of Indian politics. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

				 																																																				Sir  The transition from the ballot paper to the electronic voting machine over the last few years is a big achievement for India. The transition has been fairly smooth. But one important detail has been ignored. The voter has the choice of either selecting a particular candidate or none in the ballot paper system. He can cast a blank vote but his loyalty and allegiance to the democratic process are registered. But this choice is strangely missing in the EVM system, since the voter must cast his vote in favour of any one contestant. Thus the voter is often compelled to choose a candidate even against his wishes. This limitation has also forced many to stay away from the voting process, as they would much rather not cast their ballot for a candidate they do not want to elect just for the sake of voting. The EC should take note of this before the coming general elections. The voter should be given a choice of not casting a vote even in the EVM system. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Atanu Dey, Karbi Anglong, Assam

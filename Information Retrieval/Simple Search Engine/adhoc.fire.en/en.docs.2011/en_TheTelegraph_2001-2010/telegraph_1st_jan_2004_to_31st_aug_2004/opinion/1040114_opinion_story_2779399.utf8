		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 AN ANTIQUE CRIME
 Shobita Punja																								There is a shop in Khajuraho that had a bright sign advertising the sale of Junks and Jewels (sic). The name of the shop was a great source of amusement for tourists and of sadness to all of us who knew that this was only the tip of a nasty iceberg.																								London is known as the biggest second hand market and is the most important centre in the world for sale of art and antiquities. A Buddha figure of the Gandhara period can fetch $ 25,000. Even a beautifully sculpted arm, rudely dismembered from a Buddhist Gandhara sculpture had a reserved price of $ 8,000 in a Christis Auction Catalogue. A miniature painting of the Mughal period can bring the owner several thousands of dollars. Theft of art and antiquities is increasing due to these astronomically high prices paid for collectors items. We also know that works of art are being bought and sold as a way to launder black money attained from crimes such as fraud and drug trafficking.																								So the business of faking has become a new, very lucrative venture, for the aspiring Indian. With great skill and ingenuity, thousands of fakes are produced each year. Since most paintings of the medieval period do not have signatures or any such small impediment, skilled artists have for years been perfecting the art of the perfect fake  with flaking paint, mellowing colours, charred paper, painting on old paper to fool the hapless buyer into believing that the painting is really an antique. Unexpected treasure																								Bronze sculptures are equally easy to fake by using the same technique of manufacture as the original  the lost wax process  and then by corroding the surface a little and adding a little patina to suggest that the sculpture has been lying undiscovered for centuries. A little patina introduced with a few chemicals can fetch lakhs.																								The Indian Antiques and Art Treasures Act also defines art treasures as any human work of art, not being an antiquity, declared by the central Government by notification in the Official Gazette, to be an art treasure for the purpose of this act having regard to its artistic or aesthetic value. According to the provision of this act, no painting or sculpture or any work of art by those artists that have been deemed to be notified in the Central gazette can be taken out of India without a valid permit from the director general of the Archaeological Survey of India. The artists whose works have been termed art treasures include Rabindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, Ravi Varma, Gaganendranath Tagore, Abanindranath Tagore, Sailoz Mookerjee and Nicolas Roerich. A Ravi Varma painting at an auction in 1992 was being sold at  10,000 and  25,000. So there is a lot of money to be made in the production of fakes. Piece of history																								Most art deals of an illegal nature are struck by smugglers with the prospective buyers with the exchange of photographs and this is also where fakes and replicas pass off for the real thing. Sometimes replicas of the original are made and shown to the authorities to convince them that the painting is not an original and then at the time of packing, the fake is replaced with the original that goes past customs undetected. India, unlike Iran and Pakistan, has no regulatory restriction on the production of replicas.																								However, there are scientific means of authenticating works of art and antiquities and we need to train young customs officials and the police in every state to be vigilant about the loss of our national property.																								Every locality, town and village in our country is literally strewn with collectors items that we have seen since our childhood. We just havent woken up to the fact that they are precious and can fetch a handsome price at a fancy auction house. We need people like you and me who will constantly be on the look out in our own neighbourhood  sensitive people who will be proud watch dogs of our irreplaceable cultural heritage. We need to remember that once stolen and sold, antiques are extremely difficult to get back. Every cultural object that is lost takes with it a piece of history that cannot be replaced.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 06, 2004 							 																						MIDDLE PERIOD																														When the expected does not happen, it is always cause for concern. But sometimes this is not the case. The summoning of Mr Narendra Modi to campaign in Uttar Pradesh was a desperate move on the part of the Bharatiya Janata Party to prop up the partys plummeting electoral fortunes. It was widely interpreted as a move designed to reaffirm the Hindutva line and a surrender by Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee to the extremist faction within his party and his ideological parivar. Such ominous expectations have been belied. Mr Modi has decided to play the good boy and the obedient soldier of the party. There was very little that he said during the campaign which deviated from the line that was formulated by Mr Vajpayee. Hindutva was not forgotten but it was by no means the principal focus. Mr Modi did not actually try to woo the Muslims,  la Mr Vajpayee, but nothing that he said was directly anti-Muslim. This was a remarkable change from Mr Modis earlier incarnation when he seemed to have no compunctions about using violence and hatred to win elections.																														It might be too early to conclude that Mr Modi has been tamed. But what is clear is that he has come nearer to the publicly proclaimed party line and is more eager to follow Mr Vajpayee than the directions provided by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It would not be altogether unfair to suggest that Mr Modi is reinventing his own public image. He wants to be seen as a responsible politician and to wash away the stains of blood on his reputation. On a broader canvas, Mr Modis changed public posture can be read as a sign of the BJPs attempts, under the leadership of Mr Vajpayee, to appropriate the middle ground of Indian politics. Mr Modi has thus ironed out his extremism and behaved as any other able election campaigner. He has roused the rabble as any good orator does but he has not preached violence. Mr Modi without his extremism is as odd as a tiger without his roar. But observers of Indian politics have come to expect the bizarre and the unexpected from politicians.																														What could have been more bizarre a few years ago than the overtures being made by Mr Vajpayee towards the Muslims? To win them over, he has even changed his attire: he has abandoned his dhoti for the pyjama. Mr Vajpayee knows that if the BJP has to extend his appeal, it cannot restrict its appeal to upper-caste Hindus. The BJP, to become a national party, has to remodel itself and become an umbrella of various groups and interests as the Congress was in its halcyon days. Mr Vajpayee has begun the process of transforming the BJP from an exclusivist party to an inclusivist one. The task is not easy since many within the BJP and the sangh parivar resent the transformation. They see it as an abandonment of the BJPs core values and ideology. Mr Vajpayee is too astute a politician to see the changes that are occurring within the BJP as his own victory. He must be aware that the system has won over the party and the individual.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 12, 2004 							 																						EPIDEMICS ARE USEFULGwynne Dyer																					Only months after he was elected governor of the predominantly Muslim state, Ibrahim Shekarau suspended all vaccinations against polio in response to claims by local religious leaders that the vaccine made women infertile, and rumours that it was a Western plot to reduce the number of Muslims. For almost a year now, no children in Kano have been vaccinated, and as a result over 250 children have been paralyzed by the virus. But it gets worse.																					 In 1998, when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative went into high gear, about a thousand children were being stricken by polio around the world each day. There were only 783 cases worldwide in all of 2003. Three billion dollars have been spent, 20 million volunteers have helped with the immunization, and by last year, the disease still had a foothold in only six countries. There were hopes that polio would be extinct by the end of this year.																					Dirty trick																					Unfortunately, one of the six countries where polio still survives is Nigeria. Good progress had been made with immunization there, too  but then came last years ban. And since Nigerians travel a lot, polio has also shown up recently in half a dozen formerly virus-free African countries, including (ominously) a refugee camp in Darfur, in western Sudan. 																					A synchronized vaccination drive for the 22 African countries most at risk is being organized for this October and November, but it may already be too late. So what can have led governor Shekarau to ban polio vaccinations in his state? The answer, alas, is politics. Convoluted, cynical, ruthless, Nigerian-style politics.																					Nigeria is a seething cauldron of different languages, religions and ethnic groups, but the great divide is between the mainly Muslim north and the largely Christian south. Yet Nigerias politics is not really about religion. Its just that the army used to be dominated by Muslim officers who used it as a springboard to the presidency, and then shared the wealth with their patrons among the politicians and traditional rulers of the north.																					Too late																					It was a cozy deal that died with the last dictator, Sani Abacha, in 1998. In 1999, Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military dictator with a reputation for honesty, won the presidency with much support from northern Muslim voters  even though he is a Christian. They were revolting against the privileged clique of emirs, religious grandees, local politicos and ex-generals who have long relied on appeals to Islamic solidarity to secure their stranglehold in the north. 																					So the clique panicked, and started pushing Islam even harder in an attempt to restore their power. 																					Suddenly Islamic law was imposed across all the northern states in violation of the Nigerian constitution and of minority rights, in an attempt to provoke a polarizing confrontation with Obasanjo over religion. Elements of this clique have probably had a hand in the wave of religious riots that have killed an estimated 10,000 people in cities across the north in the past four years. And still, their presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, didnt win last years election.																					It was shortly after that that governor Shekarau banned polio vaccinations in Kano because they were allegedly a Western plot to cut the Muslim birth-rate. This is not ignorant fanaticism; it is cold-blooded political manipulation. His political machine may even have started the rumours itself. Under pressure from the Islamic Conference (which passed a strong resolution demanding the resumption of vaccinations ) and from his own voters who are now experiencing a polio epidemic, Shekarau has promised to resume vaccinations this month. But much damage has already been done, and he may have a few more tricks up his sleeve yet.

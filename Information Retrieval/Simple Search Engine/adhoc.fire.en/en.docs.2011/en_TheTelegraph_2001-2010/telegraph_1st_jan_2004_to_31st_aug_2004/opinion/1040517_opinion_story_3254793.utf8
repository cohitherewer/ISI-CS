		 Monday, May 17, 2004 							 																						TOO CONFIDENT																														In electoral politics, over-confidence can be as bad as over-ambition. If the former was the bane of the Bharatiya Janata Party in these elections in most parts of the country, the latter was its undoing in Assam. The party was led astray by the exaggerated notions of its strength in Assam. The surprise nomination of the Assamese cultural icon, Mr Bhupen Hazarika, as a party candidate symbolized the false notion of its new importance in the crucial northeastern state. The miscalculation goaded the party to sever its alliance with the Asom Gana Parishad. Both the Central and the state leaders of the party seemed to have been carried away by a faith in their own ability to take on the Congress on their own. This was part of the BJPs larger plan to spread its wings in the hitherto undiscovered areas in the east. It cannot be any consolation for the party that it has managed to win two seats in Assam, as in 1999. A closer look at the results reveals the contours of the partys miscalculation. In over 55 assembly segments, the combined votes of the BJP and the AGP are much more than the votes polled by their common enemy, the Congress. The debacle in Assam may pose problems for the BJP in other northeastern states as well. Its government in Arunachal Pradesh could face an uncertain future because the chief minister, Mr Gegong Apang, an old Congressman who had carried the whole party over to the BJP only recently, might return to his old fold. In Nagaland and Manipur, the BJPs alliances with the regional parties could also be under strains because of the change of guard in New Delhi.																														The Congress, on the other hand, would do well not to be carried away by its success in Assam. It would delude itself if it does not accept that it benefited mainly from the division of the opposition votes. This division clearly helped the chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, survive the anti-incumbency factor. He should know that the party had actually feared losing much more than the one seat it had lost from its 1999 tally. If he plays his cards well, the partys electoral success can strengthen Mr Gogois hands in tackling the problems he is facing from his own cabinet and party colleagues. Some of his ministers are allegedly involved in the oil theft from the Indian Oil Corporations pipelines. Both this controversy and the factionalism within the party over the coming reduction of the size of Mr Gogois ministry in accordance with the recent Union government legislation have had a debilitating effect on the state administration. Mr Gogois handling of both issues left much to be desired. He must rise above the Congresss politics, even in these good times, to get back to the business of governance.

		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 							 																						CRICKET KILLED WITH GOODWILL The India-Pakistan series is poised at one-one. Raju Mukherji wonders if this is a fallout of the goodwill both Musharraf and Vajpayee have been harping on				 	 Driving to crash																														Was the result of the first one-day international of the India-Pakistan revival series in Karachi a gift to a guest? And that of the second at Rawalpindi a return gesture on the part of the visitors?																														In the first one-dayer in Karachi, the way the Pakistani batsman, Moin Khan, moved away to the leg side and converted two wide balls into legitimate deliveries, was enough to raise a few questions. In that eventful last over, Pakistan was actually in the drivers seat and appeared to have the match in its grasp. 																														But in that absorbing over, Khan seemed to have had other, farreaching ideas. When he moved away to the leg side in an attempt to make room for himself, initially it may have appeared to make perfect cricket sense because Ashish Nehra was trying to cramp the batsman by bowling close to his body. But Khan completely missed both deliveries which passed between him and leg stump. He could not even manage to get a faint nick. Thus he not only missed two scoring opportunities but also allowed India to get away with two deliveries which were outside the line of the leg stump and were wides by any reckoning.																														Could this be a fallout of the goodwill both the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, and the Indian prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have been harping on? The two countries have been at each others throat ever since Partition. Since then, they have fought wars, have had regular border skirmishes and encouraged terrorist activities. The Bangladesh freedom struggle damaged relations still further and quite recently, the Kargil affair drew the two countries on the edge of war. So what exactly has happened to turn this eye-ball to eye-ball confrontation into a bat-and-ball contest?																														In the post-September 11 scenario, both India and Pakistan have been categorically told by the United States of America that they must improve relations with each other. Both neighbours have now realized that falling in with the American way of thinking is to their advantage. After all, there is really no point annoying a country from whom both countries need to beg and borrow. 																														It makes good political sense too. Here, however, we need to give Vajpayee his due. When the Janata Party came to power in 1977, Vajpayee, who was then the foreign minister, took the initiative to maintain friendly relations with neighbouring countries. India and Pakistan had not played for 18 years  Fazal Mahmoods Pakistan team being the last to come to India in 1960. But Vajpayee saw to it that cricket exchanges were revived and the Indian team went to Pakistan in 1978 with Bishen Singh Bedi as captain. 																														In the 1978 series, there arose a situation similar to the one at present. India snatched a four-run victory over Pakistan in the first one-dayer; in the second match, Pakistan thrashed India by eight wickets as India collapsed for just 79 runs. In the third one-dayer at Sahiwal, Bedi walked off midway through the innings, complaining that the Pakistanis were persistently bowling bumpers at the Indians! 																														Now it is the same Vajpayee who, as prime minister, has taken the bold initiative to grasp Musharrafs hand, extended in friendship. The prime minister, of course, has had to contend with his deputy, Lal Krishna Advani, whose home ministry has done its best to sabotage the series by raising the bogey of the security of the Indian players in Pakistan.																														But Vajpayee, the statesman that he is, put the ball in the court of Jagmohan Dalmiya, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. And Dalmiya once again proved that he is far more intelligent and capable than any of the politicians in India. Dalmiya managed to route the issue through the Pakistan Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council so well that the home ministry had to eat humble pie. 																														India scored a mammoth total of 349 runs in the first one-day match of the current series with the help of its fantastic batting line-up. But even 349 did not seem to be enough as our trundlers, perpetually lame and short-sighted, did their best to almost lose the match. In the end of course, thanks to Moin Khan, India got the gift due to a guest.																														In the following match at Rawalpindi, India had to lose to Pakistan so as to maintain the friendly nature of the series. When the prime minister tells the Indian captain to win the hearts of the people, the issue must be taken very seriously. Yes, the Indian bowling attack is so batsman-friendly that one need not worry about the prime ministers intentions being achieved. Even in the normal course of events, India is quite capable of losing any match despite scoring a record number of runs. 																														Now that the first two matches are over and the teams are at par, let us pray that the real cricket begins. Let us hope that from now on, the series is played in the spirit of competitive cricket and not in the spirit of gracious politics.																														The resumption of cricket between India and Pakistan, more than anything else, conclusively proves that Vajpayee and Dalmiya are the best brains in the country when it comes to administration. For this reason, it must be said that the sooner Dalmiya enters politics, the better it will be for the country. It would not be crickets loss  Dalmiya has it in him to manage both, cricket and politics, and with ease.

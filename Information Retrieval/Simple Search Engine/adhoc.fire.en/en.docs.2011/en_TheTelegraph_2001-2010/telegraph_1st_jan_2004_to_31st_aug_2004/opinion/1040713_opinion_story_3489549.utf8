		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 							 																						A HIGH PRICE TO PAY						DOCUMENT From the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention by the WHO, Geneva, 2004				 	 Accidents will happen																														The social and economic costs of road traffic injuries: In economic terms, the cost of road crash injuries is estimated at roughly 1 per cent of gross national product in low-income countries, 1.5 per cent in middle-income countries and 2 per cent in high-income countries.																														The direct economic costs of global road crashes have been estimated at $ 518 billion, with the costs in low-income countries  estimated at $ 65 billion  exceeding the total annual amount received in development assistance. Furthermore, the costs estimated for low-income and middle-income countries are probably significant underestimates...If comparable estimates were made of the direct and indirect economic costs of road crashes in low-income and middle-income countries, the total economic cost globally of road crashes would be likely to exceed the current estimate of $ 518 billion.																														Road crashes not only place a heavy burden on national and regional economies but also on households...In Kenya, for example, more than 75 per cent of road traffic casualties are among economically productive young adults. Despite the large social and economic costs, though, there has been a relatively small amount of investment in road safety research and development, compared with other types of health loss...																														There exist, however, well-tested, cost-effective and publicly-acceptable solutions to the problem. Funding for interventions, though, even in many countries most active in road safety  all of whom have targets for further reductions in casualties  has been scarce. In short, current road safety efforts fail to match the severity of the problem. Road travel brings society benefits, but the price society is paying for it is very high																														The predictability and preventability of road crash injury: One reason for the historical neglect of injury in public health is the traditional view of accidents and injuries as random events that happen to others. Such events are looked upon as an inevitable outcome of road transport. While the risk of a crash is relatively low for most individual journeys, people travel many times each day, every week and every year. The sum of these small risks is considerable. The term accident, which is widely used, can give the impression, probably unintended, of inevitability and unpredictability  an event that cannot be managed. This document prefers to use the term crash instead, to denote something that is an event, or series of events, amenable to rational analysis and remedial action.																														Many highly-motorized countries, in response to rising road trauma levels during the Sixties and early Seventies, achieved large reductions in casualties through outcome-oriented and science-based approaches...																														Experience shows that with political will and a commitment to achieve effective safety management, a rapid and significant reduction in road injuries can be achieved. The efforts required...include: a scientific approach to the topic; the provision, careful analysis and interpretation of good data; the setting-up of targets and plans; the creation of national and regional research capacity; institutional cooperation across sectors.																														The need for good data and a scientific approach: Road traffic injury prevention is a highly politicized issue. Most people have their own opinions on what could make the roads safer. Anecdotal information and its reporting by the media all too often allow issues to be understood as major traffic safety problems requiring priority action, which in turn puts pressure on policy-makers to respond. Policy decisions for effective road injury prevention need to be based on data and objective information, not on anecdotal evidence.																														Data on the incidence and types of crashes are needed. After that, a detailed understanding of the circumstances that lead to crashes is required to guide safety policy. Furthermore, knowledge of how injuries are caused and of what type they are is a valuable instrument for identifying interventions and for monitoring the effectiveness of interventions.																														In many low-income and middle-income countries, systematic efforts to collect road traffic data are not well developed and underreporting of deaths and serious injuries is common. The health sector has an important responsibility to ensure that the necessary data systems are established and that data on the main injury problems and on the effectiveness of interventions are communicated to a wider audience. Only by systematic and data-led management of the leading road injury problems will ...reductions in exposure to crash risk and in the severity of crashes be achieved.																														Road safety as a public health issue: Traditionally, road traffic safety has been assumed to be the responsibility of the transport sector, with the main focus within this sector limited to building infrastructure and managing traffic growth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 09, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A half-baked fudge				 																																																				Sir  The list of assets Sonia Gandhi and her son have declared in their nomination papers was quite a revelation (April 7). Sonia Gandhi has an ancestral house in Italy valued at Rs 12.45 lakh and a farm measuring 3 bigha in Delhi and another measuring 13 bigha in Sultanpur; each is valued at Rs 2.19 lakh. Is real estate that cheap in these places? Even a two-bedroom flat in a Calcutta suburb would cost as much as the Congress presidents ancestral house. Maybe people who want to invest in real estate should rush to these places. Rahul Gandhis declared assets, on the other hand, remain vague. He has 83 per cent shares valued at Rs 2 lakh in an infotech firm. An infotech firm with a capital base of Rs 2.4 lakh? Does he want to emulate N.R. Narayana Murthy who started Infosys with a capital of Rs 10,000. I see that he has omitted to disclose the value of his 100 shares in Intel Corp or that of his grandmothers Mehrauli farmhouse. If fudge you must, do so with a little more finesse.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Mohan Kumar Menon, Calcutta
				 																Anything for power				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitras assessment of the moral degradation of Indias present political leadership in Carnival of turncoats (April 2) is not far from the truth. Disenchanted masses in India have developed a distaste for politicians who increasingly seem devoid of all ethics, integrity and morals. Politics has become a means of quickly acquiring money and power. Even film-stars, past their prime, have joined the bandwagon to achieve these objectives. It is futile to expect a sense of decency from them. Ironically, they dare to give sermons on the subject to the public, whom they tend to take for granted. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Phani Bhusan Saha, Balurghat

				 																																																				Sir  In Carnival of turncoats, Ashok Mitra writes that in order to survive, politicians depend on compromises between belief and practice as much as between professional belief and actual practice. He cites the examples of the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, cleverly avoiding a mention of the Marxists who have also surrendered their professed beliefs  Parliament is a pig sty, Power comes out of the barrel of guns, and religion is the opium of the masses. All, as Mitra rightly says, is for survival.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

				 																																																				Sir  The shamelessness of politicians in India must make all conscientious citizens bow down their heads. But Ashok Mitras argument that in upper-crust politics, morals have become irrelevant is incomplete. Perhaps upper-crust politics needs to be qualified as the upper-crust politics which was nurtured by the upper castes who have perpetuated the caste divides in society. Incidents of caste-conflict are fairly common even today. The epics that Mitra refers to have also done their bit in preserving the caste hierarchies. The Indian upper class has finally succeeded in erasing the dividing line between decency and indecency, Mitra is right to note. But it is so in other countries as well  only in India they have been helped by the caste system. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitras criticism of Shivajis cold-blooded murder of Afzal Khan should be based on facts and not distortions. First, Mitra should note that Afzal Khan was a Bijapuri general, not a Moghul. Also, contrary to what Mitra says, mainstream history books like the New Cambridge History of India series (as opposed to Marxist interpretations of Indian history) claim that there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Afzal Khan wanted to surprise and kill the Maratha warrior. It so happened that Shivaji managed to kill him first.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  One reads the editorial pages of The Telegraph for the impartial articles written by accomplished writers. Reading Ashok Mitras Cutting corners column can therefore be considered a waste of time. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  All Ashok Mitra can do in his Friday whinnings is rail at modern-day hypocrisies. Mitra is sarcastic about the politicians who are making much of the theft of the Nobel medal in Santiniketan. But what about the leftists themselves? How could the Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority allow the land-grabbing by realtors to go unchecked, abrogating the Central legislation which gives Visva-Bharati absolute authority over the area? Has Mitra any explanations? If, as Mitra says, a secularist in the evening nowadays becomes a fundamentalist in the morning, it is also true that many from his party court the construction mafia in the evening but sing the virtues of Marxism in the morning. Mitras diatribe against globalization and the World Bank should be set against the progress a communist country like China has made in the last ten years  not by isolating itself and adhering to obsolete ideals of workers rights, but by aligning their economy with that of the world. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Probir Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																Giving a hand				 																																																				Sir  I have had a stammer since childhood. As a result of this, I had very few friends in school. Special schools for such children which could also help them overcome their speech disabilities are a good idea. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Snehashish Chowdhury, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The mannerisms of the disabled are made fun of in many television serials and movies  hurting their sentiments needlessly. The government should take steps to discourage such objectionable representations in the media. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sandip Kabiraj, Bankura

				 																																																				Sir  According to the 2001 Census, 5 per cent of Indians have some kind of disability. Sadly, very little attention is paid to their plight and even less effort is made to solve their many problems.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Joy Chakravorty, Barasat

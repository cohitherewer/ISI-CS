		 Sunday, April 04, 2004 							 																						OUT, OUT DAMN CLICHThe love for overused phrases is really a mark of laziness. Using clich eacute;s pushes a living language towards a dusty deathThe recent collection of the ten most used clichs in English is a reminder of how deadening an over-used phrase or word can be. Jim Hacker in the television serial Yes Minister noted with great perspicacity that every time his crafty departmental secretary said, With all due respect minister, he actually meant exactly the opposite. Similarly, the most dishonest or hypocritical utterance, more often than not, is prefaced by the announcement to be honest. Sentences that begin with the words in fact are only reiterating the obvious point that what follows is not fiction. Writing let us touch base is only to scratch the base of very bad writing. It is a phrase that conveys nothing to someone ignorant about baseball, a peculiar game played in the United States of America. Very few people are awake at the end of the day to hear what follows. At this moment in time, in philosophical terms, is so transient as to be non-existent. Yet it recurs in bad writing much too often. Clichs are the best signs of lazy writing. They reveal a refusal to stretch out to reach for the thesaurus. Clichs irritate the reader and thus fail to fulfil the basic purpose of language, communication.																														To clichs have been added another irritant. This is the practice, common among the young of today, to pepper a sentence with the word like. Like is the antonym of unlike or dislike. But a statement which says, I was like aghast is completely meaningless and the word like performs no function in that sentence. It is a mannerism that afflicts the speech of many. Between the devil and the deep blue sea has now been replaced in the parlance of the fashionable by between a rock and a hard place. Nowadays everybody has been there and done it. Magic, when push comes to shove, is often replaced by rocket science. Discussions are no longer on record or off the record but they are online or offline. Marketing spin doctors, who have taken over from experts, are busy establishing brand salience. And heads of companies keen on going forward encourage blue sky thinking. Agreement or consent is no longer conveyed by the word certainly but by absolutely.																														These fashions of speech, occasionally attractive when first heard or used, lose their cutting edge when used again and again irrespective of context and appropriateness. The words and phrases become exhausted through overuse and irrelevance. So many people have lost their occupation that Othellos original cry no longer moves anybody. The way of death has become dustier and dustier and as a result the undiscovered country can no longer be viewed through the blur of clichs.																														The real joy of good writing is in its freshness, in the unexpected turn of phrase. This is becoming rarer than an honest man in Indian politics. Writers strive for effect and corrupt their art by borrowing from the junkyard of copy writers and from the jargon of marketing whizz kids. E mails and SMSs have also contributed to the erosion of simple, lucid and attractive writing. English survives because it is a living language that constantly adds to its stock of words and phrases. But not all the borrowings need be permanent. It is time some clichs were shown the door.

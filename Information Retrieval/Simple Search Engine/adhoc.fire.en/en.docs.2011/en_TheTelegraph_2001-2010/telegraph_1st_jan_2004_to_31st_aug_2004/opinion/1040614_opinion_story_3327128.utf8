		 Monday, June 14, 2004 							 																						WINNING FACTOR With the Hindutva threat diluted, the performance of the DMK and AIADMK in the run-up to the assembly polls will decide their fate, writes M.R. Venkatesh Performing togetherThe astounding verdict of the Tamil Nadu electorate in the Lok Sabha has set off its own trail of events in the state. The verdict itself held out its lessons for both the losers (the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-Bharatiya Janata Party combine) as also the winners (the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-Congress-left parties-Pattali Makkal Katchi-Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-Indian Union Muslim League alliance). And it is not too late to recount them. 																														A close look at the voting pattern shows one thing  the electoral verdict was clearly an other backward classes backlash against the perceived revival of the Brahminical forces  a tag that the AIADMK-BJP alliance had unwittingly got  and the seemingly repressive and unpopular measures of Ammas government. On the downside, the results dealt a crushing blow to those who thought that soft Hindutva and Sonia Gandhis foreign origin issue, buttressed by the charisma of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and J. Jayalalithaa, could be a winning formula, even if the ruling AIADMK had been left friendless barring the BJP.																														Significantly, amidst this complex web of factors, the AIADMK, which contested 33 of the 40 seats at stake, leaving just 7 to the BJP, managed to marginally improve its vote-share  compared to the 1999 Lok Sabha polls  to 29.80 per cent. It got more upper-caste, particularly Brahmin, votes than ever before owing to its alliance with the BJP.																														However, the vote-share for the saffron party diminished from 7.14 per cent in the 1999 general elections to 5.10 per cent in 2004. This clearly points to the fact that the small, but increasingly Sanskritized, sections of the OBCs in Tamil Nadu, who had for the past six years begun to move towards the BJP as a national alternative to the Congress, have now definitely retreated.																														Add to this picture the anti-incumbency factor against Jayalalithaa and the fact that a large chunk of voters found their names struck off from the electoral rolls in many constituencies. Given the larger picture, the verdict then can be seen to speak strongly of the revival of a consolidated OBC-minorities bloc led by M. Karunanidhi under the over-arching presence of the Congress chief.																														It is here that we come to the crux of the issue: why is it that the OBCs suddenly found the DMK-led alliance more safe and attractive? Remember, the former deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, had even presided over the resolution of a long-drawn tussle over the Nadar-community-owned Tamilnad Mercantile Bank. That does not seem to have helped the BJP retain its hold on the OBCs in the southern districts.																														But the DMK, the OBC Vanniyar-based PMK and the MDMK had all been with the BJP in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections. That, technically, could not have allowed them unalloyed purity on the secularist plank. Yet, despite having been in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance for nearly five years, Karunanidhi pulled off a spectacular success within six months of quitting the NDA. Further, the victory margins in most constituencies averaged 1.50 lakh votes  no mean feat.																														The answer lies in what the peoples voting intentions have manifested. The AIADMK-BJP debacle shows that people resent any Hindutva-based domination. Jayalalithaa had begun making politically-correct noises soon after Godhra by saying that the sentiments of the majority should also be kept in mind. The Jayalalithaa governments path-breaking legislation, later in 2002, that banned forcible religious conversions, apparently with the blessings of the Kanchi sankaracharya, was a high-point in the movement towards achieving the Hindutva agenda without the saffron taint. But in the Tamil Nadu context  given the long history of the non-Brahmin movement against Brahmin domination in education and the services in the early part of the 20th century  Hindutva from being a benign booster of Hindu self-respect, suddenly transformed itself into the spectre of a return of Brahmin domination in the social and political spheres.																														In fact, the hard-hitting speeches of the DMK general secretary, K. Anbahzagan, at two key party conferences at Villupuram and Virdhunagar, sharply articulated this rising fear among the non-Brahmins (the intermediate castes-OBC-minorities bloc), who comprise 97 per cent of Tamil Nadus population. Even if parties like the DMK have watered down their ideological stance over the years, thanks to the caste-based reservation policy in the state, the identification of the BJP and its allies with the forces of Brahmanism was enough for the political change.																														And once this was associated with the authoritarian steps of Amma  the en masse dismissal of state government employees and teachers last year, the alleged misuse of the Prevention of Terrorism Act against the MDMK leader, Vaiko, and others  peoples anger turned into a silent wave against the AIADMK-BJP alliance. Whatever political cynics might now say, it is this context that has pushed the perform or perish imperative to the forefront for both the main political formations as they look towards the 2006 assembly elections in the state. 																														Perhaps Jayalalithaa had an inkling of things to come. That partly explains why she restored free supply of electricity to all categories of farmers a month before the Lok Sabha elections, and reversed some of her other much-detested ordinances, like the ban on animal sacrifices in and around temple premises. With the elections not even giving her a single seat, even in the traditional AIADMK strongholds, Jayalalithaa did a complete U-turn in almost all her reformist policies on the states fiscal front. She even revoked the controversial law banning forcible religious conversions through another ordinance.																														This shows that the poll results have dramatically altered the performance parameters for the ruling party. It is now opening the tap, as one finance department official remarked wryly, with Amma doling out one concession after another. There has already been a massive Rs 910 crore give-away through the slashing of power tariffs to the domestic household sector to December 2001 levels, ignoring the state electricity regulatory commission. Performance is now not seen as fiscal prudence, but as a means of assuaging the pain inflicted by previous reforms, even to the extent of reversing them entirely.																														The DMK and its allies too cannot ignore the performance factor, for they are all now, sans the MDMK, part of the Congress-led coalition at the Centre. If they are to take forward their Lok Sabha poll victory in any meaningful fashion, they can no longer afford to play the blame game on the Cauvery waters issue, or in other issues like getting more funds for the state, generating more employment or in their lukewarm attitude towards the oppressed Dalits.

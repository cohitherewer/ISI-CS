The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 30, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Cut out the niceties				 																																																				Sir  Purno Sangma could be said to prove that the cute Indian politician is not a contradiction in terms. But it seems that he is not finding cuteness rewarding any longer (Sangma and Sharad in clock fight, Jan 28). The battle over the clock symbol between the faction of the Nationalist Socialist Party led by Sangma and the one led by Sharad Pawar was conducted with the same viciousness and malice that one associates with political fights in this country. This sordid episode had a few revelations to make. For one, it made clear that being nice does not pay in Indian politics, unless you are the speaker of the Lok Sabha: Sangma was a great hit as speaker not least for his gentle rebukes and funny accent. For another, having national-level political aspirations while hailing from the North-east means one has to educate oneself in the unsavoury national political culture as well, as Sangma must surely have learnt by now. Have we just lost a nice guy to the dirty politics we practise?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Subarna Raha, Calcutta
				 																Money for nothing				 																																																				Sir  It is a pity that a government has to spend Rs 250 crore on commercials in order to let its people know that the country they live in is shining (Feel-good show with Rs 250 cr, Jan 19). Isnt the whole idea contradictory in itself? Had the country been shining, there would not have been the need for advertising it in the first place. The shine would have been there for everyone to see. In a country where more than half the population live in villages, there can be no development without improving the lives of rural people. Be it healthcare or social security, rural India is in the same sorry state it was in 50 years ago. A tube-well here and a few electric lines there are not signs of prosperity. Farmers and their families still starve to death in parts of India while many commit suicide. 				 																																																				The country would have been much better off if the 250 crore was spent on the development of the northeastern states, the most neglected region in the country. Also, the political establishment needs to ask itself whether it is worth spending so much on advertisements when millions of people do not have a roof over their head and a balanced diet, and millions of children are denied their right to education? 				 																																																				No matter whether the country is shining or not, by spending Rs 250 crore on advertisements, the government has ensured that the advertising houses laugh all the way to the bank.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  To check wastage of public funds on frequent elections, there should be a fixed term for the Lok Sabha. This can be achieved by electing the prime minister by secret ballot from candidates nominated by at least one-third members of the house. The same procedure could be adopted for a no-confidence motion but naming the alternative leader must be made mandatory here. 				 																																																				For a fair system, any indication by the leaders of the ruling party or coalition of early polls should be taken as a signal to begin tightening the reins so that the ruling party cannot spend government funds on publicity-campaigns. Besides being a huge waste of funds, frequent elections also hamper development projects. Assembly elections can be conducted simultaneously with Lok Sabha elections by introducing a system of auto-extension or reduction of the term of the assembly by upto one year after or before Lok Sabha elections. To avoid unnecessary by-elections too, a person must not be allowed to contest from more than one constituency or for both Parliament and assembly. A sitting member of Parliament or legislator must resign his earlier seat before filing nominations for another. Likewise, the house membership of an MP or MLA should be automatically terminated on his appointment to another house.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

				 																A foul mouthful				 																																																				Sir  It was unsporting of Javed Miandad to criticize Wasim Akram for giving bowling tips to the Indian pacer, Irfan Pathan (Im not on mission to help Indians, Jan 25). Miandads comments could easily queer the pitch for the recent efforts to resume cricketing ties between India and Pakistan. But it is possible that Miandad, the current coach of the Pakistan team, feels threatened by Indias current form. Akram, as a former cricketer, is free to offer his advice to any player, without being answerable to anyone. Even if he lends his expertise to an Indian, there is nothing unethical about it.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Javed Miandads comments about Wasim Akrams role in giving advice to Irfan Pathan is in very bad taste. Miandad went to the extent of alleging that Akram might have been offering tips to the Indian batsmen on how to combat reverse swing, the lethal weapon of the Pakistani bowling attack. Does Pakistans coach really think that Indian batsmen, now the most feared in the world, need tips on how to play reverse swing? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Zaki Mubarki, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Javed Miandads recent comments prove that he has a shrewd cricketing brain. That cannot be a crime. Even before the India-Pakistan series has started, he is trying to put the Indians under some psychological pressure. But after handling Australian cricketers and their media for over a month, I am sure Sourav Ganguly and company are more than equipped to field Miandads cheeky shots.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It was surprising to see the Pakistan Cricket Board demand various marketing rights for the Indo-Pak cricket series to be held in early March. It is clear that the near-bankrupt PCB wants to fill its coffers with the help of Indian companies. With the sacking of its marketing manager, the suspicion that the dealings are not entirely above board has come true(PCB sacks official, Jan 29). Shouldnt the PCB try to rope in sponsors from Pakistan for a tournament held in that country? Especially when the Pakistani government boycotts Hindi movies, Indian musicians, television channels and so on. The cricket board of Pakistan should not be allowed to fill up their treasury with Indian bounty. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vishwa Nath Jaiswal, Calcutta

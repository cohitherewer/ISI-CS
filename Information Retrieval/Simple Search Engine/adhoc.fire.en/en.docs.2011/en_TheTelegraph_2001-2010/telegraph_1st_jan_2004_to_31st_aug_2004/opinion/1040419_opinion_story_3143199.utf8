		 Monday, April 19, 2004 							 																						STRAINS IN THE UNIONSrinjay Chakravarti																					The European Union  one of the most powerful economic zones of the world  is showing distinct signs of strain. A mid-February summit between Europes Big Three, Britain, France and Germany, not only underscored the problems plaguing job creation and the Lisbon Agenda, but was viewed with mistrust by other strong players. Italy, the fourth largest country, was so peeved at being left out of the meeting that it described the omission as a mistake and warned of other lobbies arising within the Union. Smaller nations, too, fear the Big Three will manipulate the blocs agenda once it is enlarged. More serious was the threat faced by the Lisbon Agenda, an ambitious plan to become the worlds most dynamic economic area by 2010.																					The crux of the agenda is the issue of jobs.The aim is to get two-thirds of all potential workers in employment by next year. It is hoped that this would rise to 70 per cent by 2010. But with the world economy transforming rapidly, the goal, set up in 2000, already looks like a mirage.																					There is another crisis. The EU will expand to 25 nations on May 1 with the entry of 10 new members, mostly republics of the former USSR. Moscow has been urged to extend a uniform political and trade protocol to all the states. But Russia is reluctant to extend the existing Partnership and Co-operation Agreement paving the way for retaliatory tariffs and sanctions by the bloc vis--vis Russia. 																					Risky arena																					The EUs ties with the United States of America have also come under pressure. The bloc has already placed punitive sanctions on US goods as a result of disputes over steel import tariffs and export tax breaks. The World Trade Organisation has endorsed the EU position, ruling that the Bush administrations measures were illegal. But such retaliation would not benefit the bloc. 																					In its domestic arena too, the EUs economy is fraught with risks. Even now, the euro zone comprises just 12 nations. Italy has already blamed the introduction of the euro for high inflation while Denmark, Britain and Sweden have still not become part of the common currency. 																					But the EU charter has been stalled as countries like Spain and Poland had rejected the proposal for double majority decisions of over half the EU member states. Spain and Poland had benefited from a 2000 pact which allowed each member state a fixed number of votes despite differences in population. 																					Truant nations																					A schism has also appeared over taxation policies. An ambitious approach of harmonizing value-added taxes across the EU had to be diluted in favour of Britain and Ireland. But what is most damaging in Europes bloc is the fiscal deficits of nations like France and Germany. These two countries are well on course to breach EU rules limiting budget deficits to 3 per cent of gross domestic product for the third successive year in 2004.																					The European Commission is in a bind on whether to take legal action against the member states for bending budget rules to favour Paris and Berlin. There is a strong legal case, but economic compulsions may well win the day  the ministers encouraged Paris and Berlin not to make deeper deficit cuts that the EU executive demanded as they were emerging from stagnation. These deficit limits were designed before the 1999 monetary union to underpin the euro and prevent fiscal indiscipline. But a fast-track court battle in Luxembourg may impact on economic growth. Europes economic recovery is certainly fragile still, with Germany and France afraid to imperil it with budget cuts. 																					Nevertheless, the fiscal framework is being repeatedly undermined. If France does not tighten its belt, it will risk breaking the budget deficit cap every year till 2007. Italys nominal deficit this year will come close to the ceiling while its structurally-adjusted deficit is also showing an upward trend. There are warnings of possible budget risks in Britain, the Netherlands and Greece as well.																					Mired in structural, political and legal crises, it is doubtful if the EU will survive for long.

		 Friday, June 25, 2004 							 																						THE CESSPOOL																														The National Council of Applied Economic Research has worked out the financial implications of some of the common minimum programmes social-sector packages. For instance, over a five-year period, anything between Rs 19,000 and Rs 25,000 crore will have to be found for increasing public expenditure on education to 6 per cent of the gross domestic product and public expenditure on health to between 2 and 3 per cent of the GDP. Including material costs, Rs 68,448 crore will have to be found for the employment guarantee idea. These are not large sums of money, since every year, around Rs 54,000 crore is spent in the name of rural development, with precious little rural development to show. The problem is not resources, but delivery. The CMP proposes a cess on all Central taxes to finance the education target. Indeed, it is true that there is a difference between a cess and a surcharge, or any other form of tax. A surcharge or a tax goes into the black hole known as the Consolidated Fund of India and can be spent on whatever the government thinks fit, parliamentary scrutiny notwithstanding. Unlike that, a cess is earmarked. While this is true in a pedantic sense, money is fungible. Consequently, if a cess-financed increase in public expenditure on education occurs simultaneously with slashing non-cess-financed expenditure, thats neither here nor there. More important is the issue of delivery.																														Pointing to the cess-financed national highway development programme will not do, because there is a difference between widening existing national highways and creating rural roads. The NHDP has succeeded in the former, but not necessarily in the latter. According to the CMP, the cess is meant for basic education and that happens to be a state subject. Had administrative delivery mechanisms existed in all states, basic education would not have been in the terrible shape it is now. Reports have already appeared about the human resource development ministry salivating at the prospect of the largesse Mr P. Chidambaram is expected to dole out courtesy the cess. Universities in 250 identified backward districts will get Rs 5 crore each, unlike the present Rs 75 lakh. This is hardly basic education. The University Grants Commission and the HRD ministry argue that the CMP permits this, since 50 per cent of the money can be spent on secondary and higher education. The HRD minister has not bothered to read the CMP. Public expenditure on education will increase to 6 per cent of the GDP and half of this increase will be on secondary and higher education. However, as the next sentence in CMP makes clear, the cess will only finance basic education. So much for the cess and so much for tangible improvements in education outcomes.

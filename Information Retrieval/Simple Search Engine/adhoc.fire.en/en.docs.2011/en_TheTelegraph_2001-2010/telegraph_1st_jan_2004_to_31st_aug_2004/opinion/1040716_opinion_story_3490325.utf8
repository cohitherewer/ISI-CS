The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 16, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Sex and the city				 																																																				Sir  The good news is that Mumbai cops have decided to put a check on sex work (Crime act to fight sex trade, July 14). The bad news, however, is that the cops have decided to do this with the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, which is used against hardened criminals. Criminalizing the sex workers trade is hardly the answer. It is the product of inherent socio-economic disparities. By looking at it as a crime, the police would alienate both the sex workers and their clients. It would then be impossible for voluntary organizations to reach out to the women and provide them with options for other means of livelihood. But then, the legal custodians in India have always been known for their arcane views. Homosexuality is a punishable offence, and going by this example, presumably prostitution would be too. This too, at a time when they are on their way to being legalized in many parts of the world. Perhaps, the real reason behind the Mumbai polices crackdown on sex workers is to shelter the policemen who are hand-in-glove with the pimps.

				 																A question of degree				 																																																				Sir  As an academic, I am compelled to say a few things about the report, CM stands by pundit Sarkar, skirts PhD (July 9). The grading system in North American universities is entirely different from what we have in India. They use letter grades  the highest grade being A+  and more than one student may end up getting this grade. Contrary to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees claim, the recording system in US universities does not allow bestowing a first-class first on any student. 				 																																																				Obtaining a doctoral degree from a reputed university like the University of Chicago involves several academic steps, and usually takes four or more years. First, a student must successfully complete the course work. Second, he has to write a thesis based on scholarly research under the guidance of a professor, which is then submitted to the university while the student keeps a copy for himself. Third and most important, the student has to defend the dissertation at a public meeting convened by the university in the presence of the doctoral committee and other persons who have an interest in the topic and choose to attend. If the student is successful in this, he is awarded a doctoral degree. The diploma is usually handed over to the student at the next convocation. 				 																																																				Many students do not attend the convocation and do not pick up the diploma. It is not important that Sarkar has to have in possession the actual piece of paper that makes up the diploma. But to my knowledge, there is no scope for issuing a provisional certificate. Bhattacharjee should write to the university records department to validate Sarkars degree. If Sarkar wishes to clear his name, he should simply obtain a proof of his degree from the university and put this issue to rest.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Despite the spirited defence by the chief minister, it is difficult to believe that a US university will award Sarkar a first class first. Such ranking is unusual in American universities. Bhattacharjee evaded the issue of the doctoral degree of a man who has played around with the state educational system over the past two decades. He has deprived millions of students of the opportunity to learn English, which put them at a disadvantage in the job market. The whole episode smacks of skulduggery and needs to be investigated.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shyamali Ghose, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In the eyes of many, including our chief minister, there is no one to replace Sarkar in terms of his stature. Yet, the controversy surrounding his PhD degree shows that the name Pabitra is a misnomer. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has gone all out to defend Sarkar. No doubt the strategy now will be to expedite the process of Sarkars receiving of the PhD degree so as to take the sting out of the allegation. If the allegations against Sarkar are proved true, his offence is criminal. Because of the misdeeds of Sarkar, and Dilip Sinha before him, the reputation of the educated elite has been damaged. It is surprising that the police have been silent on this issue. Nor have lawyers or social activists filed a public interest litigation in the courts against Sarkar. This augurs ill for our society.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.K. Sen Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  An official investigation should be launched by the political and judicial authorities in order to address the following questions in the Pabitra Sarkar case: did Sarkar obtain a doctorate from a recognized university? If not, what was the stage of completion of his doctoral programme when he left the university? Did he officially describe himself  in any statement or application  as a doctorate? Did Sarkars jobs require such a degree? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Faith breached				 																																																				Sir  By strongly supporting the case for veils in the state schools in Europe, The Telegraph is openly supporting Islamic fundamentalism (Without covers, July1). The Telegraphs anti-Bharatiya Janata Party stance is well known. It even made sympathetic noises about Ishrat Hussein and the other terrorists who were killed in Gujarat recently. But how can it support the use of the veil which is derogatory to women? As a part of his reform measures the Turkish president, Kemal Ataturk, had banned veils. By supporting veils, The Telegraph has only reneged on its stance of support to the cause of secularism.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ramesh Dewan, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Without Covers, rightly says that one cannot confuse the debate of the hijab as a sign of gender oppression with the one which views it as a sign of religious fundamentalism . Secularism needs to be looked at in a manner so that its inherent complexities can be understood.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Trilok Sen, Calcutta

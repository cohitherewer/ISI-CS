With the ideology of liberalism striking root in the Eighties, the pre-eminence of the welfare state in the Anglo-American world came to an end. Since then, two domains of activity have grown and prospered  the market and the non-governmental sector. These two sectors have become crucial in an era when the state is contemplating on its own ineffectuality. Governance is now regarded as a more broad-based process which encompasses state-society interactions and partnerships. In the new lexicon of governance, the scope and relevance of the new factors like private corporations and market institutions cannot be underestimated.																														The volume under discussion aims to address the issue of good governance in democratic societies with the following objectives  one, analysis of good governance in the context of globalization; two, introduction of a comparative perspective in the understanding of the European and Indian experience; three, dissemination of information and contribution to the development of new courses on good governance. 																														The papers are presented in three inter-related parts, namely: the societal context of governance, administrative reforms and corporate governance. The volume shows that in the era of liberalization, globalization and economic deregulation, it is necessary to contextualize good governance. The essays recognize the plurality of actors involved in the process of governance and address more specifically the substance of governance. They transcend the narrow techno-economic blueprint that the World Bank provides and make a critique of this ideology which poses as neutral. The issue of good governance has also been linked to the decline of the legitimacy of the state in the last two decades. The essays thus imply that good governance has to address the issues of participation, decentralization, accountability, transparency, governmental responsiveness and the concerns of social equality and justice. 																														It was a good idea to design the volume in such a fashion so that Europe and India received almost equal attention. This not only provided the much-needed comparative perspective that is crucial to the understanding of the question of governance, but this also has the additional advantage of extending the analysis beyond the realm of the nation-state.																														The papers reflect the waning of the consensus on the pre-eminence of the state. The role of other sectors, such as the market and civil society has been recognized. Activities in these varied domains have a profound impact on the substance and the concern of governance. The editors have drawn attention to one important theme running through the papers which they call the heterogeneity thesis, which is opposed to the prevalent framework in certain influential quarters that suggest appearance of a homogeneous world. A critique is made of the homogenization thesis because its prescriptions are based on the error of simplification. Proper analysis demands recognition of complexity at the societal, institutional and corporate levels.																														The concerns of governance today are so complex and extend to so many spheres that it is not possible to resolve all the issues or intensively examine all the spheres within a span of one volume alone. It is imperative that the dialogue should continue and some more issues in the new lexicon of governance are examined. These issues are of local government, application of the rule of law, corruption in public life, regulation of private sectors and, at a theoretical level, multiple visions of the state contained in the models of governance. Such investigations can further add to the insight that this volume has provided.						PRADIP KUMAR BOSE

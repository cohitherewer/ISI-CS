The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 08, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Tiger by the tail				 																																																				Sir  Bal Thackeray did not have to tell Javed Miandad that he cannot forget the latters sixer off Chetan Sharma in Sharjah in 1986 (Sixer rankles Thackeray still, July 31). Miandad could not have thought otherwise. Thackeray seemed to be under the illusion that Miandad, and other Pakistani cricketers, played to win his heart. For a man who has never been known for his politeness, Miandad behaved exceptionally well when he met the Mumbai tiger. But then, why wouldnt he when he knows he had the last laugh when it mattered?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sumit Chakrabarti, Calcutta
				 																Cost cutter				 																																																				Sir  The Congress has always marginalized the real well-wishers of the party and let the sycophants take centre stage (Out of the Picture, July 28). Anybody who has dared to break the vicious cycle of sycophancy has been shown the door. Given this tradition, it would be difficult for Manmohan Singh to strike a different note. His colleagues know this only too well. He can hardly protest when the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh thinks that introducing reservations for Muslims in his state is a more important task than trying to prevent suicides by farmers. The communists on the other hand, are hell-bent on reversing every decision of the last National Democratic Alliance government. If the prime minister places the interest of the nation above the limited vision of his colleagues, he should begin to assert his will often.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

				 																																																				Sir  We Indians are lucky to have role models like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Manmohan Singh as our president and prime minister. Singhs insistence that his photographs should not be published in any government advertisement is hardly an expression of vanity, but of the desire to remain low-profile. He doesnt want traffic to be disturbed by his motorcade at an age when politicians need to make their presence felt by stalling traffic. No wonder the staff of the prime ministers office were puzzled by his order that bureaucrats should not go to see him off prior to his foreign trip. 				 																																																				But asking for his air ticket was taking things a bit too far. After being in politics for over 13 years, and having been the finance minister once, he surely knew that the prime minister travels in a separate aircraft for security reasons. But with Singh at the helm, we can be sure of cutting costs on the prime ministers account. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
G.D. Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Manmohan Singh deserves praise for doing away with the practice of ministers lining up at the airport to see the prime minister off before foreign trips . This should not only be a trend-setter but serve as a guideline for future prime ministers to compulsorily follow. Why did Singhs predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, never think of such austerity measures to save funds and spare inconvenience to the public? Vajpayee was also guilty of allowing large sums of money to be wasted in projecting his governments achievements in the media. Most of the publicity material also had his photo on it.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																Sleeping problems				 																																																				Sir  If a woman agrees to have sex with a man in exchange for money, it is termed prostitution, and the woman a prostitute, but if she does the same in the expectation of favours in kind, or to promote her career, how is it that she becomes a victim of exploitation and the man a rapist? Will the so-called feminists who are baying for Madhur Bhandarkars blood, kindly ponder over this?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Norma Louis, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  Madhur Bhandarkar should be black-listed in Bollywood for life, so that no one dares to repeat what he has done.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

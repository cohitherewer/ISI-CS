The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 05, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Good intentions go up in smoke				 																																																				Sir  May 31 is celebrated the world over as No tobacco day. Yet, on that very day The Telegraph had a picture of Shah Rukh Khan smoking a cigarette on the front page (Badshah at durbar and dinner, May 30). As if that was not enough, page 10 too had a picture of Winston Churchill smoking a cigar (The high horse of free will). Such pictures can well end up promoting smoking among the younger generation, considering the larger-than-life image of the popular actor and the former British prime minister. Should not The Telegraph too be a part of the global drive to help people quit smoking? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Anirban Laha, Calcutta
				 																																																				Sir  The drama over Kaizad Gustads lies to the police about what caused the death of his assistant, Nadia Khan, is starting to resemble a Hindi potboiler (Lie in panic ties Gustad down, June 3). Gustad may be telling the truth when he says that his initial testimony that Khan had been hit by a truck was a short cut to save on procedural delays so as to get medical aid for Khan as fast as possible. Or he may have been trying to hide the fact that he had not taken permission to shoot on the stretch of the railway tracks where the accident took place. 				 																																																				But Gustad could not even have dreamt how his life would change as a result of a lie. Its ludicrous, though, that the director of films like Boom and Bombay Boys should be so nave. And what made him think that he would get away with it? Even if the lie was on humanitarian grounds, no one is above the law. It is good that Khans relations are being so persistent in seeing to it that justice is done. After all, Khan was no ordinary spot-boy. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia 

				 																																																				Sir  The death of Nadia Khan after being run over by a passing train brings to mind how a few years ago, Aamir Khan had almost lost his life while shooting for Ghulam near a suburban Mumbai railway station. 				 																																																				The Indian Railways should have strict laws prohibiting film-shooting or crowding in or around railway tracks. In all cases, it should be mandatory to take permission for any shooting activity, which should be allowed only during off-peak hours when traffic is light				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul 

				 																																																				Sir  Earlier, it was only the producers of Kaizad Gustads films who ran into trouble when his films flopped. His last film, Boom, was a complete washout. But the current incident shows how too much cleverness can lead to trouble. His present problems must at least teach Gustad not to lie  or, at any rate, to look before he leaps. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Poison drops				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Angry man (May 29), exposes the hollowness of the achievements of the Left Front during its nearly three decades of uninterrupted rule over West Bengal. That Montaj Sheikh pronounced talaaq not thrice but seven times on his wife for allowing a health worker to feed their child polio drops, and that the unskilled labourer from Murshidabad district had sired nine children with another one in the offing, depicts a pathetic picture of life in the villages. Nothing has changed so far as poverty, illiteracy, prejudices, religious bigotry, ill-treatment of women, family planning are concerned  rather the state seems to have regressed. One wonders what has been the role of the much-publicized panchayats in this regard and what our progressive chief minister is going to do about such instances of failures on multiple fronts. But perhaps he can hardly be expected to antagonize the minority vote bank.Yours faithfully 
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 				 																																																				Sir  Polio drops are an important weapon in the governments fight against the dreaded disease. But the lack of awareness among some sections of the Muslim community have, for some strange reason, led them to be suspicious of the drops. The government should take steps to reassure them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 																																																																														 This years general elections promise to be worse than the Cola-wars  going by the number of Bollywood stars who have arraigned their magnetic strengths alongside those of the two principal contenders. The BJP has, until now, been the most proactive and successful in drafting the stars into doing war on its behalf  Vinod Khanna, Shatrughan Sinha, Hema Malini, Dara Singh, plus lesser stars like Smriti Malhotra (Tulsi of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi-fame) and Sudha Chandran. The saffron party is now all set to add another arrow in its quiver  Dharmendra. With his beautiful wife setting pulses racing in the Rajya Sabha, Hindi filmdoms original He Man is thinking of contesting the elections on a BJP ticket. At any rate he has agreed to campaign for the party, which means the BJP can be sure of at least an initial draw in the Jat belts of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and UP. And if Dharmendra leads, wont Sunny and Bobby Deol be in the supporting cast? 				 																																													The more-than-a-hundred-years-old Congress, on the other hand, is eyeing the younger lot of actors and might just have an ace up its sleeves in the form of the reigning Bollywood king, Shahrukh Khan. The Delhi-based actor had a tte--tte with Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra at a special screening of his Kal Ho Naa Ho at which he apparently said he would help out the party. Besides, the party is also talking to Aishwarya Rai, Govinda and Preity Zinta, among others. 				 																																													But the surprise entry into politics this year might be that of Jaya Bachchan. Rumours say Amar Singh has persuaded her to contest as the Samajwadi Partys candidate from Allahabad, the constituency her husband won in 1984. After all, the Big B might have sworn off electoral politics, but theres nothing to prevent him from doing his bit for his wife  and of course Mulayam Singh Yadavs party in Uttar Pradesh. The stars, it seems, are too much with us. 				 																																																																														 Theres more to a bicycle than two wheels and a handle-bar  ask N Chandrababu Naidu. The humble bicycle is not only his partys election symbol, but the tech-savvy Andhra CM also likes to zip around Hyderabad in it  probably to underline his concern for the man on the street. So it was only natural that he would bicycle his way to a public meeting, during a pre-election visit to the Rajahmundry district. So off went Naidu, huffing and puffing for four kilometres. But even as he went into harangues about his governments achievements and promising the voters the moon, someone niked his bicycle, parked nearby. When Naidu got down from the podium, thirsty but satisfied, he discovered his cycle was gone. Red-faced, the CM could only make a weak joke about how some TDP supporter must have borrowed the cycle for a joy ride. He had taken the CM for a ride at any rate!				 																																																																														 Mamata Banerjee is a great one for appearances. In public, the left is her sworn enemy and she will pillory them, call bandhs against them and crib about them to sympathetic ears in New Delhi. But in private, she is the very embodiment of polite and bhadra behaviour. Banerjee was standing in the queue for passengers boarding a flight at the Delhi airport recently when she saw Biman Bose and Anil Biswas. And insisted that they go in before her  na, na, apnara aamar theke onek senior, apnara age jaan. Now we know why few believe anything didi says!				 																																																																														 The coming elections are driving everyone crazy. In Punjab, it has driven Parkash Singh Badal, the venerable Akali Dal leader, to seek refuge in Ram. He has taken to signing off his meetings with a Jai Shri Ram instead of a Sat Sri Akal. At least in the constituencies which have a Hindu majority. Thats what happens when an Amarinder Singh sets the police on you!				 																																																																														 If Badal is feeling shaky, the BJP seems to be suffering from the foolhardiness of too much confidence. Or why would it shift Vijay Goel from Chandni Chowk, from where he has won twice, to the untried and untested Sadar Bazar? Goel was a particularly energetic MP who managed to clean up the area around the Red Fort and restored many old and crumbling havelis in the walled city, besides managing his duties as Union minister of state for sports and youth affairs and also penning two books. More important, he was popular among the one-lakh-strong minority voters in the constituency. So why is the BJP shifting him? Does it think that three is unlucky?				 																																																																														 Uma Bharti is having a blast as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh . The other day, she was flying high in her official helicopter when she spotted a sugarcane field. The memory of the sweet taste of gur made even the sadhvi CMs mouth water. The CMs wish being the pilots command  naturally  the chopper made an unscheduled stop. Uma got down, had her fill and flew off. Such are the small luxuries of office!				 																																																																														 The making or unmaking of Sonia Gandhi? While the Nehru-Gandhi bahu seems to be getting more confident in public  being able to hold her own in front of roving telly lenses, chatting up nosy journalists with remarkable ease  she also seems to be getting more insecure. Or are we just reading the indigenization wrong? Sonia is believed to have completely given herself up to the control of the astrologer who once predicted the death of her famous mother-in-law. Sonia herself was apparently instrumental in hunting out this astrologer from obscurity after her accidental discovery of his prediction of the assassination in a forgotten drawer. From then on, there has been no looking back. Sonias recent confinement for a week on the pretext of ill-health was supposedly on his advice. The launch of her children into politics is also being held up as being because of this man. The famous astrologer is also believed to have predicted that the good times for AB Vajpayee is over. Although that doesnt mean the good times for Sonia has automatically begun, but who will tell madam that?

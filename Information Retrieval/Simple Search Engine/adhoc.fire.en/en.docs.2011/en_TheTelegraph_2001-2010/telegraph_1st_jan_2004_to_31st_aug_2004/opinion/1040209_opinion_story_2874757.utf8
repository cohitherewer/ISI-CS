		 Monday, February 09, 2004 							 																						OLD STORY Hope is an unfamiliar feeling  where violence against women is concerned. Even an appearance  of change turns out to be just that, an appearance. In Bankura  recently, the eighteen-year-old daughter of a vegetable-seller  was raped by the young man of the house in which she was  employed as domestic help. Since she became pregnant, the  police, who had received a complaint from the girls  father, and the neighbours, compelled the young man to marry  her. Within forty-eight hours, her husband took her to a  quack who carried out an abortion. He has apparently disappeared  since, and his father, an influential man in the locality,  has returned the girl to her parents. He allegedly dismissed  the marriage, but said he would pay for the girls  recovery. This is a complicated sequence of events. The  initial act of violence is common enough, as is the power  equation it exposes. Women working as domestic help are  always at risk of sexual abuse. What is different about  this incident, and reason for hope, is that the violence  was not followed by the usual silence. The girls father  went to the police and some action was taken. It is the action that was dubious.  The police and the administration worked towards an understanding  and the neighbours joined in. The offender was made to marry  the victim. Thus the violence was compounded by giving it  social acceptability through marriage. The question of punishing  the rapist by law was cunningly evaded. The offenders superior  social position ensured that he would not be brought before  the law for raping a vegetable-sellers daughter. For the  girls family, such a marriage was compensation enough.  It also saved the family from the stigma of harbouring a  raped and unmarried girl. The girl herself, and the violence  done to her, were never issues during the negotiations.  She had to be erased, got rid of, in the most decorous way  possible, with some lip service to justice. The whole point  was to leave social arrangements undisturbed. There is nothing  surprising about the outcome. By not bringing the rapist  to justice, the administration helped in the perpetration  of another crime. Without a complete reorientation of social  attitudes, the law will remain helpless.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 							 																						STAGE FRIGHT																														What the left believes is dependent on who the speaker is for the left. If a party functionary is advocating the lefts cause then, pound to a penny, he will be vituperative against liberalization and the budget formulated by the finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram. But if the speaker were the chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the tone would be different, the criticism absent. Mr Bhattacharjee may not be an open advocate of the free market, but he is as keen to get investment for West Bengal as Mr Chidambaram is for India. The left maintains a distinction between the party and the government. This separation may not be all that evident in the way the Communist Party of India (Marxist) runs the state of West Bengal, but it is obvious in the various pronouncements about the Indian economy that emanate from left cloisters. The other way to look at the situation is to see the left as being driven to schizophrenia by the Indian economy and its prospects. If the CPI(M) party idealogues are sincere about their criticism regarding economic reforms, the logical step would be to launch a critique of the policies of Mr Bhattacharjee. Criticism, like charity, is best when begun at home. That would also drive home the point about the lefts sincerity about maintaining the separation between the party and the state.																														The reality is, however, a trifle disconcerting for the left because the latter rides today on a monumental bluff or a dilemma. It is clear to the left that it cannot withdraw support to the present Congress-led government. To do that would be to invite the Bharatiya Janata Party back to power. The left has to work with the Congress. Mr Bhattacharjee was unbuttoned about this. The suave and articulate politburo member of the CPI(M), Mr Sitaram Yechuri, was not that straightforward, but said more or less the same thing when he declared that the left would criticize the Union budget but would not introduce any cut motions. Such statements should allow Mr Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, to breathe more easily. But they should also make the prime minister realize that his majority is not fragile at all. The left will fulminate and champ, but will continue to lend its support to the government. After a long wait, the left believes that it has secured its hour upon the stage. It will strut and fret and, at times, be full of sound and fury. But all this will signify nothing. The lefts political options are severely limited. The sooner it accepts this and allows good governance to continue, the better for the country and for the lefts own diminishing goodwill.

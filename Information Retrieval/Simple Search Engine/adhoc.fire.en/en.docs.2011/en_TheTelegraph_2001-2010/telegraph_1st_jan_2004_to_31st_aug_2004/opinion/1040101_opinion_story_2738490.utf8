																								If the time for poll alliances comes, Mr Harkishen Singh Surjeets season cannot be far behind. It is not easy, however, to make out what kind of alliances the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is striving to strike up this time. On the face of it, he is working again to put together a third front of parties opposed to both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress. It is an old game, but then the octogenarian Marxist leader has known and played only this game over the past decade or so. The fact that it has not taken either Mr Surjeet or the so-called third front anywhere has done little to deter him. It is not surprising, therefore, that even this time Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, the first potential ally Mr Surjeet tested, wondered what the third front was all about. This does not quite look to be a promising start for the CPI(M) veterans brave new attempts to revive the old idea. But scepticism of potential allies is only one side of Mr Surjeets problems. He faces a knottier problem within the left and other parties which remain suspicious of the real motives behind Mr Surjeets maneouvres. 																								The suspicion basically is that Mr Surjeet may be talking of a third front but is actually working at the behest of the Congress. That Mr Surjeet began working overtime on alliance-making after a conversation with Mrs Sonia Gandhi should clear all doubts on this score. The real thing that Mr Surjeet cannot hide is that the left parties and their allies that are anxious to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party have little choice but to support the Congress before or after the next general elections. Even if Mr Surjeet is somehow able to cobble together the semblance of a third front, it too will have little option but to go the way of the Congress. Precisely the same scenario emerged in 1996 and much the same thing is likely to happen this time too. Some leaders of Mr Surjeets own party, like Mr Jyoti Basu, have, therefore, advocated a policy of open support to the Congress rather than going the circuitous way of the third front. The CPI(M) can go on splitting hairs on the difference between supporting the Congress and joining it in a front. But the two will mean one and the same thing to the people. No matter how much his party wants space for a third force, there is no escaping the fact that national politics has become bipolar. The smaller parties can be effective only as partners in either of the two alliances led by the BJP and the Congress. It might help Mr Surjeets  and the Congresss  cause to come clean on alliance-making.

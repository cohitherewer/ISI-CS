The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 09, 2004  Paperback Pickings The rhythmic creak of the punkaThe veil of illusion (Penguin,  Rs 495) by Rebecca Ryman is quite a tome, and  is written, under pseudonym, by a writer who was born and  raised in India, and died in Calcutta last year. It is a  Raj saga in the Far Pavilions and Jewel  in the Crown mode, and is a sequel to Rymans earlier  Olivia and Jai. Set mostly in Calcutta of the 1870s,  Ryman picks up her thread with the lives of Amos and Maya,  the children of Olivia and Jai, living in the shadows of  the past. The plot grips, but the atmospherics are predictable:  In spite of the blazing day outside  or perhaps because  of it  the heavy curtains were drawn tightly across the  bay window and the bedroom was bathed in gloom. In the silence,  the rhythmic creak of the punka sounded like the mournful  chirp of a starling stranded somewhere among the rafters. Osho: Secrets of yoga (Penguin,  Rs 250) edited by Prem Chinmaya and Bodhitaru is  a commentary of sorts on Patanjalis philosophy, and an  entertaining DIY manual of inner peace and harmony. There  are funny anecdotes with profound import, and an invitation  to the Osho meditation resort with gourmet vegetarian meals  (with organically grown produce) and a nightlife alive with  friends, music and dancing. Sample nugget: A flat-chested  woman simply becomes unattractive. Why? What is wrong? Nothing  is wrong with the woman; something is wrong with the mind.Captives: Britain, empire and  the world, 1600-1850 (Pimlico,  5.20) by  Linda Colley is a fascinating study of those hundreds  of English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish men, women and children  who were taken captive in different regions of the extra-European  world during the first quarter millennium of British imperial  enterprise. Colleys sources are virtually unexplored writings  and drawings, and she combines the panoramic and the global  with the individual and the particular. The various sections  of the book focuses on north Africa and the Mediterranean,  mainland North America, south and central Asia respectively.  The experience of captivity  from the point of view of  both the captives and their captors  forms the underbelly  on British empire. Colleys study deals with the penalties  and paradoxes of the pursuit of global dominance, not just  for those encroached upon and invaded, but also for the  invaders themselves, the warriors who so easily became captives  in one fashion or another. This is Emily Edens 1841 painting  of four Afghan captives in Barrackpore.

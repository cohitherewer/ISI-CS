				 																																	 Considering hes already relived his prison days once while writing Prisoner FF8282s Prison Diary, Lord Jeffrey Archer isnt keen on doing it again. Archers account of his 22 days at Belmarsh, one of Britains highest-security prisons, is to be adapted into a play called Hell by British actor-turned-dramatist James Rayment. Archer has blessed the script that will show the world how he got strip-searched on entering the jail and his encounter with drug dealers. But hes declined the producers request to play himself. Actor Andrew Macbean, 47, will play Archer in the play which premieres at the Edinburgh Festival. Heres hoping the jailhouse diary rocks.Neha Dubey				 																																	Like mom, like daughter. Actress Lilette Dubey can now wallow in daughter Nehas successes. Ms Dubey Jr is all set to play Olivia in Shakespeares Twelfth Night, to be directed by Phil Cameron and staged at Londons famed West End from July. The play itself will be given an Asian flavour, and Neha fits in perfectly. She sure has moved on from the two-bit roles that she played for films like Monsoon Wedding (where her crowning glory was a remixed dance number) to alternative films, like Sau Jhoot Ek Sach, where she plays a hunchback, and Anjan Duttas Bow Barracks Forever. And she, like everyone else, is only interested in meaningful roles now. So whats new? Rashid Khan				 																																	 Ustad Rashid Khan isnt one of those who turn up their noses at music churned out of Bollywood. In fact the classical singer is all set to make a debut. Khan has rendered a song for Subhash Ghais soon-to-be-released flick Kisna. And this, after he refused to lend his voice to Rituparno Ghoshs Raincoat. Well, theres always a first time.

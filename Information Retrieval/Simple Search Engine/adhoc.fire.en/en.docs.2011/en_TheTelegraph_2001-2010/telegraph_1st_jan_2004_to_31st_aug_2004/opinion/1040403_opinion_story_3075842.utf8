The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 03, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Scaling forbidden heights				 																																																				Sir  As Richard Desmond got rid of the pornographer tag, Aroon Maharajh pinned it on his lapel happily (Asian Babes in Asian hands, March 31). Unlike Desmond, a product of a liberal first-world society, Maharajh hails from an orthodox Hindu Brahmin (albeit non-resident Indian) family. Isnt this a perfect example of the biggest challenge to orthodoxy coming from within? But Maharajh, by his own admission, brings into the soft-porn trade a business-like attitude, and this must be a good thing. We simply have to stop looking at proprietors of adult magazines ( la Hugh Hefner) as decadent and corrupt individuals.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Neela Roy, Calcutta
				 																Variety show				 																																																				Sir  The foray of celebrities of yesteryear into the political arena makes one wonder if Indian politics is where performers past their prime are given a new lease of public life. That is certainly the perception of most of these new entrants. Unfortunately for them, records show that instead of lifting their sagging careers, this exercise leads to a drastic downslide in their popularity graphs.				 																																																				Bhupen Hazarika, for instance, is finding that he is losing more admirers of his music than he is gaining supporters of his politics. Politics has taken the sheen off the dream-girl, Hema Malini. Sidhuisms emerging from the political forum do not amuse Indians as they did when they came out of the commentary box. Most feel that Nafisa Ali would have served more people through her social work than she will by fighting elections. People laugh at Govinda these days not because he is funny but because he cuts a sorry figure as a politician. 				 																																																				What does politics have in it that tempts men who have already tasted popularity? Is it just the lure of power and pelf? That would explain why a large section of Indians is slowly turning its back on its political class. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
H. Krishna V, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Does the participation of non-political personalities in it diminish the appeal of an election? To some extent, yes. Particularly in the case of filmstars and sportsmen. Can one imagine the consequences if Albert Einstein decided to join politics? It is impossible to believe that Indian politics, given the way it functions, still inspires people to join it with the intention of serving the country. Persons who are already catering to popular demands in some way or the other should not waste their energies on politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nupur Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sumana Ghosh, in her letter, takes several digs at Dharmendra most of which are in poor taste (Man of the masses, March 27). Contrary to her claim that Sholay is Dharmendras only film to be remembered, Bandini, Haqeeqat, Anupama, Mamta, Chupke Chupke and many others have been, and still are, appreciated by discerning audiences, even in the cities.				 																																																				As far as the charge of bigamy is concerned, I fail to understand how that matters. Dharmendras second wife, Hema Malini, is surely empowered enough to resist exploitation. At least, give the man his due for acting on his beliefs, without fear of the consequent opprobrium from the hypocritical chattering classes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
G. Singh, Durgapur

				 																																																				Sir  In the run-up to the 14th Lok Sabha elections, filmstars are clearly being prioritized over politicians. Several veteran politicians have been denied tickets because some film-star has joined the party at the last minute. Is it possible that a person from the glamour world, with no prior experience in politics, can serve the masses better than one who has been in public service for years? Film-stars only want politics as a back- up career. But why should political parties woo these do-gooders?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Birkha K. Duvarseli, Siliguri

				 																																																				Sir  Govinda is playing his cards so well that his venture into politics could become the turning point in his life. Just when his film career was tottering, he has found an alternative career in politics. His mass appeal was never in question, now his strategic moves of travelling second-class and scaling the Jeevdani Mata Mandir have made him more popular than ever with the masses. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Gupta, Bandel

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 							 																						THINK BEFORE A STRIKE Raju Mukherjee																					A bold headline, Batsmans task more difficult now, greeted cricket-followers a few days back. The quotation was attributed to Indias master batsman, Sachin Tendulkar, who apparently believes that technological advance has changed the complexion of the game, making the task of a batsman difficult. There is no doubt that the game has undergone a lot of change with the introduction of contemporary technology. But when Tendulkar says that batting today has become more difficult as a result of it, it is difficult to believe him.																					Todays batsmen play on covered pitches, totally unaffected by rain or dew. They do not have to face the difficulties of batting on wet, uncovered wickets where almost every delivery would either leap or slither. They have the advantage of wearing helmets, arm-guards, elbow-guards and so on. Never have they been asked to play fearsome pace without protective equipment. Todays batsmen are fortunate that leg theory and bodyline bowling have been banned. Intimidatory bowling too is frowned upon by umpires. At the most, they have to contend with two bumpers per over. 																					Then how exactly has batting become more difficult today in comparison to that in the Sixties and the Seventies? It seems that Tendulkar feels so because bowlers can use the latest technological support systems like software development and camera improvement in order to spot the weaknesses of batsmen. But in that case, the opposite is also true  the batsman can use the same technology to locate the deficiencies of the bowler. Technological advance thus gives the same advantage to both. 																					Uphill task																					It is indeed unfortunate that a player of Tendulkars class should come out with such an absurd notion. Is he, by any chance, then trying to place his own generation ahead of the Trumpers, the Bradmans and the Gavaskars? Hope not.																					But why is Tendulkar getting unduly worried? No serious cricket-follower has ever doubted the modern greats. Why should they? There is no reason to think that Brian Lara, Aravinda DSilva, Inzamam-ul-Haq are in any way inferior to the Hammonds, the Harveys and the Headleys. Cricket, like any other sport, has undergone changes and further changes will surely take place in the days ahead. Changes, however, do not necessarily mean progress. Change is mere evolution, a reflection of the contemporary scenario. Nothing more, nothing less. A short example would make the issue more clear.																					Modern mountaineers may have sophisticated equipment to climb the highest of peaks quicker, but that does not mean that the achievements of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay must be depreciated. At the same time, the modern mountaineer cannot be disregarded just because he has modern technology to aid and assist him. His achievement is as creditable as that of the first Everest heroes. Different generations of climbers have merely used different sets of equipment that were available to them.																					Always great																					Tendulkar should understand the import of the words he speaks. Millions pick up the words that come out of his mouth and regard them as sacred text. Such is the faith in this great batsman that anything he utters instantly becomes the last word on the subject. So it would make more sense if Tendulkar thinks clearly before opening his mouth. He ought also to realize that every generation of batsmen has had its own problems. None has it any easier than the others before or after him. 																					The best alternative is to see a real champion of one era as a champion in a different era as well. If Tendulkar were playing in the Thirties, he would have combated leg theory, intimidatory bowling, uncovered pitches just as Don Bradman would have had no difficulty at all with modern-day software technology, crowd pressure, sponsorship deals and so on. There is little to be gained from claiming that modern-day batsmen have a more difficult task. This is plainly untrue and would merely give millions a wrong impression of the past greats of cricket.

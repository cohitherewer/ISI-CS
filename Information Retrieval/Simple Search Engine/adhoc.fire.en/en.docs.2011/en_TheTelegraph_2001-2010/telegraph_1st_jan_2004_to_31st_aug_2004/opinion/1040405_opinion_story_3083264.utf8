The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 05, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Declaration drama 				 																																																				Sir  Indias first innings declaration at Multan after the fall of Yuvraj Singhs wicket when Sachin Tendulkar was on 194 shows that Indian cricket is finally becoming professional. It was the right step and signalled to the opposition that the Indian bowlers were out to win this test. Tendulkars statements, on the other hand, reveal a deplorable lack of team spirit and discipline. A person of his experience should have known that the declaration was likely since the fall of a wicket would reduce the tempo of scoring. As it is, it was Singh who had kept up the scoring rate. Tendulkar should reflect on Rodney Marshs equanimity when his captain declared when he was on 92 and about to become the first wicket-keeper to score a test hundred or on Mark Taylors declaration when he could have broken the record of highest test innings by an Australian. Only an overwhelming desire to win can make us world-beaters; sadly, the Tendulkars fall short on this criteria.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,N.G. Haksi, Ranchi
				 																																																				Sir  There was a lot of unnecessary hoopla in the media over Rahul Dravids declaring the innings on the second day of the Multan test. As captain, Dravid had the authority to decide when to declare. While its true that Sachin Tendulkar was deprived of yet another record, has everybody forgotten the innumerable times that Dravid has steered India out of trouble without the slightest desire of achieving milestones of his own? This episode might show the difference between Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid  both undoubtedly great cricketers  one plays for himself yet wins all the accolades, while the other plays for his country but is yet to get the commensurate laurels. Also, it is not right to keep referring to Dravid as the stand-in captain  he was the official captain for the Multan test, as he will be for the second one since The Telegraphs favourite Calcuttan, Sourav Ganguly, is down with an injury.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Isha Shah, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  What happened on the second day of the Multan test could have been avoided easily. Undoubtedly, no individual is bigger than the game. But just two more overs could have given Sachin Tendulkar the chance of getting into the record books. In television interviews, the experts were critical of Tendulkars comments at the early declaration, going so far as to say that he had started to feel insecure over Virender Sehwag. No doubt, Sehwag played a great innings, and cricket lovers in India must wish that he plays many more such innings, so that the team can put up scores of this kind which will make it a force to reckon with in the future. But such comments about a cricketer of Tendulkars calibre, or indeed about anyone, can be harmful for the team spirit.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Rahul Dravids untimely declaration in the Multan test has raised many eyebrows. After all, anything that hurts Tendulkar, hurts the nation. Dravid became a villain overnight. But what if the batsman at the receiving end had been Yuvraj Singh and not Tendulkar? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhobrata Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  By going public with his disgruntlement, Sachin Tendulkar has proved that he plays for records. Only a year or so ago, his strike rate used to be above 90, but now it has come down to below 50. He took 201 balls to reach his hundred in Multan. Sehwag was making runs at that time but despite having been at the crease for so long, Tendulkar did not try to accelerate the pace. That was left to Yuvraj Singh. As for Tendulkars statement that he was never told to accelerate, he is the seniormost member of the side and should have taken the initiative, Dravid and the team management must be congratulated for their stance.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  From the television coverage, it was evident that Sourav Ganguly forced the early declaration on Rahul Dravid. Ganguly himself has been unable to perform in this entire series and he pulled back someone well on the way to creating records and that too in Pakistan. This has shaken the nations faith in Gangulys captaincy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  When it comes to Indo-Pak cricket, its only natural to be superstitious. Every time Sachin Tendulkar has scored a double hundred (217 against New Zealand, 201 versus Zimbabwe and 241 against Australia), all of which were scored in the first innings, India has lost. Perhaps, by stopping Sachin Tendulkar from getting another doublen ton, Rahul Dravid wanted to be safe rather than sorry. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Much has been said about Indias extraordinary performance in Pakistan. But what came as a pleasant surprise was the way the team handled the section of the Indian media and intellectuals over the gossip about match-fixing or Rahul Dravids declaration when Sachin Tendulkar was at 194  by completely ignoring them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sankar Majumdar, Guwahati 

				 																																																				Sir  In the present instance, it would be out of tune to say that the interest of the team should be kept above personal aspirations. Those who endorse the decision to declare either lack a sense of self or are simply pretenders who feel that it is a value-less commodity. I remember how Indian bowlers bowled wayward deliveries to help Anil Kumble pick up the 10th wicket when Pakistan last played in India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

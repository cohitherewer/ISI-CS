		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 							 																						LIVING ON THE EDGE Amlashol will recur if the relationship between the gov- ernment and the people continues to be one between the helper and the helped, writes Ashis Chakrabarti				 	 To cook up another protest																														So, youve come to see the Ethiopia of India, J.B. Patnaik, then chief minister of Orissa, told me. In 1986, the famine and starvation deaths in Ethiopia shocked the world. It was also the year India was shocked by stories of starvation deaths in Orissas arid Kalahandi district. But to Patnaik, it was all a creation of a sensation-starved media. Kalahandi, he thought, was doing no better or worse than usual. 																														In 1998, when I visited some districts of Andhra Pradesh to write a series of reports on the cotton farmers suicides, a district official at Warrangal had much the same thing to say. Journalists would do anything to create a story out of a non-story, the official  an old acquaintance from his days in Tripura  mildly chided me. 																														The good Marxist that he is, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee knows poverty and starvation are facts of life  even in West Bengal, which his Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its allies have been ruling for 27 years. 																														What he does not like is the media showing him the ugly picture. His party does not accept what the media sees and shows. The chief minister accepts that conditions of starvation exist in Amlashol in West Midnapores Belpahari area, but is not sure if the medias allegation of five deaths from starvation in the village is true. His party is, however, sure that it is not; it is convinced that the deaths are from diseases caused by malnutrition and lack of basic medical care. 																														One has heard the official  and the party  argument before, more recently, over allegations of starvation deaths in some tea gardens in north Bengal. 																														Its possible that what the chief minister and his party leaders have said about the Amlashol deaths are true. To be fair to them, they have admitted to the prevalence of starvation, malnutrition, diseases and lack of basic healthcare in areas like Amlashol. Its also possible that at least two of Amlashols victims died, not of starvation, but of diseases. 																														But the point is that Bhattacharjees reaction betrays an affliction that desensitizes all those in power. Like Patnaik and the district official at Warrangal, he would not accept starvation to be the cause of these deaths. It is sad for people to live in such conditions, he seems to be arguing, but how could they die because of them? 																														It is this strange refusal to face facts or the arrogance of seeing them only their own way that is so common to governments and other powerful people. The reason is obvious  no king likes to be stripped in public of his clothes or of trappings. 																														The problem is that both the government and its critics get their acts wrong in such situations and thereby pass the real issues by. 																														If the government is anxious to deny that these are starvation deaths, the opposition Congress and the Trinamool Congress want cooked food and other relief material to be rushed to Amlashol. Some others want the government to start schemes like food-for-work to reach places like Amlashol as soon as possible so that the poor people have something to eat in order to live. 																														In all this, a solution is sought in the governments role as the giver or the provider of relief. One does not have to know rural Bengal too well or the working of the government too closely to predict that all this help will only be temporary or ad hoc, and that this will do very little to keep the people from starvation, malnutrition or the diseases. 																														The rub lies precisely in this approach. This makes the poor people of backward areas like west Midnapore perennially dependent on dole, whether from the government or from other agencies. The result is the perpetuation of conditions which make these people live on the edge of starvation. Only when they die of living like this and news of such deaths creates a little stir, they can expect to get an ad hoc supply of some help. Then the newspaper story dies down  to the relief of powers that be  and the untold story of starvation and other basic deprivations carries on. 																														It is not usually asked why these people  or any people for that matter  must live and die at the mercy of government dole. Why cannot they make a living, tolerable if not prosperous, on their own? Why cannot Amlashol feed itself even after 27 years of left rule in West Bengal? 																														There has been one answer to such questions about Amlashol. It has been said that the poor people of the village, which is actually a forest dwelling, have been badly hit this time because the government banned middlemen collecting tendu leaves out of the area in its anxiety to keep it out of bounds for the Naxalites. 																														Its possible that the government blockade hurt more than usual. But, as a Telegraph story of 1994 showed, the areas starvation story is old and is not specific to any particular event, political or otherwise. The traders of tendu leaves did their usual business in 1994, yet the people starved and died of starvation. Even without any interference by the government in their daily lives, they ate ant eggs when they had little else to satisfy their hunger with. 																														That really is at the heart of the matter. Even a people-friendly left government interfered too little to change certain things for the poor tribals in places like Amlashol. While their traditional way of living off the forest produce was severely sabotaged by greedy middlemen from outside, the government and other institutions did not do enough to change their old ways and to empower them to emerge into new ways.																														This is a problem common to tribal populations living close to forests in most parts of India. It is all very well to cry foul over the starvation deaths in Amlashol, but to remedy situations like this it is extremely important to understand the story of the exploitation in the tendu leaf trade. 																														I am not surprised, therefore, that the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance Government has given high priority to conferring ownership rights in respect of minor forest produce, including tendu patta, on all those people from the weaker sections who work in the forests. Those who lived by forest produce were always poor  in Bengal or elsewhere, but they did not starve and die until the greedy traders came and robbed them of their meagre meals. 																														But what, you could ask, do the Bengals famed panchayats do? The answer is they do little to address the fundamental problems. Even the communists are too conservative to change traditional social mores; they fear that upsetting old social ways would alienate them politically from their votebanks. So a middle path is followed, in which panchayats become providers of small relief in exchange for political support, while the poor are left to live off the forests which make traditional living increasingly unsustainable.																														All governments are unreliable, inadequate givers at the best of times. The Amlashol story will keep repeating itself as long as the relationship between the government and the people remain one between the helper and the helped. The key to end the conditions of starvation is a major rural renewal, which should have been a logical step forward for the lefts land reforms programmes.

		 Friday, April 02, 2004 							 																						A ROAD MUCH TRAVELLED ADITI BHADURI																					The recent carnage on the streets of Gaza is not surprising: bloodshed is the rule in this part of the world. What is different is that this time, Israel has assassinated the blind and crippled Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual head of Hamas, the militant Palestinian outfit. Expectedly, the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Salom, has called it an act of self-defence, bracketing Hamas with al Qaida. This is ironic, considering that Israel had encouraged the growth of Hamas as a counter-weight to the more secular Palestinian Liberation Organization.																					The assassination has come on the heels of the Madrid bombings. More important, it has come in the wake of Israels declaration of its plan of disengagement from Gaza. Ever since the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, announced a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in February, 30 Palestinians have been killed in the strip alone. This has invited retaliation by Palestinians, the goriest of which were the suicide bombings in the Israeli port of Ashdod which killed 10 Israelis. 																					But Israels actions in the strip follow a familiar pattern. Every time a peace initiative is underway, Israel launches some military action in the occupied Palestinian territories. The policy of assassination  illegal under international law  has been resorted to time and again because assassinations invariably trigger off fresh violence and scuttle peace initiatives. No wonder Israel did not care to inform its prime patron  the United States of America  of its plans to assassinate Yassin. And, going by experience, it seems unlikely that Yassins assassination will serve the cause of Israels security. 																					One after the other																					Every assassination of Hamas leaders, as that of other militants, has been avenged by some act OF violence in Israel. When Mahmud Abu-Hanoud was assassinated in November 2001, Hamas was upholding an agreement with Yasser Arafat not to attack targets inside Israel.This was a few days before the US envoy, Anthony Zinni, was to arrive in Israel. Predictably, Hamas retaliated with bombings, Sharon accused Arafat of terrorism and the Zinni mission was wrecked.																					In July 2002, Israel assassinated Hamass Salah Shehada, hours after Hamas had declared a unilateral truce. Fifteen civilians were killed in that operation. The Hamas response was the bombing of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, killing seven. In June last year, soon after the Aqaba agreement between Sharon and the new prime minister, Mahmud Abbas, to redraw the roadmap to peace, Israel attempted the assassination of Abdel Aziz Rantissi, a senior Hamas leader. The attack came hours after Hamas said it would consider renewing a cease-fire dialogue. And Israelis paid the price in a suicide bombing on the streets of Jerusalem.																					Waiting for revenge																					Again, it was the assassination of the Hamas leader, Ismail Abu Shanab, and a few others before him, that ended the truce which Palestinian militant factions had entered into with Abu Mazen, in which the former agreed not to carry out attacks inside Israel. These killings are clearly meant to provoke, so that Israel can cite the violence that follows to extend its occupation and intensify its military activities.																					It can be safely assumed that Sheikh Yassins murder will not go unavenged. And that would give the Sharon government a pretext to prolong the conflict, to say that despite all its good intentions of withdrawing from Gaza, it found no partner for peace. This in turn would help keep the military junta ruling Israel in power.																					Yassins assassination may well trigger off another crisis in the region. Israelis  many of whom are also against the assassinations  have been put at risk once again, both inside and outside Israel. And as the last year has proved, rage, humiliation and despair have a way of getting past military checkpoints and security walls. The Israelis can take a cue from the Spanish, who voted out a government whose policies subjected them to terrorism. Sharons policies have not made Israel safer for its citizens, and the citizens alone can change things.

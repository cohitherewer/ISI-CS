Bengal Buzz / Sumit Mitra ON A HIGH: CPM supporters in Calcutta celebrate their partys victory Manoeuvring with an army is advantageous, said ancient Chinese military thinker Sun Tzu, but with an undisciplined multitude it is most dangerous. Since West Bengal came under the seemingly everlasting spell of the CPM-led Left Front a good 27 poila boisakhs ago, the state has for the most part suffered a disconnect with the Centre. Bengal did not get the special attention that states like Maharashtra, Gujarat or Andhra Pradesh did  largely due to their clout in the Union government. Over the years, the state gradually became irrelevant in the national scenario. The pro-Centre men who got elected to Parliament from the state were largely undisciplined. No wonder Bengal slipped from Raisina Hills radar. Now, with the Left poised to propel the Congress government, be it from the front seat or the back, the state has a gilt-edged opportunity to knock at the Centres door with more determination than ever  55.5 per cent of those who have given the Congress its mandate are from Bengal. Heres a wishlist that the state could roll out.Hungry for moreAt the root of Bengals many visible deficiencies lies its sullied profile as a destination of investment. In attracting domestic and foreign investment since the 1991 economic liberalisation, Bengals failure is startling, particularly on a comparative scale. Even the small Uttar Pradesh enclave of Noida, just about three times the size of Salt Lake, drew twice as much foreign investment as West Bengal during that period. The NDA government blamed it on the states poor work culture; the Left Front government accused Delhi of stepmotherly indifference to the state. If the standoff ends, new investments may pour into the agro-industries, power, roads and other sectors, giving the states sluggish economy a much-needed boost.Building basesLook at the plethora of projects pending for lack of cash: an expressway connecting Haldia with Siliguri. A new metro from Howrah to Rajarhat, running below the Hooghly. Three new airports at Malda, Balurghat and Cooch Behar. More funds for dredging the river downstream from Calcutta to keep the Calcutta and Haldia ports more navigable and upstream of Farakka to prevent the Ganga from changing its course eastward. Bengal wants foreign loans (particularly Japanese) loans for infrastructure development and that too directly, not via the Centre, to avoid paying additional rates. The state has never had a better chance to realise its dreams.Money talkIt is now in a mess, with debt being 26.5 per cent of the states GDP and interest payment being more than a quarter of its revenue receipt. State finance minister Ashim Dasgupta, on his next visit to Delhi, is sure to call on the new Union finance minister and request a package of loan waiver and interest rate reduction. He has gone on several such missions in the past, but now he has the numbers in the Lok Sabha to ensure an attentive hearing from North Block.IT mattersInformation technology (IT) minister Manab Mukherjee is ready with the first demand hed make of a friendly Centre: persuade public sector BSNL to make Haldia the landing hub for undersea cable linking. The bandwidth boost will give us enough bandwidth to set up as many IT parks as we want, to increase our share of revenues from global outsourcing.Career wiseBengals top employment-givers like jute and engineering have been hollowed out. Ditto for farming. Services love computers more than men. The CPM plans to attack unemployment in three ways: make the state have full control over welfare funds; empower the state to tax the service sector; and, offer cheaper credit to the rural sector by making the banks apply different prudential norms for the poor. Its a tough call. But the Left seems determined to seize the moment.

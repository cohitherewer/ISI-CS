		 Friday, August 06, 2004 							 																						EXPERIMENTS WITH IDEASRabindranath Tagore: A BiographyBy Uma Das Gupta, Oxford, Rs 225Some critics have taxed me with having misunderstood the meaning of the word nation. I suppose it is one of those words whose meaning is still in its process of formation, Rabindranath Tagore wrote in a letter to William Rothenstein in1917.																														Tagore in his long and eventful life was constantly engaged with reformulating a few ideas, which were in urgent need for reworking in the colonial times. Nationalism was one of those, as were education and religion. Tagore, who was primarily a poet, had the vaulting imagination to fuse ideas of Western origin and those inherited from ancient Indian wisdom. Thus a biography of Tagore may well be an account of his imaginative transcription of certain received notions, germane to the theme of self-determination.																														This is the approach which Uma Das Gupta seems to have in mind in the short biography of Tagore, part of a series of short biographies meant for the non-specialist reader. By her own admission, Das Gupta addresses two themes in her work  the one of Tagore as an indefatigable man of action, and the other of Tagore as a poet and writer of many a genre.																														Even a browse through the book will make it clear that the second theme takes a backseat to the first. Of the ten chapters, only the seventh is devoted to Tagores creative writings. Even that is largely a discussion of certain features of Tagores writings. Apart from this, Das Gupta deserves praise for highlighting Tagores philosophy and world-view which informed his intellectual pursuits as well as his contributions to education, rural economy and politics. It is the well-deliberated thematic perspectives against which Das Guptas discussions of Tagores establishment of Visva Bharati at Shantiniketan and his rural reconstruction at Sriniketan are carried out.																														But the most interesting discussion of the book concerns Tagores idea of nationalism and its fundamental differences with Gandhis nationalist programmes. Das Gupta wonderfully sums up the stimulating debate between the two great nationalist thinkers over the Charka Movement. Das Gupta includes as appendices a few select letters by Tagore written to persons like William Rothenstein, Jawaharlal Nehru, C.F. Andrews, W.W. Pearson et al. These provide priceless insights and buttress the thematic design of this short biography.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

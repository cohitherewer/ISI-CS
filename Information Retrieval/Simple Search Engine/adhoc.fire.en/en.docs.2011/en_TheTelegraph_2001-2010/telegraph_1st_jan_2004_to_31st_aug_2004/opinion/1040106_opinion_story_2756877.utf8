 - Document  Extracts from the UNDP report on HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 Not her problem  alone  Marginalization and discrimination  of vulnerable groups: The fact that it is marginalized groups   sex workers, migrants, injecting drug users and men who  have sex with men  who have so far been most severely affected  by HIV/AIDS in south Asia has resulted in these groups being  blamed for its spread. This has led to their further marginalization,  stigmatization, harassment and discrimination. Apart from  violations of their rights, this also makes them face greater  social exclusion.  This, in turn, only increases  their vulnerability to HIV and allows the epidemic to spread  because they are then less able to access the information,  services and support needed to protect themselves and others  from infection. They also become more vulnerable to abuse  and exploitation, as seen in the sexual abuse experienced  by men who have sex with men in Bangladesh. Such increased  marginalization also reduces the livelihood security and  opportunities of these groups, thereby heightening their  vulnerability to HIV/AIDS by prompting unsafe migration  or sex work. Impact on women: Nearly 36 per  cent of all People Living With HIV/AIDS in south and southeast  Asia are women. The spread of the epidemic in a region with  already highly unequal gender relations affects men and  women differently. The impact of the epidemic falls primarily  on women in four different, though related, ways: Women shoulder the increased burden  of care within the household and the community, in addition  to their domestic work and economic responsibilities; This increased care or the disease  itself lessens the ability of women to work in the formal,  informal or agricultural sectors, leading to a further loss  of income, reduction in child care and food security; In cases where the male members  of the household stop earning or die of AIDS, the women  are left to provide, including being pushed into the sex  trade; and Finally, women are often blamed  for their familys and their own sickness, and are ostracized  by the extended family and community, leading to their bearing  the social and psychological burden of the disease as well. Impact of human development on  HIV/AIDS:...the focus is on the obverse of the relationship  highlighted previously  the role that variables related  to human development play in influencing the spread of HIV,  as well as the possible linkages between human development  strategies and the response to HIV. Impact of different dimensions  of human development on HIV: There are several ways in which  human development can influence HIV transmission  the level  of economic and educational achievement, standards of health  and access to health services, income inequalities, gender  relations and the treatment of vulnerable subgroups of the  population and basic legal rights to privacy, life and liberty. It has been argued that the different  dimensions of human development affect the vector of HIV  transmission. The rate of HIV transmission is not simply  a function of sexual behaviour. Epidemiological, clinical  and laboratory evidence shows that HIV infection is evidenced  by the same factors that promote the transmission of other  infectious diseases.  There is an established literature  in public health and a century of clinical practice demonstrating  that persons with nutritional deficiencies, with parasitic  diseases whose general health is poor, who have little access  to health services, or who are otherwise economically disadvantaged  have greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, whether  they are transmitted sexually, by food, water, air or other  means. Socio-economic conditions: Within  south Asia, there are four sets of analyses whose findings  relating to the impact of income levels and educational  attainment on protection measures against HIV risk are especially  instructive. Basu, Gupta and Krishna (1997), in their examination  of the impact of adult death on households in India, found  considerable socio- economic variation in AIDS awareness  among individuals.  Within the south Asian region,  they found that although there are adverse impacts of the  epidemic, the response mechanisms tend to vary according  to the characteristics of the household. Richer households  tend to be able to cope better than poorer households, and  households where the adult was self-employed tend to cope  better than where the adult was employed as wage or salary-worker.

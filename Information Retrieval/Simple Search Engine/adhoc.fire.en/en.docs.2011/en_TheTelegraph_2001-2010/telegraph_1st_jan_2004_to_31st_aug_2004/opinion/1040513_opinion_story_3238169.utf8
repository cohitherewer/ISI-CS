		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 							 																						PRESIDENTS VOTE																														One of the pitfalls of adopting the Westminster model for Indian democracy is the anomalous position of the president. The position was created to have a figure that would be equivalent to the king in Great Britain. India as a proud republic could not accommodate royalty although Britain had successfully married democracy and kingship by way of a constitutional monarchy. The founding fathers decided to institute a ceremonial head of state and thus the office of the president was established. Outside of ceremony and protocol, the office of the president assumes crucial political importance when a hung Lok Sabha is elected by the people. When such a thing happens, a president has to stand apart from his personal choices and follow the Constitution and its provisions. For this reason, it is assumed that the president, like a monarch in Westminster, stands above the interests of political parties and is thus above the political fray. This is of course the convention and not a rule. Following such a convention is an individuals choice. In Great Britain, for example, members of the House of Lords do not, though an accepted convention, exercise their franchise because they are in theory servants of the Crown and are supposed to look after the interests of the king/queen.																														Given this position of the president, it is somewhat surprising to find that Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam actually exercised his franchise. Mr Kalam is by no means the first president of India to do this but since he is a stickler for propriety and convention, the fact is noteworthy. By casting his vote, Mr Kalam has stated, albeit secretly, his political preference. The fact that the electronic voting machine has no option for none found suitable means that Mr Kalam cast his vote for a particular candidate belonging to a particular party. In other words, Mr Kalam believes one particular individual and party is best suited to represent his interests in the Lok Sabha. But as the president, Mr Kalam stands for the entire nations interests. How did Mr Kalam distinguish between his individual interests and the national interest? If he did so by assuming that one particular party best represents the national interest, Mr Kalam would be in a dilemma in the case of a close-run electoral contest where he had to choose between the party he voted for and another. Mr Kalam would have been well advised to refrain from voting and to make a public announcement explaining his reasons for not voting as the president. Thus Mr Kalam could have set an example about the importance of following unwritten conventions in a democracy.

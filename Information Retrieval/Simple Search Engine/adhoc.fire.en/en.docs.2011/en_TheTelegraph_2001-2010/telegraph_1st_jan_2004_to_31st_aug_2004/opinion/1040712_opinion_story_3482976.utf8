The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 12, 2004 							 																						NOT BY TRUTH ALONE 																														Like grace, or justice, barbarism finds its own symbols. The devastation of Iraq has thrown up many such, but the latest is perhaps to be found in the terrified face of an escaped victim, a Pakistani freed from captivity in Iraq. He claims to have seen three men, two Americans and an Iraqi, being beheaded by his captors. In itself, the experience is unspeakable, but in fact there is no knowledge of two Americans and an Iraqi being held hostage by any militant group. The story suggests that no one quite knows what is going on: the scale of the horror that has been let loose in Iraq is barely comprehensible. Abductions and beheadings, publicized by the captors with the attached demands carefully spelt out, have not abated since the interim government took over. For the West to condemn such barbarity would be to pretend that Abu Ghraib did not happen. But the damage is not limited to these. Apart from bloodshed in encounters and ambushes, Iraqs main oil pipelines have been attacked in three crucial places in July alone. Its oil exports have been halved. A videotape displaying pre-sortie rituals by suicide killers, with some footage of actual operations, maps and targets, has been obtained too. It confirms the suspicions of the American government that militant activity within Iraq is being executed largely by outsiders, because the tape shows extremists from Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Algeria and other countries. The lesson lies in the spectacle of the hatred generated by the United States of Americas attack on Iraq, a hatred that puts the whole world at risk.																														The full impact of the US Senate Intelligence Committees harsh criticism of American intelligence agencies cannot be appreciated without this context. The committee has exonerated the Bush administration of the charge of pressurizing the agencies to produce predetermined results, but this is a frightening indicator of the weak reasoning on which the US bases its military aggression. The first question yet remains to be answered: what did Mr Saddam Hussains alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction have to do with the post-9/11 coalition against terror? It is one thing to build international strategies to fight murderous extremists, and quite another to condemn tyrant-ruled countries to destruction. Perhaps the American people will make known their answer at the ballot. In Britain, the questions being asked of Mr Tony Blair, who had actually wished to step down, are hard and pointed. The Butler inquiry report may answer some of them. But the problem that has been created, centred most obviously now in Iraq, will not be solved by truthful answers alone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 19, 2004 							 																						GENTEEL NEGLECT																														There can be such a thing as a passive barbarian. If the destruction of invaluable books and manuscripts at Punes Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute by Hindu bigots was actively barbaric, then letting priceless artwork perish in neglect is surely an example of passive barbarism. And the Tagorean establishment in Bengal has turned this into a fine and genteel art. Around 5,000 paintings by Rabindranath, Jyotirindranath and Abanindranath Tagore have been found lying in unspeakable neglect in some sort of a strong room in the Jorasanko campus in Calcutta. They have been lying about in trunks and cupboards, some even on the floor, in a room whose walls are damp and the ceiling in a state of near-collapse. A large number of them have been irreparably damaged. These invaluable paintings are officially in the custody of the Rabindra Bharati Society, whose members do not seem to have even a rudimentary notion of art restoration. Rabindra Bharati university or the museum appears to be equally clueless about the care of these paintings. This is callousness of criminal proportions. But there is another shameful dimension to the whole matter. The harrowing of this strong room was undertaken by a special officer appointed by the Calcutta high court, where the society and the university are fighting a case. Not only are the custodians of these treasures eminently incapable of looking after them, but they also fail to see the humiliation of the courts intervention in this matter. 																														Being unable to value the invaluable unless policed by the government or the courts is perhaps the most unfortunate form of infantility a society or community could suffer from. And when the other face of this infantility is cultural pride, proprietorship or chauvinism, then the whole thing begins to look rather comically disgraceful. A deeply unsavoury can of worms has been opened since the Nobel burglary in Santiniketan. The lawless free-for-all that the Tagore archives have become is only the tip of a rather sordid iceberg. Corruption, greed and ignorance are obviously at the heart of this state of affairs. But perhaps at the root of it is a profound capacity for disrespect, a kind of unthinking indifference to what is to be cherished and preserved collectively. Schools, colleges, universities, museums, archives, galleries and libraries are all places where these values and priorities are instilled, acted out and tested. It is a lamentable failure of education and of culture, and indeed of humanity, when the value of beautiful things is brought home to those they belong to by the hand of the law.

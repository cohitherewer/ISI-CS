The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 15, 2004 							 																						UNIMPROVED																														It is not very important, it would seem, how many babies have died one after another in the last three days at the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital. Because this time, unlike one and a half years earlier, officials and doctors have a lot of reasons to offer, quite acceptable ones too. A couple of babies could not have been saved, except with the kind of expenditure which is enormous even by United Kingdom standards  unthinkable in a poor countrys poorer government hospital. Some of the patients were referred too late  being the states only referral paediatric hospital is an onerous burden. And so the excuses run. Such glibness is not only an expression of relief on the part of the hospital authorities, but it also provides the state government with much-needed breathing space. The chief minister did assure the opposition in the assembly that while it was true that something had happened in B.C. Roy the night before, the situation had normalized thereafter. There can be little doubt about that: for sudden spells, the average of baby deaths in the states referral hospital comes up to a little more than three a day. No wonder the health minister, Mr Surjya Kanta Mishra, had said such things are normal when 14 children died within a few days in the same hospital in 2002.																														If the government does feel it has got away lightly this time, it would just be another reflection of its blindness and inefficiency. Additionally, it would be another proof of its complete callousness towards the underprivileged who are forced to take their critically ill children to government hospitals  of which the best is perhaps the B.C. Roy  and its casual dismissal of the lives of the children of the poor as unimportant. Even if the most recent series of baby deaths cannot be entirely laid at the door of the poor work culture of the hospital, it has served to expose the failure of the government to improve matters since 2002. Equipment and management are still poor, new machines are either already damaged or do not have the right people to work them. It needed these deaths for the government to pay attention to the hospital administrations plea to stop referrals, and perhaps to lend an ear to the problems of having junior doctors on the staff and the request for extra hands. But the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital is just the visible symptom of a much larger problem. Healthcare in the state has not shown a great deal of improvement in spite of assurances from the government, and the healthcare for children is abysmal. If the citys leading paediatric hospital produces such a record, it is difficult to conceive what hospitals in the districts may have to show. Maybe the government is better off not even trying to imagine the scale of the human tragedy this implies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 							 																						GOING NOWHERE Uttam Sengupta argues that if the Coal India headquarters has to be shifted out of Calcutta, Raipur would be a better option than Ranchi				 	 Planning the next move																														The nose and the body cannot be separated and put in different places  that is the disarming defence put forward by the Union coal minister, Shibu Soren, to justify his desire to shift the headquarters of Coal India Limited from Calcutta to Ranchi. The headquarters of CIL, he argues, ought to be where the mines are. It is a long-standing demand of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Soren adds, and it is in no way wrong for the party to articulate the demand. Soren actually appears bewildered by the commotion his proposal has caused. Separation is always painful, he acknowledges philosophically, but argues that it is often inevitable. 																														Sorens sage comments are unlikely to cut much ice in Calcutta, where the Trinamool Congress, the Left Front and the Congress have closed ranks to oppose the move. The JMM leader had not bargained for the strong backlash that his casual comment on the subject evoked among his electoral allies. Nor did he anticipate that the National Democratic Alliance would gleefully latch on to his statement and get the Jharkhand assembly to endorse it. 																														Indeed, sensing that the demand could grow into an emotive issue before the assembly elections due in February, and obviously reluctant to let Soren run away with all the honours, the Jharkhand chief minister, Arjun Munda, has stepped up the heat by requesting Soren to specify a deadline. Both support for and opposition to the plan have put the poor coal minister in a spot. He cannot afford to back off or even slow down. In fact, he will possibly have to dig in his heels and take a political stand, such as resigning from the cabinet, if the opposition gets too strident. The Bharatiya Janata Party can be trusted to do everything it possibly can to drive a wedge between the Congress and the JMM on this issue. A delegation of ministers from Jharkhand is being dispatched to New Delhi by the NDA to call on the prime minister and plead for shifting the headquarters, among other things. CIL was set up by an executive order and a cabinet decision is all that is required to set the ball rolling. 																														All political parties thus appear to have tied themselves up in knots, with many of them being compelled to support the move in Jharkhand and oppose it in West Bengal. The pressure on Soren is naturally immense as he has raised expectations and led people to believe that the shifting of the CIL headquarters would not just be a symbolic victory but would actually lead to more employment. The longer the stalemate, therefore, the greater his discomfiture. 																														However, the stalemate can come to a swift end if the Chattisgarh assembly also adopts a similar resolution, demanding that the CIL headquarters be shifted to Raipur and not Ranchi. In fact, the Union coal minister does not seem to have been briefed adequately. Otherwise, he would have known that CILs operations are not just spread across seven states, but also that Jharkhand and West Bengal have lost their primacy so far as coal production is concerned. 																														Contrary to popular conception and Sorens belief, coal mines in Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh today produce more coal than the two eastern states. They also have the more profitable coal mines compared to those in Jharkhand and West Bengal. The South Eastern Coalfields Limited, for example, with its headquarters at Bilaspur (Chattisgarh), produced 71 million tons of coal last year, compared to 28 million tons by the Eastern Coalfields Limited (West Bengal), and 37 million tons by the Central Coalfields Limited (Jharkhand). In fact, the CIL subsidiary based in Chattisgarh produced more coal than the last two taken together. 																														Therefore, if coal production is to form the basis of locating the CIL headquarters, then it is Raipur, and not Ranchi, which appears to have a far better claim. Projections made by CIL also make it clear that the picture is unlikely to change much in the future. In terms of both production and capital investment planned by CIL in the next few years, the Chattisgarh-Madhya Pradesh sector has a priority over the more traditional, old and problematic coal mines in West Bengal and Jharkhand. Raipur will have the additional advantage of being closer to another CIL subsidiary based in Nagpur. The Union coal minister does not appear to have paid much attention to such nitty gritty, which would seem to knock off his rationale for shifting the CIL headquarters to Ranchi.																														In a lighter vein, it can also be argued that the Central government will be able to please or appease, as the case may be, not just one but three states by shifting the CIL headquarters to Raipur. Chattisgarh will be the most obvious beneficiary, but both West Bengal and Jharkhand can then be granted special economic packages to generate employment and energy. The two states may not be quite averse to the idea once they realize that they have very little to lose by giving up their respective claims on the CIL headquarters. Such a move can, at best, give a fillip to construction activities for a temporary period and provide more briefs to lawyers. 																														Over the last three decades, operations at CIL have been progressively decentralized, with decisions related to procurement and marketing now delegated to the CIL subsidiaries. Sales tax and royalty are paid to the respective state governments, while the corporate income tax paid by CIL goes into the Central pool. As for employment, the CIL headquarters is said to have a little over 1,300 staff in Calcutta, many of them from outside the state. Given that experts are increasingly raising questions about the justification for retaining such a large army of employees at the headquarters, even about the utility of having a holding company, the CIL headquarters can at best be seen to have symbolic value. But then symbolism is often more important in politics than substantive issues, and the CIL headquarters could well be a symbol that West Bengal would be loath to part with.																														The controversy, however, remains largely a non-issue while discussing the future of the coal industry. Thirty years after the nationalization of coal mines, coal production in the country has gone up from 75 million tons to 280 million tons, a little less than a four-fold increase. Yet there is a shortfall of a hundred million tons every year, forcing industry to import coal. With China buying up coal mines in Australia, there is a real threat of a Chinese monopoly in the foreseeable future. Thus the country has to look for fresh reserves, modernize and even mechanize the existing mines, and take urgent steps so that new technology may allow the use of low-grade coal in the metallurgical industry. 																														Not much headway has been made in tapping the methane gas trapped in underground mines in Dhanbad, and observers of the coal industry are unanimous in their view that Soren alone can use his charisma to ensure a voluntary evacuation of Jharia, which is sitting atop a blazing fire that is also swallowing up precious, good quality coal. Soren himself has gone on record, acknowledging that the coal mafia continues to flourish. The traditional weaknesses of the coal industry and its chronic inefficiency are further accentuated by institutionalized corruption that few governments have seriously combated. Soren, therefore, will have his hands full even if he did not waste his energy in trying to shift the CIL headquarters.

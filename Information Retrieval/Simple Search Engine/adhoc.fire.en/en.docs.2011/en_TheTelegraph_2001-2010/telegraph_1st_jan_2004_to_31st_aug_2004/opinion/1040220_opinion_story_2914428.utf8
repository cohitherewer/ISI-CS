The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 20, 2004 							 																						PROFESSED INTENT																														The agreement between India and Pakistan on a road map to further the dialogue between them will be widely welcomed. Although the possibility of a real political breakthrough is still remote, the latest understanding will contribute to lessening the tension between the two countries. It is essential now to stick to the schedule of talks worked out, and not let the process of dialogue be derailed in the months to come. The road map was finalized by official delegations, led by the two foreign secretaries, after several round of talks in Islamabad. According to the schedule worked out, the two foreign secretaries would meet either in May or June to talk about Jammu and Kashmir and other issues of peace and security. At about the same time, expert groups from both sides will meet to translate into reality many of the nuclear confidence building measures agreed to in Lahore in 1999. Talks on the other bilateral irritants, including the continued confrontation over the Siachen glacier, the deadlock over the Wullar barrage/Tulbul navigation project and the differences over the demarcation of the Sir Creek maritime boundary, will take place in July. Two sets of technical meetings will be held earlier. The meeting between the director-general, Pakistan Rangers, and the inspector general, Border Security Force, will be held next month and the bilateral committee on drug trafficking and smuggling will meet in June 2004. In other words, a comprehensive schedule of talks has been planned which will address all the outstanding issues between India and Pakistan. 																														The most substantive part of the dialogue will take place after the general election in India. It has also been decided that foreign ministers from both the countries will meet in August to review the progress made in the dialogue. There are several aspects of the current accord that are heartening. Most important, officials from both sides have managed to translate the vision for peace outlined in the joint statement issued by the Pakistan president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, and the prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, after their meeting in Islamabad on January 6, into a realistic framework for talks. It is also noteworthy that the urgency of dealing with the nuclear issue has been realized. Given the concerns about Pakistans nuclear programme, it is critical that nuclear CBMs are implemented at the earliest. It is the businesslike working of the two delegations that must inform bilateral meetings of the future as well. Professionalism rather than national passions will do more to help the cause of India-Pakistan relations.

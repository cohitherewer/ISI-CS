		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 							 																						IN THE FIRST FLUSH OF YOUTH 															- Document Excerpts from Sexuality, abortion and the media: a review of adolescent concerns by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Different desires																														Young people between the ages of 15 and 24 have the highest rates of sexually-transmitted infections world-wide, representing over two-thirds of all cases in the developing world. Today, half of all new HIV infections occur among young people under the age of 25.																														This paper focuses on issues of adolescent sexuality, contraception and abortion; analyses of select media coverage; and exploration of links between these issues. Towards this I talked to adolescents, reviewed research, and scanned the media. My geographical focus was the Delhi area...																														Technically, adolescence is a stage between childhood and adulthood characterized by rapid physical growth, psychological changes and sexual maturity. The term puberty refers to the more physical and sexual maturation of boys and girls, while adolescence refers to the behavioural characteristics, which are influenced by culture as well as by physical changes. While the physical changes in this period of growth are almost universal, the behavioural and emotional development during adolescence differs widely between cultures, economies and societies.																														One of the biggest changes from childhood to adolescence is the interest in sex and matters related to it. Young people are interested in sex because of biological reasons  hormones. Suggestions about sex in music, radio, advertisements, films and television reinforce this interest, and they talk about sex and have questions about it. Adults have to find the right ways to give youth information so they can take better-informed decisions about their sexual behaviour.																														...The opportunity for sexual activity prior to marriage is increasing; the age of puberty is falling world-wide, partly due to better nutrition, and the age of marriage in many countries is rising.																														In India, the average age of marriage for women is 16 years. And as many as 40 per cent of all women aged 15-19 are already married.																														Non-technically, adolescence is the time when boys and girls...begin to find each other sexually attractive, experience desire, love, lust and a great need for physical contact with each other. While adults talk about safe sex, abstinence and waiting for the right partner, young people often give in to their most basic desires. They want to experiment. The young boy or girl who turned away from the TV or movie screen when grown-ups kissed or expressed affection...now avidly watches, taking tips. Young boys or girls who thought the family was their world now spend a great deal of time day-dreaming; and depending on their class, SMSing, talking on the phone and spending time with friends. They are moody, defiant, sensitive, loving, exasperating, confused, dependent, and independent  all at the same time.																														Sexuality and sexual behaviour in India: Research on sexuality and sexual behaviour in India is a relatively recent phenomenon. It was not till the early Nineties, when concerns of HIV/AIDS forced public and government attention to the issue.																														Researchers in the Nineties lament the lack of empirical data which, they feel, led to a complacent attitude towards policies especially regarding HIV/AIDS. But the 1994 United Nations international conference on population and development, and the global attention on AIDS, helped to focus research on high-risk groups such as sex workers, truck drivers and transient populations. This led to the belief that only high risk groups were in danger of contracting HIV, and as a result, intervention programmes and general awareness campaigns tended to concentrate mainly on these special groups.

				 																Ragas speak to him. Budding poets and authors from all over the world want to write for him. Violinist and management consultant Vasudev Murthy has, you might say, many strings to his bow. Murthy, who has released a book called What the Raags Told Me, a Rupa publication, has just come out with a literary magazine called Leaves, which, says Murthy, is meant to provide a platform for those with talent. The first edition, which contains works from writers around the globe  including Israel, Japan and the US  was launched in Bangalore recently. That isnt all. He is already on to his second book on ragas, another two dozen this time. Enough to make anyone burst into song. Madhuri Dixit				 																																	To date, Dr Nene has had nothing to do with his oh-so-charming wifes profession. But Mrs Nene, or Madhuri Dixit as we know her, is just like any other pativrata Bharatiya nari. Madhuri, after wrapping up her film projects in India, is all set to help hubby Shrirams frat in the US. Or so she hopes. At the 22nd Annual Convention of the American Association of Physicians of Indian origin in San Diego this week, Madhuri, who was the highlight of the meet, announced that she would like to be involved in charitable medical activities by Indian doctors. Well, she could just as well be a role model for all the husband-worshipping women in the K-serials. On your marks, Ektaa.Gurinder ChadhaThe secrets out. This year, for the first time, the Academy of Motion Pictures has made its list of judges public. And Indians have yet another reason to rejoice. Among the eminent members of the jury, which includes the likes of Viggo Mortensen and Sean Penn, is our very own Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha. Balle! balle! to that.

		 Friday, January 16, 2004 							 																						TEACHING THEM																								Not every profession has an articulated code of conduct like doctors do. But unwritten codes are inscribed in all professions, and it is understood that the professionals in question will abide by these. Even the terms of appointment in specific jobs imply certain modes of behaviour. This was true of teachers jobs too, although for sometime now an articulated code of conduct for teachers has been in the offing. This looks a little sad: clearly, members of the teaching profession have been seen to be remiss in matters of professional conduct. What could earlier be taken for granted now has to be written out  and carried out. The National Council of Educational Research and Training had recently evolved a code of professional ethics for teachers, and the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education is preparing a code of conduct for schoolteachers on its basis. In itself, this is healthy rather than objectionable; no harm can come from a code of conduct fairly and humanely implemented. The focus of the code proposed by the West Bengal board is on problems specific to the schools of the state. There is, therefore, a conscious effort to depoliticize teachers activity, as for example in the instruction that teachers shall not incite students against other students, teachers or the authorities, or that teachers shall not bring baseless complaints against colleagues or the administration. The intention is all to the good, but the test of such provisions will ultimately lie in the fairness and regularity of their implementation. It would be nice to know, for example, who will decide that certain complaints are baseless, or that certain actions are incitement while others are legitimate protests. The overall politicization of the education system in the state will be a difficult thing to dismantle, especially since the policymakers are part of the dominant political structure.																								What is most important in the code is the prohibition against private tuition by schoolteachers. This is perhaps the singlemost pervasive evil that the present system has bred, and it has to be eradicated with a firm hand. Much of the effectiveness of the code of conduct will depend on the strictness with which offending teachers are penalized. Building up popular opinion against private tuition will not be easy, since pupils and the guardians are the most eager that it continues. To tackle this problem, certain changes in the methods of classroom teaching, with added accountability for both teachers and pupils, should accompany the clause. The clause that teachers shall regularly inform guardians of their wards progress or failure, could be of a piece with these changes. The code of conduct should be part of a bigger vision of improvement, not just a weapon with which to threaten some teachers.

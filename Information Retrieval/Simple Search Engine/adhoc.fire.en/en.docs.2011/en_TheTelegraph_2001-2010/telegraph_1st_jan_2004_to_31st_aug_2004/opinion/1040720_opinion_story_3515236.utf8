The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 							 																						FINAL SOLUTIONS																														The seven deaths that occurred on Saturday night in a Tollygunge home will never cease to baffle human understanding and empathy. Forensic investigation is one way of getting to the truth of the matter. But killing ones nearest kin and then oneself are acts of the will, although of a will paralysed by helplessness and despair. There was deliberation behind Shibendu Sahas action, and then a kind of determination to see things through to the end. Yet this must have been accompanied by an absolute failure of hope in the efficacy of any other kind of human action. What was the source of this hopelessness, this undermining of the very essence of positive human agency? In Sahas case, it came from the sense of an irreversible financial crisis. And with that sense, the matrix of a normal life  family, friends, neighbours and livelihood  must have fallen away from the perception of his own life as something worth preserving. 																														As an expression of absolute economic despair, Sahas act is far from being unprecedented in the city. In May last year, Ajoy Bhattacharya, in his early forties, strangled his wife and three children, and then burnt himself to death. He had left his job in a bank to start a business which had failed. Two days later, 40-year-old Raju Parui killed his wife and son before hanging himself. He had realized that he could never pay back his debts. Financial ruin after retirement and the burden of medical expenses for terminally ill offspring have provoked comparable behaviour in adults. In another kind of economy, some heavily indebted farmers have occasionally taken the lives of their loved ones before killing themselves. Are such deaths then caused by a certain kind of socio-economic set-up, which not only determines the economic status of individuals and their families, but also these individuals sense of the value of their own lives? To what extent does the state  its welfare systems, for instance  determine an individuals sense of familial responsibility, of security or insecurity, of what he might take on for himself or for those who depend on him? In the cases of Saha, Bhattacharya or even Parui, it is always possible to suggest ways in which they could have worked out other economic solutions. With debt-ridden farmers and with laid-off or locked-out factory-workers, it is more difficult to do that. Would unemployment benefits have helped, or something like the British National Health Service? In a poor and populous country like India, is it at all possible, or fair, to expect the state to take some sort of responsibility for making a man feel that the world is too much for him?

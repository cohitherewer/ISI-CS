				 																																	What does one do when stuck with a defunct movie career and a superstar brother to boot? One resorts to dramatics! Faisal Khan, whose only claim to fame is being born as Aamir Khans younger sibling, will play the part of Kundan Lal Saigal, the singing heartthrob and hero of the Thirties. Phir Teri Rehguzar Yaad Aayi, the play on Saigals life, will be staged at a festival in Mumbai in the first week of April to mark the birth centenary of the late icon. Music maestro Naushad will supervise the five-day event. Meanwhile, Faisal is all geared up for the project. Fascinating and exciting, he calls it. Boring and predictable, say we. Padma Lakshmi with Salman Rushdie				 																																	Another May-December marriage. Much-written-about lover and yes, writer Salman Rushdie has decided to set the night on Fury, oops, fire, before he ties the knot with non-actress Padma Lakshmi on April 17. The Booker-winner is all set to throw a stag party for friends that promises to outstrip the whackiest dreams of the guests. The do  to be held at the Hampstead home of writer Kathy Latte  will reportedly be a women-only event, with a Spin the bottle featuring Dannii Minogue. And if an X-rated lesbian show is not sufficient to satiate deviant appetites, there will also be phallic food. Bananas, anyone? Ektaa Kapoor Gear up for yet another creative shock, for MTV will soon have a K-twist, even if the programme doesnt yet have a name. And all thanks to the K-queen, Ektaa Kapoor. The music-based youth-led Hindi serial to be telecast for 20 weeks or so will see a new set of glam dolls turn into Ektaas bakraas, and bleat happily to her sob tunes.

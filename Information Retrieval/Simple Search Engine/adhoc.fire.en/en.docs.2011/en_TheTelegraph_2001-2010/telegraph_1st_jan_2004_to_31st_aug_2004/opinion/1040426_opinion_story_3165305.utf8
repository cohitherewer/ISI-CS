The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Some misconceptions				 																																																				Sir  In Democracys bulldogs (April 23), Swapan Dasgupta comes down squarely on the Election Commission, and most certainly on election commissioners. But when democracy gives people like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Narendra Modi and thousands of lesser politicians the right to play god for most of the time of their elected existence, why should such a role be denied to the commissioners once in every five years? Dasgupta nitpicks on the workings of the EC to show how inconsiderate it has been to people by making them vote under the scorching midday sun. One should remind him that it was his partys idea to hold the elections this time of the year. Now that the electorate is showing their lack of faith in the saffronites, Dasgupta blames them for their lack of enthusiasm on the heat. He believes that the commissioners are contemptuous of the political process. Yet as a former journalist he should have had first-hand knowledge of politicians contempt for democracy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Srinath, Calcutta
				 																Revisiting Gujarat				 																																																				Sir  Is Atal Bihari Vajpayee asking for one more chance to replicate Gujarat in other parts of India or to demolish other holy places? Should he be supported so that he can spread more venom among Hindus and Muslims by building the Ram temple on the demolished mosque site or by distributing trishuls, changing history and protecting the modern-day Neros? Vajpayee should know that the minorities are aware enough not to barter their existence for the 3Es  education, economic uplift and empowerment. This is a critical time for Indians as on this election depend the chances of India becoming either a peaceful secular state or a fascist state heading towards civil war.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  At Kishanganj, Atal Bihari Vajpayee is reported to have said, that what happened in Gujarat should not have happened (PM pledge: No more Gujarats, April 23). Let us resolve not to allow another Gujarat to happen anywhere else. The first sentence seems unexceptionable, except when we recall that many members of the sangh parivar have boasted, in public and repeatedly, that the butchering of Muslims in Gujarat was a good and desirable thing. But who were the us in Vajpayees second sentence? Was he seeking to spread the guilt of Gujarat to the whole country, to hold all of India responsible for the carnage? Or was he, in his familiar oblique way, sending a message to his parivar, which so many have held culpable of the crime and which, even today, prevents Muslims in Gujarat from leading normal lives?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mukul Dube, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The apology offered by the prime minister about the Gujarat carnage at the Kishanganj public rally is totally shallow. Atal Bihari Vajpayee is well-known for his flip-flop and multi-speak. His apology comes in the wake of results of the exit poll of the first phase of the elections, which indicate that the Bharatiya Janata Party is not going to have a smooth ride as previously projected. If Vajpayee is sincere about his apology, will he dismiss Narendra Modi, who is shielding the culprits of Gujarat violence? Will he severe his connections with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which is pursuing the agenda of a Hindu rashtra in which the minorities will have a second-class existence?				 																																																				It seems that Vajpayee has come to believe that he can fool the people all the time by wearing masks suitable for the occasion. Nobody in his sane mind can forget that it is Vajpayee who blamed Muslims themselves for the Gujarat tragedy. But pre-electoral promises are a mirage constructed to come to power, after which the real agenda takes over. The minorities, especially Muslims who have suffered the Gujarat genocide, and Christians, who have suffered the ordeal of having a social activist like Graham Staines and his children being burnt alive, realize that their existence in the country is threatened by the divisive politics being pursued by the BJP and its parivar. After all, the only difference between Praveen Togadia, Modi and Vajpayee is the ability to manoeuvre the language. They all share a common agenda.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ram Puniyani, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  Narendra Modi has done the nation a service by raising his voice, though feeble, against the highhandedness of the judiciary (Modi pleads against case shift, April 22). The way the judiciary has been undermining the authority and dignity of the other pillars of a functional democracy is not pleasant. Zahira Sheikh, the lone witness of the Best Bakery case, has changed her statements many times, and by her own admission, lied under oath. Instead of prosecuting her, why is the judiciary bending backwards to accommodate her claims?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

				 																																																				Sir  The courts indictment of the modern day Neros does not include Narendra Modi and his men alone, but also the president and the prime minister. For even they made no efforts to control the carnage in Gujarat.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Only days back, the Marxists were the arch enemy of the Congress. Now they together accuse the BJP of creating a Hindu raj. Gujarat has been revived to serve a political end. The self-proclaimed secularists should know that it was a retaliation against Godhra. Hitler killed millions of Jews, Pol Pot around two million Cambodians, Stalin liquidated all his opponents and Milosevic killed thousands. Had Narendra Modi resorted to tyranny, the death toll in Gujarat would have run into millions. Yours faithfully, 
Asoke C. Banerjee, Massachussetts, US

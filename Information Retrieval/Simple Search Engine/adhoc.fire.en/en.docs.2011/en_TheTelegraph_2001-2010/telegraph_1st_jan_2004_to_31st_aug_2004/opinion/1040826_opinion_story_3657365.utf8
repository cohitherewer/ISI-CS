The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Curtain call				 																																																				Sir  Warrant or no warrant, Uma Bharti would have resigned as Madhya Pradesh chief minister sooner or later (Uma opts out, strife sets in, Aug 24). It is no secret that Bharti has been dying to get back at the Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, ever since the latter obtained the peoples mandate. Wily as she is, Bharti will expectedly use her resignation to corner the Congress on the tainted ministers issue. But was she not the other day telling the world, especially the media, how averse she was to the word, drama? Bharti seems to be going back on her words now  if her hopping around from one temple to another, performing elaborate pujas, making up with her estranged brother and travelling all the way to Hubli by train to surrender in court are examples enough. Little does Bharti realize that she resembles a failed actor on whom the curtains are drawing for good.

				 																A reason to die				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guha, in The sociology of suicide (Aug 21), seems to lose track while speaking about family bonds in pre-modern India. Statistics may show that suicide rates have increased in modern India. But it is also true that individual rights were seriously curbed in pre-modern India where the notion was very strong that the individual was but a puny member of the family, with the barest minimum of rights  and certainly not the right to take his life. To claim, as Guha does, that family ties in pre-modern India provided succour in times of distress is merely sentimental fancy. What rights did women have, or even men who strayed from family obligations? The boy who failed his examinations might have been treated indulgently, but would Guha say the same of one who tried to marry out of his caste? A compassionate and capable social support system can indeed provide psychological and social succour, but I have to contest the authors claim that the family was a fine institution in those days.				 																																																				It cannot be denied that meticulous research is needed before arriving at any conclusive hypothesis about the causes of suicides. But the notion of disenchantment needs to be explored when one is talking about suicides among the young and the wealthy. The disenchantment with worldly pursuits, taken on simply because they seem to provide the individual with shots at fame and wealth or because they are held up by the media and popular culture or are extolled by the family, needs to be examined. So does the frustration experienced by individuals when they realize that simply getting their hands on all that money can buy does not automatically ensure happiness. The inability to distinguish between what makes one genuinely happy and what the rest of society says about human fulfilment is equally responsible for causing distress and disenchantment. 				 																																																				It is not merely the gap between ambition and reality (as Guha suggests) but also the question, whose ambition, and an understanding that in most cases, a gap exists between individual ambition and what is seen as ambitious by society. There is nothing morally wrong in being ambitious or in seeking wealth or fame, neither does any of it automatically imply disenchantment, distress and suicidal tendencies as long as one is honest in ones dedication to the choice of means to get there.

				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article took me back to the late Sixties, when I was a student in a premier technological institution in eastern India. In a campus of about 2,000 students, two suicides a year were par for the course. I did not possess, then, nor do I now, Guhas erudition in the area of suicides. But there was a common thread in all those suicides. Suicide was predominant among the first-year students, and it was not because of ragging. They had been stellar performers in school, but it would suddenly dawn upon them that they were no longer stars in college. This would happen around October when the first-term results were declared, and the sinking feeling would be reinforced in January when the second-term results were out. The suicides took place in the third term. As Guha has pointed out, quoting Emile Durkheim, suicide is a manifestation of unfulfilled aspirations. Except that in those days, the aspiration was academic and not related to lifestyle.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Suicide-an-hour crisis in Kerala (Aug 9), is quite frightening. Suicides in Kerala have grown at more than double the rate at which the states population has grown. The issue should be investigated and ways found to stop the suicides instead of making a political issue of it. The state governments Kerala Integrated Scheme for Intervention in Suicides is a good measure. Other Indian states should act similarly.

				 																																																				Sir  The suicides by farmers in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and some other states are a shame for every Indian. Mere declarations of loan waivers by chief ministers are not good enough. What is required is a thorough investigation into the cause of such suicides. Especially, the credit delivery system in rural areas needs looking into. When large industrial houses can get loan waivers, it is unfair of financial institutions to pull up farmers for a few thousand rupees. Simple and friendly loan schemes should be made accessible to farmers, with a self-monitoring mechanism, which will hopefully prevent such suicides and also their exploitation by local money lenders. Further, immediate steps should be taken to rehabilitate the families of the dead. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 							 																						LITTLE IMPORT 																														Of the many traditions Indian society can boast of, indifference to childrens welfare is a long-established one. Had the state ever been serious about sending all youngsters to school, as the Constitution suggested in the directive principles, perhaps India would not have had to cover itself with confusion before the world regarding child labour. It is far more difficult to do anything about it half a century later, when child labour has become entrenched among the economic necessities of the poor. Spurts of activity and the rhetoric of intention, conveniently enough, do not disturb the system. This indifference is discernible at every level. A recent example of it is the new hurdle to the adoption of destitute children. In itself, the adoption law needs to be updated, while the laws regarding juvenile justice still leave much to be desired. Their conflict is bound to be paralysing, and this is exactly the effect it has had on the adoption process. According to the new Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2003, district judges are no longer arbiters of the adoption of destitute and orphaned children. Only juvenile justice boards can do this. Each board must have on it a magistrate and two members of the social welfare department.																														This should not have been a problem for the numerous couples wishing to adopt destitute children: it was just a change of authority, it would seem. But it is too much to expect that the changes brought about by the new law would be implemented by governments as soon as possible. For this would have meant that the state was paying unprecedented attention to the needs of children, and destitute or orphaned children at that. West Bengal is required to have two juvenile justice boards, one for the north and the other for the south of the state. Not one has been formed: the government has not yet nominated the members. The problem, according to reports, is purely adult and typically petty. The judicial officers are not ready to work with social welfare officers. Therefore, no boards yet. It has just been six months of waiting for the hopeful children and their would-be parents. Probably, there is more waiting to come.

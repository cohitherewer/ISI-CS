		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 							 																						FOCUS ON REGION																														Indias trade policy is consciously pushing regional trade agreements. There are different forms of RTAs  beginning with free trade areas and extending to customs unions, common markets or economic unions. When duty reduction rather than duty elimination is intended, FTAs can be preceded by preferential trade agreements. Historically, Indias FTA interest was restricted to south Asia. Since south Asian preferential trade agreements or the south Asian free trade area did not move, there was an attempt to push FTAs with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, apart from a PTA with Afghanistan and a possible PTA with Iran. The general agreement on tariffs and trade sanctions RTAs, provided some conditions are met. Whenever multilateral negotiations encounter problems, as they have now, RTAs proliferate. The apparent conflict between regionalism and multilateralism has often been debated. 																														However, despite the successful completion of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the World Trade Organization, 265 RTAs have been notified to the WTO. And with the Doha development agenda temporarily stuck, both the United States of America and the European Union have consciously been pushing RTAs. Not only are liberalization negotiations easier in smaller groups, some RTAs are WTO-plus, in the sense that they incorporate agreements beyond WTO. The instances are labour, environment or trade-related intellectual property rights and even services. Blamed by both the US and the EU for the impasse at Cancun, India has probably decided that it should have its own FTAs as a countervailing force.																														Beyond the south Asian region, there are two elements to Indias FTAs. First, a framework agreement for a PTA with Mercosur (Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil) was signed when the Brazilian president visited India during the Republic Day celebrations. There might also be one with the South African customs union. Brazil is the core of Mercosur and South Africa is the core of SACU. Hence, these PTAs or eventual FTAs will cement the developing country coalition forged before at Cancun. Second, there is a framework agreement for an FTA with the association for southeast Asian nations and individual FTAs with Thailand and Singapore. As part of this geographical focus, we now have Bimstec (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand), also joined by Bhutan and Nepal. Using a combined fast and normal track approach, the Bimstec idea is for duty elimination on manufactured goods by developing countries by 2012 and by less developed countries by 2017. While this deluge of FTAs and related liberalization is welcome, multilateral liberalization is preferable, and even unilateral liberalization yields welfare benefits. This is important because protectionism delays actual implementation of FTAs. For instance, India has erected complicated rules of origin and value addition requirements in FTAs with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, not to speak of non-tariff barriers through standards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 18, 2004  DIARY
 The Congress is truly a party  that believes in democracy. The principle which works at  the highest levels that only sons, daughters or daughters-in-law  are good enough also works lower down the party hierarchy.  So prevalent has become the dynastic principle in the nations  oldest party that it is perhaps now Indias largest  family business. This was never more evident than at a recent  meeting organized by AICC Gsec Mukul Wasnik, between youth  Congress leaders and Sonia Gandhi. The gathering seemed  like a grand reunion of the children, and grandchildren,  of former big names in the party. There was Wasnik Jr, Balkrishan,  once a party MP; Milind Deora, son of Murli Deora; and Jagat  Singh, Natwar Singhs son. Three Congressmen who died  recently Rajesh Pilot, Madhavrao Scindia and Jitendra  Prasad, were represented by their sons and political heirs  Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, and Jatin Prasad,  respectively. Then there were CR Kesavan, grandson of C  Rajagopalachari, as well as Rohit Tilak, great-grandson  of Lokmanya Tilak. Even the youth Congress president, RS  Surjewala, has as father a senior party leader in Haryana.  Some may say the children of leaders have a headstart in  politics a combination of genes and a political upbringing.  But there is a very fine dividing line between dynastic  rule and nepotism. Or has the Congress forgotten?				 																																																																														 He sulked and sulked until he was taken into the cabinet, but now Shatrughan Sinha is not satisfied with being only a Union minister. His latest ambition is to be the CM of Bihar. Only, Sinha is a Kayastha and Kayasthas make up barely two per cent of the states population. And given the importance of caste in the states electoral calculations, the BJP will shoot itself in the foot rather than allow Shotgun to take on the Laloo-Rabri duo. But Sinha is undeterred, and has taken his case to Pramod Mahajan. The smooth-talking gen-sec of the BJP will have a hard time wriggling out of that one!				 																																													But what might help Sinha is the rather low profile he has maintained in the shipping and transport ministry. At least he hasnt got the bad press he did in the health ministry. But what is he doing packing the various boards and committees under him with his friends from the film industry. For example, the presence of a popular ghazal singer on the board of a port in Maharashtra is mystifying  unless of course he was expected to help the minister by serenading his fellow directors into signing whatever the minister wanted them to!				 																																																																														 Failure, it appears, has galvanized Sonia Gandhi. These days, she has a 16 hours working day. Not only is she gathering allies by the dozen, but she is also showing rare confidence in her own judgment, over-ruling the advice of her aides. Even better, for those who remember the original Mrs G, she is showing an imperious side to her character. Sonia was in Bulandshahr the other day and ventured out of her car to get a feel of the district. When she got back, she found Jagadambika Pal, once of the Loktantrik Congress and lately UP unit president, ensconced in the back seat. Her eyebrows knit  and Pal froze. The lady immediately ordered senior, long-term Congress-men Motilal Vora and Mohsina Kidwai, to join her. A chastened Pal couldnt apologize enough, but Sonia said not a word to put him at ease. Her claws took a long time to show, but at least they exist.				 																																																																														 Ambika Soni is out on a ear. And guess whos Sonia Gandhis new favourite  our very own Pranab Mukherjee, someone who has never contested an election, even a municipal one. Ambika, of course, is not one to give in without a struggle. And as head of the partys media cell, the feisty lady can make a lot of trouble. She told journalists recently that Mukherjees brief on a CWC resolution was his own note and not worth the paper it was written on. Your turn to retaliate, Pranab-da.				 																																																																														 For all its tall talk of the feel-good factor, the BJP is running scared. This is evident from the scramble among its top leaders for safe seats. Sushma Swaraj, who took on Sonia from Bellary last time, is eyeing Delhi, while MM Joshi wants Mathura or Ghaziabad. Jaswant Singh, the architect of the recent populist mini-budget, would like to contest from Jaipur. And strangely, Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley, the strategists of the partys recent electoral victories, want seats where they stand a better chance of winning. The former wants Vidisha  thats almost ironcast safe since it is an RSS stronghold and also a seat AB Vajpayee once won from  and the latter, Bhopal. 				 																																																																														 Raveena Tandon will marry distributor Anil Thadani on February 22 at the Shivniwas Palace in Udaipur. Her marital home will be called Shiv Kutir. And also, when Anil proposed to her on Diwali day, a Shiv bhajan was playing in the background. Hope the coincidence turns out to be a lucky one for her. 				 																																																																														 Biman Bose is a man of many parts. Besides being the chairman of the Left Front, he is also a staunch believer in the efficacy of naturopathy. Not only is Bose the rare health-conscious politician, but one of his most abiding passions is also the healing properties of plants. He has been known to jot down details of exotic medicinal plants reported to him by party-workers from the districts, hunt down the plant and get a sapling. In fact, Boses garden at the CPI(M) headquarters on Alimuddin Street is quite a marvel. 				 																																													In political circles, some take Boses passion seriously, some dont, but customs officials at Calcutta airport were unabashedly intrigued. Bose was on his way to Japan and during the regulation customs check, they found neat bottles, marked Kancha Halood, Rasoon, Methi Amloki, and so on. Naturally, they were full of questions which Bose patiently answered. In fact, Bose has developed quite a following among people who have followed his home-grown therapies. In fact, he has a profession waiting for him should he bid adieu to politics.

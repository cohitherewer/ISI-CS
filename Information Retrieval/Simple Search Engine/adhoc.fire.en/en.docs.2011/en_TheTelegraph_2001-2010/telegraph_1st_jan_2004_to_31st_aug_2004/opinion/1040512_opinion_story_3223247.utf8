The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Family without values				 																																																				Sir  The Supreme Courts latest clarification  that the report of a complaint committee set up by an organization to look into sexual harassment of women at work will be treated as the basis for punishing errant employees  can hardly be expected to bring respite to the harassed former employee of Sahara Manoranjan (Workplace abuse shield, April 28). It suits the company just fine that it does not have any cell investigating the sexual harassment of its women employees, although the law makes it mandatory for it to have one (Woman alleges abuse at work, gets the sack, April 29). The company sacked the woman because she, evidently, could not live by the professional ethics of one of the biggest corporate organizations in the country. It did not rest at that, it cast aspersions on the victims mental state, even going on to insinuate that the harassed was no Zeenat Aman to deserve the attention she was complaining about. With such work ethics one wonders why Sahara employees continue to gloat about their parivar.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sudipta Chatterjee, Mumbai
				 																Watch those words				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayees personal observations about West Bengal have been much publicized. But the people of this state would also like to hear his esteemed views about certain other states  Gujarat, to begin with. It is ruled by his friend, Narendra Modi, who has earned himself the epithet of the Butcher of Gujarat. Modi has been called in to campaign for the Bharatiya Janata Party in places where the party felt that stalwarts were needed for election campaigns. It goes without saying that Vajpayee finds the chief minister of Gujarat more civilized than that of West Bengal. 				 																																																				Vajpayees observation that people in West Bengal cannot cast their votes in peace is all very well, but can he explain why poll observers in other parts of India have also complained of rigging? And what about the state of affairs in his own home state which is notorious for its treatment of Dalits?				 																																																				The prime minister is requested to make honest comments about what he feels or believes instead of making caustic remarks just for the sake of campaigning. After all, it was he who had, and not too long back, urged politicians to end personal attacks for the sake of decency. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Omar Kibria, via email

				 																																																				Sir  The chairman of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Biman Bose, is correct when he says that the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is ignorant about the political scenario in West Bengal (Left tells PM to check with Advani, May 6). But he should know that like Vajpayee, most people in West Bengal are unaware of how the political system has been working for the past three decades. 				 																																																				Rigging and booth capturing are common in other states too, but not on the scale in which they are practised in West Bengal. Here the government itself takes great pains to ensure that people cast their votes in favour of the left. No other political ideology is allowed to permeate Bengal, especially in rural areas where a person sporting a non-CPI(M) flag risks physical harm. Such is the success story of the communists in West Bengal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  The prime ministers comparing West Bengal to Jammu and Kashmir and Bihar, when it comes to poll practices, is inexcusable and highly objectionable especially because the comparison was made at an election rally. By doing so, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has only substantiated the allegations of the Election Commission being influenced by political pressure groups unsympathetic to the left. 				 																																																				It is a pity that Mamata Banerjee agreed tamely with the caustic remarks made by Vajpayee. People will remember her once accompanying Rajiv Gandhi to the same venue  Deshapriya Park  when she was a selfless firebrand leader, ready to take on any challenge. She has now given up her principles to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party happy, only so she can retain her ministry in case the National Democratic Alliance comes back to power.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why does Biman Bose think that rigging by the left is such a well-kept secret that the prime minister would not have known it had Mamata Banerjee not told him?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The people of West Bengal have been complaining of large-scale poll malpractices for years now. Why did the Election Commission have to wait for so long to send poll observers to the state? In the event, the allegation that the EC was influenced by the powers-that-be at the Centre cannot be written off. Be that as it may, the ECs attention, coupled with some plainspeak from no less than the prime minister, ensured that more national attention was focussed on the state. But it is doubtful if the Centre and its poll observers could achieve anything substantial in the rural interior where the red magic actually works. In other words, despite Deshapriya Park and the EC, and despite Biman Boses somewhat unreasonable outburst, the left will have replicated its success again.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																Market moves				 																																																				Sir  The exit polls predictions of a hung Parliament have rattled the stock markets (Money exits stocks, moneybags rattled, April 28). The Securities and Exchange Board of India should come up with public awareness campaigns to educate small investors on practical investment options and behaviour. That can be expected to lend a certain amount of stability to the sensitive stock market. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suresh Behera, Ranchi

				 																																																				Sir  Predictions of a hung parliament have brought a lot of misery to stock traders and investors. The huge erosion of shareholders wealth as a result of the dumping of stocks is also giving sleepless nights to many. Will the announcement of the election results bring a respite?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

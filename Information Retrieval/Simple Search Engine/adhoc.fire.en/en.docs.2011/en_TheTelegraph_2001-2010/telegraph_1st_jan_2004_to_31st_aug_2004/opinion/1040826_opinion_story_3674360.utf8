		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 							 																						WHEEL DEAL 																														Blackmail is different from protest, although the truckers on strike seem to have forgotten the distinction. Or perhaps they have not. They cannot be unaware of the damage such a prolonged strike can cause, beginning with higher prices of almost everything in the market. About 60 per cent of goods in India are carried by road, so it is not just the sudden disappearance of bananas from the store or the unreasonable price of tomatoes that is at stake. The householders misery, significant enough in itself, is also an indicator of something else. The strike is likely to affect the economy more seriously because of its timing: inflation has hit its highest point in three and a half years. And a hold-up of this kind stalls growth  the nine-day truckers strike in April last year pulled down the quarterly industrial growth to 4.9 per cent from over 6 per cent between January and March. The blow to the industrial sector and exports is severe, with small and medium-sized companies, without delivery systems of their own, struggling to transport goods on time.																														The All India Motor Transport Congress, the countrys largest truck union, is co-ordinating this strike, in protest against the proposed 10 per cent tax on freight bookings. The union has rejected the governments contention that the tax would not affect truck owners or operators but only booking agents. According to the union, the system is too closely woven to make such distinctions and the difference between the segments is blurred. Apart from this demand, the union has presented nine more points, including the abolition of toll tax on national highways. But withdrawal of the proposed service tax is crucial. A sense of grievance is not a sin, but the lack of a sense of responsibility comes close to one. Each job has an inbuilt undertaking, and truckers have taken on a service that is essential to the economy. To hold the country to ransom in order to get their grievances registered is the last thing they should think of.

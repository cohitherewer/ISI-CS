		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 							 																						GAILY EVER AFTER																														The shock of the new is not always pleasant to all. The basic problem with same-sex marriage, for those who cannot accept it, is the radical strangeness of it. Visually, it presents the public spectacle of two women or two men unabashedly going through the rituals of what has been called the most fundamental institution of civilization by none other than Mr George W. Bush. Mr Bush had even wanted to amend the American constitution to save this sacred institution from deviancy and activist judges. Not only has this amendment not happened, but Massachusetts has also become the first American state to legally sanction same-sex marriages. In this, Massachusetts joins the Netherlands, Belgium and a few Canadian provinces. For the United States of America, this is as much a vindication of constitutional democracy as was the recognition of mixed-race marriages. (In some American states, it was illegal for black adults to marry white ones until the late Sixties.) Gay marriage has become the touchstone social issue in the forthcoming presidential elections, although the liberalism of Mr Bushs opponent, Mr John Kerry, otherwise a Massachusetts liberal, does not quite manage to accommodate married sodomy. But gay marriage has once again brought the politics of homosexuality back into the arena of the civil rights movement. It is not just the fear of HIV/AIDS, but the larger, and more fundamental, issues of equality, liberty and citizenship, as guaranteed by the constitution, which are at stake when gay and bisexual men and women fight for their human rights. This is not simply a question of sexual health, but of living as fully and freely as heterosexual men and women can choose to do.																														In India, homosexuality, confounded with sodomy by the Indian Penal Code, still remains to be decriminalized. The Centre had recently made it clear to the judiciary that nothing of the sort could be done, because it did not reflect Indian social mores. The gay movement in India is still largely identified with concern over HIV/AIDS. It is yet to be seen as a civil rights movement, grappling with questions of equality, marginality and representation in a democracy. Only the hijras have managed, in some states, to give to their sexual politics this wider, representational dimension. It is still unthinkable that, say, an Indian political party  however democratic or radical its principles  will make the abolition of Article 377 part of its public agenda. Indias polity is still many generations away from making the decriminalization of homosexuality an election issue. Indian homosexuals will first have to earn their right to exist with dignity before they can imagine living happily ever after.

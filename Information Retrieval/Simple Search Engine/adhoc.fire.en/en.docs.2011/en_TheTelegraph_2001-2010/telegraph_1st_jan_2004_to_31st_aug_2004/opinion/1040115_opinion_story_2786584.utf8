		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 							 																						BEYOND RECOGNIZED POSITIONS Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan				 	 Talking at last																								When they met in Islamabad, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf showed remarkable flexibility in their established positions on Kashmir and terrorism.																								On Kashmir, Pakistans position used to be that Kashmir is a dispute; that the dispute is about the self-determination of the Kashmiri people; and that it was to be resolved through United Nations resolutions.																								Indias position was that Kashmir is an integral part of India; that a portion of it is under the illegal occupation of Pakistan; and that the issue of Pakistan vacating its illegal occupation could be resolved through a bilateral dialogue.																								After 56 years, Pakistan has now agreed that Kashmir is a bilateral issue. It has also come round to the view that this dispute can be settled through a process of composite dialogue in a manner which would be to the satisfaction of both sides.																								The logic of a bilateral dialogue suggests, therefore, that Indias position has also become flexible on the position that Kashmir is an integral part of it.																								The Islamabad joint statement represents a movement beyond the Shimla agreement, in that a bilateral dialogue between the two countries has been agreed upon as the only means of resolving their differences. The Shimla agreement had stated that the two countries are resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means mutually agreed upon between them.																								Secondly, the Shimla agreement had said, In Jammu and Kashmir, the line of control resulting from the cease-fire agreement of December 17, 1971 shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the recognized position of either side. The qualification about recognized positions is not there within the new framework for starting the dialogue, as both sides have moved away from their earlier stated positions.																								If India is serious about a dialogue on Kashmir then it has to do everything possible to increase Pakistans comfort level on the issue. Musharraf has tried to make it very clear that he wants a serious discussion on Kashmir. If Pakistan is disappointed in this regard, then the lack of progress on Kashmir would ruin the normalization process.																								Musharrafs press interaction, barely hours after the January 6 joint press statement, indicates how important this issue is for him. He emphasized a simultaneity of movement between three issues which, he said, were linked  the progress on confidence building measures, the composite dialogue on all issues including Kashmir and Pakistans commitment to prevent terrorism from territory under its control.																								In the past, Pakistan has made everything contingent upon progress on the Kashmir issue. This is what happened when the last composite dialogue was held in November 1998 in New Delhi.																								So what does Musharraf mean by simultaneity this time? That it should not be that there is no movement on Kashmir while there is progress on other issues like Sir Creek, Siachen, trade and commerce? This may lead to distrust in the peace process in the other country. However, simultaneity need not mean progress at the same speed. If Pakistan is willing to allow a different pace of movement on different issues then this is a good sign and it could be the best interpretation of Musharrafs insistence on simultaneity of movement.																								But could it also be that he was saying that he still controlled the tap of terrorism and that unless there was a movement forward on Kashmir, he could always turn on the tap all over again? One can only hope that this is the worst interpretation possible of what the Pakistan president said.																								On addressing Kashmir, it may well be that the two sides decide that the issue needs to be first softened over the next couple of years. This will be necessary for generating public acceptability if the positions of both sides are going to become flexible. While talking about Kashmir, the two sides could ensure that expectations are not raised for quick-fix solutions. Only by increasing each others comfort levels on Kashmir can the two sides sit together and decide how they would allow this issue to play out.																								On the issue of terrorism, the positions of the two sides have also become flexible. Although Musharraf had given an assurance in his address on January 12, 2002, to the nation that he would not allow Pakistani territory to be used for terrorism and had also clarified later that this included Azad Kashmir, that speech was made in a multilateral context. At that time, Pakistan was trying to fight the international image it was acquiring of being the epicentre of Islamic terrorism. The present commitment, however, is a bilateral one addressed to India alone. It, therefore, acquires a different significance.																								India on its part also did not raise the issue of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Vajpayees inaugural day speech at the SAARC summit. The only context in which the issue of terrorism came up was that of Bhutan.																								In the joint press statement, flexibility was shown when Vajpayee said that to take the dialogue process forward, violence, hostility and terrorism must be prevented. Violence and hostility were given primacy over terrorism. In enjoining Pakistan not to permit the territory under its control to be used for terrorism, the language is also softer than earlier Indian accusations of Pakistan aiding and abetting terrorism. The new language appears to acknowledge that there may be actors, agencies and groups outside the purview of the Pakistani government who may be engaging in terrorism against India.																								Having recognized the concessions made by each side to the other, New Delhi will now have to determine whether this process is based on a single individual in Pakistan or is premised on a larger support.																								To sustain the peace process, Musharraf needs to broaden its support base and correct the asymmetry in the commitment to peace between India and Pakistan. The Indian political class supports the peace process as a whole. There is also the possibility of broad-basing the peace process further through the coming general elections and the campaign preceding it.																								This is also important because by December 2004, Musharraf passes on his second hat of chief of army staff. Many in India would wonder whether a weakened president can deliver on his commitments. Unless the political parties that matter somehow underwrite the peace process with India, its chances of long-term success are bleak.																								Another important question that needs an answer is whether this is a tactical or a strategic shift in Pakistans position. There is international pressure on Pakistan not only because of Afghanistan and North Korea but now also because of its alleged transfers of nuclear technology to Libya and Iran.																								To ward off pressure from the United States of America on these issues, some argue, it makes short-term sense for Musharraf to make peace with India. Domestically too, there is pressure to deal with the jihadis, and there have been assassination attempts against him. Musharraf needs to reassure India, through his actions, that this is a strategic shift in Pakistans attitude towards India and that the peace process will not be allowed to fall apart in a few months time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 05, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Like fathers, like sons				 																																																				Sir  As the lid went off on the scandal involving Raninder, the son of the Punjab chief minister, Amarinder Singh, it also unveiled a sinister pattern  of the next generation of todays political class getting involved in corruption (Scandal-hit Amarinder keeps quit letter ready). Some years ago, V.P. Singhs son was booked under corruption charges, and of course, more recently, Ajit Jogis son, Amit, was charged in a graft scandal. Is corruption the only legacy we can bequeath our future generations? Should men in power get so blinded that they forget to give their children the taste of an honest, upright life, so that the latter grow up knowing wrong to be right? It has been seen in the past that sons of politicians and bureaucrats indulge in criminal activities, secure in the knowledge that they can get around the law whenever they need to. The only way this vicious cycle can be broken is by snapping the link between dishonesty and the good life.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Purbasha Ganguly, Calcutta
				 																Happiness quotient				 																																																				Sir  The picture of prosperity that the statistics painted on the morning of the new year was impressive, but ordinary citizens like us find it difficult to savour the sweet taste of growth in most sectors of the economy (Happy India Year, Jan 1). The overall 8.4 per cent gross domestic product growth, an all-time high foreign exchange reserve must be indicators of prosperity, since experts say so. But all this has not made living any easier for the average Indian. All kinds of foodstuff, including edible oil and milk, and fertilizers, electricity, telephone, cooking gas, education, conveyance, cable television, medicines, virtually every daily amenity has been getting dearer by the day. But a commensurate number of jobs has not been created. While interest rates on savings have been slashed by more than half, politicians and bureaucrats have continued to prosper, thanks to their fat earnings by fair and unfair means. While wishing our fellow-countrymen happiness and prosperity, we need to ponder over where these two things will come from? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The monsoon has always been the biggest influence on Indias economy. In the year gone by, the economy recorded the fastest quarterly growth in five years. But this was largely due to a good monsoon, just as the growth-rate had slowed last year following extensive droughts in parts of the northern agricultural belt that resulted in poor crops. This year, however, good monsoon rains ensured a bumper harvest for the farmers, who make up nearly two-thirds of the countrys work force. It is not time yet to attribute economic growth to the industry.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Kumar Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar

				 																																																				Sir  Whenever there is any talk about the economy, the term that is used almost as a refrain is the feel-good factor. But how is one to feel good about these developments? The stock markets may be soaring, the GDP may be galloping, but the interest rates are low. For the man in the street (not Dalal Street), the last matters more than the first two, being more tangible, and there he finds nothing to cheer him up. 				 																																																				When economic reforms were first proposed by Manmohan Singh during the P.V. Narasimha Rao governments tenure more than a decade ago, it came with the assurance that the benefits would reach even the lowest stratum of society. The poorer sections are still waiting for the benefits to trickle down to them. Can the present finance minister prove that there has been a significant decrease in the number of persons below the poverty line? Or in the number of illiterate and unemployed persons? If not, what is there to feel good about, whatever the Sensex might say?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  With an unprecedented economic growth, a robust share market, over $100 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves and a booming information technology sector, there is no reason why 2004 shouldnt be happy India year. Every Indian should feel proud of the fact that our country is well on course to joining the league of the giant economies of south Asia. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If the Bharatiya Janata Party tries to cash in on the economic growth by calling early elections, the rural Indian voter, for whom the GDP figures mean nothing, is unlikely to bring the BJP back to power.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Snehangshu Sil, Calcutta

				 																Bungle in the jungle				 																																																				Sir  For the last few years, the loss caused by elephants in the Bankura and Purulia districts have been frequently reported in the media. The inefficiency of the forest officials in this matter is also noteworthy. The forests adjoining Ayodhya hills, where these elephants reside, have been cleared for different projects. The hydro-electric project under way may be lucrative for many but is upsetting the natural balance of this area. It is ridiculous that we continue to shout slogans about wildlife preservation without taking any action about it.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manju Mandal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Will the Assam forest department wake up to save the life of the harmless monkeys dying regularly under speeding vehicles near the Kamakhya temple, between Kamakhya gate and Maligaon national highway which goes to the airport? There are no speed-breakers here, nor signboards specifying speed-limit. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.K.Ghatak, Guwahati

		 Friday, April 16, 2004 							 																						MAN WHO KNEW THE MOUNTAINSHIMALAYAN VIGNETTES: THE GARH-WAL AND SIKKIM TREKS by Kekoo Naoroji (Mapin, Rs 2000) both de-lights and educates. Its me- ticulously-taken views of the Himalayas are really a trekkers guide. At the same time, they provide a magnificent gallery of photographs in both black and white and colour. This pictorial record with precise notes is the work of Kekoo Naoroji, who traversed the little-known routes of the Garwhal and Sikkim mountains in the Fifties, when trekking was not so popular, nor these areas at all well-known. 																														For Naoroji, it was important that a man know his own mountains. Although these ranges, and their glaciers and rivers, are Naorojis subjects, the uniqueness of life on the mountains is inevitably reflected in his record. It is difficult to imagine a temple such as the one in the picture located anywhere else but at Lokpal-Hemkund, above Ghangaria.

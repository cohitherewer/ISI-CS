		 Friday, August 20, 2004 							 																						WHEN FAMILY TURNS TO MURDER FATIMA CHOWDHURY																					The term, honour killing denotes an age-old custom in which a woman, supposed to have brought shame and dishonour on her relatives, is killed by member(s) of her family. Generally, the women are killed for suspected sexual activity outside marriage, even if they have been victims of rape. However, the violation of honour can encompass anything from a woman seeking divorce to challenging acceptable behaviour.																					Honour killing is no longer confined to west Asian and south Asian societies. Cases have been reported from Uganda, Morocco, Britain, Egypt, Brazil, Sweden, Turkey and even Italy. Globalization has led to the migration of not only people but also their cultures. And the prominent west Asian and south Asian diaspora is struggling to preserve its traditional cultural values from conflicting new ones.																					It is difficult to get reliable statistics on honour killings. This is because most of the killings remain unreported by family members who are either perpetrators of or active participants in the crime. The perpetrators are rarely punished and even in cases where criminal proceedings are undertaken, the sentence given is too lenient. But although honour killings are most prevalent in Islamic countries, it does not have the sanction of religious dogma. In fact, many Islamic scholars and leaders have tried to discourage the practice.																					On suspicion only																					Most victims of honour killings are murdered upon suspicion and are never given the chance to defend themselves. In some cases, women have been murdered for simply wanting to lead life on their own terms, for being opinionated and exerting their independence. Thus the roots of the practice can be traced to the status of women as property, rather than as individuals with rights and emotions. 																					In India, honour killing has a somewhat different dimension; it is tied to the rigid caste system. Both men and women are killed for violating the code of honour that extends beyond the family to encompass caste and community. In Uttar Pradesh, a lower caste woman was raped and murdered by higher-caste Yadavs because her son had married a woman of the Yadav caste and brought dishonour to the community. The number of honour killings in the state has been rising in recent years with Muzaffarnagar district recording as many as 13 cases in the first 9 months in 2003. Honour killing is also widely prevalent in Haryana and Punjab. 																					Dowry deaths have a parallel dynamic as honour killings, in that the practice concerns violence against women within the family and is seemingly acceptable in society. 																					Basic problems																					In todays world, honour killings seem unrealistic  even bizarre. The womens rights movement may have gathered strength, but the idea of womens emancipation is yet to be embraced by sections of society. There is also a reluctance by governments to frame laws and policies to deal firmly with perpetrators of violence against women. It is this that has led practices such as honour killing to persist.																					Acts of violence against women may elicit outrage, but outrage is a toothless dagger without a campaign to create awareness and encourage change. There is a need for more tangible laws and policies for crimes against women that are too often tackled with inexcusable leniency. 																					Civil society, international organizations and the media must help to change how women are perceived. For honour killings can only be eradi- cated by an effort to change the society that pardons such a heinous act. Murder committed to preserve honour brings shame.

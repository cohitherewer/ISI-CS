		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 							 																						NATWARS NATTERTwenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan				 	 Happy days are here again																														Over the last ten days, Natwar Singh has come across as a man caught in a time warp. He confounded the Pakistanis by his statements to such an extent that General Pervez Musharraf was prompted to call the former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to figure out what New Delhi was up to.																														After creating utter confusion for ten days, Natwar Singh tried to correct course. In a press conference he floated the balloon of a common nuclear doctrine for India, Pakistan and China, leaving everyone flabbergasted. India has a no-first use policy for its nuclear weapons, while Pakistan does not because it views its nuclear capability as neutralizing Indias conventional weapons superiority. Indias threat perceptions from China have no parallel with the strategic partnership that Islamabad enjoys with Beijing. There is nothing in common between the three, so why would they want a common nuclear doctrine? Or was this just Natwar Singhs way of saying that he is actually a friendly sort?																														However, it is Natwar Singhs Pakistan-specific statements that have created an ambiguity about Indias policy towards its neighbour. He offered unsolicited advice to Musharraf that he ought to consult his foreign minister before talking foreign policy. Would it matter to India if the General consulted his batman instead?																														Natwar Singh then announced that Sonia Gandhi would be visiting Pakistan. Did she really want to visit Pakistan and, if so, for what and when? Why was her visit announced even before announcing the dates of the foreign secretarys visit or the new governments Pakistan policy? The external affairs minister then claimed that Atal Bihari Vajpayee had not provided a roadmap for peace with Pakistan and highlighted Vajpayees statement about aar paar ki ladai (decisive battle) with Pakistan. He has constantly harked back to the Shimla agreement of 1972 as the bedrock of Indias Pakistan policy. He also suggested that the Sino-Indian model of freezing the border dispute to move ahead in other areas needed to be emulated in the India-Pakistan case.																														Natwar Singh created enough confusion to prompt Pakistans foreign minister, Khurshid M. Kasuri, to administer a rap on the knuckles, saying that the Indian leadership should observe a Rhetoric Restraint Regime to avoid misunderstanding and not conduct diplomacy through the media.																														One reason why we are witnessing this confusion could be because the Congress tends to see itself as the natural party of power. It sees the Vajpayee interregnum as a minor discontinuity in the natural course of Congress rule over India. The old regime has returned and wants to carry on from where it had left off.																														Had the Bharatiya Janata Party ruled only for a year or so, the Congress may indeed have been able to do precisely that. But Vajpayee lasted six years. Whatever else be his governments lapses, and god knows some were extremely severe, it nonetheless gave Indias foreign policy a definite direction. Therefore, claiming that Vajpayee did nothing is not going to wash.																														If the Shimla agreement is really the bedrock of Indias policy towards Pakistan, then why did the successive Congress governments not resolve the issues with Pakistan? Being in power for much of the time from 1971 to 1991, the Congress had ample opportunity to do so by dealing with both civilian and military governments in Pakistan.																														The Shimla agreement may have been a good document for the times it was signed. But things have moved on. There was no terrorism in 1972, the Kashmir elections had not been rigged, and violence had not yet been injected into Kashmir. India had not unilaterally changed the border situation by crossing the Siachen Glacier and occupying the heights of the Soltoro Range.																														Since the Congress last left power, several other developments have taken place. The Lahore process was initiated. It was a bold move in itself. However, it was followed by the Kargil infiltration and the failed Agra summit. After the attack on the Indian parliament on December 13, 2001, the two neighbours nearly went to war. The joint statement of January 6, 2004, in Islamabad came at the end of these low points in the India-Pakistan relationship. Each one of these developments redefined the nature of the bilateral relationship.																														It has taken the new external affairs minister some time, after initial bouts of denying the importance of these milestones, to come back on track and recognize that the process of redefining India-Pakistan relations has moved on considerably.																														The Islamabad statement of January 6 is, in fact, a major achievement for India and going back to the Shimla agreement is a clear regression. In that statement Islamabad conceded three things. One, that it agrees that all the outstanding issues between the two countries, including Kashmir, are bilateral and would be resolved bilaterally to the satisfaction of the two sides. There would, therefore, be no role for the United Nations or for the Kashmiris as the third party at the high table. Two, implicit in the statement is the recognition that both sides would give up their recognized positions and show flexibility (Pakistan would not talk of UN resolutions and plebiscite, and India would not talk of the entire erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir being its integral part). Third, that Pakistan would not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorist activity.																														In contrast, the Shimla agreement did not rule out modes of negotiations other than bilateral (it read: the two countries are resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means mutually agreed upon by them). After January 6, all other means, except a bilateral process, are ruled out.																														The Shimla agreement did not embody any flexibility on the known positions of the two sides (it said: In Jammu and Kashmir, the line of control resulting from the ceasefire agreement of December 17, 1971 shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the recognized position of either side). The January 6 agreement is totally flexible on this. There was no terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir in 1972, so that finds no mention in the Shimla agreement, but now India has even got a commitment on curbing terrorism as the intention of Pakistan.																														So why should India hark back to the clearly disadvantageous agreement of 1972? In fact, this would allow Pakistan to slip back from its commitments. Indeed, Kasuri in his statement of May 31, 2004, responding to the gaggle of statements from New Delhi, tried to do precisely that. He tried to bring the Kashmiris as the third party to the dispute by saying, Pakistan and India have put together the composite dialogue process to look at solutions that are acceptable to Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris  all parties to the dispute. This misrepresentation of the January 6 joint statement became possible because of the ambiguity created by New Delhi.																														Thankfully, Natwar Singh has now attempted to clear the air and restored the rightful place of the Lahore process and the Islamabad statement in the process of normalizing ties with Pakistan. However much he may want to break from the formulations of the Vajpayee era, his new initiative must not be a bold march back to the Seventies.

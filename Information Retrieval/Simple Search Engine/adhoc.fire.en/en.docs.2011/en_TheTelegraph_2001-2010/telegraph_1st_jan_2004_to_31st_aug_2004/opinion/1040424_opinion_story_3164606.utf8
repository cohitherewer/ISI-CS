The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 							 																						MAN WHO 																													KNOWS 																													TOO MUCH He started out with a 10-rupee note in his pocket. Now one of the countrys leading lawyers, Ram Jethmalani is pulling out all stops as he takes on the Prime Minister on his own turf WORD WISE

	On Political Parties: In a modern democracy, parties are a neccessary evil. But some individuals must dilute that evil. I am one of them
	On Congress: Congress has new brooms. And new brooms sweep cleaner
	On his Current Focus: National integration and improving the relationship between the two major communities in India.																														The scene is funny. A man dressed in a light blue safari suit is reciting an Urdu couplet as two gentlemen sitting on a sofa nearby nod in approval. If this wasnt Ram Jethmalanis Akbar Road residence in New Delhi, one might have mistaken them for a bunch of B-grade Bollywood writers finalising the screenplay of a tacky potboiler.																														Actually, the men are reading out from the first draft of what will eventually be the octogenarian lawyers open letter to the voters of Lucknow parliamentary constituency. Jethmalani listens attentively but is not too impressed. Yeh add karo that I came to India with only a 10-rupee note in my pocket, he volunteers, mixing bad Hindi with good English. The men are delighted. Achchha dialogue hai, says one of them.																														These are the brass tacks of electioneering. And, now that the Mumbai lawyers Hamletian dilemma  to contest or not to contest  is over, he is pulling out all stops. Dressed in a pair of brown cargo trousers and a crisp white shirt, Jethmalani looks far more youthful than his rival, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But thats an illusion regular early morning badminton has helped sustain. Jethmalani is 80, a year older than the Prime Minister.																														There are plenty of similarities between the two contestants. Both love the good life  good food, good beverages. And in the past, both have served the same party and the same government. But with Jethmalanis decision to contest against the Prime Minister, their 40-year-old friendship has reportedly come to an end. The lawyer-cum-Rajya Sabha member is bitterly sarcastic. He says, he is my friend. I have never seen any evidence of that friendship. But I have been a friend (to him), he maintains.																														His election campaign will focus on the lack of any visible progress in the PMs constituency. What has he done in the past 13 years? Nothing, he says. And, immediately turns to the men sitting in his drawing room, Write down that Gomati has become a gutter. And that the elected representative hardly gave his darshan all these years. The man in the safari suit smiles. Very good point, he agrees.																														Defeating Vajpayee wont be easy. But throughout his legal career, Jethmalani has been a crusader for lost causes. Arguing for Indira Gandhis killers, for those charged with the attack on Parliament, for those arrested in the Mumbai blast cases, and, now in the Best Bakery case  he has defended the defenceless and offered hope to the hopeless. Says human rights activist Teesta Setalvad, His commitment to human rights overrides his political allegiance.																														Jethmalanis politics has often shifted like desert sands. The lawyer, who rose to eminence in the famous Nanawati trial in 1959, first contested as an independent candidate in the 1971 Lok Sabha elections. He lost. But on the next two occasions, he was successful as a Janata Party candidate from north-west Mumbai. Later, he joined the BJP. And, now as an independent candidate, backed by the Congress and the Left, he comes full circle. The lawyer points out, Democracy is a swimming pool. Keep changing the water periodically. Otherwise it becomes a cesspool.																														Such straight talk is inimitable of Jethmalani. He is downright blunt discussing others. With the minister of justice being mixed up with Narendra Modi, how can there be justice in Gujarat? And, he is forthcoming about himself, I love good red wine and Black Label whisky. Few Indian politicians will volunteer such information before an impending election. Then again, If somebody calls me a ladies man at 80, I am proud of that fact.																														Thats why the term, maverick, has stuck to him. Jethmalani takes it as a compliment. It is someone who thinks independently, who has not mortgaged his soul or intelligence to anybody. I am fine with that appellation, he says. His illustrious public career has been dotted with public spats. As the Union law minister, he had an acrimonious quarrel with Attorney General Soli Sorabjee over Shiv Sena chief Bala Saheb Thackerays prosecution.																														It ultimately led to his resignation. But prior to that, says Jethmalani, he had framed a scheme for judicial reform. I sent that scheme to the PM and told him, I require your cooperation. The PM should have been excited. But after three months, he just wrote me a single-line letter which said, I have received your letter, the lawyer shrugs, disappointed.																														That was long ago. In his drawing room now, Jethmalani is still listening to the final pages of the long letter that will be distributed throughout his constituency. The lawyer is disappointed with the last part. You will have to rewrite that, he says. As he gets ready to leave, the gentleman sitting on the sofa nearby springs to life. Saab, mahaul ban raha hai, he says. Ram Jethmalani offers a weak smile. He seems to have heard that line before.

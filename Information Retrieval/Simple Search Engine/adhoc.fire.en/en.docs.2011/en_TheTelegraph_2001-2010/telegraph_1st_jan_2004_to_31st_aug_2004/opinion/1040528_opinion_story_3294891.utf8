		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						A BIT OF THIS AND THAT				 	 Too many wordsThe Last Song of Dusk By Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi, Penguin, Rs 250Hype has been unkind to many writers, creating a mystique that is almost impossible to live up to. Reading Brick Lane, for example, or The Impressionist, one was somewhat disappointed  for the books were pretty good, but not as great as they had been hyped up to be. It is much less often that one comes across something really puerile that has been hyped up to the level of a masterpiece. And when that happens, it is really annoying. Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvis debut novel is one such effort.																					On the day Anuradha Patwardhan was leaving Udaipur for Bombay to marry a man she had not even met in the twenty-one years of her existence, her mother clutched her lovely hand through the window of the black Victoria and whispered: In this life, my darling, there is no mercy. Thus, dramatically, begins Shangvis novel. Like the lovely Anuradha, we would like to know what exactly Mrs Patwardhan means. But life is short, and the women are lovely, and so much has to be made of the elder womans cobalt-blue sari with the gold-leaf border that we shall, alas, never know.																					We shall also never know why the international literary establishment has made so much of this overwritten, patchwork enterprise. If pretentiousness and publicity were enough, it seems, then Shanghvi is chortling all the way to the bank. 																					The young writers main talent seems to be in the use of five adjectives where he needs one, or none. Cuteness is preferred over directness. Anguish is intolerable, the telephone does not ring but reverberates, a wall is painted madpink, the sky is shamelessly blue, and Anuradhas song is of resplendent, tender measure. The word louche appears at least half a dozen times. Even as the Victoria kick-starts to propel Anuradha on lifes merciless journey, we are given another glimpse of Mrs P: erect as an obelisk but with the grace of a swan, the silken pallo of her sari drawn over her head: a sigh of sartorial grace. 																					As Anuradha leaves, we are told that a weep gathered in her chest like the white crest of a wave. And most irritating of all in this extravagant, unedited prose, is a house named Dariya Mahal that is supposed to have a nasty little mind of its own. 																					The pages bring together an absurd collection of characters, all of whom are legends in their own fashion: Anuradha, with her legendary singing voice; her husband Vardhmaan Gandharva, the legendary doctor; her aunt Radha-Mashi, who throws legendary parties; Khalil Muratta, the legendary painter, and Libya Dass, who is, well, legendary for certain other things. Oh, and Anuradhas young cousin Nandini Hariharan, a cat-woman and already a legend in her own right. There are also Anuradhas two children, Mohan and Shloka  one dying early, the other sent off to exile where, predictably, he is to tell the story. Virginia Woolf and Gandhi are also brought in, fleetingly, for cleverness: Woolf to be told to jump in (sic) a river or something and Gandhi commended on his chosen dress. And then there are the nasties: an old crab named Divi-Bai, her nasty parrot named Zenobia, and of course the sour old house itself.																					Shangvis prose is flamboyant and occasionally clever, but thats not enough to make a great novel. Its not even enough for a good novel. And although the story attempts to bring in elements of the fantastic, along with coy stylistic tricks  the capital letters, the talking parrot, the bad-tempered house  this is not magic realism. It lacks the lightness of touch; it merely juxtaposes the ordinary and the tragic, instead of fusing them into a seamless narration; and it takes itself entirely too seriously.

		 Friday, March 19, 2004 							 																						VOICES FROM THE DARK				 	 Upworldy mobileJourneys to Freedom:Dalit Narratives By Fernando Franco, Jyotsna Macwan and Suguna Ramanathan, Saumya, Rs 600																					Journeys To Freedom: Dalit Narratives by the well-known academics and activists, Fernando Franco, Jyotsna Macwan and Suguna Ramanathan, is a collection of recorded narratives of Dalit oppression and assertion in Gujarat. 																					The word, Dalit, is synonymous with discrimination in India. There have been numerous attempts to understand the causes and consequences of such repression, and to find ways to counter it. This book helps us understand them by giving them the opportunity to speak freely.																					Gujarat captures perfectly the current confusion of socio-political changes in India. Caste-based discrimination vies for space with the resistance of the oppressed. Adding to the problems of the Dalits are the damaging effects of globalization, limited state-support and a resurgent Hindutva. Yet, the authors show how this marginalized section of society has started moving towards freedom  both individually and collectively  by adopting various strategies. 																					The eight chapters offer a glimpse into the mechanics of each strategy. The first three deal with religious conversions by Dalits in Junagadh, Bharuch and parts of central Gujarat. Conversions to Buddhism and Christianity have given the Vankars and the Rohits access to the values of rationality, equality and liberty  necessary ingredients of emancipation. It has also given them access to education and employment. The influences of B.R. Ambedkar and the Christian missionaries can be discerned here. 																					Ambedkarite Buddhism, unlike Christianity, has given a distinct political dimension to the Dalit cause. The impact of conversion also varies in the case of the latter. Joseph Macwan, a Dalit Christian, narrates how the Roman Catholics, unlike the Protestants, have not been able to shed their Jati trappings. This incomplete break with the past has resulted in the grafting of a modern identity onto a resilient traditional society, creating an uneasy alliance. 																					The interviews with Vankar mill workers in Ahmedabad and the Rohits in Sabarkantha illustrate how employment and migration also play a pivotal role in the Dalits search for respect and equality. The Rohits have also used their landholding, education and entrepreneurship to attain social recognition. But such options are laden with problems  caste ghettoization and discrimination in the mills, and upper caste resistance to Dalit entrepreneurship. 																					The authors argue that it is difficult to compartmentalize the strategies of emancipation. For example, the cult of Ramdevpir has played an important role in helping the Dalits of Porbander carve out a positive self-identity while maintaining a degree of autonomy from the Brahminical tradition.																					Although universal, the oppression of the Dalits varies in intensity. The Valmikis are the most oppressed Dalit community in Gujarat. The book exposes the cruel means adopted to legitimize the suppression of this community  denial of education, allocation of menial tasks and social exclusion. 																					The search for freedom continues to evolve in response to social changes. Turning to the human rights discourse is the latest ploy. This has internationalized the Dalit cause and also given it an edge. 																					Certain aspects of the book deserve mention  like the elucidation of how the identity of the Dalits has been linked to their lived-in experience. This methodological premise questions the postmodern argument that identities, whether individual or collective, cannot be deduced from experience. 																					As a serious exploration of Dalit experience, it is strange that the study is limited to one state only. Also, suggestions to strengthen existing strategies of emancipation would have been welcome.						UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

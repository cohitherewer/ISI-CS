The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 04, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Behave yourself				 																																																				Sir  Thats it  the last nail in the coffin; Silvio Berlusconi, allegedly one of the most corrupt prime ministers Italy has ever had, giving a character certificate to George W. Bush (Bush normal: Italy PM, June 1). Berlusconi probably needs to be thanked for reminding us the criterion for judging normal behaviour among men  they need to have a family, be loving husbands and fathers. Even a child would be able to tell him that some of the most famous criminals in the world have been those who have been loving fathers and husbands. Commitment to ones family does not mean commitment to the welfare of other people. Had it been so, Italys normal men, who are also sometimes politicians, would not have been so corrupt. It is perhaps normal for Berlusconi to repose faith in Bushs normalcy at the most trying time of his political career. But after the election results are out in Italy, even he might realize that Bushs behaviour, as also his own, had been quite aberrant.

				 																All the madams men				 																																																				Sir  In Towards a joint endeavour (June 1), J.N. Dixit talks about the subjects that require the immediate attention of the incumbent government. He uses the words The Congress will no less than 31 times to formulate the course of action for the United Progressive Alliance. And yet in his all-comprehensive list of Indias foreign affairs concerns, Dixit manages to miss the most important one  Kashmir. Given that the Kashmir problem is widely known to be a creation of the Congress government in power in 1948-50, Dixits silence on the issue is not surprising. He talks about reviving the ineffectual Non-Aligned Movement. Does he really mean business?				 																																																				About the other tasks and responsibilities mentioned in the article, one could point out that if the Congress was unable to achieve them 40 years in power, it is unlikely to achieve them in the next five years. All activities of Dixits government would have to be vetted by the coalition partners as this is not a Congress government, which is why his mention of the Congress so many times seems unwise. Dixit served in important and responsible positions in his heyday and should know that forces affecting security of the country are so serious that stringent measures are required to yield the desired results.				 																																																				Yours faithfully.

				 																																																				Sir  K.P. Nayars Dangerous loyalties (June 2) is a preview to the turmoil that will soon engulf the external affairs ministry, thanks to the new foreign minister, K. Natwar Singh. A foreign minister is the key figure when it comes to a countrys international presence. Which is why Singh has to be immensely careful while making a statement. The foreign minister is perhaps forgetting that Sonia Gandhi may be the leader of the party which is heading the government, but Manmohan Singh is the prime minister of the country. It is he who will represent India before Pakistan. Singh had no business accepting Pervez Musharrafs invitation on Sonia Gandhis behalf when Manmohan Singh is around.				 																																																				The United Progressive Alliance should consider itself fortunate for being able to reap the benefits of the peace process put in place by the National Democratic Alliance. Whatever its objections to NDA rule, the new government cannot go against the process already set in motion. Whether, Natwar Singh will have any Indian foreign service officers as his advisers is not the issue. The issue is whether, as the external affairs minister, he will hold the same ideology as he did as a junior minister. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  There is no doubt that K. Natwar Singh is the wrong choice as external affairs minister in the Manmohan Singh cabinet. Singhs major disadvantage is that he has a Cold War era mindset, and if that is allowed to take precedence, Indias relations with the United States of America will suffer. That would be disastrous for India in the changed world political scenario. Singhs overzealous loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi family, that borders of sycophancy, is also dangerous. This was amply demonstrated by his statement about Sonia Gandhis visit to Islamabad when no such plans were on with regard to the prime ministers visit to Pakistan.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Delhi delinks talks from terror (June 2) clearly shows that K. Natwars Singhs pragmatic approach has prompted him to state his terms at the beginning. Our past experiences with Pakistan have not been good, but that does not mean we treat positive statements with cynicism. Although time will tell how successful the present regime will be with Pakistan, the proposed approach certainly seems better than the blow-hot-blow-cold relation the previous regime had with Islamabad. I look forward to the day when India and Pakistan will have soft borders and we can coexist peacefully as a people of this subcontinent.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Saleem Chaudhry, Oxford, UK

				 																																																				Sir  By his loose talk, K. Natwar Singh has managed to reverse the direction of the Pakistan talks. Is he working for the Indian government?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ajay Agrawal, Calcutta

				 																On dry land				 																																																				Sir  It was alarming to note that West Bengals environment department is backing a draft bill that will allow promoters to fill up waterbodies upto 10 acres in area (Water in peril, May 28). With this, the few remaining ponds that are like lungs to residents, face an uncertain future. Calcutta is being turned into a polluted, congested, concrete jungle. This unholy nexus must be exposed. The citizens must be made aware about existing laws which could be invoked to prevent real estate goons from forcibly filling up neighbourhood ponds. A media report on the existing waterbodies, especially those which face imminent destruction, and the terrible consequences for Calcutta will be immensely helpful. Politicians must clearly spell out their stand and the draft bill must not be another clever ploy to unleash a war on the citys environment. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prosenjit Roy, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The decision to fill up water bodies poses a grave risk not only to ground water levels but also to animal and plant species whose survival depend on the fast-disappearing ponds. This is likely to impair the already fragile ecology of Calcutta.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Somnath Ghosh, Calcutta

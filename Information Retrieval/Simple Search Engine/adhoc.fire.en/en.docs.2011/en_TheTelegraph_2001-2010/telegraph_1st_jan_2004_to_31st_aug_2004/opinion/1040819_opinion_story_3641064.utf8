The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 19, 2004 							 																						ENJOY THE PEEP- SHOW Gouri Chatterjee																					It has happened already, a fitting tribute to the media melodrama that marked the last days of Dhananjoy Chatterjee. The notices appeared within three days of his hanging on Saturday morning, announcing two jatras that promise to pick up where the media left off. See the hanging of Dhananjoy on the open stage, invite Natyaniketan in their advertisement for Dhananjoyer Phansi!, while Manjuri Operas Phansi Hoye Gelo Dhananjoyer may go further, though where we will find out in their next advertisement.																					Never before has the jatra writers task been so easy. All that a jatra needs  the overblown passions, the exaggerated dramatics, the mob scenes and the long soliloquies  are at hand, thanks to the media coverage over the last few days. 																					Journalism never was and never will be for the lily-livered. Not as long as one dead in a train accident is bad news while 100 dead is good, 1,000 dead is excellent news. Still, the ghoulish curiosity displayed by the press over the weekend plumbed untold depths. Every twitch of Dhananjoys eyebrows, every morsel down his throat, every thought across his mind  it was not journalism, it was a peepshow, titillating, but tasteless. And pointless too.																					To believe, as some do, that the passions raised over the last few days will help in the campaign to abolish the death penalty is utter foolishness. True, there was a shift in the mood last week of the public that had bayed for Dhananjoys blood even a month ago. But already, both the purveyors and the consumers of that news have moved on to more exciting things. 																					On Wednesday, a sessions court in Ahmedabad sentenced to death a rapist-killer while the Supreme Court commuted the death sentence of another rapist-killer to life imprisonment. Any bets that one would have to look hard to spot the reports on these two orders in the media?																					Dubious help																					While the media in Calcutta were gorging on Dhananjoy Chatterjees immovable feast, the Delhi media have been indulging their prurient interests in the Capitals gay community.																					The discovery of the bodies of a USAID official and his friend, both allegedly homosexual, on August 14 in one of Delhis posh colonies, has let loose a slew of reporting on the community that plays into every prejudice against gays. 																					For the press its not just a crime story but one that represents the entire gay community. The emphasis of the coverage has been on gay culture which makes it out as if homosexuals are forever scouring the streets to pick up prostitutes and spending all their time in top and bottom massage parlours and gay chat rooms. The fact that the two men had returned from a party shortly before they were killed has been made to appear as if all gays live a fast life. While pornographic VCDs and photographs of nude men found in the room with the dead bodies has been interpreted to mean gays are obsessed with porn. 																					Ironically, all this is being done in the name of highlighting the problems they face in Delhi. Its the sort of help  enforcing every stereotype one can think of  gays could do well without. 																					Best treatment																					If you thought all this makes it a very bad week for the media, you havent heard anything yet. Britain has just got a brand new news programme, revealingly called Naked News. Political bulletins from Iraq or Palestine are accompanied by a striptease by the anchor that begins with the jacket and the headlines. By the time she ends with the kicker story she isnt wearing anything but a microphone and a smile. What better way to treat the news, wouldnt you say?

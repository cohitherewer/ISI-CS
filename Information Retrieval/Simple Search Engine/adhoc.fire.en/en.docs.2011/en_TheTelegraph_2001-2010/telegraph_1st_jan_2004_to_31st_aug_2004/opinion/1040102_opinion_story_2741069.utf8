 Gargi Gupta				 	 Courage is his legacy																								A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband Daniel Pearl By Mariane Pearl, Virago,  6.50																								This book was written with an agenda. As the prologue says  I write this book for you, Danny, because you had the courage...to die with your hands in chains but your heart undefeated... to do justice to you...to show that you were right...I write this book because, in suppressing your life, the terrorists tried to kill me, too, and to kill our son, Adam...I write this book to defy them, and in the knowledge that your courage and spirit can inspire others. And the flourish at the end, I write this book for you [Adam] so you can be free.																								The quality of Mariane Pearls prose is important. It is lucid, metaphorical, direct, emotional without being morbid, and quasi-religious in the way it pits truth, justice, courage freedom, against hate, terror and senseless killing. The last might be true of much of the post-9/11 rhetoric emanating from the West, but surely, it was never used with more justice than to tell the story of the death of Daniel Pearl. 																								If the events of 9/11 were the grand spectacle in the pageant of terror, the murder of the Wall Street Journal south Asia bureau chief was private tragedy. In a world where gruesome, inexplicable murders are not rare, what moved millions to indignation and tears was Pearls image as an idealistic journalist telling his readers the truth as he saw it, who was ensnared in the very web of terrorism that he was trying to unravel. It was the story of one vulnerable man against an extremely efficient, impregnable and ruthless enemy. at once faceless and everywhere. That his wife, Mariane, was seven months pregnant at the time of his kidnapping must also have had something to do with the global tide of outrage, as also the fact that his gruesome decapitation was captured on camera.																								A Mighty Heart treads familiar territory  from Pearls kidnapping on January 23, 2001, to the news of his murder reaching his wife a month later, on February 21. On the one hand this is a very personal account, what the jacket describes as a profound and heartbreaking love story. On the other, it is a fascinating account of the search for Daniel Pearl, of how a team from Karachi police, helped and at times hindered by a motley bunch of the missing journalists friends, attempted to penetrate the many layers of the conspiracy surrounding the crime. 																								Who killed Daniel Pearl? The book by Bernard Henri-Levy hazards the theory that Pearl was killed because he had found out too much about the terrorists links with the security agencies in Pakistan. That may be so, but in India at least, thats almost common knowledge. Mariane Pearl does not go beyond the hows and the whos, into the whys. Indeed, that does not form part of her agenda. At best, she reveals the almost ubiquitous sense of conspiracy, the complicity between the terrorists and the security agents, especially the ISI. In the circumstances, it still seems strange that the warmongers against terrorism allowed Pakistan to get away rather lightly.																								It is the human angle that is important here, the private story of someone who lived through history, her courage through all the stages of loss, her anger, bewilderment and grief. What is amazing about A Mighty Heart is that it is never maudlin, that Mariane holds on to the ability to laugh at lifes little foibles, as also at her continued belief in human goodness, more specifically in the goodness, albeit ineffectual, of the common Pakistani. As she says, If I let bitterness overcome me, I would lose my soul and if I lost my soul, I would also lose Dannys. It is a very difficult thing to do, but Mariane Pearl seems to have made a marvellous job of it.						GARGI GUPTA

		 Friday, June 04, 2004 							 																						THRILL OF THE UNEXPECTED																														The cover of Jilliane Hoffmans debut novel, Retribution, claims that it has the pace to leave behind John Grisham, and the terror to scare Harris and the heroine of Cornwells dreams. Though the book does not exactly live up to these expectations, it is a good read for those who love thrillers.																														Hoffmans heroine, Chole Larson, is a young, attractive, intelligent and promising lawyer. She is raped one rainy June night by an unknown assailant, an incident which shatters her  physically, emotionally and mentally. But twelve years later, Chole is a changed woman  she has become C.J. Townsend, a tough and respected attorney at the Miami Dade state attorneys office. 																														But Choles past continues to haunt her. She is forced to confront her fears when a serial killer nicknamed Cupid, who has terrorized Florida, is nabbed by the police. But even as Chole begins her duties on the prosecution team working on the case, she realizes, to her horror, that Cupid is none other than her assailant.																														The novel traces how difficult it is for Chole to come to terms with her tragedy, and how she prepares to take revenge and get justice for herself. She is alone in this battle, but what pulls through is her belief  Just make it through today and tomorrow will surely be better. 																														Retribution is racy and written in an engaging manner. Just when things seem to become tame and predictable, Hoffman comes up with an unexpected twist. Thus, along with Chole, the reader too learns to expect the unexpected.																														One of the novels strengths is its well-crafted and gripping depiction of the proceedings in court. The scenes in which the defence lawyer, Lourdes Rubio, argues Cupids case, or Townsends interrogation of the irresponsible police officer, Victor Chavez, are constructed brilliantly. 																														However, there are several drawbacks as well. Though the book seldom lets the readers attention flag, it is too lengthy for a thriller. As a result, Hoffman tends to get repetitive and sometimes resorts to sensationalism. Also,the hero, Dominick Falconetti, and Townsend, seem to be the only intelligent and competent people around. The reader may well wonder what would have happened to Florida with a serial killer like Cupid on the loose, if it hadnt been for the two. 																														Choles characterization is also sketchy. Very strangely, she comes across as an attractive but rather helpless young woman who is always in danger and hence in need of a male protector.																														Despite these drawbacks, the novel raises several serious issues. It highlights certain inherent contradictions in the American legal system and questions the very meaning of justice and ethics. Those who love Grishams work will note  and appreciate  the parallels. But comparisons apart, Hoffman deserves every bit of the accolades she is likely to receive in her own right.						JHELUM BISWAS

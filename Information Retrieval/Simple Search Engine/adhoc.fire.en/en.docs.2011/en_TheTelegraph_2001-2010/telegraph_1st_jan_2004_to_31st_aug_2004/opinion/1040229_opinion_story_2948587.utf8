				 																																																																														 And quiet goes the don. Now that western Uttar Pradeshs alleged mafia leader, DP Yadav, has been banished from the BJP and saffronkind saved from taint, the parivar is highly agitated over who it was that tried to induct the black sheep into the family. There are two prime suspects  one, an RSS journalist who reportedly took DP to Madandas Devi, the RSS coordinator, who in turn recommended the don to the party. And second, the high-profile BJP gen-sec, Pramod Mahajan, who supposedly thought that the backward leader would help consolidate the partys position in the Ghaziabad-Hapur belt in UP. Yadav was to contest on a saffron ticket from Sambhal, formerly the seat of Mulayam Yadav, and win it comfortably given that the Samajwadi Party boss was unlikely to contest from it. The party, which now swears by Mahajans micro-management, naturally thought it was a good deal. That is, apparently, till the macro-picture emerged. With several criminal cases against him, this father of an infamous son and MP, who often reportedly found it difficult to get someone to sit beside him in the Central Hall of Parliament, would obviously add no extra shine to the party, it was realized. And hence the purge. But wait. The grapevine has it that the party has already found some use for this liquor don during the elections. And so quiet flows the don!				 																																																																														 The Election Commission has always had some passionate crusaders in its midst. The latest to make news (or to get them in order) is N Gopalswamy, whose major obsession is computers and the internet. As Union home secretary, Gopalswamy had taken great care to update the ministrys website and apparently spent some time each day to give instructions for the uploading of the site. As a result, the National Informatics Centre thinks the home ministry website is one of the best the country has ever had. The passion continues with Gopalswamy. In Nirvachan Sadan, he is busy updating the ECs official website, which, till his intervention, recorded KR Narayanan as the president of India!				 																																																																														 All of us love to crib about our bureaucracy  of the arcane and archaic laws that none can be expected to know, much less understand. No one, much less the babus themselves, know all the rules they are supposed to abide by. And now it seems, even the judiciary doesnt. Or how can Bhure Lal be nominated to the UPSC, when he also heads Delhis environment and pollution control authority? There is a constitutional provision that expressly bars UPSC members from holding an office of profit and indeed, the government refused to notify Lals new appointment until he had resigned. The matter remained in the courts for a few months until the hble judges gave it the green signal. 				 																																																																														 There is a buzz in South Block these days. A buzz of happy expectation, as our MEA babus lobby hard for a few plum posts falling vacant soon. The pick of these is the job of Indian ambassador to Washington after Lalit Mansingh retires in March. The competition for this post is still open but not that of Mansinghs deputy, which has gone to Rakesh Sood, Indias representative to the conference on disarmament in Geneva. Sood is to be replaced by Jayant Prasad, who now mans the MEAs America desk. Another high-profile position up for grabs is that of the permanent representative to the UN. TCA Rangachari, ambassador to Germany, is expected to fill it, with former MEA spokesperson, Nirupama Rao, replacing him in Berlin. Then there is the job of secretary-general of the UN conference on trade and development which is expected to come Indias way. The principal contender for this position is Hardeep Puri, at present Indias permanent representative to the UN in Geneva. But should Puri fail to pass muster, the government may bring in an outsider, Deepak Nayyar, currently vice-chancellor of Delhi University. Thats something our babus definitely will not allow.				 																																																																														 The BJPs ongoing induct-one-a-day programme has badly rattled the Congress. Glam-boys like Subbirami Reddy, Rajiv Shukla, Sushil Kumar Shinde, when asked to try their luck in Bollywood, threw up their hands and pleaded that the moment they began speaking to some star, the BJP somehow got wind of it and, before anyone knew it, had the star swearing allegiance to it. The standing joke in the capital is that the traffic has lessoned on Ashoka Road because whoever uses it, ends up in the BJP headquarters  to be inducted.				 																																																																														 The taste of success isnt sweet always. Not in MP where the induction of Laxman Singh, brother of Digvijay Singh, has prompted both Kailash Joshi, state BJP chief, and CM Uma Bharti to cry foul. Apparently, Umas bte noire, Vasundhara Raje Scindia, together with Raman Singh, Chattisgarh CM and Laxmans relative, had pushed the induction. Uma now wants Laxman to compete from Jhalawad Rajasthan, from a safe distance, that is. 				 																																																																														 Win nothing, lose all. Any idea, who were talking about? Guessed right. The Congress. Only days ago, it had Arif Mohammad Khan  camping outside its doors for days to gain an entry  crossover to the saffronites. But thats not what Congresswallahs are agitated about. They are seeing red over Sonias move to invite Khan, much hated by the minority camp in the Congress for his radical stand on Shah Bano and the Muslim personal law, for a tte--tte shortly before he made the jump. Minority leaders believe Arif used the meeting with Sonia to enhance his bargaining power with the BJP. The former hawala scam tainted minister is believed to have tipped off his media friends about the meeting. They were there outside 10, Janpath, when he emerged from the meeting to make his unkind remarks about the party leadership. Those suspected to have arranged the tte--tte, Ambika Soni and Ahmad Patel, are now the butt of much ridicule. Which means the Congress has got it all wrong again  fighting among themselves, instead of fighting their opponents.

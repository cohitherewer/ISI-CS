		 Sunday, January 18, 2004  Whose Honour is it anyway?
 - Powerful caste panchayats often stimulate violent reprisals  In northern India a woman is better  dead than defiled. Avijit Ghosh reports from Muzaffarnagar  on the spate of killings sparked off by love Price of passion:  Gang rape victim Radha (left) with her mother. Photo:  Jagdish Yadav  It was the longest night of her  life. A night that still refuses to go away. Even three  months later, those moments  being pinned down and violently  gang raped by men smelling of hate  continue to haunt and  torment her. This is our revenge for what your brother  did to us, Radha was told. Her brother had eloped with  a girl from another community in Muzaffarnagar districts  Basedah village. The 15-year-old sister was made to pay  the price. In several parts of northern India,  a communitys honour is often redeemed in such perverse  ways as revenge rape and murder. Here young couples are  publicly lynched, their severed limbs often delivered back  home. Sometimes they are forced to drink poison or pushed  in front of running trains; the murders being passed off  as suicide. Some are paraded nude in public, made to eat  excreta. The luckier ones are heavily fined or simply given  a thrashing and driven out of their villages. This is the  other side of India Shining. In these areas, lovers walk the  razors edge. Be it an inter-caste affair, or a boy and  girl from the same village attracted to each other, or someone  marrying outside the biradari (sub-caste)  influential  family or community members, with the caste panchayats  sanction and sympathy, often hand out the most barbaric  punishments to such violators of tradition and unwritten  social codes of the land. Its called honour killing; murders  committed to protect the perceived honour of the family  or community. And the graph of such violent  incidents is rising. In western Uttar Pradeshs Muzaffarnagar  district, 13 honour killings took place in the first nine  months of 2003, says an All India Democratic Womens Association  (AIDWA) report released last week. In 2002, the figure stood  at 10. In all, 68 young couples eloped in 2002. Of them,  35 were declared missing. Muzaffarnagar, strangely also  known as Mohabbatnagar, isnt the only rotten apple in western  UP. In other districts too, Meerut and Saharanpur, for instance,  such cases take place. The AIDWA report also estimates that  10 per cent of all murders in Punjab and Haryana are honour  killings. The slayings have a silent social  endorsement. Condoned by influential community members,  they are also organised by them. Nobody knows this better  than Yasmeen Jamal. Her husband Kaasif fell in love with  and married a doctor, Naaz Qureshi. Both were Muslims but  belonged to different biradaris. You dont marry  outside the biradari in these parts. The two were  shot on a March afternoon in a crowded market place. Yet  nobody was willing to be an eye witness. The only accused  is now out on bail. Three years after the incident,  Yasmeen alleges that the two were murdered by biradari  members. They promised me, they will not harm him.  But they betrayed us, she says in Urdu, speaking from behind  a wooden door at her humble home in Muzaffarnagars Khalapar  mohalla. With no support from the same biradari  which was so offended by her husbands second marriage,  she now sustains her family teaching in a local school. Even today many justify the double  murder. It was a form of insaaf. After all, it was  a question of biradaris honour. How can someone  marry outside the biradari? asks the owner of a  sweetshop in the market where the murders took place. His  view is echoed by other shopkeepers in the area. Far away in Jahankhela village  in Punjabs Hoshiarpur district, a similar mindset prevails.  Twenty-year-old Geeta Devis husband, Jasvir, was slain  by sword-wielding assailants last November, two months after  their marriage. His crime: he was a Jat who had dared to  marry a Rajput girl.  Both families had no problem with  the union. But many local Rajputs were angry that she had  married into an inferior community. You have disgraced  us, they would say and threaten us on the phone. Earlier  they had even announced a Rs 50,000 reward for anyone who  could chop off my husbands hand, says Geeta. The powerful caste panchayats   informal caste-based courts  dotting the region offer  stimulus to such brazenness. In 2002, in Haryanas Jhajhar  district, when a Jat girl eloped with a Dalit youth, taking  her sister along, the affair resulted in four deaths. The  sisters were killed, as were two Dalit villagers.  The caste panchayat organised  the defence for the accused. The increase in caste identity  politics has given a great boost to these formations, says  Brinda Karat, general secretary, AIDWA. With caste panchayats  also controlling votes, politicians seldom take a position  against them and are happy to patronise them. And in western Uttar Pradesh,  Chowdhary Mahender Singh Tikaits Jatland, where even police  chowkis get burned down during caste demonstrations,  the administration prefers to look away. Navniet Sekera,  SSP, Muzaffarnagar, points out that certain minimum requirements  of law such as a complainant and an eye witness have to  be fulfilled before the police can act. But as former Union  minister Satpal Malik puts it, The police and the administration  prefer to ignore it because they dont want to get embroiled  in sensitive community matters. Back in 2002, the Muzaffarnagar  district administration had formed an adult protection cell  at the tehsil level to make lovers feel secure. But  such measures seem to have made little difference on the  ground. Since January 1, 2003, 32 Muzaffarnangar couples  have filed applications under the Special Marriages Act  (SMA). Only one was accepted. The procedure of informing  the parents and investigating other issues need to be completed  by 30 days. Failing which, it is rejected on grounds of  being incomplete. The SMA procedure is too bureaucratic,  says local journalist Anil Choudhary, who has written extensively  on honour killings. Ironically, honour killings are  rampant in the more affluent pockets of north India. In  a report, women activist Zareena Khursheed points out that  many families do not protest against honour killings because  the victims property, including his share of land, gets  redistributed. The acquittals in such cases too are very  high, thus encouraging such violent crimes, says Karat. At the core of such violence in  these areas are residues of a strong feudal character in  certain clannish communities such as Rajputs, Jats and Gujjars.  Muslims, converted centuries ago from these communities,  share similar characteristics. Many still see a woman as  a symbol of a communitys collective and congealed honour.  Any departure by her from the traditional norm is treated  as sacrilege. There is a sense of defilement, says eminent  sociologist Yogendra Singh. It was this twisted dialectic   that a woman is better dead than defiled  which made  many kill their own wives and daughters during Partition.  And little seems to have changed since then. The first reported honour killing  in Muzaffarnagar district dates back to 1993. In Khandravali  village, a young Dalit couple was murdered. Since then Dr  Sanjay Singh, who teaches psychology in Muzaffarnagar, believes  there is a spate of similar copy-cat killings. One honour  killing becomes a model for another to emulate, he says. Not that everybody condones such  action. Local journalist Choudhary recalls that at a recent  seminar teenage girls spoke openly against measures that  stifled their freedom of choice. College student Nitin Agarwal  has a similar view but like most in Muzaffarnagar, he is  cynical about honour killings. They keep happening every  other day. What can one do? he says. With no political  party or social organisation ready to unfurl the banner  of protest, the dissenters have no option but to fall in  line. Or, die. Its a strange face-off between  the young and the old. Yogendra Singh says that due to the  impact of satellite television and other onslaughts of modern  life, the new generation in rural India is psychically  mobile. Which means it is not averse to urban notions of  love and romance. At the same time, these young men and  women are physically immobile, being rooted to a place where  those who control the community want status quo. What is  an act of social deviance for them is breaking barriers  for the youth, he says. Till both change, the law needs  to help out the lovers. An AIDWA resolution last week suggested  a simplification of procedures under the Special Marriages  Act, magisterial inquiry into the deaths of all women between  the ages of 15 and 25 in affected states and relevant changes  in law to encourage courts to take suo motu notice  of such crimes.  There should also be a ban on  all caste panchayat decisions which go against the Constitution,  says Karat. Interestingly, the Rajasthan Human Rights Commission  has challenged the fatwas issued by these caste panchayats  through its petition in the Jodhpur High Court. That is a welcome move. But, unless  more such steps are taken, the communitys wish will continue  to prevail over the individuals choice. Cupids arrows  will continue to cause the death of the young as the 21st-century  satellite television ardour confronts 17th-century feudal  mores. And in Muzaffarnagar and several other pockets of  northern India, love will remain a four-letter word. (SOME NAMES HAVE BEEN  CHANGED ON REQUEST)

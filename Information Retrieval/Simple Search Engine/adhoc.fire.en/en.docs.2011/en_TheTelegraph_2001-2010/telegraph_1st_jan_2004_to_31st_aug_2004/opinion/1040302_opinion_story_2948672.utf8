The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A day at the matches				 																																																				Sir  Will the Indian administration ever be able to do what Pervez Musharraf has already done across the border (Pervez tames cricket chamchas, Feb 26)? For those who have grown up watching cricket in Calcutta, the Musharraf story will immediately evoke the pains of the quest for that El Dorado called a ticket to the Eden Gardens to see a test match (later, of course, one-day internationals). As a student, I remember friends who had bureaucrat fathers or uncles going to watch the match, and that too from the coveted club-house stands, without having to pay a penny. Many of them had as much interest in cricket as a minister has in the masses. The decline in the quality of spectators from the Nineties could well be blamed on these freeloaders; they also set into motion a chain of corruption, with complimentary tickets being sold right outside the stadium. Doing a Musharraf will be impossible here, since there are too many people reaping the undeserved benefits.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sugato Roychowdhury, Calcutta
				 																																																				Sir  Although this will never be recorded in the history of cricket, yet the fact remains that in the last 50 years, every Indian captain who has been to Pakistan has lost his captaincy on return. The sole exception is Sunil Gavaskar who survived in 1984-85, but one must also remember that the series was abandoned midway following Indira Gandhis assassination. This ill omen has claimed players such as Vinoo Mankad, Bishen Singh Bedi and Krishnamachari Srikkanth. In 1954-55, under Mankads captaincy, all five tests were drawn and the captain himself put up a dismal performance with only 51 runs at an average of 10.20 and 12 wickets at the average of 33.25. In 1978-79, under the captaincy of Bedi, India lost two tests out of three. Bedi could manage only six wickets at an average of 74.83. In 1982-83, though Sunil Gavaskar himself scored 434 runs in three tests, India was drubbed 0-3 in the series. This time, Gavaskar lost his captaincy on return, although he survived the scare next season. In 1989-90, the team led by Srikkanth drew all four tests. Srikkanth had only 97 runs against his name from seven innings, besides getting involved in a fisticuff with a spectator. 				 																																																				However, Pakistan has proved a happy hunting ground for some Indians. It was in Pakistan in 1978-79 that Kapil Dev made his mark as a pace bowler; in 1989-90, the 16-year old Sachin Tendulkar made history by smashing 27 runs in an over of Abdul Qadir. Let us hope Sourav Ganguly and Team India come out of the Pakistan trip with flying colours, and Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan follow in the footsteps of Kapil Dev.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Basudeb Bhattacharya, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Isnt it time the Indian cricket team was asked to go on hibernation, even if a brief one? It has already been a rigorously long season for the players. A reshuffling of the players is also long overdue, especially in the bowling department. Replacements must be found for the likes of Murli Karthik and Ashish Nehra. The selectors must also wake up to the fact that no team has been able to carry on with a batsman-wicketkeeper, instead of a wicketkeeper-batsman, for very long. Of course, these words would not have to be spent, had our politicians better sense than treating cricketers as pawns in their sordid political games.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mrinmoy Goswami, Nagaon, Assam

				 																																																				Sir  It is ridiculous to start a series  especially one as important as the India-Pakistan series  with one-day matches (One dayers first, to lodge polls, Feb 22). The International Cricket Council should intervene and change the match schedule. Politicians cannot decide, or even interfere in, such matters, the two boards must do the job.				 																																																				If Karachi and Peshawar have bad records of crowd disturbance, how is Eden Gardens any better? But Eden Gardens is back to hosting international matches, so why cant Karachi and Peshawar? Whoever wins the series, it will not be cricket.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Improving relations with Pakistan and building people-to-people contact are noble intentions. But who will bear the responsibility in case something untoward happens to the players? The government ought to remember that the slightest hitch could send an inch of progress in bilateral ties reeling back by a few miles. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dhawal Hariyani, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  The prime ministers office did the right thing to decide to send the Indian cricket team to Pakistan (Vajpayee catches, Cricket wins, Feb 15). A refusal on Indias part would have been read as unwillingness to carry forward the peace initiative. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																Courting trouble				 																																																				Sir  As the election draws near, the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has begun walking the familiar path of wooing Muslims (Atal opens windows for Muslim vote, Feb 26). Wasnt it the Bharatiya Janata Party which had once accused the Congress of pampering Muslims for votes? Now the accuser stands accused of the same charges. Vajpayee wants to know what is keeping the BJP and Muslims apart. The answer is simple. The stoking of communal fires every now and then by the party has alienated Muslims from it. How can the Muslims forget the demolition of Babri Masjid? BJP leaders used to boast that no communal riots occurred in the states ruled by their party. 				 																																																				Even the Muslims had begun to see some truth in the claim, Ayodhya notwithstanding. They hoped that the BJP would become a responsible party once it got power at the Centre and would solve the Ayodhya crisis to their satisfaction. But then the genocide in Gujarat two years ago shattered almost overnight whatever faith they had in the secular credentials of the BJP. The observations of various Human Rights Commissions and the Supreme Court condemning the state government for its failure to quell the violence were ignored by the Centre. The culprits are still roaming free and the victims are yet to get justice. Muslims remember Vajpayees comment in Goa about the inability of Muslims to live peacefully with other communities. Vajpayees prejudice against Muslims is no longer a secret. Surprising that he has the gall to beg for their votes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Serajuddin Khurram, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why must A.B. Vajpayee use the improving relations with Pakistan as a card to woo Muslim votes? There is no need to be tacit, it is clear that he, and his party, equates Muslims of India with Pakistanis. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

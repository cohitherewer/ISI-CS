The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 11, 2004 							 																						TEXTBOOK CASE				 	 Facts of the matter																														June has always been the leanest month for book sales, but it is also the month when there is hectic activity in the editorial and production departments in preparation for the post-summer rush when educational institutions reopen after the vacations. Textbook sales in July-August account for almost 40 per cent of the total yearly sales of most publishing houses.																														But this year there is a distinct slack because syllabi are being revised or de-saffronized by the new government. How long will the revision by the Central Advisory Board of Education take? And will the revision of the social science textbooks, especially history, be substantial enough? But, more important, why does the syllabus assume such overwhelming importance in the Indian school system? Shouldnt broad guidelines of what a school-leaving student ought to know be enough? 																														According to reports, the CABE review will be done in eight to ten days. If this is so, then one can bet that it will be a crude scissors-and-paste job. A few paragraphs will be lopped off, and some line-editing done to restore balance, but the underlying approach will be untouched. For instance, all references to beef-eating and animal sacrifices to placate the gods will be erased and nothing else put in their place.																														But for the production, this poses a problem: the revised editions will have to be re-set and the proofs read all over again. Although production processes are now very fast, the printing of over 200,000 copies and their distribution take time. There is no way that NCERT, often called the school textbook publishers to the nation, can deliver the stocks on time. Even at the best of times, it has slipped in meeting demand  at least on time and in all the centres of distribution.																														The question often asked is why private publishers havent filled the gap. There are three reasons. One, it is impossible for private publishers to compete on price. While the NCERT fixes its price at 2.5 times the unit cost of production, private publishers do so at 4 times because they have to turn in profits. Two, no private publisher, or even a consortium of publishers, can handle the huge quantities required, and distribute them on time. Three, NCERT texts cover the syllabus as fully as possible and question-papers are more or less set from these texts. So, there is no need for supplementary reading: NCERT texts plus class notes will solve all mysteries. 																														It is the tyranny of the syllabi and the examination system that decides what books should be prescribed in most schools. If there is no place for imagination or a play of ideas, it is because the examination paper does not test these qualities. 																														People who dont know how the system works talk loosely about liberalization, and a free-wheeling syllabus that tests understanding and application and not rote learning. But such talk is meaningless when you get down to the nitty-gritty of what matters as you move up the academic ladder. Indian parents want their wards to know facts, facts and more facts, and schools just fall in line with them. So, the moral is, if you cant beat the system, join it.						RAVI VYAS

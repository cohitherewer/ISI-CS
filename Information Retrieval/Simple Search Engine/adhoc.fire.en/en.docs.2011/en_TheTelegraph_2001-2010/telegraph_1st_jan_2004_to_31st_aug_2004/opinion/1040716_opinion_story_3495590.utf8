The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 16, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																They sing of the life divineSeeking bauls of Bengal (Cambridge, Rs 295) by Jeanne Openshaw, based chiefly on fieldwork carried out in Rarh and Bagri, is an insightful discussion of bauls, their philosophy, creativity, way of life and practices. Openshaw moves from the background provided by literature on the bauls, through actual fieldwork material, oral and and manuscript evidence, to detailed discussions of philosophy and practice. Apart from the strength of the ethnographic research, new angles to the material have been provided, for example,the lives of baul composers as contexts for their songs. Twisted (Coronet, Rs 200) by Jeffery Deaver comes of a fairly rare breed, a collection of chilling short stories by a successful writer of thrillers. Deavers variety is admirable, even if every story does not quite make it to the same spine-chilling standard. But he does display the most prized virtues of the thriller-writer, ingenuity and style. Stories of stalkers who follow supermodels into their home towns after their retirement, women who decide to go out on dates with unknown men they have met on the internet, or middle-aged men who grow neurotic over their wives change of tone over the telephone the moment the husband walks in, have exactly the mix of the familiar and the strange that is the life of the good thriller. The Nagas: The evolution of their history and administration (1832-1939): a documentary study (Spectrum, price not mentioned) by S.K. Barpujari contains a valuable collection of documents that forms the basis of an extended analytical study of the long and nuanced relationship between the British and the Nagas. The set of letters of British administrators is also important, not only as documentary evidence, but also in conveying the drama that lies behind dry legalese and bureaucratic policies. This is an excellent reference book, giving descriptive accounts of various Naga-inhabited regions as well as the history and the evolution of administrative strategies regarding Nagas during the latter part of British rule. 																												Writing poetry (Unistar, Rs 140) by John Whitworth is a useful little workbook, providing easy-to-pick-up knowledge about the basics of meter, verse form and types of poetry, while concentrating on practical exercises to encourage facility in language. Surprisingly, the book is quite a lot of fun, for Whitworth writes with humour and even a kind of raciness. Dalit diary: 1999-2003: Reflections on Apartheid in India (Navayana, Rs 225) by Chandra Bhan Prasad is a collection of articles selected from his weekly column in The Pioneer. Bhans approach to the now much-debated Dalit question is through the reclamation and establishment of rights, his method being the recording of the aspirations of the Dalits. The Punjab story (Roli, Rs 295) with a foreword by K.P.S. Gill has been reissued on the 20th anniversary of Operation Bluestar. This is thus an old collection of articles and discussions by well-known personalities and journalists, such as Amarjit Singh, J.S. Aurora, Khushwant Singh, M.V. Kamath, Shekhar Gupta, Tavleen Singh and others. It is noticeable that the value of the book has in some ways increased, because now is perhaps the right time to assess the analyses and prognoses in the articles. A thought-provoking perspective to the background to and development of the events that led up to June 6, !984, is matched by the penetrating effort to understand what was going on in Punjab during and immediately after 1984. The book is particularly valuable because the writers were in some way or other deeply engaged with the tragedies in Punjab.

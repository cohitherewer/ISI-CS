		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 							 																						BATTLE FOR PEACE																														The battle for peace is not won easily. It would be simplistic, therefore, to treat the extension of the ceasefire in Nagaland as an annual ritual. A cloud hung this time over the seven-year-old truce until the very end. The Naga militants were suddenly suspicious of the intentions of the new government in New Delhi regarding their old demand for the integration of Naga-inhabited areas in the North-east. It would have been disastrous for Nagaland and the rest of the region if the suspicion led to the militants walking away from the truce. There can be no dispute that the fragile peace in Nagaland is so much better than the prospect of a relaunch of full-scale insurgency. But to be truly meaningful, the ceasefire must contribute to the resolution of the substantive issues. There are hopeful signs, though, that the National Socialist Council of Nagalim has moved away from its demand of an independent and sovereign Nagaland. This raises hope for an end to Indias oldest insurgency. But this has been possible also because of an increasingly accommodative position by New Delhi, which has come to accept the unique history and situation of the Nagas. Having come this far, both sides need to be extremely careful not to spoil the good work.																														However, the Nagas too need to be more sensitive to the problems that their demand for integration of Naga-inhabited areas could cause in the region. Acceding to the demand would involve a reorganization of the boundaries of several states in the region. Any hasty step on this could open a Pandoras box, as the violence in Imphal three years ago testified. Each state in the North-east has a diversity of ethnic groups and it may be neither easy nor desirable to impose an ethnic homogeneity in any particular state through an official diktat. Far more important could be a realistic strategy to ensure for the Nagas the distinct identity that all militant groups seek. The Union government could achieve this by reconsidering for Nagaland the division of state, Central and concurrent lists in the Constitution. The example of the Mizo Accord of 1986 could be useful in this respect. Even that agreement nearly failed because of the Mizo insurgents insistence on a greater Mizoram which would incorporate all Mizo-dominated areas in the existing state. The important thing for the Naga talks is to stick to the spirit of accommodation and mutual trust.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 31, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Games adults play				 																																																				Sir  Whether Michael Jackson is guilty of molesting children or whether this is a ploy to sully his image is yet to be proven (Jackson alcohol charge, July 28). But either way it is the children who are being used. If Jackson has indeed sexually abused his playmates, then he has taken advantage of the trust they had in him, and for this he cannot be forgiven. But even if he is innocent, adults remain guilty of using children as pawns in a perverse power struggle between a star and his ill-wishers. Whichever side wins, it is eventually the children who lose out  games no longer remain what they used to be.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,D. Ghosh, Calcutta 
				 																Manhandled				 																																																				Sir  Pushing out vendors from running trains or lynching petty thieves reflects the frustration and the sense of helplessness in the common man (Boy pushed out of women bogie, July 23). When hardened criminals carry on with their misdeeds undaunted by law, even in the legislature; tax evaders become celebrities who deliver sermons, the anger is turned on thieves and hawkers. While the real thieves go scot-free, common man is pitted against common man.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Those who travel by local trains during peak hours know that people often mistakenly board ladies compartments, but they move out as soon as the train reaches the next station. The women are quite tolerant because most of them realize the plight of the other passengers. Thus the case of Niraj Prasad was a shocking display of the wrong kind of emotions. Such incidents are however not rare. Women often choose to forget their humanity while protecting their rights. It has often been seen in the Metro rail that little boys are made to stand besides ladies seats while none of those sitting feels it necessary and human to offer her seat to them. Is the empowerment of women synonymous with absolute hatred for the male gender? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Burdwan

				 																																																				Sir  What happened to Niraj Prasad in the ladies compartment of a local train was barbaric. The incident only proves that women take undue advantage of their rights. In buses and trains, women often sit on seats usually occupied by men. There is no denying that men also occupy seats reserved for women. But these are promptly vacated when a lady claims her seat. The problem is that no seat is marked For gents and women often refuse to vacate other seats even when ladies seats are vacant. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sakti Biswas, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  What is being done to punish those responsible for Nirajs plight? Also, what is being done to prevent such incidents from happening in the future? The injured boy seems to have all but disappeared from the news pages.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Piyal Sen, Calcutta 

				 																Moneywise				 																																																				Sir  Amisha Patels case once again proves that the pull of money is stronger than that of blood (Bollywood dads beware, pushy papas girl has grown up, July 26). The star reportedly slapped a legal notice on her father for mishandling her Rs 12 crore property. Hopefully, Patel knows that money cannot buy her everything, especially parental love. By her actions, she has not only brought shame on her family but has also degraded herself. It would do her good if she realized that her parents are worth more than all the money in the world.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  The family drama between Amisha Patel and her father shows that stars themselves do not practice the kind of righteousness that Bollywood depicts in movies. The face-off between father and daughter makes a mockery of the values Indian films are trying to hold dear. Only time will tell if the star is right or her father. But the bottom line is that when it comes to either power or pecuniary interests, success debases man. It would have been better had the matter been kept within the Patel family. Yours faithfully, 
Priyanka Gogoi, Guwahati

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 							 																						BIRTHDAY BASH																														It was to be the usual pre-poll jamboree in the prime ministers constituency. But Mr Lalji Tandons birthday bounty led to a horrific tragedy in Lucknow on Monday. The death of 25 women and a child in a stampede for free saris is not just a terrible mishap. It brings out  in all its details and in a truly appalling scale  the debasement of political culture, to the level of a kind of obscenity, from which the Indian democracy draws its most vital energies. The Lucknow tragedy is the obscene flip side of opportunistic populism. The spectacle of thousands of miserably poor women waiting for hours in the heat of a north-Indian noon for forty-rupee saris to be tossed at them by a local politician is grotesque enough without the stampede. (Most Indians are too jaded with such spectacles to find anything grotesque about such an incident. It might even have been a vibrant moment in the ongoing circus of the elections.) But the details of what followed merit a review. As Mr Tandons supporters started throwing out the saris, the crowd pressed forward. A boy tried to grab more than one, which incensed the crowd. The police charged with their lathis and the crowd started running. And then a few more saris were thrown at the crowd. So, from that point, the crowd was both running away from the police and trying to grab a sari at the same time. This was when the stampede became fatal, and those who survived had their last glimpse of a shower of legs before being trodden down. To be trapped thus between the fear of a lathi and the desire for a sari was possibly a nadir in the history of these womens human dignity  in itself, a near extinction of the human. It is this combination of extreme deprivation and the last indignity upon which Mr Tandons celebration of his own largesse was founded. And this is what makes this episode so symbolically hideous.																														The Election Commission will, of course, have to ponder the technicalities of Mr Tandons conduct. Was it bribery or unlawful assembly? The prime minister will have to talk to his campaign manager and spin doctors. But the Bharatiya Janata Party will not feel particularly threatened in its poll prospects  the Congress can never quite manage to do much with such opportunities, and the Samajwadi Party is almost a friend. Besides, those wretched women had come for a free sari, and their families have now ended up with more than two lakh each  if the middlemen do not swallow up most of the money. So, the bounty of the state remains undimmed.

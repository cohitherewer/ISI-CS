The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 							 																						HARD LUCK																														Examinations are not supposed to be fatal. Nor are they meant to test the nerves. They ought to be a fair means of evaluating the examinees abilities in a certain subject. But something seems to have gone terribly wrong with the Madhyamik English papers this year in West Bengal. First, the paper was riddled with disgraceful printing errors. To regard these spelling and grammatical mistakes as typos would be the most charitable interpretation. It is a more frightening thought that the errors were not noticed at all by the paper-setters and moderators. If that is so, then the teaching and testing of English are in the hands of scandalously inept people. Given the wrongly-stapled Physics papers in some districts, there is also an unforgivable carelessness in the system that needs to be acknowledged and rectified.																														The more grievous irresponsibility lies in setting an English paper which was perceived by most students, teachers and educationists as unfairly difficult. Some of the questions were incomprehensible within the standard of English expected of the examinees. English is a particularly sensitive and fraught area, where some of the most irredeemable blunders have been committed over decades by the West Bengal government. It is a subject that exposes most starkly the inequalities perpetuated by the states system of education. English-teaching, and its ideological foundations in Bengal, have fostered disadvantages that could strike a kind of terror or despair in the hearts of young students, the failure to understand which would amount to a fundamental shortcoming in the system. Two suicides, both of them in the districts, point to something that the government and educationists in the state cannot look away from any more. Blaming paper-setters and moderators and then compensating the students by lenient marking are the worst possible ways of addressing the problem. The board will have to ask itself radical questions about its most basic assumptions regarding the teaching and testing of English. They will also have to understand the immense human and professional responsibility they are invested with when conducting something like the secondary examinations.

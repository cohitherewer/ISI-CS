The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 							 																						HEIGHT OF BAD FORMBy its silence on the new government the BJP leadership has exposed its essentially 
anti-democratic character Bad losers provide great entertainment, because they make clowns of themselves. The Bharatiya Janata Party excelled in this particular brand of folly after the incontestable results of the 14th Lok Sabha elections were published. All its claims to Indian culture and tradition were demolished by the absurd dramatics of its leaders, which underlined the only culture the BJP could rightfully lay claim to, that of self-importance. It tried desperately to rally around its old and already discredited election mantra of Ms Sonia Gandhis foreign origin and allowed the hysterical drama of Ms Sushma Swaraj and Ms Uma Bharti full play on the national stage. Even the exiled Mr K. Govindacharya reappeared with a newborn Rashtriya Swabhiman Andolan, convinced that swabhiman was the BJPs property and that it was the partys sacred duty to teach a poor benighted nation of a billion people exactly what it meant. None of this was unplanned. It was decided in a meeting that the likes of Ms Swaraj, Mr Govindacharya and Ms Bharti would be displayed as individuals expressing their private feelings, while other leaders would concentrate on protests and marches to keep the disturbance alive. And all this to represent the feelings of a people who had rejected them. The BJP knows best, of course, never mind what the ballot said.																														If this was entertaining, the silence of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mr L.K. Advani and the other BJP leaders of note, was not. That was more than disappointing. An unexpected defeat may be difficult to swallow, but the test of statesmanship lies in grace at moments of loss. Once again, if the BJP had ever really studied ancient Indian culture and tradition, this would have been the first lesson it would have learnt. There was no effort on the part of the leaders to speak up, or even pretend that what the hysterical individuals in their party did had nothing to do with the BJP. It was an official decision of the National Democratic Alliance that except for Mr Vajpayee, no one would attend the swearing-in ceremony should Ms Gandhi become prime minister. This was not just ugliness, it was a serious breach of constitutional etiquette. The silence of the leaders grew even deeper when Ms Gandhi refused the honour. While leaders from the lower ranks, like Mr Narendra Modi, grimaced cheerily and said they were relieved and it was they who had achieved this good for the nation, not a peep drifted down from the cloudy reaches of the BJPs uppermost echelons.																														Although all this is a combination of amusing hysterics and shocking bad manners, it is also something far graver. If it is to be granted, as the BJP is arguing frenziedly, that the mandate was not for Ms Gandhi as prime minister, even though, by some cataclysmic miscalculation, it was for the Congress, then the decision had to be left to the people once again. By behaving the way it has, the BJP has displayed its disrespect for the peoples verdict, for all democratic principles and the Indian Constitution. And it has clutched on to the only thing it ever knew, the politics of hate. It is to be hoped that after this little exhibition, the new government will know what to expect.

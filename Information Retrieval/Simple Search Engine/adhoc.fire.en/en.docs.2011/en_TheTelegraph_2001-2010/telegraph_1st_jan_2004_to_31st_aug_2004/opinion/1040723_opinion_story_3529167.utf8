The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 23, 2004 							 																						TALK ANYWHERE																														There is always cause for hope. India and Pakistan have agreed to sustain the process of dialogue. Yet it is unfortunate, however, that the meeting of the council of ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation at Islamabad has once again been reduced to a forum for the discussion of India-Pakistan issues. It is heartening, of course, that the external affairs minister of India, Mr K. Natwar Singh, and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, have agreed to continue with all aspects of the composite dialogue. They have also set fresh dates in September when they will meet again to review the progress made in the talks so far. Given the fragility of India-Pakistan relations, even a commitment to continue to talk must be seen as a positive outcome. In addition, if newspaper reports, quoting official sources, are good evidence, there seems to have been a realization that there can be no quick fix to the complicated problems that exist between New Delhi and Islamabad. Therefore, it is vitally important to remain engaged with each other despite the many irritants and problems that still threaten to derail relations once again. It seems that there is a willingness also on both sides to re-open the consulates at Mumbai and Karachi quickly, and restore the staff strength at the respective high commissions in New Delhi and Islamabad. The strength at the missions was drastically reduced after the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. 																														All this is good news. However, it will be premature to believe that Indias relations with Pakistan have turned the corner. Violence seems to have been escalating in Jammu and Kashmir for the past few weeks. Indeed, the deputy chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir narrowly escaped being killed twice in the last ten days. It is believed that infiltration has also increased and there seems to be a revival of terrorist training camps across the border. There seems to be some evidence of continued support of the Pakistan army for terrorist groups. Indeed, differences over Pakistans role and support for terrorism were reflected in the discussions between the two foreign ministers. While Mr Kasuri said that Pakistan had done what it could to reign in freelance jihadi elements, India obviously feels that this is not good enough. In any case, while there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the future of the continuing dialogue, it is sad, if not altogether surprising, that SAARC has once again been dominated by India-Pakistan dialogue. This needs to change, if south Asian economic cooperation has to have any real meaning.

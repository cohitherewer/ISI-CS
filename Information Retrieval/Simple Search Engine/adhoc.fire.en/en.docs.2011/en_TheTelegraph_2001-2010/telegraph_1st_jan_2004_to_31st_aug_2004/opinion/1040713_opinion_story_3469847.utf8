The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 							 																						GOING FOR A TOTAL RECALL Nirmalendu Bikash Rakshit																					Four governors  Vishnu Kant Shastri in Uttar Pradesh, Kailashpati Mishra in Gujarat, Babu Paramanand in Haryana and Kidar Nath Sahni in Goa  were dismissed by presidential order on July 2. National Democratic Alliance appointees, they had been given feelers to quit office after the new government took over. They did not oblige, and their alleged interest in opposition-politics made their stay increasingly untenable. Their close links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is now believed to be a reason for their untimely sacking, which Arun Jaitley calls a gross constitutional impropriety. 																					However, as per the Constitution, the Centre can dismiss a governor whenever it deems fit. Article 156 (1) says, The governor holds office during the pleasure of the president. Of course, the governor may, under Article 156 (2), resign whenever he chooses. But unless he does so or is dismissed, he can, as Article 156 (3) indicates, serve a five-year term. He may also be transferred. 																					The Constitution contains no provisions regarding the retirement age of governors unlike Supreme Court and high court judges and functionaries like the chief election commissioner. The Constitution also does not determine the grounds for and procedure of the governors removal. It is left entirely to the whim of the president, or rather, that of the Central cabinet. Thus the president can, at any time, remove a governor without giving any reasons for it. Or the governor may be removed if he fails to act upon the instructions of the president or the Central cabinet. 																					As you like it																					In the Hargovind versus Raghukul Tilak (1979) case, the Supreme Court had, however, adjudged that, His [The governors] office is not subordinate or subservient to the government of India. Nor is he acceptable to them for the manner in which he carries out his functions and duties. But realistically speaking, there is no escaping the fact that the procedure of his dismissal takes away a lot of the governors independence. 																					Take the way 14 governors were dismissed in one swoop in 1989 by the president on the advice of the National Front government under V.P. Singh because it apprehended that it would not get along with these Congress-appointed governors. More recently, M.S. Thomas in Nagaland and Fatima Bibi in Tamil Nadu were sacked for allegedly defying Central directives. In both cases, the legality of the Centres actions was hardly challenged. Clearly, the constitutional provision suits the Centre.																					The provision actually also benefits the state. If the state cabinet disagrees with the governor, it may pressurize the Union to withdraw him. If the demand is strident, or if the state government has the potential to disrupt Union-state amity, the Centre may recall or transfer the governor. In 1969, the United Front government in West Bengal clamoured for Dharma Viras removal, and the Centre had to shift him to Karnataka. 																					High chair																					Transfer of a governor is often tantamount to his dismissal because he may find it difficult to assume office in a state that is far off or disturbed. To ensure that the holder of such a high office as the governor is able to maintain his independence, the Sarkaria commission suggested that governors be allowed to have an uninterrupted tenure of five years other than in exceptional cases. If the Centre wished to sack the governor, he would have to be given the opportunity to explain his conduct. 																					The position of governor becomes particularly difficult when there are different political parties at the helm in the Centre and in the state. If the governor sides with the state, he may be removed and if he acts in accordance with the Centre, he may earn the wrath of the ruling party in the state, and may even be recalled under pressure from the latter. But if changes are to be made in the Raj Bhavan with every change at the Centre, it does not augur well for democracy. It also undermines the dignity of the gubernatorial office. A constitutional reform is thus necessary to give the governor more job security and uphold the dignity of his office.

It is not merely the NRIs money that India needs but their ideas and suggestions for the countrys growth and development, writes S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve Bank of India More than a jamboreeThe Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas held late last month was the occasion for many debates in the media on what the non-resident Indian contributes to India, what he can be expected to contribute and what he expects from India. Heated discussions took place on television between eminent NRIs such as Meghnad Desai and Indian commentators on the issue. Desai, an eminent NRI economist based in the London School of Economics, was brutal in his comment that NRIs do not necessarily owe anything to India. They had to leave India because they did not have the means of sustenance and had to search for ways to keep themselves alive. In a way, the hordes of emigrants to the West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius and Fiji represent people who left India because of its poverty. They flourished in their host countries by dint of hard labour, albeit under severe work conditions. They return to India, if at all, in search of their roots and for emotional support. They cannot be expected to contribute to Indias development, except for commercially valid reasons. They will send money to India if its returns are better than elsewhere and are less risky. So much for the diasporas support to Indias growth process!One of the debates on the TV channels centred around the relative inability of NRIs to contribute to Indias economic growth compared to the more hefty contributions of non-resident Chinese to the growth of China. The explanation lies mainly in the fact that Indias diaspora  when not indentured labour  is basically in the professional occupations, like doctors and professors, while Chinese expatriates cover a wider spectrum of occupations, including business and trade. Many of them developed business opportunities whereas NRIs started doing so only in recent decades. There is also the explanation that much of the Chinese diasporas investment in China reflects the roll-over of funds transmitted from mainland China to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Be that as it may, the NRIs found themselves at the receiving end of some criticism from uncharitable commentators that they had not been as patriotic as their Chinese counterparts. It is, however, a moot question how patriotism is to be defined for an NRI. Does he owe his patriotic duty to the country of his adoption or of his roots? Is he to be patriotic to the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Fiji, or to India? The answer is unambiguously the former.The Pravasi Diwas was an opportunity for Indias rulers to announce how great India was; India shining was the message, although many of the NRIs were hardnosed enough to see through the advertising gimmicks. They have grown rich the hard way and are professional enough to analyze the data in an objective manner. The Diwas was rather an indication of how keen the Indian government was to convince the NRIs that India is the right destination for their wealth, not only for emotional but also for economic reasons.The NRI boom has been in the works for many years. The rise of the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management led to the emergence of a crop of intellectually keen and accomplished Indian youth who were targetted by high-tech industries in the US and the UK. Not for nothing is it pointed out that nearly 30 to 40 per cent of the professionals in many high-tech software companies in the US are from India. Silicon Valley is full of companies, launched and run successfully  mostly  by Indian technical personnel. It is also a fact that NRIs are today an upwardly mobile lot in the US. They not only enjoy high levels of income, but are also socially highly respected. Many of them wield considerable influence.It is therefore natural that the government of India has, over the last two years, called a conference of NRIs with a view to sharing experiences and seeking their involvement in Indias economic progress. NRIs have come in large numbers to attend the conference. But, many of them have been rather frank in their opinions. If India needs their involvement  in the sense of investments of money and time  the industrial set-up as well as governments have to be more hospitable. The pains of starting and running a business in India are too well known. All the reforms of the Nineties have not yet smoothened the process. It is easy to dismiss NRI criticism as arrogance. Fortunately, such an approach no longer typifies the response of Indian rulers. They are only too willing to listen to and learn from their visiting cousins. Rightly so. After all, we have to find out what it is that makes our NRIs shine so bright in the countries they reside in. What makes Swraj Paul the successful steel manufacturer that he is? Or, for that matter, what makes L.N. Mittal succeed in his multi-billion dollar steel business as he acquires more and more industries by the day?The answers should be both inspiring and instructive. The bureaucracy of India  I include the political structure  should lend an eager ear to the Swraj Pauls, the Lord Bagris and the L.N. Mittals when they speak about the hurdles they face in India and the comparative ease with which they start and own businesses in their home countries. There must be lessons galore to be learnt from their experience  if only we have the will to learn and correct ourselves.For one thing, these NRI achievers were able to demonstrate, by their hard work and the application of their intellect, that they deserved financial support. Banks and financial institutions in the US and the UK were willing to risk financing their entrepreneurial activities, including their acquisitions. The amounts were lent at reasonable rates and under not-too-severely-restrictive conditions. Similarly, they were able to expand their activities without seeking too many bureaucratic approvals. The capital markets were easy to access, albeit strict assessors of success. In short, there was an investor-friendly environment. There was no question of a single window clearance because the doors themselves were open.Innovation succeeds in a society in which innovators are respected and rewarded. That explains why an Amartya Sen goes on to win a Nobel Prize in the US, while he might have slogged on as a lecturer in India.NRIs have a lot more to contribute to India than their wealth  although that is admittedly substantial. They have been depositing their money with Indian banks in substantial measure. Indeed, these remittances are the bulwark of Indias balance of payments. What we need is more than money  their participation in Indias development and growth process through their ideas and suggestions. That will be much more rewarding than the consultants reports gathering dust in many offices in India.Time was when the government of India actively encouraged interaction with NRIs through the India Investment Centres abroad and in India. The IIC was started by the former minister of finance, T.T. Krishnamachari. It has been diluted  if it survives at all  in the post-91 austerity drives. There is need not only to hold periodic Pravasi Diwases, but also to attract and cultivate NRIs. Here, IICs can play a useful role in facilitating a communication of ideas and suggestions and in solving problems faced by NRIs and other investors.Hopefully, the Pravasi Diwas will not be a one-off affair  a jamboree held every year, but forgotten afterwards. There is need to maintain a continuous link with our prosperous and successful NRI brethren. We need to revive the IIC under an imaginative professional leadership. The NRIs should be made to realize that they belong to India and are not not required in India. After all, Mahatma Gandhi was an NRI of eminence who brought freedom to India and the Indian National Army of Subhas Chandra Bose had a large contingent of NRIs supporting it. It is time to recall the NRIs who are an important resource for India.

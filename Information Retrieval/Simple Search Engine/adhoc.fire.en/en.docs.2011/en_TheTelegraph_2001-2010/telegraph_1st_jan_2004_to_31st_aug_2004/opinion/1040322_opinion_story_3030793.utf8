		 Monday, March 22, 2004 							 																						GOOD RELATIONS																														It is not surprising that the decision of the United States of America to designate Pakistan as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally has caused widespread dismay in India. It would be unfortunate, however, if New Delhi let this decision seriously impact on Indias relations with the US. There is no doubt that the decision, announced by the US secretary of state, General Colin Powell, during his visit to Pakistan, will give a boost to President Pervez Musharrafs regime. Moreover, it could greatly enhance future military-to-military relations between Washington and Islamabad. Pakistan would join a select group of countries after the formal designation. Among others, Israel, Japan and Australia are also non-NATO allies of the US. New Delhis disappointment has been caused by several factors. Most important, General Powell, who was in India before travelling to Pakistan, did not let his Indian interlocutors know that he would be making such an announcement in Pakistan. Although it is being claimed by some American sources that the decision was made in Islamabad itself, this assertion is not at all credible. Such a strategically significant decision must have been thoroughly vetted in Washington and made after consulting all the agencies concerned. Moreover, the decision  at least in some Indian eyes  seems tantamount to rewarding bad behaviour. It comes soon after the disclosures about Mr Abdul Qadeer Khans leaking of nuclear secrets to countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya. These are countries that have caused deep concern to the US. In addition, it is still not clear if Pakistan has put a permanent end to sponsoring terrorism in India. 																														Unfortunate as the decision is, India must not let this new recognition for Pakistan derail its ties with the US. Clearly, Washington continues to view Pakistan with some importance. It needs Islamabads help in securing the top leadership of al Qaida, and this may have been the price to obtain Pakistans cooperation. The Pakistani army became suddenly proactive in its operations against al Qaida after the Powell announcement. Similarly, the US still views President Musharraf as its best bet in Pakistan, and probably wanted to bolster him further. On the other hand, Indias relationship with the US has acquired a bandwidth that continues to expand almost daily. From defence-to-defence cooperation to trade and commerce, the India-US relationship has speedily acquired great depth. India may have to continue to disagree with the state departments understanding of Pakistan, but that should not stop it from further strengthening its relationship with America and its people.

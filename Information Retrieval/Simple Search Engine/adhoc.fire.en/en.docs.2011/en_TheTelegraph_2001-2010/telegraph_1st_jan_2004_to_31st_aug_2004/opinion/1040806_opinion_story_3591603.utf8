The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 06, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The untouchables				 																																																				Sir  The dropping of three generic HIV/AIDS drugs manufactured by Ranbaxy from the WHO list of approved medicines is by no means an indication of the quality of the drugs manufactured by Indian pharmaceutical company (AIDS setback to Ranbaxy, Aug 5). Ever since Ranbaxy and Cipla began supplying cheaper, generic versions of patented AIDS drugs to poor Asian and African countries, Western drugmakers have been on a witch hunt against them for the fear of losing out in these markets. The real problem, however, lies in the social stigma surrounding the disease in India and many parts of the third world. This makes it impossible to identify patients and treat them effectively, even with the cheaper drugs. Children too are denied basic rights like education  as happened in Kerala recently. Those fighting the disease have their task cut out. Instead of protesting against the WHO, they would do well to raise awareness about the disease.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Rahul Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																Identity crisis				 																																																				Sir  In Who are we? (July 30), Swapan Dasgupta states that the alternative to cosmopolitanism and imperialism is nationalism. Though Dasgupta is an engaging commentator, his arguments in this article are deeply flawed. First, his easy generalizations  his description of Edward Said as the most influential thinker in the world and the remark, Huntington has replaced Said as the new intellectual icon  sound terribly juvenile. Dasguptas article is actually an apology for political realism. He uses Samuel Huntingtons views to state that ordinary decencies do not count in political affairs. Such an illiberal apology for realism goes back to Thomas Hobbes and Bernard Mandeville and has its greatest votary in the Nazi legal theorist, Carl Schmitt. All of them tried to pit the nation and the sovereign against multicultural institutions. The problem with these political realists, as with Dasgupta, is that they want to blame cosmopolitanism for their imperialist (mis)adventures, whereas the connection between nationalism and imperialism is all too apparent. 				 																																																				Dasguptas political pessimism is captured in the sentence, Unfortunately, we are nowhere near this elevated stage of political evolution. The convoluted point is that since we lack such a political culture, let us remain confined to our local and national hovels and stop striving for a better political order. After all, the political transparency of the United Nations or the International Court of Justice is unthinkable in the nationalistic government that is in power now in the United States of America and which ruled India for the past 5 years.

				 																																																				Sir  The experiment with multiculturalism was bound to fail as can be seen by the example of the US. In Who are We? The Challenges To Americas Identity, Samuel Huntington says that multiculturalism holds dangerous portents for the American identity. White Americans permitted the entry of non-whites but without granting them equal status. Racism has always been a dividing factor among men, just as religious conversion has been another. Why were the blacks converted to Christianity by the whites but not given equal rights? Religious conversion and racism have increased human misery and must be checked. As for preserving ones identity in a multicultural society, white Americans have to devise a civilized way of going about it.

				 																Going grey				 																																																				Sir  One does not know quite how to react to the proposed green laws in West Bengal (Tough green law on Buddha desk, July 29). Those responsible for planting trees to make the state greener and cleaner are clearly incompetent. The proposal that the species of the saplings will be specified, preferably dust and heat absorbing and growing fast with thick foliage, is neither here nor there. Additionally, plans to ensure proper maintenance of the saplings, if any, do not show up in the new rules. 				 																																																				Recently, in an afforestation drive along the EM Bypass, trees like the subabul, akashmoni and eucalyptus were planted by a bureaucrat. These trees are suitable for poorer soils in arid areas like Rajasthan or Gujarat. In Bengal, they rob the soil of nutrients and bring down the water table sharply. They grow fast and are, hence, fragile, breaking easily even in the most moderate of cyclones. They also block the roads, causing traffic congestion.				 																																																				The planting of the long-stemmed debdaru on road-dividers on Jessore Road is another example of short-sightedness on the part of the authorities. Only small, bushy plants are needed to block the glaring headlights of cars travelling in opposite directions. Trimmed bougainvillea, koromcha, shiuli or even weeds like bherenda would have served the purpose. These trees suit our climate, are easy to maintain and are available readily. More important, they are unlikely to burn a hole in the CMCs pocket. Besides, many of them bear fruits which attract a variety of birds. Our clever bureaucrats should have also paid attention to the old trees, planted by the Britishers on the roads. They may visit Kalyani to understand how to balance the need for greenery, with variety and beauty.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It seems that trees are the most endangered species in Calcutta, even more than the pedestrians who are routinely knocked around by rash drivers. The trees in front of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture at Golpark have been removed in a ruthless manner. It is the same story in other parts of the city. One hopes that the chief minister will put an end to this menace with immediate effect.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Shankha Sen, Calcutta

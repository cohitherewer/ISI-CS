		 Friday, June 04, 2004 							 																						MUMBAI DREAMS																														Mumbai, the finance capital, beckoned to Mr P. Chidambaram, the finance minister. Some Mumbai meetings, such as with foreign institutional investors, financial institutions and the Reserve Bank of India, are yet to take place, although those with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the stock market and bankers have already happened. Mr Chidambaram has revived the process of pre-budget consultations, dispensed with by his predecessor, Mr Jaswant Singh. Contrary to what Mr Singh argued, pre-budget consultations are not always about obtaining suggestions, which can always be submitted in writing. They are also about creating a sense of ownership. In terms of concrete suggestions from the first day of the Mumbai meetings, there is the idea of a market stabilization fund to neutralize bear cartels and allowing banks to take higher equity exposure and fund capital market investments. Of these, the former might find political favour, but not the latter. However, there was certainly a broader motive behind the Mumbai trip, to persuade Indias financial capital that all is well with reforms, notwithstanding the common minimum programme and the go-slow on privatization. 																														The finance minister has tried hard to persuade the world that the constraints of the CMP permit reforms. This is only partly true. Indeed, sections of the CMP are reform-minded. But there are also sections, beyond privatization and labour market reforms, that imply moving backwards and the test will not be what the CMP says, but what the government does. The budgets test will be deficit figures, although 2004-05 will be relatively easy because the economy and revenue are both doing well. The finance minister has talked about gross domestic product growth of 7 to 8 per cent a year. The year 2004-05 should see 7 per cent, but this is by no means the trend rate. The revenue deficit is 3.6 per cent of GDP now and the Fiscal Responsibility Act requires this to drop to 0 per cent by 2007-08, although the CMP pushes this back by a year to 2008-09. Mr Vijay Kelkar is reportedly preparing a roadmap on how this reduction can come about, to be available by mid-June. This is contingent on exemption removal, 7 per cent GDP growth and user charges  all unlikely prospects. 																														Many expenditure measures proposed in the CMP do not make the deficit target realistic, notwithstanding the cess, extended service sector taxation not integrated into value-added tax and schemes to unearth black money. For instance, if implemented, the Employment Guarantee Act alone will send all deficit numbers into a tizzy. Indeed, the financial capital may have believed legitimately that the finance minister has no great problem on his hands in 2004-05. But it is doubtful that the Chidambaram line has, in general, been swallowed. Disbelief has been suspended till budget day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 18, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Parking an idea				 																																																				Sir  Santiniketans association with Rabindranath Tagore and its tranquil surroundings have earned it a place in the hearts of local tourists, students and foreigners alike. Contrary to the high courts observation, the place does not need an amusement park to increase its attraction to tourists (HC greenflags fun park in Santiniketan, March 13)? The very idea of such a park in Santiniketans culture-rich locale is repulsive and Mahasveta Devis consternation is understandable. Such a concept of amusement can neither be associated with the people who live in that town (a substantial population of those living around being tribal), nor with those who frequently visit it for a much-needed break from their urban existence. Santiniketan has already lost much of its old charm, given the greed of real estate dealers. An amusement park will only add to the mess. Besides, development of the kind cited by the Sreeniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority could be done without, because it will only be accompanied by more environmental damage. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Chaitali Chakraborty, Calcutta
				 																A different tune				 																																																				Sir  Bhupen Hazarikas decision to join politics and contest the Lok Sabha polls under the saffron banner from Guwahati was a little unexpected (Diamond for Guwahati, March 11). It is altogether undesirable that cultural icons like him should at all be associated with a dirty game like politics, whose ethics is far removed from the world of music. Which is why Hazarikas decision to join the fray surprises, not so much his decision to be a part of the Bharatiya Janata Party. One would have appreciated his position much better had he gone to the Rajya Sabha through a nomination.				 																																																				To elucidate what a heinous game politics is, one may take the fact that Hazarika was given a ticket from Guwahati, instead of his home town, Tezpur. This was because the BJP thought it would be humiliating for the singer to lose out to the sitting Congress member of parliament from Tezpur, Mani Kumar Subba, known as a moneybag with scores of allegations of corruption against him. Had public service been topmost in the minds of the BJP and Hazarika, the thought of a possible defeat would not have bothered either. 				 																																																				Several questions have been bothering us about the singer. Why did Hazarika have to join politics if he wished to serve the people? And even if he did, why did he not chose a secular party like the Congress? Does he have political scores to settle? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

				 																																																				Sir  Preaching one thing and practising another was thought to be an idiosyncrasy of politicians. That a cultural figure could have the same affliction was evident when Bhupen Hazarika jumped on to the BJP bandwagon. Only in January, Hazarika had said that he wished to remain a slave of music instead of becoming a servant of any political group (Thank you, but no thank you: Bhupen, Jan 30). Why the change of stance now? He had also said that he would consider becoming a Rajya Sabha member only if he were nominated by the president. Did the opportunity of free medical treatment abroad the possibility of a governorship or some diplomatic assignment prompt Hazarika to reconsider his decision? The people of Assam would still hesitate to brand Hazarikas decision a betrayal. He may have started to sing the feel good song, but he should be cautioned that those who now call him a diamond, will not stop from castigating him when the nations shine begins to wane.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mrinmoy Goswami, Nagaon

				 																																																				Sir  Bhupen Hazarikas joining politics is not surprising, but his siding with the BJP certainly is. He is a socio-cultural icon in Assam and his association with the ruling political party at the Centre will strengthen the partys hold in Guwahati. His entry into politics should help remove the parochial perceptions that guide national politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aiyushman Dutta, Guwahati

				 																Cocooned				 																																																				Sir  Contrary to the report, Silk board under fire over egg damage (March 4), it is important to mention that the worms hatched between January 26 and February 3 this year are now in the ripening stage. Thus the allegation that the worms are dying soon after hatching is misleading. The Central Silk Board usually supplies silkworm eggs to silkworm rearers whose individual rearing capacity ranges from 50 to 500 eggs. None of the farmers purchased five lakh eggs from our unit. It is possible that the purchase was made from local silkworm seed producers, most of whom are unskilled and supply spurious silkworm eggs to the farmers. The mulberry (toont) leaf has been described by the report as blue vitriol leaf. There is no use of blue vitriol in sericulture. 				 																																																				The report has scared many farmers of crop loss despite their expecting a bumper harvest. Around 15 to 20 out of 65,000 farmers of Sujapur involved in the business have suffered losses. This can neither be interpreted as a blow to sericulture nor considered a case for mass compensation.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Bhattacharjee, deputy secretary (tech.), zonal silkworm seed project office, central silk board, Maheshmatil, Malda

				 																Role model				 																																																				Sir  Soni Begum has set an inspiring example ( Riches pale before rags, March 11, 2004). Poverty has not taken away her values. Despite having three hungry children to feed, she chose to return the money she had chanced upon. She is a lesson for all, especially the power-hungry politicians who rule our lives.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Was Soni Begums act of honesty worth just Rs 1,000? The state should reciprocate in a more substantive way by giving her a job so that she can at least feed her children.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Purnima Vasudeva, Calcutta

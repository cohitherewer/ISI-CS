The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 13, 2004 							 																						TILL THE END OF TIME Anupriyo Mallick																					In the past few decades, there have been frequent reports in the media about the horrific abuse of the elderly. Take the recent case of a septuagenarian couple who moved the Delhi high court against their son and daughter-in-law, for allegedly torturing them and trying to usurp their property. As in this case, the aggressors are often members of the family. The immediate and common response to such incidents is to blame the younger generation for neglecting or abusing those very people who sacrificed a lot to bring up their children. Though some cases do warrant such comments, they are no solution to this deep-seated problem.																					In our society, where economic considerations and productivity are important driving forces, those who are not productive have little to cheer about. Consequently, little thought is spared for the old in India or attention paid to their needs. The problem is compounded by the fact that though old people live longer nowadays, thanks to advances in medical science, they are also likely to suffer or remain ill most of the time. 																					Lack of awareness about the free medicare services on offer and limited access to such services are reasons for the misery of senior citizens, lower down the socio--economic scale. While the debilitating effects of old age cannot be avoided, the damage can be minimized by careful planning and preparation, starting from middle age. This would ensure that a person retains a basic capacity to function even after 60 years of age and along with it, some amount of independence. 																					Right medicine																					Strengthening the public healthcare system in the country is by far the best way to ensure access to medical services. Social workers say more geriatric clinics need to be set up and more wards for the old reserved in hospitals. In the villages, the primary healthcare centres must ensure that senior citizens get proper medical care. In this regard, the national policy for older persons proposes that medical and para-medical staff from government healthcare facilities be trained in geriatric care, and the setting up of state-funded hospices to care for the chronically ill or destitute elderly. 																					The difficulties in getting pension and provident fund from government-run organizations are a further indignity the elderly have to face. The national policy promises to greatly enhance coverage for poor persons under the old-age pension scheme  the goal being to cover all those below the poverty line. It also promises to promote pre-retirement counselling. While such counselling has become popular in the organized sector of late, the unorganized sector is still largely neglected. 																					Over the past couple of years, there have been many reports of violent assaults on older persons living alone. Indeed, elderly people who live alone in cities are often the target of burglaries and break-ins, especially in the metros of Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai. 																					Safety nets																					In this context, safety  hitherto perceived as the least of the problems concerning the aged,  has suddenly become very important. A number of nongovernmental organizations have come up with specific strategies to ensure the safety of senior citizens. For example, helplines have been set up. These services may be helpful, but are largely insufficient in addressing the needs of the vast grey population. Thus, government initiative in this area remains the best solution.																					In this connection, the national policy envisages the introduction of special provisions in the Indian penal code to protect older persons, and a review of tenancy laws to guarantee older persons occupancy rights. It also directs the police to keep a friendly eye on the senior citizens who live alone and encourage them to interact with neighbourhood bodies.																					Among senior citizens, it is the women who are especially disadvantaged. The lack of enough financial muscle and power to take decisions, made worse by a lifetime of being under the thumb of male relations, have rendered many of them incapable of living alone in old age. Policymakers and NGOs need to pay special attention to the problems of this group.

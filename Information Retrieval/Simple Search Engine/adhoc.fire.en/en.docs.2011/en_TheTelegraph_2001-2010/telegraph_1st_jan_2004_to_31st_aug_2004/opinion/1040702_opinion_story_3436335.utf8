The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 02, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Modest appeal				 																																																				Sir  Liberalism cannot be imposed, it has to grow from within a community. Thus, the European Court of Human Rightss statement that the headgear ban is a valid way to fight fundamentalism is not just wrong-headed but it is disrespectful to the religious sensibilities of Muslims (State above scarf in Europe, June 30). While women all over the world are fighting for their rights, the least the state can do is grant them the freedom to make choices, including the right to dress the way they choose. A secular democracy allows its citizens the freedom to practice any religion of their choice, and if the religion of their choice enjoins women to cover their heads, the state has no business disallowing it. If a woman chooses to wear the hijab, if she does not consider it degrading, why should a court demur? Expressing ones religion by dressing in a certain way does not mean one is being fundamentalist. If such repressive measures continue, what will it be next? A ban on Christians wearing the cross? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Afreen Zaidi, Calcutta 
				 																																																				Con job				 																																																				Sir  Visva-Bharati has been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons (After shame, scandal at Tagore varsity, June 26). First, it was the theft of the Nobel medallion of Rabindranath Tagore, and now the fake mark-sheet scandal involving its former vice-chancellor, Dilip Sinha. 				 																																																				That Sinha recruited Mukti Deb, who had only passed the higher secondary examination, to the post of senior lecturer shows the high level of corruption in the educational system. How is it that the mark-sheets Deb produced were not exposed as fakes? This proves that either the vice-chancellor was very careless (which is unlikely), or that he had ulterior motives. Also, Sinhas statement that Tagores stolen Nobel medal was still in Santiniketan could signal his involvement in that scandal too. The only way to contain the damage is to severely punish all those found guilty.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is well known that appointments in educational institutions in West Bengal are controlled by political parties. But, one does wonder why someone like Dilip Sinha compromised his position. What examples are eminent citizens like him setting the youth? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arjun Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Not only has Dilip Sinha made the student community of Visva-Bharati hang its head in shame, but he has also disgraced the profession of teaching. What prompted the special favours to Mukti Deb? Besides, if her Bsc and Msc mark-sheets were fake, the police should also verify the authenticity of her higher-secondary certificate. Also, if Deb managed to teach for 7 years then why did she not clear her examinations? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The scandal involving the former vice-chancellor of the Visva-Bharati and a lecturer of mathematics is an insult to Rabindranath Tagores dreams and notions of education and culture. These scandals prove we are not capable of retaining such lofty ideals. People like Deb and Sinha, who bring disgrace on Visva-Bharati, must be given exemplary punishment. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Phani Bhushan Saha, Balurghat

				 																Slipping on oil				 																																																				Sir  The Union petroleum minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, said he had little option but to raise oil prices given the sharp rise in international prices. But in early June, global crude prices had stabilized after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gave an assurance that production would be increased. By June 14, when Aiyars announcement came, oil prices had gone down from a high of around $40 to a little more than $37 a barrel. So why were prices raised in India?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Nirmal Saha, Calcutta

 Sir  The hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG may have been necessary, but it could have been handled in a more people-friendly manner. Instead of increasing prices in one shot, it could have been done in two phases, after citizens had been given a couple of months notice to help them prepare. Overnight price hikes benefit only dealers, who hoard huge stocks so that they can make some easy profits. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ullas Pradhan, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  Left parties have criticized the hike in petrol and diesel prices as anti-people and anti-farmer. But the left supports the Central government, and hence was partly responsible for the hike. They have no moral right to criticize it, and put the entire blame on the Congress. The left are free to withdraw their support to the government, if they do not approve of its actions. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arun Kumar Das, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The prime minister has refused to go back on the hike in fuel prices, but has announced many concessions for farmers. The latter constitute 60 per cent of the population, many of them desperately poor. Does the Congress now want to attract the votes of this section? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Fifty per cent of the retail petrol price in India constitutes taxes. This includes a 10 per cent import duty, which makes the landed cost of crude oil very high in India. Another 33 per cent sales tax is added to the refined crude oil, along with a surcharge. Thus the price of refined petrol in India is among the highest in the world. Our state-run oil firms, who are into refining and marketing, have a very low profit margin and can hardly be asked to cushion consumers from any further hike in the price of petroleum. In the circumstances, it is strange that the government has not considered any further reduction of taxes. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Gaurav Jajodia, Cuttack

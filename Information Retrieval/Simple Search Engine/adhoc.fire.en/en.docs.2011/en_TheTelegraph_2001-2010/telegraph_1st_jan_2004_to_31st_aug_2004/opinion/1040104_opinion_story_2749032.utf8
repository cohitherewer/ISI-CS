The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 04, 2004 							 																						ECO-BLUNDER																								The vast network of canals bringing water to arid regions, thousands of tubewells sucking out groundwater, and millions of hectares of rice in northern India might have helped feed the nation. But the long-term consequences of transforming the ecology of a region might have been unfathomable while the activity was under way. Whats been happening in the north Indian plains may have some parallels with a theme that had emerged in the celebrated late science fiction writer Frank Herberts classic novel Dune, published in 1965. In Dune, Herbert explored the issue of the consequences of tampering with ecology on a grand planetary scale. A band of people living on a barren desert planet called Arrakis set out to transform their home into a lush green world. Arrakis is a special planet  it is the only place in the galaxy where a spice called melange is found. Melange makes space travel possible and has emerged as the most valued commodity in the galaxy. Arrakis is also a home to giant sandworms that serve as a source for melange  young sandworms excrete melange. Attempts to green Arrakis would have ended up wiping out the sandworms. And the fierce warriors who seek to transform the planet owe their strength and capabilities to their hardy existence in the desert planet. Science fiction analysts believe that in Dune, Herbert questioned the morality of changing the environment. Is it right for humans to transform an ecosystem?

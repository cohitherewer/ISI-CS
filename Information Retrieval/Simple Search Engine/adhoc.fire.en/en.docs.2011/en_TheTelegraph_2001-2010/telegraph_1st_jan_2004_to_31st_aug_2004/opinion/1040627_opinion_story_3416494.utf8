The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 27, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Let the kid be				 																																																				Sir  Scientists may have given Craig Flatman a clean bill of health, but it is unlikely to cut much ice with parents who will continue to insist that their children have milk, vegetable and fruits (Teen existed on jam sandwiches for decade, June 24). Especially, middle-class Bengali parents for whom meal times will remain a struggle. The child will not eat  either because he is not hungry or is disinterested or does not like the food  and the parents will not rest till he has had the last mouthful. Its a routine that often continues into teenage and sours many a parent-child relationship. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Joyeeta Chatterjee, Calcutta 
				 																Wedding party 				 																																																				Sir  The intense media glare that accompanied the engagement and wedding of Vanisha Mittal and Amit Bhatia, two people who have no claim to fame other than being super-rich, was nauseating. Readers have had to suffer the juvenile verses of the couples relations, the sick jokes of the star entertainers, the grouses of disgruntled guests and pictures of the vulgar ostentation. Surely, they would have appreciated more substantial news with their morning cuppa?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Varsha Sheth, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Non-resident Indians tend to see India through the rose-tinted glasses of a Yash Chopra, Subash Ghai or Karan Johar film. Its evident they havent seen the films of Satyajit Ray or Mrinal Sen. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashish Sengupta, Dhanbad

				 																																																				Sir  Laxmi Mittal is a British citizen, and hence the concerns of the teeming millions in Calcutta or India do not touch him. Being a self-made billionaire, Mittal also has every right to do what he wishes with his money. But, such sheer ostentation could have been avoided. There was a Mittal wedding in Calcutta some years ago too. But that was perhaps somewhat less ostentatious, since you cannot hide the overwhelming poverty of the city behind dark- tinted glasses and air-conditioning. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Bill Gates and Ted Turner are several times richer than Laxmi Mittal but they do not flaunt their wealth as the latter did on the occasion of his daughters wedding or earlier, when he bought a palatial house in London. Rather, the American and European billionaires are known for their philanthropy. Such mindless splurging by Laxmi shows Indians in a poor light in the West. 				 																																																				Also, Mittals choice of Hindi filmstars to entertain his guests shows the shallowness of his cultural preferences. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

				 																																																				Sir  The director of My Big Fat Greek Wedding must be ruing the fact that he did not make a film on my big fat Indian wedding after the big fat Indian wedding of Vanisha Mittal. But it is a wonder that the bride and groom did not get impatient for a little privacy. May the couple live happily ever after because after all this drain of money it will be a little too much if they head for a divorce.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debanjana Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																Track suits				 																																																				Sir  There are a number of shops selling a variety of drinks inside Metro railway stations, in order to quench the thirst of passengers during the summer months. It is also great to see cleanliness being maintained year after year. But there is no toilet. Cant the officials make space for one, at least for ticket-holding passengers? Is Laloo Prasad Yadav listening?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vishwa Nath Jaiswal, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Indians Railways does not provide plug-points to charge mobile phones in air-conditioned compartments. Most passengers in these coaches have mobile phones, now that roaming services have become so popular. Since a journey can stretch to two-three days, charging a phone becomes a necessity. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Akhtar, Secunderabad

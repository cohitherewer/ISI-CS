		 Friday, May 07, 2004 							 																						BEYOND BORDERS																														The latest expansion of the European Union will undoubtedly give it formidable trading and political influence. It remains to be seen, however, if the new EU will be able to actively promote peace and prosperity on the continent and beyond. The recent expansion of the EU is the largest ever in its history. The joining of 10 new countries, including 8 from eastern Europe, gives the EU a population of 450 million, and the new Union will, at euros 10 trillion, account for a fourth of the worlds gross national product. The new EU landmass will now stretch from Portugal to Poland and the languages officially recognized by Brussels will go up to 20. This is undoubtedly an incredible achievement. Indeed, not only have the acceding countries had to satisfy rigid economic benchmarks, but they have also had to abide by equally stringent political norms, including those related to democracy and human rights. Moreover, this is by no means the final expansion of the EU. A waiting-list of potential members will be taken up in several phases over the next few years. While the emergence of the expanded EU has been cause for celebration in several of the member countries, there is no doubt that the Union is and will continue to be confronted by huge hurdles in the months to come. 																														The most striking problem is the economic disparity on the continent. On an average, the new members have a per capita gross domestic product equal to only 46 per cent of that of the old members. Unlike in the past, new members cannot expect huge aid or subsidies to quickly raise their economic standards. In other words, there will continue to be two economic entities within the EU for years, if not decades, to come. This will, not unexpectedly, generate political and social tension. Similarly, there are widespread differences over foreign policy, especially with regard to Europes relationship with the United States of America. The old members, barring the United Kingdom, are generally sceptical of US policies and have, in recent months, not shied away from expressing as much. In contrast, the new members view the Atlantic relationship as important, and view the presence of the US in Europe as a way of offsetting the dominance of larger European countries like Germany. The chances, therefore, of developing a common foreign and security policy seem remote, at least in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the recent expansion has not, unlike in the past, generated much enthusiasm within the European people. Nevertheless, despite the problems, the enlargement of Europe once again reinforces the importance of the free-market, democracy and, above all, the spirit of reconciliation.

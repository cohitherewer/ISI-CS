The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 							 																						COMING TOGETHER Gandhis Congress was a coalition from within. Ms Sonia Gandhi has created a coalition from without which will take the party back to its unassailable position.Independent India has always been ruled by a coalition. This statement should not startle anyone who is familiar with the nature and the evolution of the Congress. The Congress began in the late 19th century as a Christmas meeting of Westernized oriental gentlemen who took upon themselves to serve as Her Majestys loyal opposition in India. The coming of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to Indian politics radically altered all this. Gandhi gave to the Congress an organizational structure that spread right into the villages. His organizational genius linked locality, province and nation. This enabled him to mobilize Indians for the mass movements that he led. He made the Congress representative of all Indians in yet another way. He called to the Congress all Indians  from the poor peasant to rich Indian businessmen. His call went out to all Indians irrespective of their class, caste, creed and religion. He successfully united all these conflicting interests under one umbrella. The contradictions were not overlooked but they were not allowed to stand in the way of a common action to attain a common goal. Even under Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, the Congress retained this umbrella character. It could hold together diverse groups and individuals. The Congress was nothing more than a coalition.																														The Congress began to lose this character, for a variety of reasons, in the Nineties. The political space that it vacated was appropriated by caste-based parties and to a lesser extent by the Bharatiya Janata Party. This fracturing also meant that the Congress lost its right to rule India. The mantle of leadership passed to the National Democratic Alliance. This was a coalition led by the BJP and it succeeded after the failure of two very short-lived coalition governments. The NDA came together not on the basis of a shared ideology but on a shared desire to stay in power. The coalition partners worked out a common agenda which served as the basis of policies that were formulated. The nature of this coalition was different from the one that the Congress represented. The NDA was a coalition from without. It was put together from the outside to meet a particular political exigency. In contrast, the Congress, in the way Gandhi had fashioned it, was a coalition from within. The Congress acted as a magnet which brought diverse elements under its leadership.																														The defeat of the NDA has brought to the forefront another coalition that is led by the Congress with Sonia Gandhi as its undisputed leader. But this coalition bears some of the features of a coalition from without. Its origins and its existence are predicated upon a common political will to keep the BJP out of power. The coalition partners have come together not because they agree with the Congress but because they see the Congress as an effective vehicle to push out the BJP from power. The real test before the Congress is to make itself the effective centre of the coalition by managing the embedded contradictions. One Gandhi created the coalition from within, another will have to bring back the Congress to that unassailable position.

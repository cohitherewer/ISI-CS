The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 							 																						HARD																													HEADED																													WOMAN Whats a nice girl like her doing in politics? Dont ask. Actress Jaya Bachchan is made for the job																														Dont lets, please, ask Jaya Bachchan that first bird-brained question that rises to our minds: How Does It Feel? She answered that one nearly a month ago when journo-cum-filmmaker Khalid Mohamed interviewed her immediately after the news came in that she was the Samajwadi Partys nominee to the Rajya Sabha. It was an honour, she had trilled. And why had she abruptly accepted the offer, having rejected it twice earlier? Because I think it is futile for any person to sit in a drawing room and make facile pronouncements about whats going on in the country. I have accepted the honour because of the UP chief minister Mulayam Singhji who is a simple, compassionate, grassroots person. The prime issue that concerns me is literacy for women. My, but the ladys serious. In a national theatre that largely regards a berth in the RS as a bit of a snore, the redoubtable actress actually remembers her lines. 																														The day before her swearing-in she travelled to Kathmandu to attend a prayer ceremony at the Pashupatinath temple. Minutes after she took her oath in Parliament the next day, she decorously bent to touch the feet of HRD minister Arjun Singh, presumably because he had been a friend of her eminent Bhopal-based journalist father Tarun Coomar Bhaduri. Mark my words, observed a film journalist, politics will be her greatest act yet. 																														But then, the 56-year-old FTII graduate perfected her sense of timing a long time ago. Her first film was a Ray special, Mahanagar. Hrishikesh Mukherjees vastly successful Guddi was her official Hindi film debut, in a role she reprised for many subsequent Jaya starrers: an ingenue. Her marriage to Amitabh Bachchan took place in the same year  1973  that the then largely unknown actor burned up the screen in Prakash Mehras Zanjeer. 																														Shortly after that she disappeared. To emerge from the shadows briefly to star in Yash Chopras Silsila (a sensational act because the film also cast Amitabh and Rekha and was then believed to be a celluloid retelling of their triangled love story) only to bow out again. There were wild rumours that her husband was the cause of the no-show, but Jaya hotly contested them, saying the decision to confine herself to the interests of home and children Abhishek and Sweta was her own. 																														When, in 1997, she dramatically made a comeback in Govind Nihalanis Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Ma, the press went wild in their applause. One unfortunate hack made the mistake of asking her if she had sought Amitabhs permission before returning to the screen. He is my husband, not my guardian, for Gods sake, she snapped back. And then she silenced the old rumours forever by repeating the husband-wife act with Amitabh in Karan Johars Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham in 2001 which celebrated older family values. 																														Dedication to husband and family feature high on Jayas list of pursuits. Icily silent when the Bofors gun issue erupted and implicated her family, she not only supported her husband, then a close friend of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, when he joined politics in the mid-Eighties but played a political card or two herself. When Amitabh campaigned for Mulayam in the early Nineties in Etawah, she was by his side. And far from being the addendum to Amitabh Bachchan that many believe her to be, she took many of the hard-headed decisions in his life. She was the one who insisted that the Bachchans stay at the chief ministers residence and not be put up at a hotel. (Its clear to anyone with half a cerebellum that that has paid off.) And as for her children  and theirs  no one has ever doubted her devotion to them.																														The lady wears many other badges. Reportedly worth over Rs 22 crore, she is chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Promotion Board and formerly headed the Indian Childrens Film Society. 																														So why has she such few known friends? Famous for freezing over completely at social gatherings, Jaya Bachchan is hard to cosy up to. She has personally admitted to being cold and indifferent to people she didnt take an immediate liking to. (One Bengali pressman tried to break the conversational ice with her by speaking to her in her mother tongue and was rewarded with a curt put-down  in English.) She is surrounded by a protective wall of hangers-on and lackeys, rails a reporter in Mumbai. What shed like to set up  through her husband  is the new first family of Bollywood. 																														Writer and social commentator Shobhaa D will have none of that. Thats completely untrue, she says. She is very much her own person. She may have this carefully constructed persona  remote, reserved  but she has her own circle of friends. I think its important for her to let people know she is someone in her own right. D concedes, all the same, that Jaya sets her sights high. Ive always believed shes by far the more ambitious of the two, she admits. Shes also more of a politically savvy person. 																														Just as well. Because in Jaya Bachchans latest shot, as she recently joked, there will be no retakes.

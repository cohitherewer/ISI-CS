		 Friday, January 23, 2004  FAMOUS IN HER OWN RIGHT 
 On Balance: An Autobiography By  Leila Seth, Viking, Rs 495  Only the utterly cynical will  say that Leila Seths only claim to fame is that she is  the mother of Vikram Seth. She has actually had a very distinguished  career in the judiciary. Only pettiness kept her out of  the Supreme Court bench. She could have led, if she so wanted,  the comfortable life of a corporate executives wife, doing  the cocktail circuit. But she chose to be a lawyer. She  qualified to be a barrister-at-law from Lincolns Inn. She  came back to India to work as a junior with Sachin Chaudhuri.  Seth recollects her career and her family life. It is a  pity though that she does not provide any accounts of dramatic  cases which she heard as a judge. The domestic side of her  life seems to have taken precedence over her public life.  She brought up three very unusual children, one of whom  is also prodigiously talented. She writes about them with  a mothers affection. Her writing is lucid but the prurient  and the gossip seeker will be sorely disappointed. There  is no sensational stuff here. This is the lifestory of a  sincere and hard-working career woman, who successfully  balanced her career with a full and sensitive family life. FIRST  LINE OF DEFENCE  A Matter of Honour: An Account  of the Indian Army, its officers and men By Philip Mason,  Natraj, Rs 350 Philip Mason was a very distinguished  member of the heaven born Indian Civil Service. He was also  very proud of his days in the sun in the service of the  raj. As a writer, he made his name with Men who  Ruled India in two volumes. This was his account of  some famous ICS officers. In this book, Mason looks back  at another British-Indian institution, the army. The British  Indian army was no less important than the civil service  in preserving the raj. Perhaps more so since British rule  in India, was first and foremost, an act of conquest. Mason  traces the history of the army from its beginnings in the  18th century to the excellent record of that army in World  War II, especially in the campaign against Romell in Africa.  Mason is good on the psychology of the individual soldier  as well as on the collective nature of the military enterprise.  This is the first Indian edition of the book and the publishers  deserve to be congratulated for reprinting this classic. TRAGEDY WAS HIS MIDDLE NAME Dilip Kumar, Star Legend of Indian  Cinema: The Definitive Biography By Bunny Reuben, HarperCollins,  Rs 500  Dilip Kumar is by consensus one  of the real greats of the Hindi film industry. From his  first film, Jwar Bhata, in 1944, to Saudagar  in 1991, his career has spanned more than half-a-century.  As such, the actor must have valuable insights into how  the industry has changed since he first entered it. But  this book provides no such insight. The books sole business,  as Reuben writes in the preface, is to trace the actors  metarmosphosis from Yusuf, the often bewildered, hurt and  introverted child, to Dilip Kumar, The Love Legend, and  therefrom to Dilip Kumar... Unfortunately, Reuben does  not manage to get over the film-journalists instinct to  recount old, salacious gossip about the many loves in the  actors life. Worse, he allows the actor to pander to his  rather wide sentimental streak: I think everyone falls  in love only once. Again  if there is an again  is  merely an imitation of the brilliant flame, the blinding  light. Needless to say, a critical eye is too much to expect  of Reuben.

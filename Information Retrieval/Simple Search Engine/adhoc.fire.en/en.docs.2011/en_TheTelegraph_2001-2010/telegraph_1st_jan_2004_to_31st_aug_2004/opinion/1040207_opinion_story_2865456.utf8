The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 07, 2004 							 																						REMAINS OF THE DAY THIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT  SINGH				 	 Fond memories																					There were a few English families which even during the heyday of the raj preferred friendship with Indians to friendship with their own kind. They gave tacit support to the freedom movement, stayed in India after it gained independence and reluctantly returned to England when their breadwinners were retired. They continued to retain their Indian connections as best as they could by keeping an open house for their friends visiting England. On the Indian side, such friendships were restricted to the black sahibs or wogs (Westernized Oriental gentlemen) who could meet the Brits on equal terms, speak their language as well as they spoke it, have the same taste for food and liquor and subscribe to the same values. It was a small community which did not gloat over the end of the British rule as good riddance of an oppressor but continued to harbour nostalgic memories about it. Most of them are now dead or in the sunset time of their lives. I was lucky in enjoying such friendship with a few: Sinclair (Burmah Shell), Charlton (The Statesman), Croom Johnson (British Council), Wint (The Guardian), Zinkin (Lever Brothers). Whenever any one of them visited Delhi, they stayed with me. Whenever I went to England, I stayed with one of them in London or Oxford.																					Sinbad Sinclair died quite some time ago. I can never forget his description of his last meeting with Pandit Gobind Vallabh Pant to settle the terms of the takeover of Burmah Shell by the Indian government. Both men suffered from Parkinsons disease and their hands shook while holding the draft of the agreement. 																					Guy Wint had a stroke in the train on his way from Oxford to spend the weekend with me in London. He was the next to go. I spent one summer with his wife, Freda, and their two children in their home in Oxford. Freda converted to Buddhism. She is 92. Henry Croom Johnson went some six years ago; his wife followed a few months later. The same happened with the Zinkins: Maurice died last year; Taya followed a few months later. 																					Of my closer English friends, only Elinor Sinclair, who is the same age as I, remains. I was told her memory was fast failing. However, when I called on her in London about four years ago, I noticed no lapse of memory. She asked about every member of my family, had me autograph books I had sent her and told me she was writing her Indian memoirs. Some months ago, I wrote to her from Kasauli. I got no reply. I concluded she too had deserted me. Fortunately, that was not so. Her daughter Margaret, who looks after her, had responded but her letter never reached me. A few days ago, Mark Sinclair rang me up from London to tell me he would be spending an evening with me and bring a copy of Margarets letter. So he did. It said her mother was in very poor shape. Her memory was gone, she was confined to a wheel-chair. She also mentioned Joy Charlton, who was in good health, had suddenly died while she was at work. (The Statesman, which her husband had edited for many years in Delhi and Calcutta did not have a word about her going).																					It was a long evening by the fire-side. Mark, who looks the spit image of his father, has his mothers intonation. He went down the list of obituaries. I felt like one in a deserted banquet hall when others had departed. I recalled lines from Thomas Moors Oft in the Stilly Night:																					When I remember all																					The friends so linked together																					Ive seen around me fall																					Like leaves in wintry weather.																					I fell like one																					Who treads alone																					Some banquet hall deserted,																					Whose lights are fled,																					Whose garlands dead,																					And all but he departed.																					Taste of success																					By way of a Lohri gift, Poonam Sidhu Khaira of Chandigarh sent me a box of laddoos and panjiri (a kind of dried halwa). They were tastefully packed in a box bearing the Sikh logo, ek onkar in large letters with the name and address of confectioners Lovely Jalandher Cantonment. I have tasted nothing better in the way of mitthai. I wrote expressing surprise that such excellent stuff could have been produced by sardars not famous for their skills as halwais. Who was Mr Lovely? She sent me the details. It turned out to be a heart-warming success story.																					The confectionery firm known as the Lovely group are not Sikhs as I had presumed from the logo, but Mittal banias who had a modest army contract business in Sialkot (Pakistan). On Partition, they moved to Jalandhar, hoping to resume that business with the Indian army. They did not do as well as they had hoped. The eldest, Baldev Raj, decided to go into confectionery as a side business: every bania has mitthai in his blood. He was an instant success. He opened his shop for only two hours in the evening from 6 to 8 pm. Everything he had made was sold out. In 1986, it became a full-fledged mitthai shop. For reasons unknown, they named it Lovely. Soon they were catering for large wedding parties and other celebrations in other states.																					I am not sure whether it was Lovelys laddoos that persuaded Rahul Bajaj to give the dealership of his motorcycles to the Lovely group when he visited Jalandhar in 1991. Five years later, they got the Maruti Agency as well. Today, the annual turnover of this once impoverished refugee family from Pakistan is over Rs 120 crore.																					Baldev Raj has three sons: Ramesh Naresh and Ashok. They live under one roof, but work in different offices. The family is giving back to the people some of the prosperity it owes them. They started with the Lovely Institute of Management and added institutes of engineering, architecture, law and education to it. They now plan to set up a Lovely University.																					The jungle rules																					There is an Urdu quarterly, Tamseel-e-Nau, edited by Dr Imam Azam of Qilaghat, Burdwan, which I make a point to read: it has good articles, short stories and poems. In its last issue I came across a short poem by Shahis Kaleem Ara entitled Yeh tasveer nahin jungle kee (This is not the picture of a jungle). It tells its own tale in a few memorable lines. I render a very free translation:																					Lofty mountains and running streams,																					Cluster of trees with green leaves																					A tiger springs with all its might																					On a thirsty deer in full flight																					A snake has a frog in its mouth,																					The frog in its mouth a butterfly																					It is not the picture of a jungle, it is a lie,																					It is the picture of a city doomed to die																					It has humans but no humanity.

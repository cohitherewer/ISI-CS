		 Sunday, April 25, 2004 							 																						CHANGING TO GOVERNBy wooing Muslims, the BJP is trying not just to win elections but also to reinvent itself as the natural party of governanceIndian democracy is unique in that it began its career with a natural party of governance. This is somewhat paradoxical in a democracy since no one political party should have the monopoly over a government that claims to be of the people, by the people and for the people. The paradox grew out of Indias history, more specifically out of the history of Indias national movement. The Congress led that movement, came to power after independence after the first general elections, and stood forth as the government. Till Indira Gandhi was defeated after the Emergency, a non-Congress government was beyond the imagination of most people. Since that time, the claims of the Congress to be Indias number one party has come under question and from the Nineties, its position has been suffering severe erosion. This erosion is a function of a crisis of leadership as well as the rise of political parties which claim to represent those groups who had come together under the umbrella of the Congress. The rise of the caste parties in north India  the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party  is an example of this tendency. In the heyday of the Congress, a very large minority group, the Muslims, had seen the party as the guardian of its interests and safety. The destruction of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, and the riots that followed, left Muslims disillusioned with the Congress and they took their woes elsewhere. The political space occupied by the Congress has become progressively smaller.																														One significant consequence of this political development is a conspicuous vacancy in the slot for the natural party of governance. In terms of size and popularity, there is only one contender for the position, the Bharatiya Janata Party. The programme of the sangh parivar  the larger ideological family of which the BJP is an important member  has been the BJPs principal obstacle in becoming a claimant to the role of Indias party of governance. Its programme has been seen to be ideologically exclusivist, tilted towards upper caste Hindus. It was seen as anti-Muslim and communal. It was difficult to accept such a party as representing a pluralist and multicultural society as Indias. The BJP, once it came to power at the head of a coalition government, began to feel the weight of the sangh parivars ideological baggage. Under the leadership of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, it began to distance itself from the sangh parivar and slough off its anti-Muslim and communal image. The relationship between the BJP and the sangh parivar was an internal battle within the forces that uphold Hindutva. Mr Vajpayee won that battle and placed governance before ideology. The BJPs saffron thus began to fade.																														The relationship with Muslims was a different matter, since it was mired in years of mistrust and hatred. But without winning the trust of Muslims, the BJP could not achieve what it wanted: occupy the space vacated by the Congress, to become Indias natural party of governance. Hence Mr Vajpayees appeal to Muslims. Hence the assurance that Gujarat will not be repeated. Hence the pronounced attempts to break the mistrust of Muslims and bring them closer to the BJP. This is more than an electoral ploy. It is an attempt of the BJP to reinvent itself to fit the mantle that history seems ready to put on it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 							 																						WIN ALL THE WAY																														For the Malaysian prime minister, Mr Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the triumph in the national elections can perhaps be counted as three victories rolled into one. Most obviously, the remarkable success of the Barisan Nasional coalition, headed by Mr Badawis United Malays National Organization, seems to have dammed the growing tide of support for the Islamist opposition that had become particularly strong since 1999. The fact that the coalition wrested control of two northern Malay-dominated states, Terengganu and Kelantan, from the opposition Pan-Malaysia Islamic Party which had held them, is a good indicator of the scale of the Islamist forces defeat. It is almost symbolic that PASs president lost his seat. Mr Badawi can count this as positive support for his anti-corruption, pro-development secular agenda. He is the man of the moment, his agenda is targeted at a people aware that their economy is no longer in crisis. Their mandate was necessary to validate the position he received when Mr Mahathir Mohamad transferred power to him five months ago. In this context, it is possible to view his huge victory as a vindication of his distinctive style and approach. Losing more of the Malay vote, in tune with the drift against the UMNO in 1999, would have caused problems within his own coalition by giving dissenters useful handles against him. This victory, therefore, has done a lot for Mr Badawi.																														The Islamist defeat is rather startling, suggesting that more Muslims were wary of the Islamist state envisaged by the PAS than it appeared. A revival of old laws, which would entail a shutting down of entertainment centres and stoning and amputation as punishments for various crimes, was not as welcome as the PAS expected. Islamism in the PAS had also distanced it from its former ally, the Justice Party, formed by the former deputy leader, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, after he lost his position in 1998. Without an Islamist surge, the opposition had little to hold on to. In addition to his image, Mr Badawi already had all the cards. Barisan Nasional has been in governance for four decades. The advantages of such a history in an election campaign are obvious.

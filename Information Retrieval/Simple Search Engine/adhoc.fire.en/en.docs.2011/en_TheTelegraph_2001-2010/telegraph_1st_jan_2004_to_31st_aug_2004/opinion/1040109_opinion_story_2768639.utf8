		 Friday, January 09, 2004 							 																						READ BETWEEN THE LINES Ravi Vyas				 	 Newer vistas																								The publishing industry has changed beyond recognition over the past few years. No longer is it a gentlemanly occupation  it has entered the world of big business. Distinguished firms have meekly allowed themselves to be bought by media barons, and have become subject to multi-million dollar mergers and acquisitions. Two questions arise. Could the firms have stalled their acquisitions and consequent restructuring as a sub-division of the entertainment industry? And is this good or bad for the publisher, the distributor, the author and finally, the reader? 																								The answer to the first question is no. Almost all the big names of the Seventies and Eighties  Longman, Macmillan, Andre Deutsch  had reached a dead end. Since authors, aided by literary agents, were demanding much more in advances and royalties, acquisition of new manuscripts was increasingly becoming more expensive. Revamping the backlist with more reader-friendly and attractive formats was just as expensive because production costs had risen with the advent of new print technologies. 																								Remaining in business demanded more money. This resulted in the publishers giving in to media barons who controlled a range of communication products  newspapers and magazines, printing presses, television, satellite stations and so on. No publisher could have carried on simply by publishing books. 																								Increased acquisition and production costs were not all. Distribution costs or costs of sales leaped up too. The book store chains were demanding better trade terms  discounts of 45 per cent and more, 60-day credit with the guarantee of full returns, that is, copies that remained unsold would be returned and credit adjusted against future purchases. All this apart from higher warehouse costs. 																								For the publisher, there was simply no choice: he had to give in or perish. The fact that he is still around even if his identity has been merged in a larger conglomerate means that he has at least been given a fresh lease of life. The distributor has clearly gained with the influx of big money. He gets better terms, especially if he commands a chain of bookstores or if his bookshop is strategically located in the shopping malls. 																								The author, too, has gained somewhat. Developments in print and communications technology in the last decade have led to an inexhaustible appetite for new books and publishers are willing to pay more than before because they have more money to play around with.																								But what about the reader? Because big money is at stake, the kind of books that would be published after mergers and restructuring are precisely those which would be lucrative. For the mass market this means sex, glitz and violence, that has the potential to spin off into films and TV serials. At the other end are the science, technology and medicine reference books, subject dictionaries, books on professional courses, or coffee table pictorials  they require very heavy investments but can also be priced ten times the unit cost of production. 																								Publishing is moving increasingly towards segmented markets. But sadly, what will disappear is the mid-list or books that have no clearly defined readership profile. There is no place for them in an over-specialized world.						RAVI VYAS

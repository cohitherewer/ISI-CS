The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 							 																						ENTRY THROUGH THE EXIT POLL Gouri Chatterjee																					The morning after is frenetic. Reuters is not alone in reporting, Indias top politicians are racing to woo voters in giant northern heartland states after exit polls after the first round of voting suggested the Hindu nationalist-led coalition are set to return to power. Even those who are staying put are busy downplaying that part of the findings they dont want to agree with. 																					Living with exit poll results while the election process is on cant be easy. And will become progressively tougher with each round of voting and consequent round of exit polls. Especially if the findings remain as close as they were in the first round.																					It doesnt matter that pollsters have gone out of their way to point out all the pitfalls and uncertainties that make polls in India such a hit-and-miss affair. Prannoy Roy, the minence grise of opinion polls in India, even counselled, Take them with a pinch of salt, just before the graphics of his exit poll rolled.																					It doesnt matter too that polls make for such excruciatingly boring TV: all graphs, bar charts and loquacious experts but absolutely no action. It shows how desperate the channels are, how keen the competition is, to have gone in, one and all, for the huge expenses involved in such polls. 																					Nor is it really relevant that journalists, print and television, will continue to report on the electoral battle till the bitter end, indicating, may be even spelling out, the winners and losers. They never have and never will be taken as seriously. However imperfect, polls are seen to be objective, reports a journalists fallible impressions.																					So the demand for banning exit polls may gain ground in the next few weeks (though nothing can be done now). The right to freedom of expression can be such a two-edged sword. 																					Pretty figures																					When it comes to statistics, journalists are no better than the man on the street. Figures leave them cold, very cold. 																					So they never took much notice of the figures that put West Bengal at the high end of the countrys economic league table. Figures that showed that between 1992 to 2000, the states economy grew the fastest among the 15 major states, even more than Karnatakas. And that during the same period, per capita income in the state grew by 5.7 per cent, second only to Tamil Nadu (whose per capita income grew by 5.76 per cent). Also that West Bengals literacy level has been consistently higher than the national average and population growth rate lower than the national average. 																					Its only now, with flyovers and shopping malls sprouting all across Calcutta, that a spate of feel-good articles about city and the state has begun to crop up in the media. Hardly a case of unearthing something known to a few. Anyone with half an acquaintance with the city could say that. 																					Is it any surprise therefore that there appears to be few takers for the BJPs Shining India campaign? Everyone goes by their own experience, no matter who claims what.																					Best-laid plan																					The furore over Bob Woodwards new bestseller, Plan of Attack, detailing how the United States decided to go to war with Iraq, continues to rage in Washington. But even for those of us in distant parts of the world who are ready to believe the worst of George W. Bush, what is most intriguing is not the actions of Americas president but the actions, or lack thereof, of Americas best-known reporter.																					How could Woodward, one half of the two-member team that broke the worlds most famous news story, Watergate, hold on to such explosive information without rushing to print the moment he got the stuff? Name one Indian journalist who could do so.																					But then, Woodward has long graduated to a writer, something American journalists work assiduously towards. And his paper, The Washington Post, is happily reporting the flap the book has put the Bush regime into. I cant imagine any Indian employer being quite so magnanimous.

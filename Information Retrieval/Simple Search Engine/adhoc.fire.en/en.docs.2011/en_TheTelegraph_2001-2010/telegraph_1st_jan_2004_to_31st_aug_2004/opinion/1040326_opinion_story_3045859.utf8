		 Friday, March 26, 2004 							 																						TALKING ALLIES																														Electoral alliances require parties to make compromises without appearing to be losers. The Congress now seems to be accepting the compulsions of the coalition-dharma. In Jharkhand, the partys patience with the pressures from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has paid off. The deal may have forced the party to play second fiddle to Mr Sibu Soren of the JMM; but without it the Congresss chances in the Lok Sabha polls in the state would have been more uncertain. Without the alliance, the JMM was unlikely to win many seats on its own, yet it could queer the pitch for the Congress in almost all of the 14 seats in the state. It could thus prove to be a winning deal for both parties and their other partners  the Communist Party of India and the Rashtriya Janata Dal. This is so despite the fact that the Congress and the JMM would be locked in friendly fights for two seats over which their dispute remain unresolved. The success of the alliance-talks between the two parties, however, has implications beyond the parliamentary polls. Both parties want the alliance to work at the assembly elections in the state next year. Whether it will last till then will depend largely on the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls. And if it does, the Congress will be the junior partner in a government headed by Mr Soren. 																														The JMM leader himself remains something of a problem. Not only has he changed political camps several times in the past, thereby making himself an unreliable ally; the bribery charges against him, dating back to 1993, could provide fodder for the Bharatiya Janata Partys campaign in Jharkhand. But then, the BJP may have to contend with two problems in this. First, political morality and a leaders clean image are no longer winning factors in Indian politics. If Mr Sorens political fortunes dimmed in recent years, it is doubtful that it did so because of the charges of corruption against him. The more important problem for the BJP is the collapse of its alliance with the Janata Dal (United), its partner in the National Democratic Alliance government in Jharkhand. The Congresss success in finally striking up the alliance will surely be contrasted with the BJPs failure to retain its old allies. As a result, while the Congress-led alliance will prevent the splitting of the anti-BJP votes, the BJP cannot hope to make any such gains from divisions in the opposition camp. An entirely different scenario had helped the BJP nearly sweep Jharkhand in the last two parliamentary polls. The reversal in Jharkhand shows that a party may succeed with its coalition strategy in one state and fail in another.

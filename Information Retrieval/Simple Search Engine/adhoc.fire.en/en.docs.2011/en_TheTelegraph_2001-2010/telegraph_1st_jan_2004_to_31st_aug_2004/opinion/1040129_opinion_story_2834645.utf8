The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 							 																						OF THE PEOPLE																														The die is cast. India goes to the polls sooner than later. The life of the 13th Lok Sabha has been shortened by the recommendation of the prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to the president, Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, that the present Lok Sabha be dissolved. This is a clear sign that Mr Vajpayee, in the jargon of British political culture, wants to go the country. This has taken nobody by surprise. It was expected that the National Democratic Alliance would try and capitalize on the overall ambience of well-being and goodwill and go to the polls early. The results of the assembly polls late last year spurred on the decision to put the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies on election mode. The short session of the Lok Sabha that begins today will carry through certain essential business of the house without which the machinery of the government cannot run. The most important of these is the vote on account to meet the running expenses of the government. The governments announcement that the current Lok Sabha is only being reconvened has created a storm in the tea cup of constitutional propriety. The Congress has put forward the view that the reconvening violates the constitutional provision by which the president is supposed to address the joint houses of parliament at the beginning of every calendar year. Moreover, after the winter session the Parliament is customarily prorogued. The outgoing government may have to answer these allegations before it relinquishes office.																														The passing of this Lok Sabha will have nothing to remember it by. There were no memorable debates or any witty exchanges. This Lok Sabha will be remembered for the verbal duel last year between Mr Vajpayee and Ms Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the opposition. This is memorable not for the intellectual level of the exchanges or for the rhetorical flourishes. The sheer banality of the debate made it remarkable. The level of the debate is a measure of the political culture of India. The Lok Sabha is no longer a forum where ideas are discussed and debated. It could be argued that the standard of parliamentary debate has never been very high but the current level is poor even when compared to the Nehruvian era. Even the display of oratory does not match that of Nehrus era. Mr Vajpayee is an honourable exception to this last generalization. Even when his speeches lack content, the oratory is of a high order. This Lok Sabha will be missed only by those who will not get re-elected to the 14th Lok Sabha. The sad part is that there is no guarantee the 14th Lok Sabha will be an improvement on its predecessor.

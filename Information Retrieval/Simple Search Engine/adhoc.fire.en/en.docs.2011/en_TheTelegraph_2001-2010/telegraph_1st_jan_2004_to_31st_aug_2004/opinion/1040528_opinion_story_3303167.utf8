		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						REWRITING HISTORY				 	 New tasks																														Now that the old order has gone, school children could get back to reading the many voices of history. What this means is that the NCERT texts that were saffronized and which had become the standard history textbooks in most schools for a number of reasons  will be scrapped; new texts will be written or at least the old reprinted till the new, updated editions are readied. 																														However, two questions arise. First, will the NCERT, which holds the copyright to the books, need to go back to the original authors for permission to revise the texts? Second, how long will it take to get the new editions in place?																														The answer to the first question is a straight yes. The NCERT may hold the copyright and may have paid the authors a fee for the books, but permission has to be taken from the authors because the main body of the text is theirs. The NCERT did not take the required permission from them nor showed them the revised texts when they went about revising the books. It is anybodys guess what would have happened if the authors went to court. Delays would be inevitable and at the expense of students, and the final verdict could well go against the NCERT. 																														The revision of the texts itself amounted to no more than adding a few paragraphs here and there to glorify Hindu values. It was the worst kind of scissors-and-paste job carried out by some historians wedded to the Hindutva philosophy. But superficial as the changes might have been, they were enough to distort the books as a whole and twist young impressionable minds. The authors and some scholars made some feeble protests, but nothing came of it. The schools accepted it because it would have been too much to stand up to the establishment. Besides, questions in the final examinations would be culled from the NCERT texts.																														The question repeatedly asked in the initial years of the National Democratic Alliance is why the NCERT adopted short-cut methods to get the revised texts in time for the new academic year beginning 2000. 																														There are two possible answers. First, writing an entirely new text from scratch takes time and patience. It is also a question of assessing the ability of potential authors to write a clean copy, keeping in mind the linguistic standards of the average student. Many textbooks in India fail because the author(s) has not been able to assess the latter. This requires some years of experience; first-time authors cant do the trick.																														Language, style and subject matter are the three key ingredients for a successful book. But these are qualities not easy to find in any single teacher or a team of teachers. The subject matter is invariably covered in a simple, straightforward way. Language and style almost always falter, or at least require very close editing. This takes time and patience. 																														It will take many months to bring out new texts. It cant be done any earlier if it has to be done reasonably well.						RAVI VYAS

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 							 																						NORTH WIND																								Bhutans offensive against Indian rebels has offered Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee both an opportunity and a challenge. It has broken the back as well as the morale of the militants belonging to the Kamtapur Liberation Organization. It has also gone a long way in snapping the KLOs logistical and other links with mentors like the United Liberation Front of Asom. It is now upto the chief minister to seize the opportunity and stamp out the menace of militancy in north Bengal. The violence and subversions that the senseless movement for a separate Kamtapur state unleashed has been a disaster for the regions peace and economy. Apart from sporadic Naxalite violence in some south Bengal districts, the Kamtapur rebellion has been the worst threat to peace in West Bengal in recent years. The movement may not have a large following, but the geography of the region has long made it difficult for the state to fight it. Besides, it became a rallying point for malcontents and political adversaries out to embarrass the ruling Marxists. It is possible, though, that some unrelenting elements within the KLO would ignore Mr Bhattacharjees latest appeal to the outfit to give up arms and return to peace. It would be unrealistic for the chief minister to expect the militancy to wither away. In step with Assam and the union government, West Bengal has to complete the task that Thimphu began. 																								Mr Bhattacharjee also faces a challenge of weeding out the causes which the KLO exploited. Both in the northern and the southern parts of Bengal, there is an increasing tendency among political extremists to rope in tribals and other poorer sections of the people. If the Kamtapuris managed to win the support of even small sections of tribals in north Bengal, that was obviously because they felt more deprived and more alienated than other people. Even partners of the ruling Left Front, such as the Forward Bloc, routinely complain of lack of development in north Bengal. The regions only organized industry  tea  has long been in decline. The governments lack of vision has thwarted private entrepreneurs initiatives to exploit the areas tourism potential. The board set up a few years ago for north Bengals development has generated more political debates than hope for the people. Development may not necessarily be an antidote to militant politics, but it may take the sting out of the extremists propaganda battle. It is also worth pondering why sections of the people are disillusioned with the political process. Unless these basic problems are examined and remedies attempted, there will always be disgruntled groups raring to fall to the lure of the gun.

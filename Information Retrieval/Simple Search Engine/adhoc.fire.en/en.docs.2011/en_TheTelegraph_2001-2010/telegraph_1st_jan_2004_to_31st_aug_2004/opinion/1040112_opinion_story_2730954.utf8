		 Monday, January 12, 2004  FOR WHOM THE WARNING BELLS TOLL
 Warren Buffets modern fable about  a world where the dollar is devalued, has lessons for the  US as well as the rest of the world, writes S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India		 Alice in SquanderlandOne of the richest persons in  the world, Warren Buffet, has not become rich by sheer luck  or circumstance. He has been good at exploring opportunities  for investment. He is entrusted with billions of dollars  by Americans and others for investment. The news is that  he has declared himself a sceptic about the future of the  greenback  a warning signal for those who deal in foreign  currencies. In the November 17, 2003 issue  of Fortune, Buffet expressed his concerns very vividly,  narrating a fable about two imaginary islands, Squanderville  and Thriftsville. He compares the United States of America  to Squanderville, which buys 4 per cent more goods and services  from the rest of the world than it produces, represented  by Thriftsville. Thriftsville supplies these goods and services  in return for bonds, which are denominated in Squanderbucks.  This is generally representative of the present situation  of the global economy in which the rest of the world is  financing the excess consumption of US by lending resources  to the US economy for which it receives bonds in dollars. Buffet extends his fable into  the future in which Squanderville continues to accumulate  liabilities to Thriftsville. Thriftsville accumulates in  turn a huge quantity of bonds, representing the rest of  the worlds claims on future output of Squanderville. Trouble  is brewing. Experts warn Squanderville that it is difficult  to service such large liabilities. Thriftsville residents are aware  of the risks they face. In Buffets words, they start to  ask What good is it to hold the IOUs of a shiftless island?  They change their approach. They sell most of their bonds  to Squanderville residents. They get in return other scraps  of paper  Squanderbucks. They start using these bucks for  buying Squanderville Island. Eventually, Thriftsville owns  all of Squanderville. In effect, Squanderville has been  colonized by purchase rather than conquest.  Buffets remarks are a true reflection  of the emerging global economic reality. He compares the  situation with what obtained in the global economy after  World War II. Ever since the war ended and till the Seventies,  the US economy operated in the Thriftsville mode, selling  more goods and services than it purchased. In the result,  it invested lots of resources in the rest of the world.  The USs net investment, which included investment inside  the US as well as that outside, was significant. This, in  turn, gave rise to a large reverse flow of income in the  shape of dividends. This continued till the Seventies. Over the last five years, the  decline in fortunes has speeded up. The rest of the world  owns a surprising $2.5 trillion more of the US than the  US owns of other countries. Buffet quotes a figure of 5  per cent as the percentage of the national wealth held by  foreigners. To add to it, foreign ownership of the US climbs  at $ 500 billion a year  the amount by which the US lives  beyond its means in a year. This means that the annual deficit  increases even further, to the extent that these liabilities  carry a cost in terms of interest and dividends. This is  a world of compounding of interest. This spending spree  cannot continue indefinitely. Buffet notes that the US is able  to enjoy a special status because of its special circumstances.  It is able to behave at present with a sense of irresponsibility  because of its past record of good behaviour. So to say,  the US has a national credit card with large drawing limits.  This is supported by the large amount of desirable assets  which the US has. But, there is a drawing limit to  the USs credit card.  In this connection, I would like  to draw attention to the remarks of Kenneth Rogoff, former  chief economist of the International Monetary Fund: Foreign  creditors give poor countries just enough rope to hang themselves.  They are giving the US enough rope to tie the noose around  their neck several times. This contradiction is self-evident  to all except those who should be concerned  the creditor  nations of Asia and Europe, who are pumping their reserves  into American securities denominated in a potentially falling  currency and offering low returns. In a way, this is particularly  a real-life dilemma for the central banks of Asia, which  are accumulating dollar-denominated assets as they intervene  in their forex markets to buy dollars with a view to keeping  their own currencies at a low value. This is needed rightly,  in their view, lest their own currencies appreciate too  high for their exporters to be able to compete. Rogoffs  analogy could be extended to say that the rope Asia extends  to the US may not be a noose but a lifeline to help its  own exporters to grow. Buffet, true to his reputation  as an investment sage, has also suggested a solution to  the US crisis. He believes that the US can escape the problems  of insufficient exports by introducing an import certificate,  which enables exporters to finance imports. These certificates  will be tradable and will be useful for financing imports.  The suggested solution is similar to what India tried in  the Nineties  the exim scrips. Ultimately, these gimmicks  are, however, not worth the while. Every currency finds  its level, whatever the gimmicks. Eventually, a dollar devaluation  may be inescapable. This should concern our reserve managers  because the value of our billions of dollars will take a  hit if the dollar sinks further. Hopefully, our central  bank has distributed its nest-egg in diversified currencies,  but mostly it would be in dollars. A decline of the dollar  may prove costly. We may, however, note that expert  opinion is not all on the side of Buffet. Alan Greenspan  himself is confident of the USs soft landing. He feels  that market forces will eventually defuse the deficit. But  the fact is that Greenspans forecast means that the dollar  may devalue. The rest of the world has necessarily to spend  sleepless nights over what it means for the value of its  reserves. Today, the lesson of Buffets  fable cannot be lost in the hype that Greenspans optimism  offers. The fact is that it is the flow of Asian capital  which keeps interest rate low in the US and sustains its  rate of expansion such as it is. It is arguable whether  there will be a smooth landing or an explosive collision.  But, in both events, the USs exchange rate has to adjust  and it will go downward. The dangers posed by the USs  extravagance are picturesquely summed up by a story narrated  by French economist, Jacques Rueff. He said, If I had an  arrangement with my tailor that whatever I pay him returns  to me the very same day as a loan, I would have no objection  at all at ordering more suits from him. Similarly, America  continues to order goods from Asia, paying for them with  funds which Asia lends to the US as loans. This is a Ponzi  game, which has to end in due course, in an implosion of  financial order. It would be unfortunate if we  come to the end of this game with a crisis, resulting in  the US withdrawing within a protectionist shell. Its repeated  attempts to restrict imports of goods and services  steel  from China, software from India  are all indications of  such dangerous trends. The time has come for all countries  to get together to attempt a solution of this problem.  Meanwhile, of immediate import  is the question of what happens to our reserves, kept in  US dollars. How much is kept in US dollars is not known.  We need to be satisfied that sufficient safeguards are taken  to ensure that the reserves do not turn to empty scraps  of Squanderbucks. What happened to our sterling balances  with the devaluation of UKs sterling should not happen  to our reserves with the USs dollar devaluation. Buffets  fable holds lessons not only for the US, but for the rest  of the world as well.

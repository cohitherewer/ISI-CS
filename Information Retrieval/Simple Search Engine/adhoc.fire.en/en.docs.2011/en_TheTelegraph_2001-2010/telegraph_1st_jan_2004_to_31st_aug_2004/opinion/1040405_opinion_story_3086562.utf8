		 Monday, April 05, 2004 							 																						ANOTHER ROAD																														The rhetoric of roadmaps hardly inspires trust anywhere in the world today. Such roads are supposed to lead from terror or oppression to peace or democracy. But if they have done no such thing in west Asia yet, then there is little reason to be hopeful about such talk emanating from the military dictators of Myanmar. Last August, the Myanmarese junta had announced its own roadmap to democracy to a sceptical international community. Myanmars foreign minister has now let on that Ms Aung Sang Suu Kyi is to be released from house arrest before a landmark constitutional conference on May 17. Ever since her National League for Democracy spectacularly won the elections in 1990, the military regime has used force and fraud to over-ride this assertion of democracy by keeping Ms Suu Kyi, and her colleagues in the NLD, in captivity, either in their homes or in the countrys grimmest prisons. Almost 60 now, the Nobel Peace laureate, no doubt depleted by continuous incarceration, remains an icon of indomitable political resistance in the eyes of the world. Out of house arrest until May last year, she was caught again that month after a got-up clash between her supporters and the militarys political front, the ironically named State Peace and Development Council. It is widely believed that many of her supporters were massacred then, and her most eminent colleagues, some of them in their eighties, also put under arrest. Since then, she has been moved between prison and home, and has refused offers of release made by the junta. She would accept freedom only after her colleagues are released. 																														The Myanmarese junta have remained opaque and intransigent in spite of the sanctions and warnings imposed by such powers as the United States of America, the European Union, Britain and Japan. The United Nations has sent envoys to Myanmar to keep up dialogue with and vigilance over the regime  but to little avail, as far as the fates of Ms Suu Kyi and her senior colleagues are concerned. Perhaps more unequivocal pressure and disapproval from countries like China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia would be of greater effectiveness than the persuasive powers of the Western nations. Although the nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation get together primarily as an economic forum, they must also sustain a common position to isolate and pressure the Myanmarese junta to respect human rights and return the country to civilian rule. Such issues have been addressed by the APEC before, notably in relation to East Timor in 1999. The first stage of the Myanmarese roadmap will have to be the reconvening of the National Convention  disbanded in 1996 after the NLD walked out  in order to draft a new constitution. Ms Suu Kyi and her colleagues are indispensable for this initial step towards democracy. Meanwhile, the rest of the free world can do little more than wait and watch.

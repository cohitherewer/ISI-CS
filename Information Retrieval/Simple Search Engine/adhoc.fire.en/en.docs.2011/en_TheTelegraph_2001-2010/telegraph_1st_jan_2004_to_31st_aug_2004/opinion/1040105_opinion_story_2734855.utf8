		 Monday, January 05, 2004  ITS TIME TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS 
 The BJPs refusal to rein in Jayalalithaa  as also contradictions inherent in their coalition drove the  DMK and MDMK out of the NDA, argues M.R. Venkatesh Alone is best  In politics, a new chemistry often  generates a new arithmetic. This paradox explains the scenario  in Tamil Nadu over the past ten days, as the Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam and the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam  pulled their ministers out of the Union cabinet and quit  the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance  at the Centre.  The BJPs one consolation is that  the Pattali Makkal Katchi, led by S. Ramadoss, remains in  the NDA. Thus the departure of the DMK and the MDMK poses  no threat to the stability of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led  coalition, for now, at any rate. Even so, the PMKs continued  presence in the NDA is at best cold comfort for the BJP  as the next Lok Sabha polls are not far way.  The DMK had been gradually alienated  from the BJP ever since the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam, headed by J. Jayalalithaa, came back to power  in the state in May 2001. But the presence of Murasoli Maran  in the Vajpayee cabinet had cemented the DMKs relationship  with the BJP in New Delhi. Maran, as the Union commerce  and industries minister, was not just the DMKs new icon  in the capital, his equations with the BJP top brass, at  least initially, helped soften the blows being rained on  the DMK president, M. Karunanidhi, and others, by Jayalalithaa.  But worse was to follow. First,  the ideological crisis triggered off in the DMK by the post-Godhra  communal riots. Ironically, at around the same time, Jayalalithaa  came into her own as chief minister, winning the Andipatti  by-poll in February 2002 after the Madras high court had  cleared her in the Tansi land deal and Pleasant Stay Hotel  cases.  And once Jayalalithaa began wooing  Hindu sentiments, first by the temple annadhana scheme  and later by enacting a law to ban forcible religious conversions,  the state BJP units unabashed appreciation of amma  shook the confidence the DMK and the MDMK had reposed in  the BJP since 1999. The Centres Prevention of Terrorism  Act, which was mainly intended to curb cross-border terrorism,  had also become a powerful tool in the hands of the Jayalalithaa  regime. Its first victim was the BJPs staunch defender  in Parliament, the MDMK leader, Vaiko, in July 2002. Next,  the Tamil Nationalist Movement leader, P. Nedumaran, was  also netted for speeches made in support of the Liberation  Tigers of Tamil Eelam.  The long arm of the anti-terror  law also caught up with Nakkeeran editor, R.R. Gopal,  who had been the governments emissary to Veerappan in the  negotiations for the release of Kannada actor Rajkumar.  All this reinforced the oppositions case in Tamil Nadu  that POTA was being misused by the AIADMK to settle political  scores and that the BJP at the Centre had done nothing to  halt the onslaught.  The BJP, which had a political  understanding with the Akalis, swiftly rushed to defend  Parkash Singh Badal in Punjab when he was being probed by  the Congress government in a disproportionate assets case.  But when the houses of former DMK ministers in Tamil Nadu  were raided by vigilance officials, there was not even a  murmur of protest from the BJP in support of its otherwise  trusted Tamil Nadu ally, the DMK complained. The BJP also  did not respond when the partys youth wing leader, M.K.  Stalin, was stripped of the Chennai mayorship through a  speedy legislation by the Jayalalithaa regime.  For the BJP, the need to keep  amma happy flowed from its anxiety not to lose the  support of its Hindutva constituency in the state.  Hence, it was not surprising that both the DMK and MDMK  cited the BJPs overt and covert support to the AIADMK  over a period of time as one of the main reasons for quitting  the NDA, apart from POTA being a major irritant in their  relationship.  Karunanidhi partly attributed  the delay in quitting the NDA to Marans prolonged illness,  the DMK chief has now disclosed a more basic reason. That  was the BJPs decision not to back the DMK candidate, Nagoor  Hanifa, in the by-election from the Muslims-dominated Vaniyambadi  constituency in June 2002  because our candidate was a  Muslim, said Karunanidhi. The DMK leader was angry at the  serious violation of the NDAs common agenda that decreed  that no discrimination would be made on the basis of religion.  He was also furious that his complaints to the BJP high  command about the state units attitude had no effect.  The situation poses fresh challenges  to the NDA. For the BJP, mere insistence on coalition dharma   the phrase M. Venkaiah Naidu kept harping on when the  DMK announced it would agitate over POTA and other issues   will not help it to tide over underlying contradictions.  More so, when the BJPs regional allies feel threatened  about the erosion in their social bases as it tries to steal  a march.  In this connection, it is important  that the DMK has, of late, been insisting that Tamil be  declared a classical language by the Centre, instead of  being just one of the official languages. It has been reinforcing  its commitment to the Tamil language and culture, as much  as its concern about the minorities.  Even the PMK, which is a part  of the NDA for now, has said that if in the long run, the  BJP wants the support of regional allies, then it cannot  ignore the demands and aspirations of the people of the  respective regions, which only the regional parties reflect.  Its leader, Ramadoss, referred to the BJPs indifference  to the plight of the Cauvery delta farmers in Tamil Nadu  as an example of this.  On the defensive, Venkaiah Naidu  has said that the NDAs common agenda has been most flexible.  But that is a matter of debate, especially when it comes  to contentious issues like Ayodhya and an uniform civil  code.  But what is needed for a viable  coalition, as borne out by the latest political turmoil  in Tamil Nadu, is a proper conflict resolution machinery,  instead of the NDA convenor, George Fernandes, making a  last minute dash to sort out issues.  The BJPs is now in the horns  of a dilemma in Tamil Nadu. Should it come to terms with  the AIADMK, which seems to be more ideologically compatible,  even as its leader, Jayalalithaa, is out to drive a hard  political bargain? Or should it tie up with minor parties  like the PMK, since the two other important Dravidian parties,  the DMK and MDMK, want to disconnect from an extreme right  and communally sensitive outlook, to save their skin?

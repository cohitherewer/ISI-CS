The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 							 																						DOUBLE TAKE																														Electoral campaigns are all about influencing the peoples perceptions of reality. No wonder that the people of Jharkhand had very different views from Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Ms Sonia Gandhi on what the new state has given them. For the prime minister, Jharkhand, like Chhattisgarh, has given the tribals not only a state they could call their own but also a new identity. He was obviously keen on taking electoral advantage from the fact that the National Democratic Alliance government had created the two tribal-majority states. It is an entirely different matter, though, whether the rulers of Jharkhand had been able to fulfil the aspirations of the people. The movement for a separate tribal state in the region was inspired by the peoples sense of alienation from the rulers in Patna. It was not only the lack of a distinct ethnic identity but also the economic deprivations that prompted the people to call for the regions separation from Bihar. It was as much a political as an economic dream that drove the Jharkhand movement.																														The political overtone notwithstanding, there is substance in Ms Gandhis complaint that the dream has been shattered. And the Bharatiya Janata Party, as leader of the NDA government in the state, has to take the blame for it. The new states history has so far been marked by political chaos and administrative incompetence. The factional feuds within the BJP and the partys problems with its partners have led to the removal of the former chief minister, Mr Babulal Marandi. His replacement with Mr Arjun Munda may have saved the coalition government, but it did little to inspire better understanding among the NDA partners or to improve the administration. The state governments inept handling of the domicile issue  over the reservation of jobs for the local people  has driven a wedge between the tribal and non-tribal sections of the population. Instead of giving them a new identity, ethnicity became a political tool for expanding vote- banks. The biggest casualty of this politics of expediency has been the failure on the economic front. Little wonder that different Maoist groups exploited the lack of governance to lure an increasing number of poor people to their ranks. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the prime ministers appeal to the Maoists to give up violence and join the political mainstream. Extremist politics can only sour the dream that marked the birth of the state. But the Maoists will succeed further in their destructive game if Jharkhands politicians continue to fail. Scoring poll points may help politicians, but not the people.

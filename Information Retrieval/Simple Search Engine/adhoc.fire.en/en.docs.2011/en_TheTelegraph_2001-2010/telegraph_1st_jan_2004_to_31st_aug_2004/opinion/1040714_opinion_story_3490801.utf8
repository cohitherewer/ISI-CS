The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 							 																						STATION TO POST OFFICE Shobita Punja																					I am absolutely delighted that on June 30 the article on VT Station was published in The Telegraph, and the very next week, UNESCO seemed to have heard our plea and declared VT a world heritage site. This does not mean that UNESCO will give any funding for the conservation and maintenance of VT, but it does mean a big change in world affairs. For the first time, a functional building anywhere in the world has been given this exalted status of being a building that symbolizes the creative genius of humankind, an example of our international common heritage, there for the whole world to protect and admire.																					The problem starts now when the Indian Railways will have to abide by international standards for the protection of world heritage sites and take special care of the worlds busiest railway terminus with 700 staff and nearly 30 lakh commuters passing through it every day.																					Following this success story we need to quickly make a plea for other functional buildings that are of historic or architectural value, that add distinction to our cities and are landmarks in their own right. Lets take our post offices for example and all the grand GPOs that grace our cities. These buildings service millions of people, bringing them together through the postal system and forging communication systems where none exists. 																					It is these buildings that for over 100 years have kept communication alive for thousands of people. It is from here that messages of happiness and sadness were sent around the country and the world. Today, when e-mail and internet communication have superseded the postal system, and even threaten to wipe out the comforting handwritten letter, we must not forget what these buildings have done in the service of the nation.																					Only connect																					We need to recall that all human beings love to communicate. We long to share and be in touch and these post offices are a symbol of that love. Before e-mails and the postal system-communication were slow and very tedious. Pigeons were trained to serve as our erstwhile messengers. Our brave runners travelled miles on foot and horseback to deliver messages of war and peace across vast territories.																					Chennai has a beautiful GPO. The famed architect, Robert Chisholm, completed it on North Beach Road in 1884. The building was close to the dock that brought ships from England to India with letters and months-old news to those stationed here. This huge building covers over 5,000 square metres. The magnificent size of the building is matched by its height and its varied rooftops. Long, tiled gable arches, reminiscent of Keralas steep, sloping red-tiled roofs are interspersed with flat-roofed towers. 																					Other features, like the arches and columns, have been inspired by the wooden architecture of Gujarat and the projecting balconies from the Islamic architecture of Bijapur or even Rajasthan. All the while, the general impression of the building is a well-knit combination of architectural details from different parts of the country. The edifice has an unmistakably early-colonial Indo- Saracenic feel to it, in which Hindu, Islamic and European elements have been fused together. In telegraphic language, all of Indias history is compressed into this building.																					This building is in urgent need of repair as a fire some years ago ate away large portions of the structure in the northern wing and the tiled roofs of the domineering towers were disturbed by a cyclone not long ago. We need to begin by conserving the grand GPOs of our metropolitan cites  Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai  and then think of saving the lovely post offices in all our other cities.																					While the postal department has a museum of the history of stamps and first-day covers in Delhi, one wonders if anyone in the department of posts and telegraph has thought of putting into its budget a small maintenance allowance for the heritage buildings that he inhabits.																					P.C. would not be very PC (politically correct) if he has not reserved a budget to preserve our extraordinary Indian heritage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 							 																						FAME OF POVERTY																														Exotica turns into poverty in the same way that electra turns into banality. When India was ruled by the British, it was associated, in the minds of foreigners, with maharajahs, hunting parties and the Indian rope trick. After independence, despite the best efforts of Jawaharlal Nehru, and more recently, the India Shining brigade, India evokes images of poverty and deprivation. Poverty in India sells globally. The latest example of this trend is the designer, Mr Sabyasachi Mukherjee, whose creations in the Lakme India Fashion Week won international acclaim because they had an aura of bohemia around them. Designs made by Mr Mukherjee could help to be down and out in Paris and London. To appear poor is to appear chic. This should not raise too many eyebrows or hackles. If one looks at the list of Indians who have earned acclaim in their chosen fields across the globe  Satyajit Ray, Mother Teresa, Mr Amartya Sen and Ravi Shankar  all of them, save the sitar maestro, have had their names linked to poverty in India. The most obvious is the fame that accrued to Mother Teresa once she made looking after the poor and the ailing of Calcutta equivalent to her devotion to Jesus Christ. Without Calcuttas poverty, Mother Teresa would have no fame, and her critics have argued that her work and the publicity it received gave Calcutta a bad name. Satyajit Ray was accused by Nargis Dutt of peddling poverty to make a name for himself. And much of Mr Sens fame as an economist rests on the work he did on poverty and famines.																														Since more than three celebrities have had their fames linked to deprivation, one can, following the famous injunction of Goldfinger, see it as a phenomenon that is above the law of coincidences. None of these persons, if the truth be told, ever tried to cash in on other peoples lack of moolah. They tried, in their work, to capture and cope with the reality that surrounded them in India. Mr Mukherjee has merely designed clothes that ordinary women can wear and still appear fashionable. His collection, he confessed, was for the frog princess. Similarly, Rays Pather Panchali reflected life in rural Bengal and broke away in content and form from the romanticism and sentimentality that had marked Indian films before him. The appeal of Rays film lay in his treatment and his craft. The charm of Mr Mukherjees designs lies in their novelty and their innovativeness. But such is the power of poverty in India that it is seen even where it does not exist. It would be a shame if poverty, like beauty, lay in the eyes of the beholder.

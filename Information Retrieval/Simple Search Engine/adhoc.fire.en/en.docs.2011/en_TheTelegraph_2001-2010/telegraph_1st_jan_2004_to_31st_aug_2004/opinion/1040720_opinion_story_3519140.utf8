		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 							 																						THE POSSIBILITY OF STAGNATION						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the West Bengal Human Development Report, 2004				 	 Supportive system																														Health and Nutrition: Health and nutritional status are two crucial and interlinked aspects of human development, which in turn interact with the demographic variables in important ways. While health and nutrition conditions can be related with aggregate economic growth, there is no necessary or linear causation, and policy interventions can play an important role in determining both access to health services and nutrition, as well as outcome indicators in this area. In West Bengal, several outcome indicators suggest that while average conditions are still inadequate and could have improved more rapidly, there is more equality of access across the population to basic health and nutrition than in many other states.																														Demographic features relevant for health: Certain features like population density, population growth rate, sex ratio and rate of migration to urban areas are directly related to the health and nutrition situations of the community. ...The extent of reduction of the decennial growth rate of population in West Bengal has been quite impressive at nearly 7 per cent compared to the Indian average of 2.5 per cent. The improvement in the sex ratio in West Bengal has been considerable, at the rate of 1.86 per cent as compared to the average Indian improvement of 0.6 per cent. The rate of increase of the urban population in West Bengal was less than 1 per cent, much less than the Indian average of 2 per cent, indicating that rural-to-urban migration has been substantially less in the state than elsewhere in the country.																														As already noted, although the mean decennial growth rate of population has increased, there are significant differences across districts. Sex ratios also show district-wise differences, with Medinipur being the best and Calcutta the worst. Of course, high rates of male in-migration into Calcutta may explain this to some extent; however, the sex ratio for 0-6 years is also the lowest in Calcutta.																														...The crude death rate in West Bengal is much less as compared to the Indian average, indicating that the health system is more supportive in preventing death. It has also improved more rapidly in the recent past than the all-India indicator. Further, West Bengal ranks third in India with respect to infant mortality rates. Nevertheless, obviously further policy interventions are needed to control fertility and birth, since there is still considerable scope for improvement even in these indicators. In addition, the average age at marriage still remains low in West Bengal, although it appears to have increased in recent years. Since teenage marriage and pregnancy tends to be associated with low birth weight and higher infant mortality, and also higher maternal mortality, this is an issue that needs to be addressed.																														The infant mortality rate of West Bengal, at 51 per thousand, is quite good by aggregate Indian standards. As expected, the IMR in urban areas is much lower than that in the rural areas.																														Even in terms of reduction over time, in the 1982-1992 period and the 1992-2002 period, West Bengal appears to have done much better than India as a whole, which clearly suggests a gradual improvement in health facilities over the years in the state. The gap between West Bengal and India is especially high for female IMR, indicating that West Bengal has a better record of ensuring the lives of girl infants than India as a whole.																														The total IMR for rural areas also shows a reasonably good decrease over the years. However, although the total IMR for urban areas is much less than that of the rural areas, the rate of reduction in the urban IMR... has not decreased significantly in the last few years, indicating a possible stagnation in the reduction of IMR in urban areas. This suggests that the existing health service facilities in the urban areas are possibly getting stretched and that a much greater effort will be needed to bring down IMR further. It is also well-known that as the situation improves, further progress becomes more difficult. TO BE CONCLUDED

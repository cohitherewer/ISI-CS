By C.A. Kincaid, Rupa, Rs 295The stories in The Rupa Book of Indian Love Stories have been collected from C.A. Kincaids Tales of Old Ind. The introduction to the book is by none other than the well-loved storyteller, Ruskin Bond. Bond tells us about the essence of the stories and whatever little is known about Kincaid. He makes a very important point. He says that the scarcity of information about Kincaids personal life is representative of the preference of earlier writers to stay in the background and let their works speak for themselves. The primary concern of most authors was to tell a story well. And that is exactly what Kincaid does. Which is why even after all these years, his works retain their interest and freshness. 																														The stories which Kincaid tells are age-old tales that have been loved and nurtured by listeners for generations. Legends of Hir and Ranjho, Suhni and Mehar, Mamul and Rano, are as well loved by Indians as the tales of Romeo-Juliet, Troilus-Cressida are by Europeans. These tales possess a charm that lives on through numerous retellings. It is impossible to date them. They have been handed down from one generation to another by word of mouth. They have taken the form of poetry, novels, and even films, through the ages. Every fresh retelling has added a new flavour to them. As a result, many of them have metamorphosed from incidents to myths. Kincaids retellings have a special appeal because they give a new dimension to these tales. 																														The tales originate in the East but are narrated from a Western perspective. In Kincaids hands, they assume fairy-tale proportions, and begin with the inevitable fairy-tale phrase, Once upon a time....																														In spite of the title, not all the tales are love stories in the conventional sense of the term. For example, the tale of Dodo and Chanesar, is more of a story of sibling rivalry and fight for power. Or take the story of King Dyach and Bijal. The storys focus is on Bijals dilemma in killing King Dyach, and on King Dyach keeping his word to Bijal. There is hardly any love plot in the tale. But these, rather than spoiling the effect, gives variety to the book. 																														Along with these, the book contains traditional love stories as well. Some of them end on a note of sadness while others end happily. If the readers feel disheartened at the fate of Punho-Saswi, Mamul-Rano, Kauro-Chanesar and Suhni-Mehar, then the fortunes of Rajbala, Hir-Ranjho, Jan Tamachi-Nuri, Birsing-Sundarbai and Kamsen-Kamrup should make them happy. 																														Many of the tales tell mythical birth stories that are reminiscent of the legend of Oedipus. Lives are foretold and man tries to avoid his destiny by attempting to control it. The tales seem to prove, though, that man can never rule his fate. This quality enhances the fairy-tale/mythical effect of the tales and lends them a romantic charm. 																														Kincaids stories take the reader back to a familiar yet mysterious past. It is a pleasure to undertake this journey, because its charm does not end until the last page is turned.						JHELUM BISWAS

		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 							 																						POLLUTION IS A PERSISTENT PROBLEM						DOCUMENT From the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants which came into force on May 17, 2004				 	 Keep out																														The parties to this Convention, recognizing that persistent organic pollutants possess toxic properties, resist degradation, bioaccumulate and are transported, through air, water and migratory species, across international boundaries and deposited far from their place of release, where they accumulate in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; aware of the health concerns, especially in developing countries, resulting from local exposure to persistent organic pollutants, in particular, impacts upon women and, through them, upon future generations;																														Acknowledging that the Arctic ecosystems and indigenous communities are particularly at risk because of the biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants and that contamination of their traditional foods is a public health issue; conscious of the need for global action on persistent organic pollutants; mindful of decision 19/13 C of February 7, 1997 of the Governing Council of the United Nations environment programme to initiate international action to protect human health and the environment through measures which will reduce and/or eliminate emissions and discharges of persistent organic pollutants; recalling the pertinent provisions of the relevant international environmental conventions, especially the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade... Recalling also the pertinent provisions of the Rio declaration on environment and development and agenda 21; acknowledging that precaution underlies the concerns of all the parties and is embedded within this Convention,...TO BE CONCLUDEDThis is the concluding part of the letter from 52 former senior British diplomats to Tony Blair, April 27, 2004																														The military actions of the coalition forces must be guided by political objectives and by the requirements of the Iraq theatre itself, not by criteria remote from them. It is not good enough to say that the use of force is a matter for local commanders. Heavy weapons unsuited to the task in hand, inflammatory language, the current confrontations in Najaf and Falluja, all these have built up rather than isolated the opposition. The Iraqis killed by coalition forces probably total 10-15,000 (it is a disgrace that the coalition forces themselves appear to have no estimate), and the number killed in the last month in Falluja alone is apparently several hundred including many civilian men, women and children. Phrases such as We mourn each loss of life. We salute them, and their families for their bravery and their sacrifice, apparently referring only to those who have died on the coalition side, are not well judged to moderate the passions these killings arouse. We share your view that the British government has an interest in working as closely as possible with the US on both these related issues, and in exerting real influence as a loyal ally. We believe that the need for such influence is now a matter of the highest urgency. If that is unacceptable or unwelcome there is no case for supporting policies which are doomed to failure. 																														Yours faithfully, 																														Sir Graham Boyce (ambassador to Egypt 1999-2001); Sir Terence Clark (ambassador to Iraq 1985-89); Francis Cornish (ambassador to Israel 1998-2001); Sir James Craig (ambassador to Saudi Arabia 1979-84); Ivor Lucas (ambassador to Syria 1982-84); Richard Muir (ambassador to Kuwait 1999-2002); Sir Crispin Tickell (British permanent representative to the UN 1987-90); Sir Harold (Hooky) Walker (ambassador to Iraq 1990-91), and 44 others CONCLUDED

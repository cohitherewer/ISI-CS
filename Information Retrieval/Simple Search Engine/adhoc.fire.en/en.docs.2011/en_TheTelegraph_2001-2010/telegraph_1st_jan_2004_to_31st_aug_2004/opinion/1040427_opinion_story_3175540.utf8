The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 							 																						STILL AT SEA																														Stalling things comes naturally to Bengals militant trade unionists. But what the Forward Seamens Union did to stall the voyage of a Port Blair-bound ship was not just another episode in the dubious annals of labour militancy; it was a vicious example of how irresponsible trade unionism can be devoid of all humane values. Little wonder then that the agitating union members not only roughed up the ships captain but also refused to provide food to the passengers. Even mothers with little children could not elicit help or sympathy from the agitators. One shudders to even think of the trauma the passengers would have suffered if the voyage had been stalled, not at the Kidderpore docks, but out in the sea. There must be something rotten about a labour strategy that would thus allow holding innocent people to ransom. It cannot be anybodys argument that the agitators did not have the right to ask for their dues. The Shipping Corporation of India, which runs the service between Calcutta and Port Blair, should have taken steps to sort out the dispute over the crews dues. It was simply unfair of the corporation to have kept the issue unresolved and approve an uncertain voyage. 																														The fact that the union is affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions is no coincidence. The labour wing of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) has long remained the biggest stumbling block on the states road to economic recovery. The stalled voyage will easily be seen as a metaphor for disruptions that stymie Bengals progress. It has already revived bitter memories of the time in 1997, when the same unions disruptive tactics stalled the ships service for ten months. Despite his many assurances to hold the CITU in check, the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, obviously finds the task still formidable. True, there have been occasions when he sought to live up to his promise. But incidents such as this tend to damage his credibility in two ways. They rouse old suspicions about whether the leopard can really change its spots. And, they raise questions about his sincerity  and ability  to rein in errant comrades. Such questions can be absolutely disastrous for his attempts to woo investors to Bengal. Mr Bhattacharjee needs to take a hard look at the CITUs militant ways and also at his own attempts to eliminate them. Evidently, he needs to do more than he has done so far. He has to prove unequivocally, both to the people and to the investors, that he puts the states interests above his partys. He has earned enough goodwill with some of his reformist policies. He cannot afford to let the unreformed men in the CITU or his party undo it.

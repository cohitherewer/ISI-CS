The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 							 																						TALKING RIGHT																														The successful conclusion of the talks between India and Pakistan on nuclear issues will be widely welcomed. It is critical now to sustain the momentum and ensure the creation of a safe and stable south Asia. The nuclear dimension in the India-Pakistan relationship has caused widespread concern even outside the region. There has been a great deal of pressure on both New Delhi and Islamabad to engage each other on the nuclear question since 1998, when India and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear tests. The Lahore summit of 1999 included an agreement on a memorandum of understanding on nuclear issues. The MOU contained a comprehensive set of confidence-building measures, which, if implemented, would have led to the creation of a nuclear-risk-reduction regime in south Asia. Unfortunately, the Kargil war of 1999, and hardened positions on both sides thereafter, prevented any movement forward until the Islamabad meeting between Messrs Pervez Musharraf and Atal Bihari Vajpayee earlier this year. It was decided then to revive the composite dialogue, including dedicated talks on nuclear CBMs.																														The recent talks in New Delhi have, in essence, carried the Lahore process forward. A series of CBMs have been announced to promote stability in the region. These include better communication, notification and transparency measures. The two sides have agreed to upgrade the existing hotline between the two directors general of military operations and install a new dedicated hotline between the two foreign secretaries. New Delhi and Islamabad will also work towards concluding an agreement on pre-notification of the flight-testing of missiles. The broad understanding on this was arrived at in Lahore, but no technical agreement had been signed. Indeed, the Pakistan team, this time round, presented a draft, which will now be studied by Indian experts. The international community will be satisfied that India and Pakistan even reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining a unilateral moratorium on further nuclear tests. Finally, both the countries have agreed to hold consultations on nuclear-related issues in order to arrive at a convergence in their positions in multilateral fora. There is no doubt that much progress has been made in these talks, and the dialogue will help to create a climate where more difficult issues can be addressed. The success of the nuclear talks demonstrates that the India-Pakistan relationship is not necessarily a zero-sum one, and that win-win outcomes can be secured with a little persistence and imagination.

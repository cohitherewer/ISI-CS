The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 							 																						SHADOW PARTY																														Bankruptcy cannot be a ticket for a ride to the future. Nor can a denial of the past. The Congress, however, is attempting the impossible by presenting to the nation an election manifesto that is politically and ideologically vacuous and at the same time hangdog about its own achievements in the recent past. The Congress pioneered the economic reforms and presented to the country a blueprint for liberalization. If India shines today and if the barometer of economic growth hovers around the eight per cent mark, it is because the era of economic reforms was inaugurated in 1992 when a Congress government was at the helm of affairs. Today, the Congress is a reluctant reformer. It refuses to stand up and claim the full authorship of the economic reforms project. Two factors contribute to this amazing and appalling reluctance. One is the fear that a claim on economic reforms, however justified in history, will make the Congress appear anti-poor and bereft of its socialist moorings. The other is a petty inhibition to acknowledge that Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao was not as bad a prime minister as he is made out to be by leaders within the Congress. The emptiness of the manifesto also grows from here: the Congress wants to be all things to all people. In the process, the Congress has no identity of its own. Nobody is ever sure where the Congress stands on vital issues.																														The Congress, as its manifesto says, is pledged to change with continuity. What is not clear is the direction of the change and the nature of the continuity. At the most common-sense level, some changes, by their very nature, are incompatible with continuity: liberalization with socialism, tradition with modernity, dynasty with a republic and so on. Yet the Congress flaunts these polarities and has, in fact, made quite a fine art of it. The party no longer has any distinctive character and colour of its own. The responsibility for this can squarely be laid at the door of the party leadership. The charting of a definite direction for the Congress has not been one of the qualities that Ms Sonia Gandhi has brought to the party presidentship. She does not have her husbands vision, nor does she have her mother-in-laws charisma and ruthlessness. Yet the Gandhi family is her principal asset. The Congress wants to have power, but has no road-map for governance. It wants to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party, but has no alternative vision. It wants to inspire the people, but has no leader with that magical quality. Its past achievements are matched by its present bankruptcy. It is not half the party it used to be.

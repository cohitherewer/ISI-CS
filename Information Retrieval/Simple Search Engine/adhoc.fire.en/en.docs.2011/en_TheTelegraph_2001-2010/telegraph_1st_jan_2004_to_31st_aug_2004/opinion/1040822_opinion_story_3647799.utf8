The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 22, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																No better, no worse				 																																																				Sir  Wasnt the Congress complaining not too long ago that the Bharatiya Janata Party was spending too much on ad campaigns? Then what about the numerous ads of Rajiv Gandhi and his vision being splashed all over the media? India Shining has now given way to Incredible India  and according to one, rather defensive, Congress leader, the people should not object too much because it is being done for their benefit. Fair enough. As long as the party does not lament about projects lying unfinished owing to a lack of funds.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,  Rana Basu, Calcutta
				 																Reality check				 																																																				Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee is right in saying that the books Jawaharlal Nehru wrote represent his vision of an independent and modern India (A new tryst with destiny, August 15). 				 																																																				Also, Nehru and Manmohan Singh have a lot in common in terms of erudition, culture, vision and a liberal outlook, though their public lives may not be as similar. The former entered politics with the urge to free the country of foreign rule. In time, he became a mass leader. The latter, a quintessential technocrat, was inducted into politics much later in life to rescue the national economy. Singh is constrained by coalition politics and the lady behind the curtains. So while Nehru could make the state the engine of social and economic change, the present prime minister is handicapped by the lack of a personal mandate. This will greatly inhibit his attempts to keep the Indian economy on its current growth path and counter the pressures of not falling behind China.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Undoubtedly, Nehru was a great visionary; however his plans never bore the kind of fruits the country would have desired. But he was lucky to have the advice of great intellectuals in shaping his strategies. The lack of such advisers has compounded the problems of Manmohan Singh. What Singh has as policy-makers are men of dubious reputation, known more for flouting rules. Interestingly, the communists whom Nehru considered detrimental to the growth of the nation are today sharing power with the Congress. Nehru had once remarked, Frankness hurts often enough, but it is almost always desirable, especially between those who have to work together. The message for Singh is clear: he must not yield to the whims of the allies if he seriously wants to put the nation back on the track. Yours faithfully, 
 Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 				 																Paper chase				 																																																				Sir  The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Educations pledge to the Calcutta high court that it will introduce double evaluation of answer scripts is welcome (Double check on papers, Aug 15). Being an examiner, I would like to advise the council to keep a close watch on those market notes and suggestions which mysteriously match the questions in the examination paper. To give just one example, the council should tally the suggestions given by the tutorial, Touch and Pass, with the HS questions this year.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.A.R. Barkati, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The WBCHSs proposal to evaluate answer scripts twice and simplify the review procedure is not as easy as it sounds. Not too long ago, the council was reluctant to even review scripts for a fee. Besides, the council has to look into many other things that are wrong with the system. For example, the delay in the HS results this year which led to many students missing the deadlines for admissions in colleges in other states. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, S.S. Almal, Calcutta

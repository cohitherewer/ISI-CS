		 Friday, April 16, 2004 							 																						RITUAL VIOLENCE																														It is impossible to miss the grim symbolism of the tragedy that struck Guwahati on Wednesday. Coming in the midst of the Rongali Bihu celebrations on the first day of the Assamese New Year, it turned a time of joy into one of sorrow. That the victim of the grenade blast was a five-year-old child is even more potent in its dark symbolism. The two facts together point to the uncertainties that overshadow life in Assam. A season of joy slips into one of mourning without a notice. And the unlikeliest of victims, like innocent children, fall to an odd burst of senseless violence. The tragedy also exposes the insanity that underlies political militancy in Assam. Leaders of the United Liberation Front of Asom, which was suspected to have been behind the blast, must be worse than cynics to claim any kind of success in the death of the child. But that precisely is the point. An outfit which believes that its violent means justify its ends is unlikely to see either the brutality or the futility of its actions. But if the common people of Assam needed any further proof of the futility of the states many militancies, they had it in the tragedy in Guwahati. 																														This was, however, not the first time that the ULFA or some other militant organization engaged in such violence with an avowed objective to disrupt the elections. The aim clearly is to terrorize the people so that they do not take part in the democratic process. But the violence also denotes a desperation born of defeatism. The electoral system may have its flaws, but a violent militancy is no alternative to it. The more the people ignore the militants threats and join the political process, the more the militants are thwarted in their subversive attempts. The chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, was right in alerting candidates for the Lok Sabha elections against possible militant attacks on them during their campaigns. The killing of two candidates for the 1999 elections underscores the importance of the warning. But the state administration needs to identify areas which are more vulnerable to such attacks than others and take steps to counter the threats. The Election Commission too has to take the situation in Assam into account while allocating additional Central forces before the elections. But it remains primarily the task of political parties to win the peoples confidence  and not just their votes  in the battle against militancy. After all, the militants real design is to strike at the system and try and damage the peoples faith in it. There is much more at stake in Assam than just another election.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 YOU CANT SCOOP THE FUTURE
 Gouri Chatterjee																								Its that time of year again when every newspaper, every magazine, every television channel you turn to is awash with year-end remembrances and new-year predictions. Not because the year gone by is truly memorable (though some are arguing 2003 will make it into the history books as the year Indians abruptly altered the way they view themselves) or because the year ahead will necessarily be any more outstanding. Anyway, public memory is not really that short and even the greatest journalists cant scoop the future.																								Nor is it that news does not happen around this time or editors are too lazy to think of anything more creative to mark the passage of time. The end-of-the-year ritual stems wholly and solely from the conviction among editors that their readers and viewers, caught up in their rounds of parties and picnics and entertaining of NRI visitors, are just not in the mood to read anything more demanding or disturbing. In other words, they get the media that they deserve.																								Brought up to believe that editors always know best and given that this is the first day of the brand new 2004, here goes my short wish list for the next 364 days. 																								First, and Im keeping my fingers firmly crossed even as I write, that the second coming of Tehelka, slated for the 31st of this month, lives up to its great expectations. Even if it is postponed again (the original date was last October), it will surely appear sometime this year. But it wont be enough for it to be just a journalistic success (though even that is a tall order since it promises to deliver a Top Secret, as it has named its section featuring exposs and investigative stories, week in week out). It has to make money too. 																								Luminaries like Shah Rukh and Aamir Khan, Mira Nair and Pundit Ravi Shankar may not miss the one lakh of rupees each of them have already donated to make Tehelka independent of vested interests. But a commercial failure will provide editors of established papers with further vindication of their stand that investigative journalism is really pass.																								The second, and no less fervent, yearning is that mainstream media start acting its age and stops pandering to the youth. Okay, more than half the Indian population is now less than 25, and 15-25 is just the age-group advertisers are hankering for. But who doesnt know that news is not for kids, never was and never will be. Target the Skippies, Zippies, call them what you will and you will end up with a Times of India. News can help people make sense of the chaos around them, but not if it is dished out only for people who live life with add-on credit cards. 																								The most obvious media event of the year is of course the looming general elections. Wish it would be more about policies and performance and less about personalities and opinion polls. The last round of assembly elections showed issues do sell with voters. But are editors convinced they will with readers and viewers too? Unlikely. The signs are already there that elections will be made fun. It has begun with the contest being reduced to a clash of titans, Atal Bihari Vajpayee versus Sonia Gandhi. The ruling party could ask for nothing more. 																								It would be a great year if newspaper editors are again read and not seen. The desperation with which print editors tried to become TV personalities throughout last year was pathetic to watch. Worse, they failed. Not one has emerged as a TV star. Rather, TV wants them only as long as they have their day-jobs, which they may have jeopardized. Readership of newspapers and magazines is falling.																								Luckily for you, dear reader, the business of news will make sure all these wishes are belied. Still, heres wishing you a very happy new year.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																The city is about anonymityCorridor (Penguin, Rs 230) by Sarnath Banerjee is an impressive Indian experiment in bringing together text, image and collage to depict the many registers of modern urban life. The arcades of Connaught Place and the long vistas in Calcuttas metro stations are two of the corridors depicted in the title of this graphic novel. This is a novel teaming with real and fictional people. Keats, Woody Guthrie and Baudrillard, Watson amp; Crick and Roland Barthes. There are also Jehangir Rangoonwalla, Digital Dutta, Brighu and Shintu. This is a cleverly allusive work, with some fine sketches  particularly of Old and Lutyenss Delhi. The city is about anonymity. Some people meet, talk, part. Some dont, and live with the frustrating knowledge that invisible bonds tie them together.Towards an aesthetic of Dalit Literature (Orient Longman, Rs 175) by Sharan- kumar Limbale is Alok Mukherjees translation of this Dalit writer-activists Marathi monograph of 1996.

This edition is prefaced by a personal portrait of Castro by Gabriel Garca Mrquez: One night, while he was eating vanilla ice-cream in slow little spoonfuls, I saw him so overwhelmed by the weight of the destinies of so many people, so removed from himself, that for an instant he seemed different to me from the man he had always been. Then I asked him what he would most like to do in this world, and he answered immediately: Just hang around on some street corner.

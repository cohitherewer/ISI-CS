The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 							 																						CARRYING COAL																														Populist politics often borders on the parochial. In wishing to shift the headquarters of Coal India Limited from Calcutta to Ranchi, the new coal minister, Mr Sibu Soren, has followed a familiar pattern in Indian politics. The ministry of railways, in particular, has had a history of the ministers anxious to shower special benefits to their own states or even parliamentary constituencies. Railways ministers like Mr C.K. Jaffer Sharief and Mr A.B. Ghani Khan Choudhury in the Eighties and Ms Mamata Banerjee and Mr Ram Vilas Paswan in recent years used their portfolio more to nurture their own constituencies than to run it in accordance with the national interest. In so doing, they sacrificed economic and administrative logic at the altar of competitive populism. Mr Soren seems to have a bigger personal ambition at stake. Having worked out a successful electoral tie-up between his Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, he now has his eyes set on the next years assembly elections in Jharkhand. In his view of things, what he achieves as a coal minister will help him claim the chief ministers chair after the state polls. All this obviously has little to do with the coal ministrys real agenda, which Mr Soren ought to be taking up. He has to decide, for instance, how to modernize coal mining in India and make it a profitable enterprise. The big issue of privatization of the coal industry, unresolved in the previous regime, has to be addressed in earnest. But Mr Soren has to first understand the nature and importance of his office. 																														There is little doubt, though, that the uneven development of regions and states in India calls for a major restructuring of the governments priorities and resources. But the shifting of the headquarters of the CIL or the Damodar Valley Corporation to Ranchi is not the answer to Jharkhands economic backwardness. As a minister of the Union government, Mr Soren would do much better if he can contribute to a holistic plan for his states overall economic development. Apart from the fact that the lefts importance in the new scheme of things in New Delhi may actually make it difficult for Mr Soren to shift the headquarters of these units from Calcutta, a parochial approach cannot be the basis of sound public policy. 																														While Mr Soren may not succeed in his venture, he may stir up avoidable political controversies and worse, unholy rivalries between the neighbouring states of Jharkhand and West Bengal. But, more important, Mr Sorens attempt raises serious issues of the relation between popular politics and public policy-making. Obviously, a Union minister cannot use his portfolio in the manner a member of parliament uses the funds made available to him for the so-called local area development. Unlike the ordinary MP, who may have some justification for catering to the constituencys needs, a minister has to plan his priorities in the national interest. It would be disastrous for a crucial ministry if Mr Soren uses it to promote his personal agenda.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																As they like it				 																																																				 Sir  How the left can be so supremely oblivious to even a hint of hypocrisy in its behaviour is a mystery (Scent of flowers in business talks with Israel, June 13). The left leaders had raised Cain when the previous National Democratic Alliance government started to improve relations with the Israeli government. Our sympathies should be with the Palestinians, they said. So why is the left dispensation in West Bengal welcoming the Israeli ambassador, David Danieli, now? Why should the interests of the Palestinians be less important than the modern irrigation technology which the Israelis have promised to give the state? The left was not prepared to soften its stand on Israel even after military hardware despatched at a moments notice from that country helped us win the Kargil war. The left seems to have one stand for the state, a different one when it comes to the nation. This two-facedness informs its economic policy as well. Now that it has emerged as a player in national politics, can one hope that the left will try to be more consistent?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, G. Basu, Calcutta
				 																Little hope				 																																																				Sir  The report, 3-year boy goes for blood, gets HIV (June 7), shows the carelessness of the doctors attending the child. What is more infuriating is that the medical staff and the doctors at the hospital did not disclose the fact of the childs infection to its parents for about a year. 				 																																																				For quite some time now, it has been mandatory to test donated blood for HIV. This is done either by the detection of virus-specific antigen or antibody through the Elisa test or with a more sensitive method of polymerase chain reaction that directly checks the specific genetic structure of HIV in the contaminated blood. But neither test is infallible. The former method can produce misleading negative results, and this is also true of the more expensive PCR test. 				 																																																				It could very well be that the child had been given the contaminated blood because of such a test failure. But rather than looking into whether this was the case, the principal of the NRS Medical College and Hospital, Purnima Saumandal, tried to shift the blame on the victims parents by questioning whether they had got the blood from her hospital. This is how members of the medical community in India (especially West Bengal) have often tried to shield their errant colleagues at the expense of defenceless patients. And under pressure from the medical lobby, the government has also chosen to overlook these mistakes. The director of medical education, C.R. Maity, might have been unable to fathom why the parents of the victim had been kept in the dark for such a long time, but what steps has he taken to correct the situation once he came to know of the incident? 				 																																																				The medical set-up in West Bengal is rotten to its core. More fortunate patients from Bengal may have the option of seeking treatment elsewhere, but the poor have no such luck. Instead of protecting these patients from the harassment of negligent doctors, the medical council prefers to rescue the latter when they make unforgivable and irreversible blunders. Unfortunately, without a radical transformation of the medical system, this incident wont be the last one that ought to have been averted. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Ohio, US

				 																																																				Sir  Taking a break from running after foreign investors, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should pay urgent attention to the state of his health ministry, especially as there have been so many medical scandals in the recent past. Why should children be made to suffer because of the callousness of state-run medical colleges? Where blood transfusion was meant to give new life to a child, it has managed to infect him with the HIV virus. Systemic irresponsibility, fostering a decadent work culture, has led West Bengal nowhere.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The peoples government of West Bengal is ridden with contradictions that would leave even Karl Marx in a state of confusion. Only in a state full of self-proclaimed champions of the poor can doctors get away with infecting children with the HIV virus. The Marxists have taken refuge in promising a detailed inquiry. If this incident had taken place in the evil world of the capitalists, the victim and his family would have received compensation for the hospitals negligence. However, in West Bengal, irresponsible doctors are usually let off by the government if they display the right allegiances. It is doubtful whether such an incident would have been condoned by the Keralites, who have democratically elected a communist government. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Devasiachan Paul, Keezhppally, Kerala

				 																																																				Sir  Why have the doctors and medical staff of the NRS Medical College and Hospital not been punished yet? The reason being given as to why the thalassaemic child received HIV-positive blood is either a laboratory oversight or a faulty blood-testing kit. Can the medical staff not be expected to take basic precautionary measures before going ahead with the transfusion? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vivek Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The unfortunate news of the blood transfusion gone wrong may have made it to the front page, but as in the past, this will soon be a forgotten story. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Purnima Vasudeva, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In keeping up with the good work that The Telegraph has done by exposing the unabashed blunder of the medical fraternity in the state, it should ensure that the issue is kept alive in the minds of people until the government promises that this will never happen again, and agrees to compensate the victims family.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Diya Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is frightening to see how the West Bengal government consistently exploits the poverty and helplessness of a segment of its people and denies them medical assistance when they need it most.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

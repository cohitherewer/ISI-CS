The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 07, 2004 							 																						SHOPPERS CITY																														Every now and then, Calcuttans are given intimations of what the chief minister understands by urban development, particularly in relation to their city. Two such revelations have been made recently. While inaugurating a new mixed use project, City Centre at Salt Lake, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has talked about realism and the urban poor. And at a World Environment Day event organized by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, Mr Bhattacharjee talked about reducing air pollution, protecting water bodies and trees, and improving solid waste management. The two instances together ought to reassure Calcuttans that their city is growing towards the perfect balance between ecology, entertainment and a retail boom, which, in turn, is being realized through a new bond between the public and the private sectors. (The Salt Lake complex is jointly promoted by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and Gujarat Ambuja Cements Limited.) That the most visible evidence of development in the city is invariably cited in terms of a retail boom is, in itself, a clue to the lack of vision that characterizes the states ideas regarding how Calcutta might grow. If more people are shopping, eating out and watching films, then helping them to do these things in built-up bits of the city must be urban development  with some rhetoric thrown in about Calcuttas 17 lakh slum-dwellers.																														The government still needs to work out, from the most rudimentary level imaginable, what must be done to make this city minimally liveable for its citizens. This is the level of the most basic human necessities  breathable air and drinkable water. The slightly less basic needs might follow: roads, footpaths, drains, transport, safety. Then, there is the question of flyovers: who builds them, for how long, at what cost, in how many attempts, and to what eventual effect. Grasping the inscrutable inner workings of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners is therefore becoming essential to puzzling out the meaning of development in Calcutta. The air and water stories are, of course, clearer. Air pollution levels continue to be worse than deadly in the city. And any legislative and regulatory solutions to the problem remain confined to the chief ministers public oratory. Auto emission control has been relegated to the realm of the utopian. Architectural extravaganzas are therefore the only hope for hapless Calcuttans. Those are the only channels in which something like a civic consciousness remains active. If one cannot breathe, one might as well shop.

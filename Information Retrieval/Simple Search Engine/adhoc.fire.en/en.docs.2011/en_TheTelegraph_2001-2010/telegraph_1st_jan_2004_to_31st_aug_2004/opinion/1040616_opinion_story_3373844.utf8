		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 							 																						EUROPA VEXED																														In an era of globalization, even wars, like stock markets, have global dimensions and impact. The aftermath of a war spills over into civil affairs. When the war against Iraq was launched under the leadership of the United States of America, Mr Tony Blair, the prime minister of Britain, least expected that the defeat of his party in local elections would be one fallout of a war against tyranny in faraway Iraq. Similarly, no one quite calculated the impact of the Iraq war on the elections to the parliament of the European Union. Yet, as the results keep coming in, it is clear that European voters have rejected those who were directly involved in the Iraq war. Britain and the Netherlands were punished by the voters. But there are other issues that galvanized the voters. The German chancellor, Mr Gerhard Schroeder, and the French president, Mr Jacques Chirac, also took a beating at the hustings. Economic stagnation, unemployment and social reforms made the German and French leaders unpopular. It would appear from the election tallies that European voters have taken a leaf out of the books of their Indian counterparts. European governments have been hit by what Indian psephologists have come to call the anti-incumbency factor. Mr Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, summed it up well when he said that across Europe, sitting governments received significant protest votes against them.																														There is more at stake in the EU elections than the punishment vote. The EU parliament will have to ratify the new charter. One interpretation of the results is that the electorate wants a more efficient EU, which is the real purpose of the draft constitutional treaty. But a contrary interpretation sees in the votes, gains for the Eurosceptics especially in Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden. This might make the ratification of the new charter really difficult. The passing of the treaty is bound to be bumpy since Poland, the biggest of the new entrants, is resisting a change in the EU voting system which would reduce its power. Britain too is trying to preserve national vetoes in core areas. But more than anything else, what should worry the champions of the EU is the low turnout. Only 45 per cent of the eligible voters came out to cast their ballots. This is the lowest voter turnout since 1979, when direct elections to the EU began. The new entrants, mostly from east Europe and ex-communist, registered a 26 per cent turnout. The old EU has voter fatigue and in the new EU, voting is yet to become an embedded political praxis. Europe is yet to become a viable province of the globe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 							 																						WHO DOES THE POLLS BEST? Gouri Chatterjee																					Tuesday night, shortly after the exit-poll results had droned to a halt on the various television channels, four colleagues from a city newspaper were sitting in the coffee shop of a five-star hotel and doing what they do best: passing the buck. 																					Well, youre the one who said no one is interested in these elections, theyre so predictable. So good writing, thats what you had said election coverage should be all about.																					Thats what everyone said  till the exit polls. NDA would win easily, Congress would get less than 100...																					Bullshit. This is the most uncertain election ever. Anything can happen.																					Its amazing how all the papers, the English newspapers at least, had swallowed the governments feel good line wholesale.																					Thats because they thought that was what their readers line was too.																					Does that mean we publish travelogues in the name of election reporting? How can one go to Andhra Pradesh and not see the anti-Chandrababu Naidu wave?																					Everybody makes mistakes. I remember going to UP for the 1984 elections and getting completely bogged down in caste-class calculations. So many per cent Jatavs, so many per cent Kurmis, and what not. I still remember the headline to my copy: No sympathy factor, caste still king. This after spending three weeks in UP! Of course, that was my first election and I havent gone wrong since. Its better not to take too micro a view.																					That only proves my point. That you need to send people with political understanding.																					Even they go wrong. The person who went to Andhra is a seasoned reporter...																					Round and round they went. In this city and elsewhere. Or so one hopes. If the exit polls are right (and thats a big if), the next general election could be a lot sooner than the summer of 2009. All this soul-searching will surely make them keep their readers better informed about the countrys political situation then. No one can be amused at the sudden plunge in their share prices that the exit polls wrought. 																					Profit over spunk																					It is customary to gush during centenary programmes. But Union minister Arun Jaitley may have really meant it when he said, Ramnath Goenka could verily be called the single largest contributor to the existence of a free press in India, at Goenkas centenary function last Thursday. 																					The founder of the Indian Express newspaper, who took on such powerful personalities as Indira Gandhi and Dhirubhai Ambani, still evokes strong reactions. To most he epitomizes a courageous press, while some revile him for using his newspaper to pursue purely personal agendas. 																					Itll take a book to get the correct picture, but one thing is certain. You cant have another Goenka today. Power is no longer the prime motivator of todays media barons, only profit is. And profit creates its own moderating influences. At one stage, there were 300 cases filed by the government against the Express and credit supply from banks was cut off. Thats not how profits are made.																					Even Shekhar Gupta, the papers editor-in-chief, would not like to go back to those good old days. The paper has moved away from, I would not say irresponsible journalism, but hasty journalism, he has told a media website. The paper had a lot more spunk then, but it has a lot more credibility now.																					Preity plays Barkha																					Kabeer Khan, whose earlier film was on the INA, is producing one on Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was killed by terrorists in Pakistan in February 2002. A feature film is being made on Shivani Bhatnagar, the Delhi journalist who was murdered four years ago, while Preity Zinta is acting in a film as a war journalist in which she looks just like Barkha Dutt  short hair, loose clothes, etc. The war in the film is the Kargil War. Its nice to know real-life journalists can be celluloid heroes too. Of course, violence or impending death helps  both Bhatnagar and Pearl died a gory death and even women war correspondents risk their lives.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 							 																						CAR PARKS AND LEOPARDSA metropolis which can offer a wild leopard the choice between Aishwarya Rai and an MTech is a very bizarre animal indeedAre Indian cities becoming bourgeois at last? An eminent Indian social scientist has asked this question in a recent essay on Calcutta. At last implies relief and hope. But make it alas, and the question becomes a troubled exclamation, full of a critical, concerned and even despairing nostalgia. Between that at last and alas lies a whole range of responses to the way old Indian cities like Bombay and Calcutta are becoming Mumbai and Kolkata. This is the story of their entry into both a postcolonial and a globalized modernity. The transition is bringing about new kinds of citizenship, new modes of governance. A new aesthetic of the city is beginning to emerge, but together with all this, newer forms of dislocation, disparity and contradiction. 																														Juhu beach is going to be cleaned up for the proper Mumbaikars. Bombay high court has ordered the relocation of the pav bhaji and kala khatta stalls on the Juhu Chowpatty. Residents Hema Malini and Shabana Azmi have given crores from their MPs funds for the cleaning up of the beach. An architect has been engaged, and a local NGO, committed to conserving the environment and preserving heritage, is also helping to transform the beach. The foodstalls will become a food court, and all the fair-ground chaos, together with slums and other encroachments, will be replaced by parks, neat rows of palms and a huge car park. The India of picturesque anarchy is giving way here to a new order of civic awareness and cooperation. Judicial activism, governmental funds, non-governmental initiative and residents movements are reclaiming the public places of the city by ridding them of encroachers and polluters. Citizenship is becoming law-abiding and eco-friendly. And in the process, the city will look, sound and feel different  tidier, cleaner, safer.																														Is there any room then for that alas within this experience of urban development? A sanitized Juhu beach, a hawker-free Rashbehari Avenue, or a Varanasi ghat without the hideously polluting bathers, dhobis, corpses and buffaloes: these are all perfectly necessary and desirable achievements for the health of modern cities, pedestrians and rivers, respectively. But what, if anything, is lost in translation? And is it at all possible to lament this loss without sounding either populist or silly? There are, of course, other and more serious flip sides to development  the ill effects of indiscriminate construction on a citys groundwater resources, for instance  compared to which such wistful farewells to anarchy will sound effete, even irresponsible.																														But the ironies of modernity have taken on an almost primeval form in another part of Mumbai. Another story of encroachment and reclamation is being played out in the city, away from the sea and in the margins of the forest into which the city has grown. Leopards are carrying away, in alarming numbers, the people who have encroached on their natural habitat. Pigs, rabbits and dogs are now being used to distract them from human flesh. On either side of where the cats live are Film City and the IIT, bastions of modern Mumbai. A metropolis which can offer a wild leopard the choice between Aishwarya Rai and an MTech is a very bizarre animal indeed.

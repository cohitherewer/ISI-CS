		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 							 																						SINISTER ANARCHISTS																														Anarchists of one country are a problem for its neighbours as well. Nepals Maoists have proved once again that they are also Indias concern. But their attacks on Indian vehicles in Nepal, in retaliation for the arrest of one of their leaders in West Bengal, have a sinister design that might not be apparent immediately. On the face of it, the violence is a warning to Indian authorities not to help the Himalayan kingdom in its battle against the Maoists. The Nepalese rebels would, of course, be nave to expect this crude tactic to work. Apart from compulsions in its bilateral ties with Nepal, New Delhi has good reasons to be extremely vigilant against the Maoists. It is no secret that Nepals Maoists are aided and sheltered by their Indian counterparts. Their absurd rehearsal for a world revolution may be a laughing matter, but no government worth its salt can afford to ignore these groups potential for violence and disruptive activities. There is thus a strong case for more  and not less  Indian action against the Maoist threat from Nepal. It is as much a matter of Indias own security in a geo-politically sensitive area as it is an important issue for bilateral and regional co-operation. 																														It is equally important, however, to guard against another danger. The Maoists may well have planned the attacks on Indian vehicles to incite anti-India sentiments among the common people of Nepal. Given the history of such attempts by various vested interests in Nepal, this is no unfounded fear. The so-called Indian factor has always come in handy for Nepalese politicians anxious to foment trouble for partisan gains. For all their ideological rhetoric, the Maoists could stoop to bouts of India-bashing for tactical reasons. It would be a cynical ploy because any disruption of vehicular traffic, and thereby of commerce between the two countries, could cripple the Nepalese economy. The common people of Nepal could suffer untold hardships in such an eventuality. The Maoists want to exploit such a situation to incite public anger against India. It is crucial for both New Delhi and Kathmandu to see through this evil design and foil it. Unfortunately, there is a political vacuum in Nepal, which the Maoists are also trying to exploit. The two main political parties  the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist)  refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the government of Mr Surya Bahadur Thapa, who was appointed prime minister by King Gyanendra. It should be New Delhis policy to help Kathmandu restore the political process in that country. Joining hands to fight the Maoists could help that cause too.

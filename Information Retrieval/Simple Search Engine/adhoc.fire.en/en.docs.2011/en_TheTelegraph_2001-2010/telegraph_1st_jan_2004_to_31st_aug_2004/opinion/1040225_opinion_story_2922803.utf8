The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A mans world				 																																																				Sir  C. Venkitaramanas curriculum vitae should henceforth include the following: scant respect for women, and faith in the casting-couch philosophy (Sex abuse charge against public sector boss, Feb 14). Despite established personal codes of conduct, corporate India is plagued by gender-inequality, stemming from the mens boardroom syndrome. Women are deemed fit only for back-end operations, with very few getting to leadership positions, unless they have the right connections or better still, good looks. When women perform well, they are given offers to relax with bosses, rather than promotions. Meritocracy, ethics and personal integrity mean very little in this world of power, greed and lust. The disbelief with which the corporate fraternity greeted Venkitaramanas news does not raise hopes of breaking this vicious cycle. Vigilance committees and gender senisitization courses could still be instituted as desperate measures to set things right.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Anik Barua, Calcutta
				 																Cub politics				 																																																				Sir  The induction of Varun Gandhi into the Bharatiya Janata Party is entirely in keeping with the Indian tradition of political rivalry within a single family (BJP or Cong, dynasty cant lose, Feb 17). Take the family of the former prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri, for instance. Interestingly, the members of this family got along well with one another in spite of their political differences. Another example is the Scindia family, although the rival camps within this family were not exactly pleasantly disposed towards each other. Varun Gandhi has exhibited remarkable maturity by showing respect and affection for his cousins, Priyanka and Rahul, and his aunt, Sonia Gandhi. The Congress president has, in her turn, wished her nephew well in his political career. Who knows, maybe the direct political rivalry can make the Nehru-Gandhi clan more united than it has been so far.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The first dynasty of India has been out of political office for some time now. India has finally had a taste of a more progressive non-dynasty rule. Perhaps Maneka Gandhi and her son have realized that the dynasty has no future in Indian politics. The Congress harps on the past and can find no faults with the Bharatiya Janata Party other than its communal character (Congress stoops to conquer, Feb 16). The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has become an ally of the Congress in all states except West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura (Basu asks allies to back secular Cong, Feb 3). Both the parties have claimed to be friends of Muslims. But Muslims are surely not the only minority community in India? Who then will look after the interest of the rest?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Kumar Pal, London

				 																																																				Sir  The National Democratic Alliance in general and the BJP in particular have been targeting Sonia Gandhi, for her foreign roots. Varun Gandhi, the new recruit of the BJP, toed the same line when he declared foreign origin to be an issue but not the main issue (BJP or Cong, dynasty cant lose). Nationality by birth is a matter of chance or accident. Ones adopted nationality is truer in the sense that it is determined by the individuals choice. No matter what her administrative acumen is, Sonia Gandhi is an Indian by choice. How many Sonia-baiters can honestly say that they would have accepted the nationality of a poverty-ridden India, given the option of becoming a citizen of a first-world country? Maneka Gandhi, on the other hand, would have risked political fade-out if she did not join the BJP. Her decision shows the true face of poll-eve politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If Sonia Gandhi ropes in her son and daughter for electoral politics, can the other Nehru-Gandhi daughter-in-law be far behind? Hence the entry of Maneka and Varun Gandhi into the BJP. This has put both parties on a somewhat equal footing. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																Unreliable service				 																																																				Sir  Reliance India Mobile has widely advertised that its bill can be paid by credit card at its outlets. Accordingly, I registered myself for the facility and was allocated a personal identification number by the company. I used it to make a payment for an outstanding bill, and the payment was confirmed. All of a sudden, I was debarred from making outgoing calls owing to non-payment of bills. When I informed Reliances customer care services that the payment had been made, they checked their data and said they had indeed received the payment. When I asked them to restore the connection, I was asked to visit a Reliance WebWorld and make an interim payment for reactivating my connection. Why I have to take the trouble of visiting the WebWorld and make a payment has not been explained by Reliance. On asking other Reliance customers, I found out that many of them had similar experiences. It is quite obvious that Reliance is used to taking its customers for a ride.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Banerjee, via email

				 																																																				Sir  I was shocked to receive a bill of Rs 880 from Reliance India Mobile. I have never applied for a Reliance connection in the first place. Reliance should cancel the bill immediately and trace the culprit who used my name and address and carried out this gigantic fraud.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pradeep Dalmia, Delhi

		 Friday, July 02, 2004 							 																						LOSS OF FAITH																														A peace move is, above all, an act of faith. The Assamese rebels have sabotaged once again a possible peace initiative by acting in bad faith. The United Liberation Front of Asom not only failed to respond to the Centres latest offer of talks, it also broke the states fragile peace by launching another spell of mindless violence. The ULFA must take the blame for New Delhis decision not to start a dialogue with the group immediately. If the chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, has also hardened his position on the group, it clearly reflects his loss of confidence in the groups bona fide for any meaningful dialogue. The ULFAs recent attacks on innocent civilians are particularly frustrating as they have come at a time of a new hope. The Union minister of state for defence, Mr Bijoy Krishna Handique, articulated that hope when he suggested that the Centre had no objection to holding the talks with the ULFA in a third country. This was viewed as a major step forward for New Delhi to meet an old demand of the rebels. All that the Union and the state governments wanted was a clear indication of the ULFAs sincerity about peace. Some statements by the ULFAs chairman, Mr Arabinda Rajkhowa, kept the hope alive until the fresh rounds of violence smothered it once again.																														It may now be necessary to call the ULFAs bluff in a more emphatic manner. The Royal Bhutanese Armys operations against the group inside that country had put it in disarray for quite some time. Its new-found belligerence could well be an attempt to boost the flagging morale of its cadre. It could also be aimed at blackmailing the peace initiative. The government must send out a clear signal that it would not submit to any such ploy. It is important, therefore, to consolidate the gains from the anti-ULFA operations in and outside Assam. There is thus an even greater need for the army and the Assam police to coordinate their strategies more effectively. The new regime at the Centre should have no problem following its predecessors policy with regard to a ceasefire in Assam. Only if the ULFA takes concrete steps for negotiations, a ceasefire may be considered. That does not necessarily preclude preparations for peace talks. The experience in Nagaland suggests that a ceasefire may not be a major problem if the right conditions for talks are created. Mr Gogoi, on his part, can use the latest violence to try and create a political consensus against the rebels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 							 																						WHATS IN A SARI?																														It must be irritating for women to have to fight over what they may wear to work. But a great many women teaching in schools and colleges in Calcutta and its suburbs have been wasting their time and energy engaged in precisely such a banal struggle. A high-school teacher had started going to work in salwar-kameez with permission from her school. But after about a year, she was told that she would not be marked present in the attendance register if she did not come in a sari. She had appealed to the womens commission and other authorities, mentioning that she has to travel more than a hundred kilometres to work, and it would be difficult, to say the least, to do this in a sari. But the school refused to let her sign the register if she was not properly dressed, and even fined her two months wages. But the state womens commission has now intervened to declare that there was nothing wrong in coming to teach in a salwar-kameez. The commission has also asserted that what women wear to work is entirely a matter of their own choice, based on convenience, comfort and discretion. The school or college authorities have no right to dictate a dress-code for their teachers. This has been communicated to the government schools and colleges with the endorsement of the relevant minister. But the authorities in Chakdaha College  which happens to be in the higher education ministers assembly constituency  are still invoking an old tradition to insist on the sari-code for its teachers.																														Control over how women present themselves in public is a way of keeping them in their place  in this case, quite literally by keeping their bodies inconveniently entangled in yards of cloth. It is, of course, no coincidence, that this control is largely supervised by men. Among such men are not only school and college administrators, but also armed militants. Women in Kashmir and Manipur have been kept properly dressed at gunpoint. The logic most often has to do with modesty. Schoolteachers must not titillate their students and colleagues. (It is assumed here that the sari cannot be worn provocatively.) There is also more than a whiff of regionalist chauvinism here. Women often have to defend the salwar-kameez in Bengal against charges of objectionable outlandishness, as a legitimate form of national dress. Teachers who come in pants or Western dress might have to contend with worse. But men holding high positions in schools and colleges should sort out, in their own heads, their feelings about and attitudes to womens bodies in different kinds of clothing. Women should not have to expend time over such senseless trivialities.

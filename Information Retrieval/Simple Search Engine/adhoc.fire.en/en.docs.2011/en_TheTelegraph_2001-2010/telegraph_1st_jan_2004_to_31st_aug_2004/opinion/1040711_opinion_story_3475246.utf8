The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, July 11, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																That sinking feeling				 																																																				Sir  When the Telgi case broke, one presumed that heads would roll. They did, but mostly of small fry. Ministers continue to be shielded while lesser mortals like assistant police commissioners get the boot. The same will happen in the Ketan Tirodkar case (Cop whistle-blower in jail, July 10). Which is why the prediction that he would take down a few more people with him sounds so false. It is precisely because these people will never go down that both Abdul Karim Telgi and Tirodkar will never be allowed to sink. They might go underground, but underwater, never.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, M. Chowdhury, Calcutta
				 																Difference in degree				 																																																				Sir  As a Cambridge graduate, I cannot but express my surprise at Amit Roys misleading depiction of the MA degree at the Cambridge University (Economics in Royal company, July 6) . At Cambridge, the old system of conferring the MA degree was abandoned in the mid-1840s to protect its importance, dignity and value. Today, like the universities of Oxford and Dublin, Cambridge confers MA (an honorary degree) as a matter of right on those who hold a BA degree from the university and some senior members of the university who may not hold a Cambridge BA degree. 				 																																																				As for Cambridge undergraduates, they proceed to the MA not less than six years from the end of their first term of residence. But the degree does not come magically as Roy indicates. A formal application has to be made, a fee paid, and the overall eligibility must be upheld and certified by the relevant Cambridge college of which the undergraduate was a member. In brief, a Cambridge MA degree is obtained through invitation and not examination. It is also the case that once a member of a Cambridge college (as an undergraduate or a postgraduate), the student remains a member of the college, and ipso facto, the university for life. All Cambridge MA degree holders, as per the universitys statute, become members of the universitys top decision-making body (the senate), use the university library and participate in various university activities. The fact that Cambridge undergraduates may receive the MA degree without any examination does not make the Cambridge BA or MA less significant. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Smoke alarm				 																																																				Sir  What struck me on a recent visit to both Chennai and Bangalore was that apart from smooth roads, fast traffic and abundant trees, I also discovered a comparatively better civic sense among the people. Smoking in public places in actually banned in the two cities. If the rule can be implemented so effectively in other metros, why cannot Calcutta respect the smoking ban? How long will the civic authorities sit back and blame the non-availability of enough workforce to discourage public smoking? People should be made more aware of the ban to reduce the sale of tobacco (in any form, mainly cigarettes) by half. This will need a workforce. Willing youths may be asked to volunteer. The group should always work towards improving civic sense with regard to spitting, urinating and throwing junk on the roads. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avishek Nandi, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The recent ban on smoking in the Parliament House is a welcome move (Smoke ban, July 5). This is just the example people had been waiting for. Smokers like Vijay Mallya, P.A. Sangma and Nilotpal Basu should put health concerns before their personal choices. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Somnath Chatterjees call to ban smoking inside parliament should be read as the first concrete step in implementing the ban in public places. So far, the ban has been singularly ineffective. People still light their cigarettes in buses and trains without sparing a thought for their co-passengers. The statutory warning on cigarette packs has also never been known to discourage smokers. Chatterjees call may be seen as the first hint that the government is serious about the ban.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, T.R. Anand, Calcutta

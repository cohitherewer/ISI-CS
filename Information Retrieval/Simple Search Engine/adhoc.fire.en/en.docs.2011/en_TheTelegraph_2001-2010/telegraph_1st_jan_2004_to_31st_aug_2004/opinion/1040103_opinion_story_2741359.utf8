The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 03, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Forced spending				 																																																				Sir  Ordinary matches are made in heaven, and celebrity marriages in newspaper offices. David Beckhams Christmas gift to his wife may appear to stink, but there is a reason behind it (Becks 3m Posh salvage package, Dec 29). The invasion of privacy by a ruthless paparazzi has completely corrupted family lives for celebrities, so much so that expensive gifts rather than displays of affection have become the survival kit for celebrity alliances. Perhaps a little more restraint from the media could help the Beckhams spend their time more normally and spend less.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Indranil Ghosh, Calcutta 
				 																Remembering a hero				 																																																				Sir  West Bengal may be taking rapid strides in various fields but the death of Bapi Sen will remain a blot on its collective memory forever (Homage to a hero in uniform, Dec 27). The government should have found more concrete ways to pay homage to a true hero than merely offering employment to his wife. Ugly politics within the police must have ensured that the honest serviceman went unnoticed. The crisis his family now finds itself in points to the fact that the government has done little for it. Anger against the guilty constables has turned into indifference and the hope of getting justice has waned under the weight of the cumbersome judicial proceedings. I think Sens case should be decided by a special jury for the man deserves more respect than what he is getting now. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It will be sometime before Calcutta forgets the winter night when an off-duty policeman gave his life to protect the modesty of a woman from being outraged by his drunken colleagues. The Telegraph, especially, needs to be thanked for keeping his memory alive. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anis Khan, Uttarpara

				 																																																				Sir  Bapi Sens family is struggling hard to accept the loss of a son, a husband and a father. The state government should not make it any difficult by keeping them in want, whether of finances or of moral support. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amarnath Das, Konnagar

				 																																																				Sir  A mother of a two-year-old, single-parenting two young children, should have been given employment which gives her enough pay and flexibility to discharge her responsibility towards her family. But the state government not only failed to see the sentiment behind the refusal of Bapi Sens widow to work for a department which killed her husband, but also, and quite sadistically, reneged on its promised and denied her the opportunity to opt for an alternative government employment. This is not a very heartening message for either the young Sens or the future generation of Calcuttas citizens.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Sikdar, Calcutta

				 																Security measures				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Mild disturbance (Dec 25), urges strict and consistent application of the legislation against sexual offences. But an analysis of the actual cases of enforcement reveals that thousands have been summarily imprisoned based on complaints. Later investigation in most cases revealed that many were innocent. So effective legislation and faithful application often results in the horror of uncalled for imprisonment, harassment and social disgrace for thousands of people who are often not guilty. 				 																																																				Second, at the conference of the All India Democratic Womens Association, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had suggested that more women should come out to work and share the economic burden of their families. This is the crux of the matter. Despite economic opportunities, many educated women view marriage as a meal-ticket for life, with other perks. The demand for non- resident Indians, MBAs, chartered accountants and other professionals is precisely for this life-time security. Which is probably why dowries are demanded in exchange. 				 																																																				Another thing. Feminists need not worry about Bengals handling of sexual offences. They can rest assured that the communists will stamp out all individual freedom, turning George Orwells 1984 into reality. Yours faithfully, 
 Sandeep Mukherjee, Calcutta

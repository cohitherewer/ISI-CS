		 Sunday, March 21, 2004 							 																						TEXTS, LIES AND POLITICSTrying to ban the Discovery of India is an outcome of the art of falsification which all totalitarian regimes practise
Falsification is an art which totalitarian regimes practise shamelessly. Josef Stalin completely obliterated Leon Trotsky from the history of the Bolshevik Revolution. Adolf Hitler, to legitimize the Final Solution, perpetuated a string of lies about the Jews. Those who see the Bharatiya Janata Party as the harbinger of fascism in India will not be surprised by the demand of Mr Gopinath Munde, the president of the BJP in Maharashtra. Mr Munde announced that Discovery of India should be banned because in it, Jawaharlal Nehru, according to Mr Munde, called Shivaji a bandit. While the demand to ban a book smacks of authoritarianism, this particular claim of Mr Munde is ridiculous in content and mischievous in intent. The simple fact is that Nehru wrote no such thing. He described Shivaji as an outstanding guerrilla leader who was a thorn in the side of the Mughal administration in the Deccan. In fact, Nehru noted the contribution of Shivaji towards the consolidation of Hindu nationalism. Mr Munde has obviously never opened Discovery of India to read what Nehru had actually written. If he has checked out the book and then made the demand, he is guilty of deliberate falsehood. Mr Munde is either an ignoramus or a deliberate and unscrupulous fabricator. 																														There is no need to be kind to Mr Munde. He has done the damage he had intended. The Shiv Sena and other Maratha jingoists will not stop to establish the veracity of Mr Mundes statement. They will go on a rampage, which is all they are good at. Mr Munde wanted to whip up anger against the Congress. The result can only be violent. His statement should also be seen in the context of similar lies uttered by the BJP and sections of the sangh parivar. Ideologues of Hindutva have a long tradition of distorting history and of taking quotations out of context. Muslims and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi have both been victims of such distortions. Nehru is a new name on the list. Other figures on the sangh parivar hate-list  the historian, Romila Thapar, is a well-known example  frequently have their writings distorted. The BJP and the ideological family to which it belongs obviously believe that to lie and to distort in order to calumniate an enemy are not matters of serious consequence. This only highlights the moral vacuum in which they operate: a vacuum that enables the spread of lies, the incitement to violence and murder as so many steps to the goal of a Hindu rashtra. 																														Quite distinct from the peddling of untruth, there is a more profound issue involved here. Nehru in his book had expressed his opinions on various individuals and subjects. All his opinions need not be shared by everybody, and indeed they should not be. But this is not sufficient ground for calling for a ban on Nehrus book. Such a demand is frequently voiced in India. In West Bengal, supporters of Subhas Chandra Bose burnt copies of the Ananda Bazar Patrika because the newspaper had published extracts from Boses letters to his wife. The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute was vandalized because it had been thanked by a scholar in his critical study of Shivaji. And now comes Mr Mundes ridiculous demand. It is Indias immaturity and misfortune that are manifest in this kind of extreme touchiness about icons.

		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 							 																						GO WITH THE TRADE WIND Difficulties in ensuring suitable compensation and a redistribution mechanism discourage policy-makers from advocating free trade, writes Alok Ray Learning to driveThe principle of comparative advantage is one of the most basic principles in economics, and yet one of the most misunderstood. The case for free trade basically rests on this principle. Though many economists support free trade, practical policymakers are often opposed to it. Does this mean that there is something seriously wrong with the economists case for free trade?																														The principle says that if countries specialize and trade according to comparative (or relative) advantage, then all trading partners will gain. This is true even if a country, say, the United States of America, is more efficient in the production of all goods relative to another country, say, India. In such a case, the US should specialize in the production of those goods in which it is relatively more efficient and India should specialize in those areas where its comparative disadvantage is less. So, except for the highly unlikely case where the difference in efficiency levels between the US and India is exactly the same in all industries, there would be a difference in comparative advantage and hence a scope for mutually profitable trade between nation.																														Like all theories, it is based on assumptions. The most important are full employment and costless mobility of resources between sectors. So, if the Indian capital goods industry is less efficient and its textile industry more efficient relative to the US, then resources in India should move out of the capital goods industry towards textile production. In the process, jobs will be lost in the former sector and more jobs would be created in the textiles sector. But this may take some time. It is possible that there will be immediate job losses in the first industry as it cannot compete with cheaper imports, but the textile industry may not expand at a sufficiently high speed (it would need more investment, managerial resources, infrastructure) to absorb the surplus labour. 																														Unemployment of resources would imply gains less than that suggested in theory. Similarly, the labour released from the capital goods industry may require different kinds of skills to be absorbed in the textile industry. If so, the cost of retraining has to be subtracted to get the net gains from free trade  which may be positive even after the subtraction. Given a sufficiently long time, the people losing jobs in the capital goods sector would be eventually absorbed in the textile or some other industries.																														This is the way technological progress has taken place. For instance, replacement of horse-driven cars by automobiles created temporary unemployment for coachmen but eventually they found other jobs (including car driving after learning to drive autos). The reabsorption time would be less for an economy which has a high rate of innovation and growth of new industries rather than a relatively stagnant economy. So there will be short-run adjustment costs for those who lose jobs. Society will have to take care of them with a suitable social safety net and direct compensation while easing resource reallocation through retraining and other facilities. Unless that is done, there will be justifiable opposition to free trade, however beneficial to the nation in the long run. Further, an aerospace engineer losing a job and getting absorbed as a hamburger flipper in McDonalds is not an ideal employment situation.																														Moreover, comparative advantage does not remain fixed. It changes as an economy grows through investments in physical and human capital. The state may play an important role here. For instance, the successful development of a world-class automobile industry in Japan and Korea is often attributed to the creation of comparative advantage in this industry by suitable government policies rather than free-market forces. So when economists sing the virtues of free trade, they mean free trade according to the long run or dynamic comparative advantage. But to develop this comparative advantage, one may require temporary protection. This is the infant industry argument. 																														But suppose a country is not internationally cost-competitive in any product when it is exposed to free trade. The economists answer would be that in such a case, it would temporarily import everything and export nothing. This would result in a big trade deficit and unemployment. But in a free market system, the wage rate in the country will fall and the value of that countrys currency will depreciate. Both would help the country gain cost competitiveness in international markets in a sufficiently large number of products. But these automatic adjustment mechanisms may not work if the wage rate is not allowed to fall, despite unemployment, and the exchange rate is kept fixed by government intervention. In such a case, the massive trade deficit and unemployment can continue indefinitely. Even otherwise, the process of adjustment may take a long time, which a nation or its government may not find acceptable.																														Under free trade, resources move from the relatively less efficient to the more efficient industries. The country then sells goods which fetch higher prices abroad and, in exchange, buys those which are cheaper. This increases the total availability of goods for the nation. But that does not mean that everyone ends up being better off. All that the economists say is that with a larger collection of goods, each and every one can be made potentially better off by suitable redistribution. It is in this sense that the nation as a whole gains. But to the extent that the losers (like resources in import competing industries) are not actually compensated by the gainers (like those working in export industries), some people will end up losers and would oppose free trade. It is small comfort for anyone to know that though one has lost his job, two other persons have gained jobs somewhere else.																														A nation benefits from trade in several other ways also. One, international trade increases product variety. Some varieties which have a small local demand (some exotic cheese or kiwi fruit or models of sports cars) may simply not be produced locally as it may not be profitable to produce on a very small scale. The consumers can get these only through imports. Wider range of choice, in addition to cheaper goods, is a gain. Two, trade enables a country to produce a smaller range of goods (along with a wider range of choice for consumers) on bigger scales. The cost reduction through scale economies means that all countries may get these goods at lower prices. 																														Three, import competition and producing for the more competitive export markets force producers to improve quality, cut costs and upgrade technology on a continuing basis. This enforced efficiency effect is particularly evident in todays India. Finally, freer imports and direct foreign investment increase the range of capital goods, other inputs and technologies available to the nation. This increases the productive power of the economy.																														Thus, free trade based long-run comparative advantage can potentially bring enormous gains to everyone. But free trade needs to be accompanied by a suitable compensation and redistribution mechanism to ensure that everyone actually ends up being better off. Perhaps, the economist implicitly assumes that it would be done. The practical policy-makers know the enormous difficulty of doing it, as also the political consequences of not doing it. So they would rather not go for free trade.

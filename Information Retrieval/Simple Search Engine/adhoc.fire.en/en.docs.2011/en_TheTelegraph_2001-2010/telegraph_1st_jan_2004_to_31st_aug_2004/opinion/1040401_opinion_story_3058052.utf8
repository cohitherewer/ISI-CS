The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 01, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Its raining sops				 																																																				Sir  Give the voter what he wants, but only at the time of elections seems to be the catchline for the Telugu Desam Party (Voters dump liquor and saris for gizmo gifts, March 31). Thanks to N. Chandrababu Naidus fascination for technology  old electoral favourites like liquor, saris and cash have been replaced with gadgets like computers and mobiles to appease the voters. Also, given its non-performance, the TDP cannot run the risk of continuing with traditional sops  clothes induce very little party-loyalty in a consumer-savvy electorate, while liquor-induced absenteeism may lead to the loss of crucial votes. But this poll strategy exposes some disturbing facts. Naidu and his kind resort to buying the electorate with such incentives in order to brighten their poll prospects. Also, globalization in India has created a consumerist culture where Indians can do without basic necessities, but not without the luxuries. Perhaps, discretion and discrimination would help the electorate fight the twin evils of bribery and globalization. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Aloke Dey, Calcutta
				 																More than a game				 																																																				Sir  As the editorial,  Not by bat and ball alone( March 13), pointed out, the political overtones given to Indias tour of Pakistan does not make for a good game of cricket. Given that the Centres stand on cricketing ties between India and Pakistan has always been inconsistent, the prime minister deserves praise for permitting our cricketers to play the Pakistanis in their country. But his directive to win hearts bestows on the Indian team a political mission. To dress cricketers in the garb of political ambassadors certainly mars the spirit of the game. Indian cricketers should be concentrating on playing the game, and not on matters off the field.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sujit De, Sodepur

				 																																																				Sir  The terms in which Atal Bihari Vajpayee wished the Indian team is clearly part of his India Shining campaign. However, if anything untoward happens to the players during the tour, the violent reactions of the Singhals and Togadias might hinder peaceful polling. Perhaps Vajpayee should have insisted that the tour take place after the elections.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Muhiuddin Shaheen, via email

				 																																																				Sir  The success of the Pakistan tour will surely improve relations between India and Pakistan. The Indian players have won not only the one-day series, but also the hearts of the Pakistanis, as Atal Bihari Vajpayee had wished. Vajpayee has been able to guide India through this crucial phase, something that the secular leaders have not been able to pull off yet.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.M. Chowdhury, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Indias tour of Pakistan is being used by the National Democratic Alliance to improve relations with Pakistan. But the Indian leaders must realize that charity has to begin at home. Unless we learn to live amicably with Muslims in our own country, extending a friendly hand to our neighbour is a futile exercise. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Lalita Agrawal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Samsung Friendship series should be renamed the Baby Noor series after Noor Fatima, the Pakistani child who underwent surgery in India recently. Noor has become a symbol of harmony between the two countries.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Atul Awaethi, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  The game of cricket, and not politics, should play a crucial role in cementing goodwill between India and Pakistan. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chandan Ray, Sarsuna

				 																																																				Sir  When the Indo-Pak cricket series is meant to promote harmony and peace between the two countries, then it is not proper to describe Sachin Tendulkar and Shoaib Akhtar as weapons of mass destruction, as some newspapers have done. In the new climate of bonhomie, they could be regarded as weapons of mass entertainment.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																Friends turned foes				 																																																				Sir  The Election Commissions decision to award the National Congress Partys clock symbol to Sharad Pawars faction rather than that of P.A. Sangma sets a bold precedent (Pawar clocks symbol win, March 9). It has proved its impartiality by not giving in to pressure from the National Democratic Alliance. Sangma is now likely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party as he commands negligible support in the NCP.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Sharad Pawars statement that the NCP has decided to fight the ensuing elections to Parliament in alliance with the Congress has discredited the original point of forming this party (Sharad skips Sonia origin, March 27). Significantly, P.A. Sangma, who had unsuccessfully challenged Pawar during the recent controversy over the party symbol, is a force to be reckoned with in the North-east. He is capable of taking the fight to the Congress or the NCP on his own turf.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramesh Pradhan, Dibrugarh

				 																																																				Sir  Having bagged the clock symbol, the Maratha strongman has emerged as the winner in his race with P.A. Sangma. However, the political rivalry between the two is likely to consolidate the Bharatiya Janata Partys position in the elections.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The frequency with which Sharad Pawar changes his political colours is likely to put a chameleon to shame. The man who, until very recently, was at his acerbic best while talking about Sonia Gandhis foreign roots, is now seen dodging that very issue with ease. Pawars betrayal of his own conscience can only be attributed to his desire for power.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Avinash Gupta, Hooghly

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  One faces numerous problems while withdrawing money from the ATM outlets of the State Bank of India  long queues, slow transactions and unfriendly staff. The SBI should ensure that its customers can avail themselves of a better quality of service.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Niloy Mukherjee, Calcutta

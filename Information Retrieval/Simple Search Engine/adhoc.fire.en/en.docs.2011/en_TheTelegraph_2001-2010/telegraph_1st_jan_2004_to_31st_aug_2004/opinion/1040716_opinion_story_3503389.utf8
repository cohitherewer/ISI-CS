		 Friday, July 16, 2004 							 																						A NOBLE WAY OF LIFEARTS OF MUGHAL INDIA: STUDIES IN HONOUR OF ROBERT SKELTON (V amp;A and Mapin, Rs 2,000) edited by Rosemary Crill et al is a book of essays presented to Robert Skelton, one of the foremost authorities on Indian art in the Western world. The book is lavishly illustrated, with reproductions of rare Mughal paintings. This makes the book a collectors item. The picture selected here is from a late 17th century Viennese palace which had one room decorated with Mughal miniatures. The paintings probably came from Golconda via the Dutch East India Company. The chosen picture is from the south wall and shows a Mughal emperor (possibly an ageing Shah Jahan) with a cheetah keeper. The man reading from a book on the steps of the dais, to the left of the emperor, is suggestive of the Mughal emperors fondness for learning. The painter brings together the Mughals love for the outdoor with their patronage of the arts and letters.

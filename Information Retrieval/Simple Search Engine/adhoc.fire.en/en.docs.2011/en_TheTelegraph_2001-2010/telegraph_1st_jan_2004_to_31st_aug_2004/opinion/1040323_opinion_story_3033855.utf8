The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 							 																						CROWN PRINCE																														The law of primogeniture is a relic of the feudal era. But intentionally or otherwise, Ms Sonia Gandhi and the Congress seem to be upholders of that rather quaint law in modern times. The decision to promote Mr Rahul Gandhi ahead of Ms Priyanka Gandhi in the election batting order cannot be explained in any other term save the preference for the male first-born. Mr Gandhi has not ever shown a pronounced public interest in politics. The same cannot be said of his sister, who has been visible and occasionally vocal as well. Mr Gandhi has been something of a recluse, staying away from the limelight. Also, he was abroad for a considerable period of time pursuing a career which was far removed from Indian politics. Yet he is the Congress candidate from Amethi. The choice of Amethi is also significant since it is a kind of a Gandhi family fiefdom: three Gandhis have previously fought elections from there, Rajiv, Sonia and Sanjay. The emphasis on dynasty, lineage and tradition is too strong to be ignored. Ms Sonia Gandhi seems to be telling her critics that although her provenance is Italian, she is culturally and socially imbued in traditional Indian values. These are values that privilege son over daughter, the first-born over other children, and family (read dynasty) over merit. Mr Gandhi goes to Amethi, according to this set of values, to claim his heritage as the eldest son of the Gandhi dynasty. All other considerations pale into insignificance.																														It is very easy to scoff at these values from the ramparts of a Westernized and urban modernity. But these are the values that are respected all over India, in the villages and even in some towns and cities. It can hardly be disputed that despite the considerable success of the modernization project, large parts of India remain outside its influence. The choice of Mr Gandhi for Amethi will not strike a discordant note in those parts that are relatively untouched by modernity and its attendant attitudes. In such areas, the choice will reinforce the Congress as the party that respects Indian tradition, and this in turn will serve to counteract the foreign-origin campaign directed at Ms Sonia Gandhi. Mr Gandhis candidature from Amethi announces that the dynastic mantle has passed to the person who will easily be recognized by traditional India as the rightful claimant to represent the dynasty.																														The obvious focus on the dynasty underlines a contradiction that stalks the Congress. In terms of policies, it has been the pioneer of modernity in India. Yet this has not stopped it from nurturing traditional values. It led the campaign to make India a republic. Yet this has not stopped it from becoming a party driven by a dynasty. Mr Gandhi has nothing to recommend himself save the names of his father, grandmother and great grandfather. This lineage, and this lineage alone, makes him different from any other loyal Congress worker of his age group. The Congress continues to sit on the fence that separates tradition from modernity, but its loyalty to a dynasty is proof that its legs are dangling on the tradition side of the great divide.

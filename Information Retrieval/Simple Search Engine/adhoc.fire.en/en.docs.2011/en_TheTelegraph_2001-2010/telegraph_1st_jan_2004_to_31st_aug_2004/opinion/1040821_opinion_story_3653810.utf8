	K. Malleswari: The girl from Andhra Pradesh lifted a combined weight of 240 kg to become the first and only Indian woman to win an Olympic medal.																														His mother tells you the story. Some time ago, Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore went to a police station to get an officers endorsement that he needed to buy cartridges for shooting practice. I am busy, the officer said, why dont you come another day? Rathore replied that he would wait in his office. And he kept waiting  for one hour, two hours, then three, four, five, six and seven. It was a battle of attrition and a war of nerves. The officer wanted to tire him out, but Rathore was equally determined not to give in. Finally, the officer gave up. What metal are you made of? he asked him. And then, he signed the paper.																														On Tuesday afternoon at the Markopoulo Shooting Centre in Athens, the officer would have got his answer. The metal is steel but smells like an Olympic silver. That afternoon, the 34-year-old army major waged the most desperate and determined war of his sporting career fighting indifferent form, treacherous winds and the devils of doubt within. And won.																														For a billion heads drooping after a clutch of disappointing performances, Rathores triumph  finishing second in double trap shooting  is the difference between national honour and humiliation. I want to hire a management company that can take the medal across to the children of the nation with a message: This is a silver. You go for gold, he said in an interview later.																														Trap shooting is a gruelling, expensive sport. A sport only rajahs, who abound in the land of Rajasthan that Rathore comes from, could indulge in. The triumph of a commoner in the same sport is history being turned topsy-turvy. Especially when Rathore took up the sport only six years ago at the late age of 28.																														Think of the odds Ladbrokes would have given then for Rathore winning an Olympic medal. But as his mother Manju recalls, starting late meant only one thing for the shooter. He told me, it just means I have to work three times harder, she says. As ace sprinter P.T. Usha wrote in her column, Trackside, Rathore was determined to win a medal. Not all of us could show the same mentality all these years.																														Fellow shooters offer an incisive peepshow into Rathores unyielding core and uncompromising work ethic. Moraad Ali Khan, who shared the gold with him in the Manchester Commonwealth Games two years ago, recalls a practice session. One day, when we were training together, he shot 550 cartridges. That is like taking part in three matches a day. He is the most hardworking shooter I have come across. Another international shooter, Jaspal Rana, doesnt ever remember him talking during a practice. He is always focussed. With him, there is no bullshit.																														But practising hard at the range  and meditating at home  was never a problem for the shooter. What worried him was the lack of funds  something that he felt sorely when he made plans to go to Europe last year as part of his Olympic preparations. It is said he had to plead with K.P. Singh Deo  Rowing Federation of India chief  to take up his case. Singh Deo, in turn, spoke to the then Union defence minister, George Fernandes. And it was only then that the funds came in from the army. Later, when sports ministry funds too rolled in, he politely refused the offer, saying that he had enough; a gesture that enabled other shooters to benefit from the fund.																														The expensive Perrazi is Rathores favourite accessory. But even as a child, his mother says, the Jaisalmer-born boy was fascinated by guns. When he was four, a family friend bought him a .22 gun. Rathore  Chilly to friends and family  wasnt allowed to play with it but it was one of his prized possessions.																														That he had an obvious talent for the target was first noticed when at the age of 12, he shot 25 out of 25 during an NCC camp in Jodhpur. But the army officers son, who moved from Delhi to Dharamsala and from Jabalpur to Jodhpur, hopping from one school to another, never had the opportunity to take up the sport.																														Even his early years in the army  he is with the same regiment that his father once commanded, the 9 Grenadiers  his life revolved more around battling insurgents in Kashmir than at the shooting range. During an anti-insurgency operation once, he recalled in an interview, a bullet whizzed by between his legs.																														It was only when Rathore, who also holds a masters degree in strategic studies, was posted to Mhow in 1998  where he taught marksmanship to officers  that he first took up the sport. Wife Gayatri was surprised to find him practising with a dummy pistol before the mirror one day. It felt good, he told me. And that he wanted to practise, she recalls.																														His rise was meteoric. Within four years of having picked up the shotgun, he had won two gold medals at the Manchester Commonwealth Games. That win gave him the confidence that he could do well in the Olympics, says Gayatri, a former army doctor.																														But that Tuesday afternoon at the shooting centre in Athens, Rathore found the quiet determination in his soul ebbing away. Shooting is the macho mans mindgame, playing chess with a gun in hand. In varying weather conditions, under the pressure of expectations, you need a perfect alignment of mind, eyes and finger to be able to hit the target.																														However, having shot two poor qualifying rounds, the six-foot-tall armyman had a sinking feeling and reached out for his mobile phone. What his wife told him will forever be a part of Indias sporting folklore: Its not over, till its over.																														And it wasnt. With unwavering determination, Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore dug deep into his reserves and hauled himself out of the abyss. At a time when Indias best have all faltered on the worlds biggest sporting stage, many are still wondering what makes a Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore.																														Ask the officer in that New Delhi police station. Hell know.

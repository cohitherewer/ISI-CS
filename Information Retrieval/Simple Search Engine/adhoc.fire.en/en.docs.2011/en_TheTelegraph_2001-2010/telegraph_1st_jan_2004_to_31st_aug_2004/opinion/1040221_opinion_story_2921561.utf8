The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 																																	 Okay, so they dont make writers like you anymore, Sir Vidia. But books need to sell, you know. V.S. Naipaul feels the little green men and wizards, the standard fare in bestsellers of late, are debasing literature. At the World Book Fair in Delhi last week, the Nobel laureate was on a lambasting spree. Literature is supposed to be a reflection of the world we inhabit. (But) it has given way to little green men, ghosts, exorcism literature is being pushed away in favour of wizards. He also bemoaned the standards of publishers, who took on only those stories which they could turn into marketing triumphs. Were betting a certain Ms Rowling will have a thing or two to say about that.  Nelly Furtado				 																																	Class meets kitsch too often these days. Now you have a Punjabi remix of a Nelly Furtado song. Canada-based Indi-pop band Josh has remixed the singer-songwriters latest hit Powerless, into (what else?) bhangra. Furtado, touted as Canadas answer to Alanis Morisette, has been nominated for four Juno awards (Canadas Grammies) for her album Folklore which features the song. And the remixed track is one of the high points of the album. The video, meanwhile, has Furtado in myriad picture frames with loud colours to give out the desi feel. And though its difficult to imagine the classy lady doing this now, Josh has managed to ride the song (if we can call the mixed version that!) to a feature on CNN. What you would literally call 15 minutes of fame.  Kapil Dev				 																																	Just when you thought youd had enough of a former cricketing legend visiting your drawing rooms, Kapil Dev has decided to storm movie screens as well. Dev plays himself in Sohail Khans Bollywood venture, Aryan, where he tries to psyche up a boxer-turned-sports journalist to get back into the ring. He says he took up the role because it required him to play himself. Straight from the heart.

		 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 AND THE EMPIRE LIVES ON
 Dipankar Das																								Early December, a high-profile East African Indian immigrant, Yasmin Alibhai Brown, stunned the world by belatedly returning the title of Member of the British Empire to the Queen. This came within days of the refusal of Benjamin Zephaniah, the dreadlocked Rastafarian rhymester, to accept the Order of the British Empire. While Alibhai Brown attributed her gesture to the United Kingdoms surrender to the United States of America and Britains unkindness to asylum-seekers in a searing article, Zephaniahs hatred for the powers that be in the UK has been no secret. He described the OBE as a remnant of colonialism, which reminded him of slavery. 																								Zephaniah, whose poems speak starkly of post-imperial Britain, explained his unceremonious return  I get angry when I hear the word Empire. It reminds me of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped, and my forefathers were brutalized. 																								Together with Alibhai Brown, Zephaniah has joined a long list of high profile people who have turned down the awards, a trend whose precedent was probably set by none other than Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore returned the knighthood with a letter to the king which was searing in its attack on the frightening inhumanity of colonialism. John Lennon too returned the OBE  ridiculing the medallion by calling it a gong  as a symbol of a government that supported war and murder in its former colonies and supported the US in Vietnam. Shameful history																								While these are the more celebrated cases, by no means are they the only ones. There has been an unending stream of conscientious objectors who have thought the monarchy and more so, the reference to Empire, unacceptable. Of course, we could dismiss the celebration of Empire as a bit warped. After all, Falkland Islands notwithstanding, the imperial sun has set for good. The Union Jack has slipped down the flagpoles all round the world. The pink conquerors have quietly crept back home, so have the boxwallahs and memsahibs. They quietly abandoned the steaming landscapes of India and Africa for their pallid, drizzled streets. All that is history and there is no point exhuming this dead horse. 																								But precisely because it is history, it should be treated as such. A colonial history is for atonement, not for celebration. That fine point seems to be lost on the high and mighty in the British system, which seems to cherish that history. A history so smeared with loot, plunder and death, should be instructive for everyone in terms of what should not have happened. Instead the present is ordered by this rapacious past. The attitude lives on. It lives on in what the great historian, E.P. Thompson, described as the last colony of the British Empire  Britain itself.  Clean-up act																								When Germany emerged from the shadow of World War II, it accepted the blame for what it had wreaked on the world. The German people and the government made efforts to cleanse German life of Nazism. To this day, the German government pays compensation to victims of the concentration camps. 																								Such conscious acts of cleansing are necessary in every society at certain historical junctures. But British thought, British society has never been cleansed of the filth of imperialism. The emaciated British ego rests on an inverted pride in its dubious history. It is not easy to rid oneself of history overnight. As Salman Rushdie remarked, Four hundreds years of loot and plunder; four hundred years of assuming superiority to the fuzzy-wuzzies, wogs and dagos leaves its indelible stain behind. But what is galling is that hardly any effort has ever been made to own up  to accept the guilt of the Empire. 																								It is then not a coincidence that while post-war Germany re-emerged to power the engine of European growth, Britain steadily shrinks into insignificance. Britains crisis is not economic or social, but of culture itself, of the societys sense of its self  a chimerical empire that Britain refuses to abandon, lest it be told it is just another small nation.

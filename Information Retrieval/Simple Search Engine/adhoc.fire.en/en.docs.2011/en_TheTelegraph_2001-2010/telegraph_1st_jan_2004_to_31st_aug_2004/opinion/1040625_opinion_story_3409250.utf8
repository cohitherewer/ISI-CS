		 Friday, June 25, 2004 							 																						MEN AT WAR				 	 Crisis managementSUPREME COMMAND: SOLDIERS, STATESMEN AND LEADERSHIP IN WARTIME By Eliot A. Cohen, Simon amp; Schuster, $ 8.50In his book On War, Carl Von Clausewitz asserts that military strategy begins at the point where policy ends. In 1957, the American political scientist, Samuel Huntington, shot to fame by writing The Soldier and the State. In his monograph, Huntington draws on the history of Western democracies, and like Clausewitz, asserts that a combat-effective army is professional. In other words, a politicized army is not merely useless against an external threat but it also becomes a domestic nuisance. Eliot A. Cohen, professor at John Hopkins University, raises questions about the Huntington model through this book.																														Cohen claims that the distinction between politics and military strategy is a red herring. Politics and the military are not watertight compartments. At times, they overlap and merge with one another, especially during war. Even minor tactics have political implications, argues Cohen. For instance in Vietnam, there was no consensus between the president of the United States of America and its air force on the issue of bombing. The nature of bombs to be used and how may seem like a tactical issue, on the surface But it is related to the quantum of civilian casualties, which in turn has political implications. Thus, bombing became a state department issue in the US.																														According to Cohen, political interference is necessary for improving the combat effectiveness of the army. This is so because combat is too serious a business to be left to the military alone. Cohen tries to prove this by falling back on history. Abraham Lincoln  one of the most successful statesmen in American history  in contrast to what Clausewitz and Huntington argue, always interfered in military matters. The American president had a penchant for sending a stream of letters to his field commanders, asking for details about what appeared to be minor matters. In fact, Lincoln believed that continuous interference with the generals was necessary to goad them into action. And purely military issues like timing, casualty and so on, had political repercussions.																														In the late twentieth century, the relations between civilians and the military had deteriorated in the US. This was because US presidents had given up Lincolns tradition of being in contact with the generals. This, according to Cohen, was one of the most important reasons behind the military failure of the US in Vietnam. 																														Instead of overseeing the nitty-gritty of war, President Lyndon Johnson and his secretary of defence, Robert Macnamara, were not in the picture at all. Johnson and his civilian advisors lacked the guts to rein in the inefficient military bureaucrats at Washington. Unlike Lincoln, who replaced inefficient generals immediately, the Johnson administration dithered on this crucial issue. 																														During Bill Clintons presidency, the dice was loaded further against civilian decision-makers. Numerous former military generals took advantage of the media attention to carve out political careers for themselves. One such example is the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Colin Powell. 																														In the last fifty years, says Cohen, politicians were forced out of the office in the event of any military debacle, but the military chiefs continued. Ironically, in a democracy the public ire was directed entirely against the politicians. But the civilian and military bureaucrats escaped public scrutiny.																														Cohen ends by analysing the British, French and Israeli political and military decision-making apparatus. He concludes that Georges Clemenceau, Winston Churchill and David Ben-Gurion, the most successful wartime leaders of their respective countries, had the habit of Lincoln  of continuously meddling with and monitoring the activity of army generals.																														In recent times, a section of the Indian intelligentsia and the military brass are asking for the introduction of an American-style chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. In the British military, this post is known as the chief of defence staff. But with the introduction of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  who became the most powerful military advisor of the civilian cabinet  the quality of American civil-military relationship has deteriorated, observes Cohen. This is because the chairman has prevented the politicians from looking closely into military affairs. 																														This observation has important implications for the managers of Indias security setup.						KAUSHIK ROY

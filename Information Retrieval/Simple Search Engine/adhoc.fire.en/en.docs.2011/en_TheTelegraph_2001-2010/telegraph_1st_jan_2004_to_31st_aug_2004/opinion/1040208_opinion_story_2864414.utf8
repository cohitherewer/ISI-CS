The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, February 08, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Born to an unchanging world				 																																																				Sir  Rhadha, the grandmother in Gujarat, may seem to have shattered all Indian mores by giving birth to her own grandchildren, but the reality is far from it (Best thing Ive ever done, says Grand-mom, Feb 2). Remember, the babies had to be born to keep the marriage of their parents going because children are important in the Asian community. The search for a surrogate mother failed because she had to be an Asian, and among Asians the thing is still stigma. Moreover, the babies aunts still have to have arranged marriages. The more things change, the more they remain the same.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, M. Sikdar, Calcutta
				 																Dropping the case				 																																																				Sir  This is to register my disgust and deep sense of anger at the spinelessness of the government of India which was evident in the way it succumbed to pressure from the British government and granted clemency to Peter Bleach, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for aiding and abetting terrorism in this country. Bleach and his co-conspirator, Kim Davy, had air-dropped a huge quantity of arms and ammunitions over Purulia in West Bengal in December 1995. The cache of arms could have been used to kill a huge number of people. 				 																																																				Bleach has always maintained that he had kept the British government informed about his shady activities, a claim which the British Government has affirmed before the House of Commons in November 2002. If that is so, why didnt the British government, which claims to be in the forefront of the war against global terrorism, expose the conspiracy and arrest the conspirators? Why has the British government taken such undue interest in the release of Bleach, whose complicity in the above mentioned subversive activity is undisputed? Or was the British government afraid that Bleach would spill the beans?				 																																																				Kim Davy, a Danish citizen who mysteriously escaped from custody at the Bombay airport, is leading a secure life in Denmark with the government of India doing pretty little to seek his extradition. Under the circumstances, the unconditional and untimely release of Bleach is nothing but an outrageous step. Yours faithfully, 
 N.D. Jayaprakash, New Delhi 				 																																																				Sir  It is unfortunate that the release of Peter Bleach took such a long time despite the presidential order to set him free. Bleach had been languishing in prison for more than eight years despite the fact that his co-prisoners in the same case, the five Latvians, had been set free three years back. Is it Bleachs British legacy that was the cause of the discrimination? 				 																																																				The jail authorities had cited two reasons for the delay  a customs complication and a case of assault of a co-prisoner in the Presidency jail which was pending against Bleach. But the two cases were not as significant as the arms drop case. If Bleach had already been granted pardon by the president on the main case, there was little reason he should have been detained for the other two. The accused has suffered enough mental agony over the years, compounded by bad health. Discriminatory treatment of foreign citizens shows the government in poor light. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Ram, Calcutta

				 																Self-help				 																																																				Sir  The fast emerging trend in the North-east of holding exhibitions where local artisans can demonstrate their talent and potential is a welcome step and may help local craftsmen attain self-sufficiency while promoting the culture of the region. According to the latest statistics, the North-east comprises 19.2 per cent of the total handloom and handicraft products produced in the country. 				 																																																				The Baba Ambedkar Sahib Scheme of the Central government, which provides financial support and also the basic infrastructure to many self-help groups, has turned out to be a boon for craftsmen. Institutions like the Kadorna Cooperative Society are trying to synthesize ethnicity with modernity. Nedfi is also doing commendable work in this regard.  Yours faithfully, 
 Aiyushman Dutta, Guwahati

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 31, 2004  Out and About
				 																																	In springtime  or so its been said  a young mans thoughts turn to love. And now it transpires that a not-so-young man nurtures similar passions in basant. Meghnad J. Desai, 63-year-old British peer, professor of economics, director of the Centre for the Study of Global Governance in London and proud possessor of a mass of silvery mane, is going to marry New Delhi-based editor and former television producer, Kishwar Ahluwalia, next month. Love apparently blossomed between the two when Desai was doing a book on Dilip Kumar, to be published by Roli Books, and Ahluwalia was editing it. And Roli celebrated the event this week by cutting a cake. Thats called having your cake and eating it too.				 																																	Writing isnt the same thing as acting or modelling. But one can always try. And Bollywoods hottest heroine Preity Zinta plans to do exactly that. The leading lady of Koi Mil Gaya and Kal Ho Naa Ho, two of Mumbai film industrys top hits in 2003, will be writing a monthly column for bbc.com. Topics: life and cinema. It is an opportunity to address any issue, says the zesty and feisty heroine. Hope that is not something like Save the Whales.

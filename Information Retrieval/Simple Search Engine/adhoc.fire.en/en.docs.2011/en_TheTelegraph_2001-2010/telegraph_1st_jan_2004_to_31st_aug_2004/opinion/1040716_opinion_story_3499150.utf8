The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 16, 2004 							 																						SANS SENSE																														Ideology is power-neutral. This simple statement will appear bizarre to most observers of Indian politics. Power, or more importantly the lack of it, makes ideology change tracks. This is true for most political parties in India. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, under the leadership of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was one of the most vocal advocates of liberalization and economic reforms. But now that Mr Vajpayee is no longer the prime minister, he appears to have turned against reforms. He announced that his party would oppose the increase in the foreign direct investment limit in insurance, telecom and aviation. This, in a paradox that is typical of Indian politics, puts the BJP and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on the same ideological trajectory. It needs to be noted that even the Congresss enthusiasm for economic reforms was distinctly muted when it was out of power, from 1996 to a few weeks ago. Of course, there is an element of disingenuity in these flip-flops of the political parties. In the case of the CPI(M), the insincerity is most blatant because in West Bengal, where it is in power, the left replicates many aspects of the economic reforms in its economic policy for the state.																														It could be argued that when political parties are out of power, they propagate their own ideologies. When they are in power, running a government, they articulate policy, and this does not always converge with their ideology. On the distance between ideology and policy falls the long shadow of the government and issues of governance. Two implications follow from this. One is that in Indian politics, ideology does not underpin policies. Second, when parties are in power, they think of the country, and when they are out of power, they think only of their own constituencies. Both implications are dangerous. Policy without ideology suggests a kind of anchorlessness: a situation that spawns ad hocism and expediency. Thus yesterdays socialist can easily become todays reformer and vice versa. The shift in focus from country to constituency explains the vacuous nature of Indian politics. Indian politics seldom, if ever, takes a principled position over any issue. Even the CPI(M), which is self-righteous about its principles, is pro-capital in West Bengal and anti-capital in New Delhi. It would, however, be unfair to criticize any one particular party for this state of affairs. The matter has somehow become endemic to the system. Indian democracy thus has demographic depth but no intellectual width.

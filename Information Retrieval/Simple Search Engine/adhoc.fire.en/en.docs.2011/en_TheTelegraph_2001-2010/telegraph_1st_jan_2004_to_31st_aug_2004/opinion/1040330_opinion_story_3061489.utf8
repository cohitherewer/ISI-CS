The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 							 																						TALKING IT OUT																														The second round of dialogue between leaders of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference and the deputy prime minister, Mr L.K. Advani, seems to have built on the first meeting held earlier this year. Although it is too early to expect a breakthrough, the meeting could help consolidate the dialogue and generate a fresh momentum for the peace process in Jammu and Kashmir. As may be recalled, the APHC had, in recent weeks, come under tremendous pressure to suspend talks after alleged human rights violations by security forces operating in the Kashmir valley. The separatist leadership needed a face-saver, and this seems to have been provided by Mr Advani. Indeed, there were two important assurances that the Central government gave to the APHC leadership. Most important, Mr Advani promised to speed up the process of review of the cases of political prisoners from Jammu and Kashmir and release those interned without serious cases against them. Simultaneously, the deputy prime minister asserted that a mechanism for ensuring zero level human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir would be created to ensure that there is security with a human face and ordinary citizens are not subjected to any harassment. 																														The Hurriyat delegates and New Delhi have also agreed that the next meeting will be held in June 2004, after a new government is installed at the Centre. Probably more substantive issues would be discussed there. While a good beginning has been made, it is important to recognize that there will continue to be hurdles in the way of a meaningful dialogue. The Hurriyat today, especially the moderate leaders who met Mr Advani, has little control over the terrorist groups operating in the valley. It is unlikely, therefore, that these groups will respond to a call by the Hurriyat to stop perpetuating violence. There are also important separatist leaders, outside the Hurriyat, who were not part of the meeting. It is possible that these leaders may continue to project the dialogue as a sell-out by the Hurriyat leaders. Clearly, the India-Pakistan rapprochement has helped the process of the internal dialogue. Indeed, Mr Advani conceded that the general climate for talks between New Delhi and Srinagar had become conducive after the visit of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Islamabad, his talks with Mr Pervez Musharraf, and the joint India-Pakistan statement. It is still, however, unclear what attitude Pakistan will adopt to the dialogue in the long term. Be that as it may, it is important that the dialogue be sustained until it is possible to arrive at a real modus vivendi.

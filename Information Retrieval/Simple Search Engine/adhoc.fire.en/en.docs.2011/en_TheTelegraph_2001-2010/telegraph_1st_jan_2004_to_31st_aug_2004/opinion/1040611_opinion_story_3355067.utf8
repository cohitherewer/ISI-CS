The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 11, 2004 							 																						HOME IS A LONG WAY OFFTHE BUS STOPPED By Tabish Khair, Picador, Rs 495The Gaya-Phansa bus route is not as popular among tourists as the Gaya-Patna route. Despite this, the private bus which plies from Gaya to Phansa is almost always over-crowded. This bus, driven by Mangal Singh, carries people whose faces have that indefinable something to inspire a traveller to conjure tales around them. These stories often run parallel to each other, and occasionally, also intersect. Some of these stories seem to end midway, even as some others unfold. At the places the bus stops too some stories inevitably pop up.																														Tabish Khair compiles these stories imaginatively in The Bus Stopped. Though not quite a novel, Khairs narrative is generically very close to one. Quite deliberately, Khair stops short of integrating the tales into a master narrative. 																														The apparent disjunction between the tales underscores an underlying theme  the search for home. In fact, Khairs book opens and ends with deliberations on the idea of home. Where do homes begin?, asks Khair in the concluding chapter. Obviously, there cannot be any straightforward answer. Nor can there be any systematic attempts at answering it. The homes that the characters in the book are headed for, or leave behind, are part-real and part-imagined, part-static and part-dynamic, partly lost and partly lived-in. 																														Khairs narrative  rather, narratives  delineates the changing nature of such homes, set apart in time and space. The bus journey format imposes a simultaneity to the process by which these widely-scattered homes are periodically formed and then scattered.																														The individual tales of the book exude melancholia of various kinds. Though not integrated, these are intelligently juxtaposed to suggest, and in some cases foreshadow, possible inter-relations. 																														Khairs language has a distinctly poetic flavour. The story of Mangal Singh, the bus driver who lost his love to his cousin and the owner of the bus; Farhana, the feminine-seeming eunuch who is on the lookout for something better in life, and Mrs Mirchandani, the respectable lady  all are told with a careful change of the register and with the help of poetic images. Then there are also the stories of those who are not passengers of the bus  like Wazir Mian, the cook, and the adolescent boy whose sexual fantasies are fired by a few chance glimpses of the neighbourhood maidservant, Zeenat. 																														One of the mainstays of Khairs narrative technique is a constantly changing narrative voice. We come across three different first-person narrators in the book, apart from the second and the third person narrators.																														At a superficial level, these tactics are meant to ward off boredom. But for those who prefer to delve deep, these suggest the plurality and the elusiveness of the concept of home  familiar and yet so unattainably far.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

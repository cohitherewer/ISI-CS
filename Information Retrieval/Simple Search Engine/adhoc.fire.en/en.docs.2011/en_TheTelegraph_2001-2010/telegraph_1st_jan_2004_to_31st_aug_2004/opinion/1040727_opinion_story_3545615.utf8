		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 							 																						THREES NOT ENOUGH 																														Taking the long way round is not necessarily a mark of discouragement. Rather, it might be an expression of determination. The model nikaahnamas drafted by Ms Uzma Naheed, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, and Ms Neelofar Akhtar, a lawyer, attempt to safeguard the rights of women within marriage and during divorce without insisting on an immediate ban on the verbal triple talaq. This last has been the sticking-point for numerous recent debates among the scholarly and religious heads of the minority community, and was the central issue in a major meeting of the board last week. The more conservative sections among the community feel that the triple talaq cannot be given short shrift because it is approved of by Islamic law, although not by the Quran. In brief, the model nikaahnamas are an outcome of the debate between the conservative segment and the liberal one on the board. The really important aspect of the suggested marriage contracts is the effort to protect womens rights in case of divorce and also to give women greater agency in deciding the course of the marriage.																														There are two facts that strengthen the case for the draft contracts. Most of the provisions for the protection of womens rights already exist in the personal law. Although it is true that personal laws of all religions put women at a disadvantage, it is also true that some provisions of Muslim personal law are fair and thoughtful. The point is that they are deliberately overlooked or misapplied. That is possible only because a large number of women in the minority community in India had for long been left unexposed to education. It is also significant that the system of triple talaq does not operate anywhere but within India. It is obviously out of keeping with the contemporary understanding of rights and empowerment, and its continued existence would be an indicator of a lack of awareness among the women of the community. By imposing conditions upon the pronouncing of the word talaq three times, the draft marriage contracts try to forge a way out of instant divorce. This alone proves that a lack of awareness is no longer a problem, and that women within the community have taken up the cause of their own rights with determination.

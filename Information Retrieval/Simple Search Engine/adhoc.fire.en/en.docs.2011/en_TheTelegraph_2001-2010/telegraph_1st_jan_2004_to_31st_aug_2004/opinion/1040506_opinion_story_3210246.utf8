The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 06, 2004 							 																						TURN TOO LEFT																														The perception that elections in West Bengal are not altogether free and fair has been around for a long time. In time, the perception coincides with the first election that was held in West Bengal under the auspices of a Left Front government. The Left Front may resent this, and rave and rant about it, but this is a common perception and the left has done precious little to uproot this perception. On the contrary, it has acted in a manner to strengthen existing suspicions and allegations. Take for example what is happening during the ongoing general elections. One of the first things that the Election Commission did was to announce that it would appoint special observers for the polls from outside the state. It followed this up by ordering the transfer of senior and junior police officers from their present posts. It was felt that the presence of these officers would not be conducive to free and fair polls in the areas under their present jurisdiction. This has angered the Left Front, and its leaders are now busy hurling abuse at the EC and its mode of operation.																														It is this fury of the Left Front which appears odd and suspicious. If the Left Front is committed, as it should be, to free and fair voting, it should accept graciously whatever the EC is doing. Only the EC can ensure a free and fair poll, and hence the left should cooperate with it. If the Left Front is confident of winning most of the seats, as it should be, it should not be affected by the administrative changes that the EC is putting in place. A transfer of a few officers should not adversely affect the Left Fronts electoral fortunes. If the Left Front feels that by transferring officers, the EC is putting a slur on the lefts reputation, it should ignore the slur and remove it by doing good work for the development of the state. The Left Front should have nothing to fear from the EC. But by raving and ranting and by protesting too much, it conveys the impression that there is something always rotting in West Bengal during elections. The Left Front is the lefts worst enemy in the state. The Left Fronts anger against the EC is seriously misplaced. It is making an enemy of a potential friend.

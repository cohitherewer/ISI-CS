		 Sunday, January 04, 2004 							 																						MISPLACED HONOUR By refusing an honorary doctorate,  possibly bestowed for political reasons rather than academic,  Mr Vajpayee has behaved as a prime minister should. Honorary doctorates are double-edged  instruments. They can be used to bestow genuine honour and  to show sincere appreciation. They can also be used as an  instrument of sycophancy. This danger arises especially  when powerful politicians in authority or the very wealthy  are given honorary degrees. Universities are prone to see  honorary degrees as investments. A degree given to a millionaire  has the built-in expectation of an endowment; from a politician  or a prime minister there is the expectation of greater  government patronage or some other official favour. Thus  honorary degrees of this kind are always open to controversy.  The University of Oxford in a celebrated  or notorious   case refused to give Ms Margaret Thatcher an honoris  causa doctorate when she was prime minister even though  she was an alumnus of the university. A powerful lobby worked  against Ms Thatcher. In India, a minor controversy has been  created by the refusal of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the prime  minister, to accept an honorary degree from Maharaja Sayajirao  University in Vadodara. The senate of the university violated  a fundamental protocol and a basic code of good manners.  They did not seek the prime ministers prior approval. Mr  Vajpayee is apparently averse to taking such degrees. Predictably,  he turned the honour down.																								There may have been other factors at work behind Mr Vajpayees refusal. For one thing, the universitys senate is known to be Bharatiya Janata Party dominated. Such a body may have thought of honouring Mr Vajpayee for political reasons. Mr Vajpayee has done well to refuse the degree. The suspicion that the senate was driven by political and sectarian considerations is strengthened by the fact that the senate also considered Mr Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, and Mr Praveen Togadia, the leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, as possible recipients of honorary doctorates. Mr Vajpayee would not like to be tainted by the same tar as Messrs Modi and Togadia. It can be argued that by virtue of being the prime minister of India, Mr Vajpayee holds the highest honour that his country can bestow on him. Honours of a quasi-academic nature should be irrelevant to him.																								There is the larger question of universities giving honorary degrees to politicians. Honorary degrees should be used to recognize work done by scholars not from the concerned university and for others who have made significant contributions to the arts or to literature. An honorary doctorate carries with it an academic distinction. A prime minister does not qualify for it just by virtue of the chair he occupies. Mr Vajpayee is a poet but it is doubtful if the senate of Maharaja Sayajirao University would have considered honouring him if he had not been the prime minister. Mr Vajpayee is an astute man who knows which gesture is sincere and which is not. He has also shown that he does not hanker after honours. He has behaved as a prime minister should.

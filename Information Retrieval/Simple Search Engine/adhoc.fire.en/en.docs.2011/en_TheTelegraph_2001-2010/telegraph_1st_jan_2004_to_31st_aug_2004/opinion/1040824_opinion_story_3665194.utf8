		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 							 																						FREE RANGE																														Belonging is an elusive notion. The relationship between an individual being and its geographical locatedness is both a subjective and a material thing. And out of this conjunction arises the experience of citizenship. The increasing openness and mobility of modern life have complicated this experience and its politics. In spite of its nearly six-decades-long stakes in the idea of nationhood, India is now being made to confront these complexities. At the beginning of last year, there were about 20 million non-resident Indians living in 110 different countries. India now seems more willing to allow foreign citizens of Indian origin in 16 of these countries to be Indian citizens as well. This is only a marginal improvement on the Persons of Indian Origin scheme, started in 1999. Judging from the continuing vaguenesses in the dual citizenship provisions, there still seem to be some hesitation and apprehensions about the whole thing.																														First, the idea seems to hover uncertainly between the economic and the sentimental. Does India want these citizens because of their fortunes, or is this a way of honouring their feelings about their roots? The previous government, with its Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, had hoped for the former, but used the rhetoric of the latter. There were corresponding incentives for NRIs to invest money in their motherland, some of which have been reversed now that there seems to be more than enough foreign exchange. This time too the emphasis is on being able to buy property more easily and certain other fiscal advantages. But what kind of citizenship will this be without the rights to vote, to equality in public employment and to appointment to a constitutional office? Can the sentimental attachment to a national identity exist without these concrete elements of political agency? In concrete terms, what this boils down to is a matter of material convenience, rather than emotional attachment. It would be of immense help to many people to acquire foreign citizenship and thus free themselves of visa requirements while travelling abroad, and also keep their Indian citizenship, which would, in turn, allow them entry into the country without a visa. The pragmatics of modern, globalized lives is founded on such a sense of possibilities  the ability to travel, study, work, buy and sell without hassles anywhere in the world. Dual citizenship gestures towards this possibility, if its implications are properly and fearlessly thought through.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 20, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Spare the rod, and the child				 																																																				Sir  I feel somewhat sceptical about the Calcutta high court circular prohibiting caning or any form of corporal punishment in schools in West Bengal (Caning bar in place, not violators penalty, Aug 17). And that is because the punishment for the guilty teachers is vague  it could be anything between warning and suspension, depending on the gravity of the situation. Who decides how grave the situation is? In how many cases of corporal punishment have we heard of the exact punishment awarded to the culpable teacher? In fact, these teachers have used their position in many cases to make the students appear deserving of corporal punishment. Their unripe age, and more importantly, fear, often stands in the way of students speaking against their teachers. The noble intentions of the judiciary notwithstanding, implementation of the circular will remain a tricky issue. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,  Shubhra Roy, Calcutta
				 																Budget and after				 																																																				Sir  In talking about the governments concentration on primary education and upgradation of the Industrial Training Institutes, Shubhashis Gangopadhyay has drawn attention to the vast pool of unskilled workers, who are always in short supply when small entrepreneurs require their services (Consistent programme, July 20). But there is a vast rural adult workforce engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery and forestry which does not fall under the purview of the ITIs. This section is not skilled in the technical sense, and their productivity remains low.				 																																																				This rural workforce needs special attention for upgradation of their skills. Training institutes are hard to come by in rural India, making technical training an impractical option for many unskilled rural workers. Therefore, along with strengthening primary education for children and upgrading the ITIs for the youth, there is a need to organize skill-upgradation programmes for the rural workforce at places convenient for them. This is not difficult and does not involve high costs either.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debdas Mukhopadhyay, Haldia

				 																																																				 n Sir  A report authored by Vijay Kelkar has proposed to tax approved securities like provident funds and pension plans at current rates during the time of encashment (Kelkar salutes seniors in tax rejig, July 24). Under the existing rules, persons earning above Rs 5 lakh are not entitled to any tax rebate, under Section 88, on their annual savings. For this category of people, wouldnt the above proposal amount to a double taxation of the same amount, once at the time of earning and the other during encashment?				 																																																				A person earning below Rs 5 lakh might save taxes at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent on an annual basis. But he will have to cough up 30 per cent plus surcharge in taxes when it is time to encash his PF and pension plans.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.G. Shah, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  After the budget, the government has quietly withdrawn the 6.5 per cent tax-free government bonds from the market even though nothing was mentioned about this in the budget itself. This unscrupulous move on the governments part has put millions of investors in trouble. Many people have been parking their funds in this scheme because it was safe and hassle-free and more so because it was exempt from taxes. Besides, it made sense to invest ones hard-earned money in such schemes to avoid the vagaries of the stock market. 				 																																																				This decision on bonds will make the government immensely unpopular. Economic reforms are welcome, but overdoing it will cost the government dear. The government could have reduced the interest rate on this bond to, say, 6 per cent, in keeping with the current trend of lower interest rates everywhere. But the total withdrawal of the scheme is ridiculous. The finance ministry needs to review the situation and re-introduce the tax-free bonds so that the people have no reason to feel shortchanged. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Amit Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  To tax and then misspend seems to be the theme of all Union budgets. New taxes are imposed every year without sparing a thought for how the tax revenues are spent. This time, a securities transaction tax and worse, a service tax have been introduced, to add to the woes of the citizens. Every year, the comptroller and auditor generals report provides instances of wasteful and avoidable government expenditure, and revenue leak. Would so many taxes be necessary had such wasteful expenditure been eliminated? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
J.G. Arora, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir  The budget for 2004 has proposed a service tax on consultancy bills of practising CSs, CAs and CWAs, whereas lawyers are outside the purview of it. Is this fair? Or was the finance minister, a lawyer himself, trying to give his fraternity a few sops?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Rampuria, Siliguri

				 																Of animals and men				 																																																				Sir  Our chief ministers daughter has been exhorting celebrities to save dwindling wildlife species of the North Bengal forests. I want to tell this socially-conscious lady that several tea gardens of North Bengal are closed sine die and hundreds of their employees are starving. Will she put in a word to her father, so that the helpless lot gets some succour? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, D.K. Chakravarti, Calcutta

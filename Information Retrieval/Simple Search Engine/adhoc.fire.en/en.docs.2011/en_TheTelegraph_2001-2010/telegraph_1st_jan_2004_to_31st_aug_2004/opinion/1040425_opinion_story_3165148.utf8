The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Testing time ahead				 																																																				Sir  Someone should tell Mulayam Singh Yadav that it is dangerous to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds (Mulayam smacks lips, juggles laddoos, April 23). For the moment, Yadav seems to be sitting pretty with both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party on tenterhooks about whom he will ally with finally. But Yadav may find that things are not so rosy once the election results are declared. After all, it is far easier to manipulate the leaders of parties than it is to convince voters to support you, especially if you have nothing to recommend you but a bag full of unkept promises. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, R.K. Basu, Calcutta
				 																																																				Lost in action				 																																																				Sir  Damayanti Tambays lifestory is evidence of the governments indifference to the brave soldiers who put their lives at risk for the sake of the nation (Long road to nowhere, April 18). Once the war is over, no one in the bureaucracy bothers to find out whether the captured soldiers are dead or alive. Thirty-three years is a long, long time and it is shame that Vijay Tambay is still languishing in some jail in Pakistan. Since relations with Pakistan have improved, the government must take up the task of freeing him. If this negligent attitude persists, few people will want to join the armed forces.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vivek Dudheria, Howrah

				 																																																				Sir  It speaks volumes for Damayanti Tambays grit and tenacity that despite 33 years having passed since her husband was reported missing in action and despite not knowing what had become of him, she has not lost hope of her husbands return. No one knows whether Vijay Tambay is still alive. If he is alive in some Pakistani jail, Tambay must surely have given up hope of ever seeing his wife. In the euphoria of the recent cricket series, the country seems to have forgotten the past bitternesses in the India-Pakistan relationship. Politicians must take time off electioneering to try to free this brave soldier.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sayan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In the rush to fill pages with electioneering activity, the media played down the deaths of two Indian airforce pilots, Gagan Oberoi and Mayank Mayur, when their Jaguars crashed near Sonamarg earlier this month. Elections are important, but it does not make sense to devote so many pages to politicians and allocate just one report on the bodies of the pilots being found. Flight lieutenant Oberoi had been married for less than a year. But there was not one article on how the families of these brave young men were coping with the loss. Instead, the papers were full of the news of Anil Kumble becoming a father.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sandhya K. Nambiar, Jamshedpur

				 																Screen saver				 																																																				Sir  It is a good sign that films with immoral content are faring badly at the box-office (Bare truth for Hollywood, April 5). Films are said to mirror society and hence, the rejection of such films is a healthy trend. Hopefully, the phenomenon will catch up with Bollywood soon. The makers of vulgar films often try to justify themselves by resorting to the clich that the film industry is a demand driven one. But now that they know that there is no demand, will the producers stop making such films? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suresh Behera, Ranchi

				 																																																				Sir  Recently, there have been a number of releases of films certified A by the censor board. I went to see a couple of these movies and was amazed to see many underaged viewers among the audience. Viewers of A movies are supposed to show proof of age at the time of entrance. In reality, there is nothing to stop children from entering the hall. My 10-year-old daughter is aggrieved that while I do not allow her to go to see adult films, many of her friends have been taken to see them by their parents  in some cases the parents have even helped them to dress in adult clothes to avoid problems at the time of entrance.				 																																																				Evidently, there is need to increase public awareness in this matter. The authorities also need to do a better job of regulating cinema halls.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P. Agarwal, via email

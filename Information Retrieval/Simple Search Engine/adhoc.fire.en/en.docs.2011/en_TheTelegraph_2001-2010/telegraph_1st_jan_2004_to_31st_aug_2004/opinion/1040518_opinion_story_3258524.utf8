The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 							 																						PLASTIC ISNT NATURALSayantani Biswas																					Most Calcuttans will remember that in late 2001, shopkeepers in the city had suddenly become very conscientious about not handing over goods to their customers in a plastic bag. There was, reportedly, a ban on plastic carry bags. But as most meaningful orders meet their fate in this state, this ban was soon side-stepped and things are now as they were before. Well, almost. The West Bengal Pollution Control Board claims to be pursuing the issue rigorously. At least its website says so.																					The national ban on the manufacture, storage, sale or use of carry-bags of less than 20-micron thickness was part of the Recycled Plastics Manufacture and Usage Rules, issued by the ministry of environment and forest in 1999, and led to a similar ban in West Bengal in 2001. It had been declared then that shopowners would have their trade licences cancelled if they were found using plastic bags below the prescribed thickness. However, the absurdity of penalizing the end-users rather than those at the source must have struck the officials soon after. The WBPCB subsequently shifted its focus to conducting raids on plastic carry-bags manufacturing units and wholesalers premises.																					Little difference																					There seem to have been an increase in the number of hearings against the violating firms, but this has made little difference in the use of plastic bags. So either the basic information about the ban has not been disseminated properly or the manufacturers have found loopholes in the rules. Nowhere does one find mention of the number of trade licenses cancelled since the ban came into effect. The errant manufacturers are usually given a second, and sometimes third, chance. This type of leniency may have been adopted keeping in mind the future of the thousands employed in the plastic carry-bag manufacturing industry. 																					The ban is running into three years now, but the tempo is yet to pick up. A blanket ban on the manufacture, sale and use of plastic carry-bags had been thoughtfully placed in the Sunderbans, coastal and forested zones and the hills of Darjeeling district since September 15, 2001. Subsequently, the blanket ban was extended to ten heritage sites in the state. But this is a selective approach to the plastics pollution problem in the state. 																					Carry on, babus																					This is not to say that a ban should ideally be extended to other parts of the state, especially to Calcutta. Such a proposition is unrealistic  these bags have their uses. But if the bio-degradability factor has been addressed by the 20-micron thickness rule, the WBPCB should have also thought about the quantity of plastic-bag wastes. Take a look at the extensive use of plastic bags  nobody thinks much before insisting on separate carry-bags for every item bought from each different shop. All that the board has to do is to specify the quantity of bags that can be produced, say in a month. Once supply of such bags becomes constrained, they will be used more prudently. Plastic-bag waste will then come down automatically. 																					At the same time, popularizing viable alternatives to such bags will have a crucial role to play. This was taken on by the board only in August last year and although individuals and organizations are being trained by it, awareness and will still seem to be limited. Although plastic carry-bags less than 8 inches by 12 inches have been banned, they continue to be very much in use  those used by the flower-vendors come readily to mind. 																					The PCB has indeed taken up a problem that has become enmeshed with our daily lives. General awareness of such pollution, and also about the boards position on it, through notices, advertisements, billboards and campaigns, are sadly missing. People in Bengal may take pride in a lot of things, but certainly not in their civic sense. It is this sense that needs to be awakened. 																					The boards ban on plastic carry-bags from government buildings in the state is odd. After all, it is unlikely that the babus working in these places will not use such bags carelessly elsewhere or will try to persuade others to use them prudently.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 							 																						BLEEDING HEART																														The top is always a very lonely place. This realization must have come to Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, rather cruelly during the bandh on Tuesday. He was all alone in a vast and sprawling red building for most of the day. None of his ministerial colleagues had reported for work. Nobody will blame the chief minister if he wondered to himself what he was doing at his desk when all his comrades and colleagues were enjoying an illegitimate and an undeserved holiday. For whom was Mr Bhattacharjee setting an example, if he was setting one at all? Was anyone around to learn from his example? Can a group of people completely brainwashed by a defunct and destructive ideology ever learn? These questions hover over Mr Bhattacharjees solitary presence in the Writers Buildings on the day the rest of the West Bengal cabinet had a siesta. It can be taken for granted that even though the chief minister was alone, he had no solitude. His own support to bandhs in the past, the ideology he still swears by and the attitude of his comrades and colleagues must have come out of the empty and dank corridors of Writers Buildings to haunt him. The ghost of irresponsible trade unionism nurtured by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) must have emerged out of the rickety woodwork to do a macabre dance on the corpse of Mr Bhattacharjees vision of an industrialized and rejuvenated West Bengal.																														The bandh on Tuesday made it very clear that Mr Bhattacharjee has not only failed to convince his party about the urgency of his vision, he has also failed to persuade his ministerial colleagues. Even the minister of industries, Mr Nirupam Sen, who should logically be leading the drive for industrialization, stayed at home. The finance minister, Mr Asim Dasgupta, said that he was in complete sympathy with the strike against the Centres economic policies. Since there is very little difference between Mr Bhattacharjees economic policy and that of the Centre, will it be unfair to assume that Mr Dasgupta is opposed to the policies of his own chief minister? His absence from work on Tuesday also suggests this conclusion. Mr Bhattacharjee is obviously not the captain of his own ship. The real enemies of his dream project are not outside but within his own team. This might well make Mr Bhattacharjee a very unhappy man but an individuals unhappiness cannot change the course of history.																														In fact, history takes no cognizance of an individuals sentiments. If Mr Bhattacharjee is unable to deliver on his promises, history will see him as a failure. The fact that his team members did not support him will count for nothing. This perhaps only aggravates the chief ministers loneliness. What is inexplicable  and even at times exasperating  is the stoic silence Mr Bhattacharjee maintains whenever he finds his party and his intentions pulling in two opposite directions. He maintained this silence when asked about his colleagues absence from work on Tuesday. Silence, he should remember, will not bring solitude, neither will it stall the devastation of West Bengal.

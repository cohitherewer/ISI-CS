The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Separate ways				 																																																				Sir  London society, it seems, will never cease to be shocked (Imran partnership ends, June 23). It knew of the separate lives of Jemima and Imran Khan for the past one-and-a-half years, her maladjusted life in Pakistan, her alleged affair with a British actor, and yet never suspected that the couple could call it quits? It couldnt have taken nine years for Jemima to realize that the salwar-kameez is not the last thing in the marriage to a Pakistani. Just as Imran couldnt have taken so long to understand that it isnt easy to make a Muslim wife of a billionaire Englishmans daughter. Only, London society didnt wish to listen.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,J. Sen, Calcutta
				 																																																				Be a sport				 																																																				Sir  Despite having more than a hundred years of football history, India has not yet achieved anything noteworthy in this sport. Latecomers in this field such as the United States of America, Japan and South Korea have achieved in two or three decades what India has not achieved in half-a-century. Unlike cricket, football is a global sport. It is also hugely popular in India. But improper management and bad marketing have hampered the game. The country may be divided into 8 zones, with at least two state-of-the-art football academies in each zone which could be in technical collaboration with reputed foreign clubs such as Manchester United and Real Madrid. Trainees should not be more than 9-years-old. 				 																																																				With a world cup berth in 2018 as our target, India should bring in more acclaimed foreign coaches from places like Qatar, Japan and South Korea. Foreign visits by footballers should be matched with invitations to top overseas football clubs to play in India. Good managerial skills and professionalism can help Vijay Mallya, vice-president of the All India Football Federation, and Indian soccer make up for the lost years. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajib Acharya, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  On the one hand, international football tournaments like Euro 2004 enthrall viewers with the quality of the games being played. On the other, they make us conscious of the kind of football being played here. Bad administration, lack of vision and proper marketing strategy, and politics have made India a nonentity in world football. Sports not only brings glory to the country but also generates commerce, as cricket has done in India.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dhrubojyoti Ray,

				 																																																				Hooghly				 																																																				Sir  Euro 2004 is probably the next best thing after the last world cup football to be witnessed by television viewers. The star player of Euro 2004 is the tall and lanky Danish striker, Jon Dahl Tomasson, who scored four goals for his team in the world cup, and has now single-handedly steered Denmark into the quarter-finals. He is a creative footballer and does not rely on team-mates to create chances for him to score. A more prolific scorer than the legendary Laudrup brothers, Tomasson is destined to reach great heights. Denmarks performance in this tournament depends a lot on Tomasson. Players like Pavel Nedved and Milan Baros, who are from the Czech Republic, and Wayne Rooney from England, will give Tomasson stiff competition for the top goal scorers position.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Small change				 																																																				Sir  Every year, April to July are the months which see students sitting for various entrance examinations. They spend enormous energy and huge amounts of money to be coached for taking these exams. Given the scenario, it should be made mandatory for all institutions to maintain absolute transparency in the declaration of results. The performance sheet of each candidate should either be sent by post or placed on the web, indicating clearly the marks scored. This will not only show students how they missed their chances in competitive exams like the Joint Entrance or that for the Indian Institutes of Technology, but also where they needed to improve. The use of HB pencils should be banned. Students ought to be directed to use permanent marker pens. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Rohini Karmakar, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 							 																						PURE TERROR																														Rebels usually end up destroying more than they can change. It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that Nepals Maoists have stuck to a course of mindless violence. If there were any doubts about the rebels real motive, the attack on the factory of Nepal Lever, a subsidiary of Hindustan Lever Limited, should dispel them. The Maoists had made their intentions clear when they forced nearly a dozen firms to close their units in Nepal. But the bomb attack on the factory of Nepal Lever also exposes their duplicity. It came within days of the rebels promising not to target any multinational company, barring American joint ventures, in view of the US governments support to Kathmandu in tackling the Maoists. It should now be clear that the rebels actually want to cripple both the political system and the economy of the Himalayan kingdom. It should also be apparent that the failure of the so-called economic blockade of the Kathmandu valley has made the Maoists more cynical and desperate. The failure of the blockade and the chorus of public protests against it were a measure of the peoples frustration and anger at the Maoists politics of violence and intimidation. Their ability to ambush security forces or bomb a factory is the stuff of terrorism and does not indicate any popular support.																														Obviously, the Maoists want to use violence as a ploy to force the government to peace negotiations. But the way they walked out of peace talks in the past puts a question mark on the genuineness of their desire for peace. Both the government and the political parties in Nepal have repeatedly underscored the need for the peace initiatives. But no peace would be either durable or constructive if it is forced at gun-point. The current political instability in Nepal may have abetted the Maoists devious design. There is an urgent need for Nepal to clean up its political mess. But it would be suicidal for the government to allow the rebels to exploit the situation. The attack on Nepal Lever also points once again to the role of the international community in helping a small nation defend itself against anarchists. As Nepals closest neighbour and its largest trading partner, India has a role that is qualitatively different from that of any other foreign power. For the Maoists in Nepal also threaten Indias business and security interests.

		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 							 																						WHAT THOSE NUMBERS FORETELL						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the assessment at the 27th session of the Committee on World Food Security, 2001				 	 Food insecurities																														In general, relatively low or declining prices of agricultural commodities during 2000 have been reflected in reductions in the value of the food imports of developing and low-income food deficit countries in US dollar terms, a trend that had started after a peak was reached in 1996. On the other hand, apart from a slight dip in 1996 because of the steep peak in the prices of most basic food commodities, the growth in the volume of food imports has been maintained more or less at the same rate throughout the Nineties. While these developments indicate an improved status of food security at the national level for these groups of countries in general, there are still many countries and many vulnerable groups within countries that continue to face severe food security problems. 																														In response to the request for additional information on access to food by the Committee at its last session, the gross national product per capita data has been supplemented with data on growth of per capita GNP in constant prices as well as GNP per capita at purchasing power parity. Information on income distribution has been presented in the form of the Gini index and the prevalence of poverty measured at the national as well as the international level...																														It is widely acknowledged that there is a strong link between poverty and food insecurity since most of the poor are either undernourished or vulnerable. The twin objectives of the World Food Summit and the United Nations Millennium Summit of halving undernourishment and poverty by 2015 are highly interconnected and interdependent...It is appropriate to examine the progress in alleviating poverty in order to assess the situation with regard to peoples access to food generally...																														In sub-Saharan Africa per capita income is projected to rise by 1.3 per cent per year over the next decade, far better than the continued decline over the Nineties but only one-third the average rate of Asian economies. HIV/AIDS will have a substantial negative impact on a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa which has about 70 per cent of the 34.3 million existing cases worldwide...																														The first sentence of the Rome Declaration on World Food Security reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger. The reference to safe and nutritious food expands the concept of food security to include food safety, an issue that has gained in prominence since bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease began to spread in Europe. However, food safety issues cover a much broader range of risks than the one now attracting public attention. 																														A benchmark range for the ratio of end-of-season cereal stocks to global utilization has been used by the Food and Agricultural Organization...to alert the global community of potential and/or impending shortfalls in world cereal supply. The benchmark range has been set at 17-18 per cent. The ratio has only dipped below the threshold during two periods since its acceptance as a food security indicator  during the mid-Seventies the ratio fell to 14-15 per cent (1973-76), and in the mid-Nineties it fell to 14-16 per cent (1996-97). Although the measure only considers the physical availability of global supplies, during both of these periods it proved to be a good predictor of sharp rises in international cereal prices as well, indicating possible problems related to access to food of vulnerable population groups.

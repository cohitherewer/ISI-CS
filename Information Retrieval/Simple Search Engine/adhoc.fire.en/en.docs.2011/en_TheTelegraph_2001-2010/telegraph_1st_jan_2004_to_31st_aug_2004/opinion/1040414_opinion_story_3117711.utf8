The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Show business				 																																																				Sir  Why must Lakshmi Mittals buying a 70 million mansion in London attract comments like show-off (Mittal on top of mansion mount, April 12)? If you are worth 3.5 billion, you can well afford to spend so much. And especially if you have once been thwarted. But in Mittals case, the disapproval in the British society stems not so much from envy at an Indian making it so big in their country, but at the innate English dislike of ostentation. Take the Beckhams, who are as much the butt of criticism for their high living as Mittal is. Even the various American actors and musicians who have bought properties in the English countryside have to be careful not to throw their weight around. Britain is not like the United States of America where Bill Gatess humungous mansion on Lake Washington is more the object of tourist wonder than of envy. But the US operates on the credo: if you have it, flaunt it. Obviously, Britain is yet to be touched by this consumerist breeze.

				 																																																				Death in vain				 																																																				Sir  The inefficiency of those who run the West Bengal educational boards never ceases to amaze. It is a wonder how the state government manages to recruit such thoroughly unprofessional people to run its boards. Question papers are leaked, results are posted on the internet before schedule; there are spelling mistakes in the language paper itself. The Biswajit Dhara case is quite in keeping with this record of serial bungling (Lost and found answer paper takes a toll of ten lives, April 7). Given all this, and the fact that too much is expected of students, it is not surprising that the incidence of suicide among students of the state boards is higher than that among students of professionally-run boards like the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education or the Central Board of Secondary Education. Naturally, more and more parents are opting for the central boards, even those who can scarcely afford it. 				 																																																				But our state government continues to waste tax payers money on these teachers who are insensitive and inefficient, and have no qualms about raiding the house of a student at ungodly hours to retrieve lost answer-scripts. The board should be made to pay a hefty compensation to the next of kin of those who died as a result of its idiocy. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

				 																																																				Sir  It is appalling callousness on the part of the invigilators and examiners that set off the chain of events that resulted in the death of Biswajit Dharas father and nine others. Why did the invigilators jump to the conclusion that Dhara had made away with the answer script, without first properly investigating the test centre itself? And now the compensation for this error being offered to Dhara is a choice of examination centre by the board. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shatarupa Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sadly, Mukti Dhara died without knowing that his sons missing answer paper had been found. The incident must not be swept under the carper and the teacher who accused Biswajit should be punished. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  A simple chart would have obviated the need to accuse Biswajit Dhara of dishonesty, without giving him a chance to defend himself. Every time a student deposits his answer script, an entry should be made in the chart. Besides what kind of invigilators and teachers would behave so badly with a young boy?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Death-wish over exam pressure(April 6), refers to some of the most terrible sufferings our students face at present, compelling many to take their own lives. The determination of the people in authority to improve the situation, as evident from the report, is commendable. But it is hard not to be sceptical, or even cynical. Three suicides in March 1998 of girls yet to reach their teens may be recalled. One was Sahana Pal, whose suicide note concluded with the heart-wrenching post script: sorry for my bad spelling. Hers became a sort of cause celebre at the time, and the government swung into action. A non-governmental organization I work for was invited to help out, and we did. But then all was forgotten. Nothing much has happened since, except that principals and higher-ups have become more strident in putting the blame on parental pressure. That conveniently lets the designers of the system off the hook. But not the children. In the years since Sahanas death, student suicides nation-wide have increased by more than 100 per cent, according to the current Crime Records Bureau statistics, and the worst city figures are, as then, in Calcutta. Even if they are right to accuse parents, what have the principals and bureaucrats done to help parents respond to the situation? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Brendan MacCarthaigh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The new trend of postponing examinations because papers are leaked is simply ridiculous. Some time ago, the question paper for the common admission test for management institutes was leaked and the test was held again later; and now, the medical entrance test will be held on April 17 for similar reasons. When the authorities discovered that the papers had been leaked, why didnt they set an alternative question paper and carry on with the examinations instead of wasting the time and energy of lakhs of candidates? Medicine has always been considered a very dignified profession. People have complete trust in doctors. But now a section of the profession is ready to risk the careers of 2.5 lakh students. Look at how most of those accused in the test paper leak are medical students themselves. The parents of candidates too seem to have no objection to pay upto Rs 8 lakh for the papers. The authorities should stop such leaks which seem to recur on the eve of nearly every examination. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suchi Arya, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Bengal Siksha fails Delhi test (April 8), about the failure of the West Bengal government to universalize elementary education prompted a comparison with the education system in Singapore, where we have been living for the last five years. In 2003, the government of Singapore made primary school education compulsory. To implement this order, the ministry of education checks up on each child born in 1996 (at the age of 6, all children are suppose to attend primary school), to ensure they have registered with a school. Those who have not are traced and forced to take admission. Parents who fail to register their children are liable to be punished. 				 																																																				It may be argued that Singapore is a small country, so implementing such an order is easy. But dont our state governments enjoy enough power? The problem here, along with the paucity of funds, is that we lack the will to change the educational structure.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chaitali Tarafdar, Singapore

		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 							 																						ODDS																													AND																													ENDS He swears he has always played by the book. And thats why businessman-turned-film producer Jagdish Sodha finds himself in a spot																														Jagdish Sodha will have you know that he is an honourable man. The problem  if you can call it that  is that he has a great many friends. But is knowing someone a crime? he asks somewhat plaintively. Kya galat kiya? 																														The answer to that is still coming in. What is clear, however, is that Sodhas fondness for people has drawn him into an ugly controversy. Last week, the International Cricket Council (ICC) imposed a five-year ban on former Kenyan cricket captain Maurice Odumbe after investigating claims that he had accepted money and hospitality from a known bookmaker. Odumbes now estranged wife, Maloney, identified Sodha as the bookie. Sodha is sick and tired of all this. Social circuit main hoon na main (I am a part of the society circuit, thats why), says Sodha, offering a simple explanation in his trademark Mumbaiyya Hindi for his friendship with Odumbe. 																														Odumbes former wife, of course, has another story to tell. She told the ICC investigators that she had been very unhappy with her husbands friendship with Sodha. The ICC investigations revealed that Odumbe had travelled to Mumbai four times in 2002, and that Sodha or his associates had paid for his stay at five-star hotels. The ICC also stated that Odumbe had confessed that he had received $28,000 to fix matches. The Odumbe ban has brought back the ghost of Indias links with match-fixing  a spectre that haunted cricket when the Hansie Cronje affair rocked the world in 2000. But Sodha sits pretty in Mumbai and denies all allegations of fixing matches.																														He refutes the ICCs claim that he works as a bookmaker and, in a telephonic interview from Gujarat, asserts that he is an honourable businessman with an interest in real estate, film production and distribution and the market. Being in the social circuit, I am friendly with big people from actors to cricketers, and judges to socialites, he says.																														Bollywood indeed knows him better as a distributor of the Salman Khan-starrer Bandhan, Sanjay Dutts Vaastav (produced, incidentally, by Chhota Rajans brother Deepak Nikhalje) and Godzilla. I have financed many films, but always kept my name under wraps, he says. It is not just films that he dabbles in. He claims to have purchased the rights of the controversial Marathi play, Mi Nathuram Godse Boltoy, based on the life of Mahatma Gandhis killer, and plans to film it. Sodha also approached adman Alyque Padamsee offering to produce his musical, Carmen. 																														He is much too busy, Sodha stresses, to be involved in bookmaking. If I am a bookmaker, why should I bet on a losing team like Kenya? he says. Kenya was never on his radar, the gregarious businessman holds, but Odumbe was a close friend. He met the Kenyan cricketer at a tournament eight years ago. I did pay Maurice Rs 25,000, but that was for his accommodation and to buy medicines for his brother, who is a heart patient. Maurice has even returned the money, says Sodha.																														Sodha holds that ICC investigators should probe him if they think he is a bookmaker. ICC guys visited Mumbai to check where Maurice stayed, but did not call me, he says. Its another matter that ICC jurisdiction is limited to questioning the conduct of players, leaving corruption investigations to local law enforcement agencies such as the Mumbai police. The crime branch of the Mumbai police did call Sodha for an inquiry, but let him go after recording a statement. 																														Though he has never been arrested or convicted, Sodha was among a group of 23 bookies picked by the police during a raid at the Bageecha restaurant in suburban Malad in January 2003. The bookies had apparently got together to work out a Rs 50 lakh hafta to pay the police to be allowed to operate freely during a major tournament. It was alleged that the bookies were let off on instructions from joint commissioner Shridhar Wagal  now in jail for his alleged links with Abdul Karim Telgi.																														Sodha doesnt deny that he was present there. I went to Bageecha for dinner with my family. I intervened and fought with the police when they dragged me to the police station unnecessarily, he says. This time round, Sodha plans to do more than just intervene and fight. He is busy plotting ways of getting even. I have asked Maurice to come to Mumbai with his lawyer and we will together take legal action. Sodha says. Famous last words?

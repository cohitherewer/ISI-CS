The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 							 																						...AND THE HAWK																														The decisions of a chief minister are often the best indicators of his or her attitude to governance. Ms Uma Bharti, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, has given a clear indication of her priorities. She took over as chief minister only after shaving her hair at Tirupati. This, of course, is a matter of her own personal religious beliefs. But she followed it up by declaring that the districts of Maheshwar and Amarkantak would be vegetarian. And characteristically, Ms Bharti has taken the widest possible definition of vegetarianism and has included eggs, onions, and garlic in the list of prohibited items. Alcohol is also part of the list. The reason for this ban is very simple: the two districts are supposed to be hallowed and sacred. Ms Bharti has obviously stretched her own religious convictions to extend to everybody. It cannot be argued even on the basis of Hindu tenets that sacredness is related to vegetarianism. Moreover, as chief minister, Ms Bharti has no rights and powers to impose her own dietary preferences on the people of two districts and on persons who choose to visit them. This is a kind of authoritarianism which is unpardonable and unacceptable in a democracy. The people of Madhya Pradesh elected the Bharatiya Janata Party to power because the party fought the polls on the issue of governance and not on a religious agenda. Ms Bharti has shown that religion is top priority for her as a chief minister. She did not even enter the residence of the chief minister until a temple had been constructed within the compound.																														Ms Bhartis actions demonstrate that in her beliefs and attitudes she is more akin to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad than with Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayees Bharatiya Janata Party. The latter sees itself as being accountable to the electorate and is committed to a programme of development and good governance. Religion has no part in this. The VHP, like Ms Bharti, equates politics with religious aggrandizement and attempts to impose its own beliefs on people. Ms Bharti is out of tune with the leadership of her own party. What is unfortunate is that Ms Bhartis advocacy of militant Hinduism through state policy comes at a time when orthodox elements within Muslim society are showing signs of giving up their more fundamentalist positions. Empathy and the healing touch are the need of the hour. Mr Vajpayee has set the example by his attempts to make the BJP speak for the whole of India rather than for Hindus alone. This has passed Ms Bharti by because she is a sannyasin burdened with worldly concerns. For her moksha lies in power.

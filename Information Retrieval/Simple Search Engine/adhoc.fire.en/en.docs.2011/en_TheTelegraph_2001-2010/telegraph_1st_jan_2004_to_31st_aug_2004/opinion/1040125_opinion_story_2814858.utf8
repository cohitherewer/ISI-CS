The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Pretty faces, ugly reality				 																																																				 Sir  Sahara India Pariwars advertisement congratulating Aishwarya Rai on being voted the most attractive woman by the Hello magazine could not possibly be missed even with eyes shut (Jan 22). This kind of full-page publicity, which also mentioned that Rai was Saharas council director, serves no purpose other than wasting precious newsprint. Who knows how many like Riyaz Ahmad (photograph on Jan 23), who risked his life and lost both arms to save another child from a train accident, have to make way for the Rais and the Jennifer Lopezes every day? When will we get our priorities right?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Diya Mehta, Calcutta
				 																Crime and the state				 																																																				Sir  Bibek Debroys article on crime and the criminal justice system in India provides useful insights (Crimes unnumbered, Jan 15). He points out correctly that police do not care about non-cognizable crimes unless they are specifically instructed to do so by the magistrates. Let alone being familiar with proper definitions of crimes, the average Indian has no chance of getting justice if he does not have connections in the right places. This can only point to a democracy in regress. If changes are being attempted in different spheres of our social, economic and political lives, why should the judicial system be left out? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Even though the Malimath committee and its recommendations were in the news sometime back, few have a clear idea of what they are all about. The committee threw light on the workings of the the police administration in India. India has always been a soft target for terrorist activities, primarily because of the incompetence of the police force. The loopholes in the judicial system are also taken advantage of by criminals. The police system has been reduced to something of a joke. Why is it that the police promptly come to the aid of the VIPs and not of the common people though the need of the latter may be far greater than that of the former? Also, committees like the one headed by Justice Malimath should not be formed if their recommendations are not going to be heeded. Such committees deserve autonomy rather than political control. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Animesh Sengupta, the former clerk-storekeeper-accountant at Islamia Sadar Hospital in Chinsurah who was wrongly accused of misappropriating Rs 8,000, had to wait for 18 long years to get justice (18 years to rip off thief tag, Jan 16). Suspending him without a proper preliminary investigation to establish a prima facie case against him was a gross irregularity. It surely cannot be the case, as has been stated now, that no handwriting experts were available at the time to verify if the signatures on the dubious cheques matched Senguptas. Further, denying him subsistence allowance during the period of suspension was in total violation of the rules governing suspension under the West Bengal Payment of Subsistence Allowance Act. It seems that his only lapse was volunteering to bring the matter to the notice of the hospital authorities. 				 																																																				On second thoughts, it is also quite intriguing how the police could arrest Sengupta merely on the basis of a first information report. The chargesheet against him was filed by the police after a delay of five years. During this period, he suffered enough agony and humiliation. He was denied even a semblance of justice, made to suffer ignominy and languish in jail for several years of his life for no fault of his. Both the hospital authorities and the police handled the case in the most callous manner. But why could the courts not deliver justice to him fast, a thing that would have taken only a few patient hearings? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Ram, Calcutta

				 																Name of the book				 																																																				Sir  Jeet Thayils book of poems, which has been briefly reviewed in the Paperback Pickings section on January 16, is called English and not English Poems.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

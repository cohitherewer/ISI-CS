The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 06, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Success has never tasted so sour. In Malda, the old Congress war-horse, Ghani Khan Chowdhury, has been seething in anger ever since he found himself quietly left on the wayside while the younger Bangalis  Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi  triumphantly crept into Manmohan Singhs cabinet. Barkatda apparently believes that both Pranab and Priya have ganged up with the high-profile Ghulam Nabi Azad to deny him his rightful place under the sun. But why? Because Azad, seemingly, does not want competition as the seniormost representative of the minority community in the cabinet. Yet Barkatda is quite sure that without his aid, the minority votes would not have come the Congress way in Bengal. However, Ghani still has a mind sharp enough to realize that there is little use in carping in public, unlike a similarly dejected Suresh Kalmadi. Kalmadi, the newly elected MP from Pune, is supposed to have lamented in front of someone no less than Priyanka Gandhi Vadra herself how sad he feels to have been left out of the ministry after having been in the parliament for 23 years. For Priyanka, mum was the word. Naturally. 				 																																																																														 While the results were still coming in on May 13, Sonia Gandhi is said to have invited the CPI gen-sec, AB Bardhan, over to 10 Janpath for discussions. As the two were talking, in walked Rahul Gandhi, who had just returned from Amethi flush with success. Seeing his mother busy, he turned to go but Sonia called him back and introduced him to Bardhan. This is my son, Rahul, she said. Bardhan hurriedly put in, Madam, does he need an introduction? We all know he is Rahul Gandhi. Sonia shot back immediately, No, he needs to be introduced. He has come to the Lok Sabha and should know everyone. You are a senior leader. He needs to know you. We had it coming, didnt we?				 																																																																														 Jagdish Tytler, minister for NRIs, must be suffering from a terrible inferiority complex. For each time someone greets him, he apparently launches on an unprovoked lecture on the importance of his ministerial charge. Tytler would apparently have his listeners believe that the prime minister himself had told him that his was the ministry of investment (given the ministry of disinvestment had been shut down) as it was his task to make NRIs invest here. If that failed to convince, Tytler had further proof  the office space he had landed in South Block, which houses the office of the PM himself. Got it?				 																																																																														 Talking about office space, a heavyweight battle just ended between Mani Shankar Aiyar and the redoubtable Renuka Chowdhury about a particular room in Parliament House. Mani, holding a cabinet rank, had been allotted this room, while Renuka, a minister of state, was given another in the poorly-lit third floor. The lady apparently did not waste time to occupy the petroleum ministers room. Poor Mani sought an appointment with Ghulam Nabi Azad, who has a say in these matters. But while Mani was waiting to call on Azad on the appointed hour, Renuka stomped in before him. When Mani was called inside, the junior minister was already sitting beside Azad, a smile writ large on her face. Et tu, Azad?				 																																																																														 About room in the upper house. Indias former ambassador to Washington, Lalit Mansingh, is still a strong contender for the lone seat the BJP is set to win from Orissa in the forthcoming biennial election to the Rajya Sabha. The one most certain to get the BJP nomination to the upper house is Brajesh Mishra, the former principal secretary to the former PM who is to be rewarded for his loyal service to AB Vajpayee. Another keen contender for a Rajya Sabha seat is Arun Shourie. Though the former disinvestment minister is considered to be an interloper by some sections of the BJP, Shourie has gained the confidence of the senior leaders of the party who are determined to secure for him another term in parliament. The former journalist, previously elected from Uttar Pradesh, may now be accommodated by Uma Bharti. Hasnt done too badly for himself, eh! Shourie that is?				 																																																																														 No biz like showbiz. For the stars in parliament, the biz continues. It was probably this realization that drew the stars together on the first day of parliament. As expected, Dharmendra was the cynosure of all eyes, and sat flanked by a galaxy of other Bollywood stars  Samajwadi MP, Raj Babbar, and BJP MP from Gurdaspur, Vinod Khanna. They were soon joined by the elegantly dressed Jaya Prada, Samajwadi MP from Rampur. When Sunil Dutt walked in, the stars all stood up to congratulate him as the minister of sports and youth affairs. The show goes on...				 																																																																														 While we congratulate ourselves for our political system that is heavily British (although thoroughly indigenized), those who are in charge of running that system now are already having second thoughts about how much they should thank the Brits. For one, Indias prime ministers have an insurmountable problem when it comes to the colonial design of their workplace. For example, there is no concept of attached bathrooms in the South Block. Which is perhaps why PMs like Rao, Vajpayee and Gujral preferred to use 7, Race Course Road as their residence-cum-office. Even when Sonia Gandhi was the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha from 1999-2004, she did not have the luxury of an attached washroom. Some quick-thinking Congresswallahs were fast to spot the opportunity for accosting madam without prior appointments. Since they lurked in the corridors to catch madams eye, the entire stretch to the loo had to be posted with SPG men. For the new PM, the discomfort is similar. Lets see if Manmohan Singh braces it all to grace the South Block chair occupied by Nehru and Indira.

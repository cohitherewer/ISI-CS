 							 - Pakistan has been treating the world to a soap opera ...while Abdul Qadeer Khan took the blame for selling Pakistans nuclear secrets. Imtiaz Gul in Islamabad and G.S. Mudur in New Delhi report on the scandal that reeks of a hasty cover-up				 	 Larger than life: Citizens in Lahore walk past a billboard showing Pervez Musharraf and the map of Pakistan. Scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan (below). AFP/Reuters																														For the second time in over three decades, Shamsunnisa found herself in agony, sundered from her son on the day of Id. The first time, 32 years ago, Major Islam ul Haq was a prisoner of war, a captive of the Indian army. Last week, Islam, principal staff officer to now discredited Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, was again in custody, held by the Pakistani army. And 76-year-old Shamsunnisa was in distress. 																														Weve been betrayed by our own, said Hussam ul Haq, Islams brother. This is how our national heroes are treated. Islam is among seven scientists and four other officials the Pakistani government has detained for leaking to Iran, Libya and North Korea, blueprints for technologies that could have helped those countries build nuclear weapons. 																														Khans confession notwithstanding, the families of the officials in custody say they are victims of a carefully-contrived farce designed to stop the buck from travelling to the generals. It was a climactic 40-minute meeting that brought the curtain down on the first act of an action-packed drama that began on November 27, when Mohammad Farooq, the first of 11 scientists still in detention, was picked up by intelligence sleuths. 																														The meeting between Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and Qadeer Khan, in house arrest since January 28, was followed by an admission of guilt by the man once known as the father of the Islamic bomb. And along with that, rather conveniently, came a mercy petition which the federal cabinet accepted. 																														On Thursday, the President pardoned Khan. But not everybody is convinced that its all over. We have yet to determine under what circumstances he confessed and sought a reprieve, says Pakistan Peoples Party chief Amin Faheem. The whole affair is suspect. 																														For many in and outside Pakistan, the episode reeks of a cover-up. For many questions that the arrests led to are still to be answered. Would Khan and his men have leaked nuclear secrets to friendly nations without the knowledge of the government and the army? And was the President in the know? 																														Pakistan has been treating the world to a soap opera, says Subash Kapila, an international relations and strategic affairs consultant with the South Asia Analysis Group (SAAG), an Indian non-government think-tank. Pakistans non-proliferation activities are the worlds worst-kept secret. 																														Analysts familiar with Pakistans secret deals say the accusations against Khan and the other nuclear scientists, Khans confession, as well as the public pardon are all part of an elaborate charade.																														Individuals could not have done this without a wink and a nod, says K. Santhanam, director of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis, New Delhi. Analysts say that more than anyone else in the Pakistani military hierarchy, Musharraf himself should be accountable at least for the deals with North Korea. The agreement for cooperation in missile technology was finalised during a visit by Benazir Bhutto to North Korea in the early 1990s. 																														Musharraf, who was then director general of military operations, was responsible for coordinating the project. Musharraf and Khan made many secret visits to North Korea on this project, together and independently, claims Bahukutumbi Raman, former additional secretary with Indias Research and Analysis Wing. In a paper published by SAAG, Raman says Pakistan initially paid for North Koreas missiles and related technology with dollars and wheat purchased from the US and Australia. 																														Through the 1990s, says Raman, the missile deal between Pakistan and North Korea was coordinated by the Joint Intelligence Miscellaneous, or JIM, a division of Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence (ISI).																														The supplementary agreement to help North Korea in developing a military nuclear capability was reached after Musharraf assumed power in 1999, Raman maintains.																														Pakistan began its nuclear quest in 1955 when the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) was set up, ostensibly to promote the peaceful use of atomic energy. Its first nuclear station  the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant  was installed with Canadian help after 17 years. The nuclear one-upmanship in the subcontinent flared up with Indias Pokhran blast  which prompted former prime minister Z.A. Bhutto to pledge that Pakistan would eat grass, if necessary, to develop its own nuclear weapons. He handed over the job to Khan, who had returned to Pakistan from Holland for research. 																														Work went on for some years at the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL), set up near Islamabad to establish a uranium enrichment plant. But the suspicion that Khans efforts were aimed at an Islamic nuclear bomb  a reference to the countrys close ties with other Muslim states  refused to die. 																														Now as events unfurl in Pakistan, its role in helping other nations in their nuclear ambitions can no longer be denied. Yet, experts stress that this was an operation that would have been planned right at the top. Security experts point out that the military and intelligence security system that was in place at the KRL would have precluded individual scientists from leaking technological secrets on their own.																														There is no chance that Khan and the others could have engaged in transfer of nuclear technology to foreign countries without the knowledge and approval of the government, says Frank J. Gaffney, president of the Centre for Security Policy, Washington DC. 																														The Pakistani military was responsible for the programme, it was an authoritarian regime, and the technology transfers were part and parcel of foreign policy, not pure commercial transactions, Gaffney told The Telegraph. The scientists at the KRL are kept under tight surveillance by the army and the intelligence agency both within Pakistan and during their visits abroad. 																														 For Pakistan, ironically, it was the very countries it was secretly feeding knowhow for nuclear weapons, that squealed. Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and thus has to open its doors to periodic inspections of its nuclear materials inventory. Satellite pictures may have alerted International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors about a site named Natanz, 100 km south of Tehran, where Iran was erecting a facility to make weapons-grade uranium. 																														Iran had initially denied any illegitimate nuclear research activity there. But last September, IAEA inspectors visited Natanz and detected samples of enriched uranium  a material that may be processed to make bombs. 																														In a letter couriered to the IAEA in October 2003, the head of Irans atomic energy organisation acknowledged that Iran had been trying to develop facilities for weapons-grade uranium for 18 years with foreign aid. The designs of machines called centrifuges were identical to those in Pakistan, which themselves are derived from designs that Khan had allegedly stolen from The Netherlands in the 1970s.																														In December, Libya sprung another surprise, coming clean on its own nuclear ambitions. Seif el Islam, the son of Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi, identified Pakistan as its leading nuclear supplier for which Libya had spent US $ 40 million, most of the money going to Pakistan. The disclosures by Iran and Libya forced Musharraf to acknowledge that individual scientists may have been leaking secrets on their own. 																														After pardoning Khan, Musharraf again claimed that no Pakistani government or army has ever been involved in nuclear proliferation. He asserted there is no evidence of the involvement of former army chiefs Aslam Beg and Jehangir Karamat in the illegal nuclear technology transfer. 																														Besides Khan and Islam, Pakistani investigators have also picked up 54-year-old mechanical engineer Mohammad Farooq, 66-year-old civil engineer Shijawal Malik, and others. 																														The families have ridiculed charges that scientists were leaking nuclear technologies for money. Were middle-class families. We dont have fancy cars, giant bungalows, and we dont holiday abroad, says a family member of one of the arrested scientists. Friends describe how Farooqs extended family of 17 members live together in a four-bedroom house. 																														Although the current controversy erupted after the recent disclosures by Iran and Libya, international strategic analysts have long known about Pakistans transfer of nuclear weapons technologies to these two countries and to North Korea. However, some non-proliferation experts believe the transfer of nuclear technology from Pakistan may have involved both state-sponsored as well as personal initiatives of scientists. The technology transfer to North Korea had to be state-approved because the payment was missiles, says Leonard Spector, deputy director of the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, Washington DC. 																														But the technology transfers to Iran and Libya are more ambiguous and may have involved some self-enrichment, Spector told The Telegraph. 																														Analysts say Washington would be aware of the role the government played in the transfers, but has for now decided to back Musharraf. The administration is quiet probably because it feels Musharraf is in a very difficult situation, and he is a valued ally in the war against terrorism, says Gaffney. 																														The US is attempting to arrive at a practical solution to a very difficult problem, adds Spector. The goal is to ensure that the Pakistani government no longer supports this kind of activity. But it is important to maintain stability in Pakistan. 																														The truth about the Pakistan establishments role in the transfers may never emerge, unless some of the arrested scientists decide to speak out. When he was allowed to meet with family members for a short while on Id last week, Shijawal Malik told an intelligence officer: Nothing Ive done will ever put my children to shame.

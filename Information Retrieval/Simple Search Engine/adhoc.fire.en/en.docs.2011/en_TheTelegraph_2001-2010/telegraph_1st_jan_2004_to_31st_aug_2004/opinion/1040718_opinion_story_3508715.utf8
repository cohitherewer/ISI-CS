The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, July 18, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 The dual power Centre may be working fine for hardcore Delhi politicians who know how to keep the fine balance, but not for the less privileged who come from the periphery  Rajasthan for example. The other day, a group of Congressmen came from this state to air their opinions on the Yamuna-Sutlej link canal issue. The delegation, headed by the Rajasthan state Congress chief, Narayan Singh, and Congress legislature party leader, BD Kalla, went straight to 10 Janpath, and was granted an audience with Sonia Gandhi pronto. As the leaders sipped their tea, their mobile phones (kept outside with the security because such contraptions are not allowed inside the house) kept on ringing incessantly. The caller was from the PMO and was desperate to remind the owners of the phones about their appointment with the prime minister. There was no response, however, and by the time the Rajasthan Congressmen came out of madams durbar, the time of the appointment had already passed. We do not know if they were given another chance to meet the PM, but we have good reason to believe that their voices will have reached the man concerned.				 																																																																														 One would have expected Sushma Swaraj to have some sense of gratitude for Sonia Gandhi, as, in the final count it was she who saved Swarajs well-oiled curls. But no. A few days back, Sushma was coming out of the chamber of the Rajya Sabha chairman, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, when she stumbled upon Sonia. Sushma hesitated, so did Sonia. And then the two ladies of the two main parties in parliament lowered their gaze and walked briskly past each other. There were no greetings, no pleasantries were exchanged. The MPs accompanying madam followed their political master, completely ignoring Swaraj. Talk about probity in public life!				 																																																																														 The orientation programme for first-time members of parliament saw Pranab Mukherjee giving a lecture on the passage of the budget and other financial bills. His pupils heard him with complete attention, till Jairam Ramesh fielded an innocent query, How do you move a cut motion on the Union budget? Mukherjee looked at Ramesh hard and replied icily, You do not move a cut motion against your own government. Got it, Pranabda.				 																																																																														 This probably needs a special mention. In the Lok Sabha, the bright new MP, Milind Deora, made a special mention, drawing attention to the need for preserving heritage buildings in Mumbai. As he went on and on to drive home the point, the BJPs Laxman Singh, more famous as Digvijay Singhs brother, grew restless. He soon interrupted Milind, pointing out that for a special mention, one did not need to read out a statement or deliver a speech. The young chap paused, but did not stop. The aggression was open and palpable. When the speech ended, the Congress MP, Shelja, thumped her desk hard and other UPA parliamentarians soon joined her in cheering the young man. Later outside, proud father Murli Deora was heard recouting to all those who cared to listen how the younger Deora had humbled a failed and frustrated politician like Laxman and what a great potential this single act of his son had revealed. Any buyers?				 																																																																														 The monkey menace in Lutyens Delhi has set off a kind of security alert. Parliament House and Rashtrapati Bhavan have adopted their own means to deal with the menace. The former has a chimpanzee to shoo off the simians and the owner of the chimpanzee now is on its permanent payroll. The Rashtrapati Bhavan has been less successful. Earlier, a chimpanzee had been killed by the monkeys, although the present recruit seems to be doing its job well. The PMO also has a pet  a well-fed feline. Now youll ask who put the cat there, among the piegons!				 																																																																														 The spotlight has suddenly shifted to the Arunachal Pradesh governor, VC Pande, who used to be a VP Singh favourite during the Bofors days. Pande is the author of several books and has written three during his stay at the Itanagar Raj Bhavan. It may be a mere coincidence that all three touch upon loneliness. Or may be not?				 																																																																														 Back to square one. Well, not entirely. But it is difficult to suppress the glee when one is told that in the railways-run canteen in parliament, kulhads are being bypassed when it comes to serving soup. The bone china is back. Sadly, not so for tea, which continues to be served in recycled earthenware.				 																																																																														 Our home minister, Shivraj Patil, is turning out to be quite an enigma. To his officers and attendants, he appears to be a fastidious and cranky old man, more obsessed about the crease on his shirt, than with matters of governance. And to his colleagues in parliament, he often seems to be a hopeless innocent, completely unaware of the ways of the world. When the opposition targetted Shibu Soren recently, accusing him of being an offender in the eyes of law, Patil is said to have openly wondered how such an allegation can be brought against a man who had just contested and won a Lok Sabha election. Taking a cue, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley turned the heat on, saying that even though the CrPC empowered ordinary civilians to turn over a proclaimed offender to the nearest police station, the home minister refused to do his duty by the law and turn in Soren. The house adjourned, Patil was reportedly heard making inquiries whether the CrPC actually armed civilians to help the authorities get hold of an offender. A little nave, should we say?

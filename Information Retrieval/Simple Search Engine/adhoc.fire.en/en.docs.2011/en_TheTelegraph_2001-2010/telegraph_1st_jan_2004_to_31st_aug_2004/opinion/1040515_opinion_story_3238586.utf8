The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 							 																						WHO																													DARES																													WINS  In an election full of surprises, this one took the cake. Earthiness swept away experience, star value won over credibility. But then Govinda, riding local trains and visiting temples, had left nothing to chance FIVE ACTS
 Jaya prada: Emerged as Samajwadi Partys heroine no. 1 defeating Begum Noor Bano in Rampur
 Dharmendra: Basantis Veeru proved too strong for everybody in Bikaner
 Raj Babbar: The Samajwadi Party politician retained his Agra seat
 Sunil Dutt: Dutt Senior survived another round of electoral battle
 Vinod Khanna: The action hero was one of the few ministers to survive the anti-NDA wave. The 14th Lok Sabha election was all about surprises. Smriti Malhotra Irani was surprised that Indias most wanted bahu was unwanted in Chandni Chowk. Yashwant Sinha was surprised that an area where he had spent Rs 1.5 lakh to build a road gave him a mere 61 votes. And, Mulayam Singh Yadav was surprised that nobody invited him to become deputy Prime Minister at the end of it all.																														But perhaps the mother of all electoral surprises came from an actor who once had the copyright over parrot green shirts and tight pink trousers. Govinda Ahuja triumphed over Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) Ram Naik by over 48,000 votes. In an all-white outfit, the brand-new Congress MP looks a little off-colour. Literally so. How did he pull it off? Jiske sar par bade-boodhon ka ashirvaad ho, uske saath achcha hi hota hai, he tells an enthusiastic television reporter. Coming from any other star, that would have sounded like a clich. Coming from the 40-year-old actor, who seldom does an interview without mentioning his mother, it sounds sincere.																														Therein lies the key to his electoral triumph: an ability to appear credible. Stardom is usually about selling style and charisma. Govinda peddles earnestness and sincerity. And few know the art of connecting with common folk better than him. In Virar, the suburb where he grew up and which is a part of his Mumbai North constituency, they are quick to reel out stories of his enduring earthiness. Like the character he played in Pardesi Babu.																														When the Congress announced his candidature to take on the near-invincible Naik, most believed the move reeked of desperation. For the past five elections, the constituency was the former Union petroleum ministers pocketborough. 																														And unlike many other politicians, he had nursed it fastidiously. On the other hand, Govinda was a political greenhorn, though his parents  father and small-time producer Ashok Ahuja and bhajan-singer mother Nirmala Devi  had been Congress workers. Everybody agreed he would pull in the crowds but most wondered if that would translate into votes.																														But having struggled in the early years of his acting career, Govinda is as street-smart as the small-time crook he played in Bade Miyan, Chhote Miyan. While canvassing for the polls, he added a human touch to his chutzpah. The actor travelled second-class on local suburban trains, touched as many feet as possible and spoke to elderly women in the manner a son talks to his mother. The women wiped his face with their aanchal and gave him good luck charms. And though he always turned up late for the election meetings, as he often does for shooting, they waited for him.																														When he spoke to them, it was obvious Govinda knew little about politics. Smart lines such as, Meri har kavita vastavikta hogi, mera har pravachan vachan hoga (every poem of mine would be a reality and every sermon a promise) reminded one more of a bad Hindi poetry teacher than a good politician with his ear close to the ground. But it did not matter. People felt he would work hard to provide them with pravas (clothes), aawas (houses), gyan (education) and swasthya (health), as he had promised. And when he refused to attack Naik because the latter was senior and elderly, it showed him up as a rare film star: someone with good values and a firm moral code.																														It was good strategy. Govinda left little to chance. He visited as many temples as possible seeking blessings from the priests. He managed to persuade Sonia Gandhi to address a rally in his constituency. And he unhesita-tingly took help from schoolmate Hitendra Thakur, brother of well-known gangster Bhai Thakur. Previously, Thakur was known to support Naik. Viewed in the backdrop of an overall anti-NDA wave, especially in the cosmopolitan cities, one can understand why Mumbai Congress chief Gurudas Kamats brainwave to field him worked so well.																														In a television studio later on Thursday evening, Govinda switched over to a light-coloured sherwani. Like a seasoned politician who is adept at tautology, he answered every question without committing himself to anything. 																														When quizzed on the issues he wanted to raise in Parliament, he said, I will bring up those which are important to the public. And he continued to do the Hindi poetry teacher bit. Jo logon ko shabd diye hain, unke liye fariyaad karoonga, he said. Translated into English it meant, I will try to fulfil my promises.																														The past two years have been bad for Govinda, the actor. Barring the rip-roaring Jodi No. 1, and to some extent Ek Aur Ek Gyarah, most of his films have collapsed at the box office. Maybe it was Sonia Gandhis vaani mein shudhta  purity in voice  which got him interested in politics. But it could also be interpreted as a desperate move of a fast-fading star.																														But right now the actor with impeccable comic timing and rapidly gyrating hips, is enjoying the fruits of a new vocation. When a reporter asked him to sum up the results of the Lok Sabha election, he responded in characteristic style, Sonia ji ki jai, jai, unke shatruon ko bye bye. A group of fans gathered around him burst into laughter. 																														For them, Govinda has metamorphosed from Hero No. 1 to Neta No. 1.

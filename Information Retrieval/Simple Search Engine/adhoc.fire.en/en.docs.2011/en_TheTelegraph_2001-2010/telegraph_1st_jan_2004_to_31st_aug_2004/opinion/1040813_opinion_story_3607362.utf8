The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 13, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Pressed for attention				 																																																				Sir  Just what are the media trying to do with Dhananjoy Chatterjee (Framed; cry in eleventh hour, Aug 12)? Readers of every city-based newspaper are being deluged with trivia about the condemned man  be it his lunch menu or how he performs Kali puja. Death, even for a criminal like Dhananjoy, is a solemn affair. The media have no right to sensationalize it. But then this complete insensitivity is also evidenced in advanced societies in the West. Witness how the media turns state executions in the United States of America into colourful affairs. Remember Timothy McVeigh? The endless discussions about whether Dhananjoy should live or die seem puerile. The law of the land has found Dhananjoy guilty. It should now ensure that the death penalty is carried out in a professional manner. Little attention should be paid to sermons preached by a virtuous fourth estate.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Shankar Pal, Calcutta
				 																Still burning				 																																																				Sir  Manipur has been in turmoil ever since the alleged rape and murder of Thangjam Manorama by the Assam Rifles. But the state and the Central governments have done precious little to assuage feelings. The Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, even went on to point to the absence of modern technology and the existence of a tribal system as explanation for the state being on the boil (Patil justifies Central stance on legislation, Aug, 8). Considering the gravity of the situation in Manipur, the home ministers remarks can only be termed as mindless. Is it tribal to protest against injustice or are all the disturbances in the region due to lack of modern technology? If the ethnic population in the North-east is largely tribal, how are the people to blame for it? If modern technology hasnt reached this part of India, shouldnt successive governments at the Centre be held responsible? If Patil is so concerned about technology, he should have created a corpus fund to fill the lacuna. 				 																																																				The pertinent question for the region is neither the army, nor the militants. It is the Centres perception of the North-east as a law and order problem. Which is why the insistence on the return of normalcy. The government needs to repeal the the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act immediately. If the government can think of repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act, why not the AFSPA? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N.D. Singh, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Dangerous drift (Aug 5), argues that the demand for revoking AFSPA is ill-advised and that civil rights groups suffer from a distorted view of the problem. But in a democracy, isnt the interest of the common people more important than the states political expediency? Manipuris have suffered heavily as a result of the infringement on their personal freedom. But what is more worrying is the widening gap between New Delhi and the North-east in general, and Manipur in particular. Manipuris have every right to feel that they are treated as third-rate citizens by the Indian authorities. The Delhi durbar wakes up to their distress calls only when tragedy strikes. Remember the uprising against the ceasefire extension in June 2001 when the Centre refused to condone the indiscriminate firing by security forces that cost 20 precious lives? The same attitude is prevalent today. The people of the North-east are as patriotic as those in the rest of India. How long can they suffer the ignominy of being ruled with outmoded political tactics reminiscent of the British rule? Perhaps, a few kind words and goodwill visits from our politicians will go a long way in healing the wounds.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N. Deban, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Patricia Mukhims What Ails the Region?(June 8), and Indictment of the People(Aug 3), were excellent articles. However, I do not agree with the view that the Meiteis nurture militant groups of their own as a challenge to those operating in the hills. Many Meiteis resent these revolutionaries-turned extortionists. Mukhim is right to note that politicians and bureaucrats enjoy a symbiotic relationship with the militants, and the Meitis seem quite happy with the existing arrangements.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Robin S. Ngangom, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir  The Central governments intransigence on the AFSPA issue explains why the North-east continues to burn. Instead of trying to understand why the whole of Manipur  from government employees to Marwari shopkeepers  has risen up against the AFPSA, the government continues to insist that the act is necessary. The media have also fallen in line with the government view tamely and argue that the army must have special powers. Unfortunately, the common people are never told what these special powers are, or more important, why the army should be placed above the law. Both the media and the government should realize that they owe some respect to Manipuris human rights. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shankar Gopalakrishnan, London 

				 																																																				Sir  The only way to solve the crisis in Manipur is to put an end to insurgency, either through talks or by force. It is common knowledge that there are certain liberated zones in the state where it is the militants writ that is allowed to run. Even the state machinery remains subservient to militants in such zones. Yet, in other parts, the state enjoys undiluted power over the people. How can there be dual centres of authority? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Laishram Tomba Sing, Imphal

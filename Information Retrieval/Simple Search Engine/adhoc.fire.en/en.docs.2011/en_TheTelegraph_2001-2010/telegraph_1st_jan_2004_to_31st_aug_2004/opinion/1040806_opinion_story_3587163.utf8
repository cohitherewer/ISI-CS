The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 06, 2004 							 																						NO BAIL-OUT																														Power in chains is always an exciting sight. Mr Manmohan Singhs ministry seems to be providing the electorate with a glut of such spectacles. After the hullabaloo over Mr Laloo Prasad Yadavs induction, there was the Shibu Soren affair. Mr Soren stepped down and is now in custody, because of his alleged role in a massacre. The latest in line is Mr K. Chandrasekhar Rao, leader of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti and a Union minister without portfolio. A non-bailable arrest warrant has been issued against him for contempt of court. Mr Rao had failed to appear in court on two days when the case against him for alleged misdemeanour in the distribution of tickets during the last elections was scheduled to be heard. The opposition is just lapping this up; its tainted ministers slogan has acquired extra vim. Even the prime minister is reported to have put off his projected ministry expansion. Although that may be a blessing in disguise, such reports suggest a degree of disturbance over the arrests and warrants that seem to be pouring into the ministry.																														This is not the first time that the judiciary has taken a stern stand against politicians. Such a stand had become visible from the time that the executive, irrespective of who sat on the treasury benches, was perceived to have abdicated its responsibilities. Yet the attitude can also be rather puzzling. Indian jurisprudence assumes a person innocent till he is proven guilty. No one can be penalized, either legally or professionally  or politically  till he is convicted of the charge. Non-bailable arrest warrants are usually meant for those whose alleged crime is heinous or dangerous, or who are likely to tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses. The world of politics accommodates a lot of cunning tricks and dirty games; framing cases against political enemies is common practice, if only to harass the target of ire. The real problem here is the unconscionably slow progress of any case in the courts. A quick resolution would have helped eliminate much of the drama associated with politicians being hauled up by the courts. People must be made to feel that the wheels of justice are grinding, precisely because they grind so slow. Hence the arrests and the non-bailable warrants. Nor do politicians help by doing vanishing acts or not appearing in court. An appearance of guilt is all that is needed to complete the drama.

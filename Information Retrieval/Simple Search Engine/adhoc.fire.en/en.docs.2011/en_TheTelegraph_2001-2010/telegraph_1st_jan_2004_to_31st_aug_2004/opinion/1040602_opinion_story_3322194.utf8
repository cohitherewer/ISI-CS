The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Step by step				 																																																				Sir  Arundhati Ray, quite clearly, believes in small things. That is probably why she has acquiesced to the audio rendition of her bestseller without much ado (God of Small Things hears prayers of radio, not screen, May 30). The script for the radio has been given the go, by the playwrights own admission, without consultation, and without as much as a look at the script by the writer. Does that indicate Rays disinterest in the production? Probably not, considering the fact that the radio version is bound to rekindle the possibly flagging interest in her book. There are other little things it may achieve. It may soon spawn another commercial venture involving the script of the radio play (just as Rays recently published script of In Which Annie Gives it Those Ones, a 1988 film produced for the television), and take her closer to the bigger step of allowing the screen version of the book. It could even cajole Ray into giving up small worries about a film crew rampaging Kerala.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Minimum impact				 																																																				Sir  The left argues that it is not against economic reforms so long as they are justified and have a human face. The Congress expressed the same belief while releasing the common minium programme. It has been argued that profitable public sector units will not be privatized, while loss-making PSUs will be allowed to restructure. In the same breath it is declared that economic reforms would continue as they have since 1991. 				 																																																				But the basic premise of economic reforms is that the government should not be in the business of doing business. It should utilize its time, money and energy to improve public life and infrastructure, and create conditions conducive to enterprise, so that the economy, unfettered by burdens and controls, can grow and flourish. It is immaterial whether the government is running profitable companies or not  so long as they are not in the strategic sectors (such as defence or atomic energy). Desisting from selling off profitable units is bad economics, because when these companies start making losses, or are faced with falling profits or rising competition, they will fetch far less money than they do today. Moreover, PSUs often make profits simply because they enjoy a monopoly or a near-monopoly. The cost of inefficiency or large overheads can then be forcibly passed on to consumers. 				 																																																				The new policies on disinvestment seem to be harking back to the days when nationalization was the mantra for progress and prosperity. Labour reforms are out, and the right to strike is upheld. PSUs cannot be disinvested without the employees (read unions) consent. This new phase of PSU-pampering has another dangerous fallout. With renewed vigour, the leftist unions have already started demanding a sixth pay commission which is not due till 2006. If PSU salaries go through the roof, it will only serve to create a new upper-middle class employed in PSUs and rewarded for their inefficiency at the cost of tax-payers money. Why should PSU employees become more equal than others? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The prime minister may be talking of liberalization with a human face, but the CMP clearly bears a Marxist face (Highest common happiness, May 28). The left imprint on the CMP is evident from the decision that the Industrial Disputes Act will not be touched, sick PSUs will be sold only after each case is evaluated and that there will be limited privatization. If there is a further increase of direct taxes to fund education, agricultural subsidies are raised, foreign direct investment is restricted only to infrastructure, wont it upset the reforms process? Manmohan Singh is being forced to bend to the wishes of others  which means more subsidies, more fiscal deficit, more inflation  and more states.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The graphic with the report, Highest common happiness, mentions incentives to be provided to investors, senior citizens and pensioners, but there is no mention of an income tax rebate or any other kind of incentive to people who solely depend on income from interests, particularly those who have been victims of voluntary retirement schemes of the previous government and did not opt for pension. There are several others who do not enjoy standard deduction facilities available to pensioners and therefore have a larger income tax liability				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The CMP is unlikely to affect the working of the present government. The United Progressive Alliance, like the National Democratic Alliance, has expressed its desire to reserve 33 per cent of seats for women in the legislature. But no time-frame has been fixed. With the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party opposing the bill, the Congress has indicated that it will go for a consensus. The left has ruled out the RJDs suggestion to have a sub-quota for women from the other backward classes and the minorities. Thus it is clear that women will never get their legitimate right for reservation in legislature. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The CMP can never redress the countrys problems, least of all give confidence to the market, which is why the sensitive index is continuing to fluctuate so wildly. Millions of ordinary people, especially senior citizens, had invested in the stock market with the hope of getting better returns. Their lives savings have vanished. Even in this nightmare, the newly elected ministers continue to haggle over a basic programme of functioning. 				 																																																				The remedy lies in arranging for pragmatic measures to ensure that consumers are able to pay for the facilities they need, and enforcing strict restrictions on avoidable expenses.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 							 																						SOME BLOTS ON THE PARTY Anuradha Kumar																					When N. Chandrababu Naidu decided to bring forward the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, which will now be held along with the Lok Sabha polls later this month, he clearly wanted to cash in on the sympathy following the Naxalite attempt on his life last October. But the subsequent reassertion of the Telengana issue promises to give the Telugu Desam Party-Bharatiya Janata Party combine a few worries. 																					The Telengana Rashtra Samiti, formed in 2001 by K. Chandrashekhar Rao, has made inroads in the region, capturing an impressive 18 per cent of votes in the 2001 local elections. As a result of its recent alliance with the Congress, the TRS will contest 42 assembly and 6 Lok Sabha seats in Telengana this time.																					With 16 Lok Sabha and 107 assembly seats, Telengana could well prove to be the decisive battleground in these elections. In 1999, the victory margins of the TDP-BJP alliance were lowest in the six seats it won in the Telengana region. The TDP won Warangal by 13,000 votes, Peddapally by nearly 15,800 votes, while the BJP won Karimnagar by over 19,000 votes and Medak by 22,000 votes. The Congress, which had no alliances, had trailed the TDP-BJP alliance by only 1.5 per cent of the vote share; even so, the TDP managed a two-thirds majority in the 294-member assembly.																					Rural discontent																					The TDP is vehemently opposed to a separate Telengana state and hopes to counter the demand by emphasizing the Naxal threat and reiterating its commitment to development. In its manifesto, the TDP promises Rs 60,000 crore to continue the welfare measures aimed at alleviating rural distress and ensuring agricultural development, largely in Telengana and interior Rayalseema  which have been afflicted by the states worst drought in 40 years. 																					The government is anxious to stave off protests by farmers afflicted by falling market prices and little government assistance. Years of poor rainfall have turned farmers in Telengana to alternative crops  chillies, turmeric and groundnut. But increased production this year has led to several cases of distress sales. Trouble erupted in Nizamabad district with the sudden fall in turmeric prices. A similar situation arose in Mahboobnagar over groundnut prices. The price of chillies has fallen to Rs 2,300 per quintal from Rs 3,200; trouble erupted in Guntur and Warangal when traders offered only Rs 1,400 per quintal. 																					Welfare state																					The government is negotiating with the Centre to announce a minimum support price for all agricultural commodities. The TDP manifesto also promises to set up a Rs 200 crore market stabilization fund to support farmers overcome falling crop prices.																					Naidu hopes his slew of one crore welfare sops will allay any adverse impacts of the drought and anti-incumbency factor on his governments electoral prospects. Since last March, farmers have been given sops worth Rs 700 crore. Naidus populist measures have added to the governments debt burden, which now stands at a whopping Rs 57,000 crore.																					The demand for Telengana comes at a time when farmers have been feeling the pinch of a prolonged drought, severe water shortage, mounting debts, erratic power supply and unemployment. It is this situation that the TRS has exploited. The distribution of water for irrigation in the region is also a sore issue. Though Telengana has 68.5 per cent of the catchment of the river Krishna, it is allocated only 37.5 per cent of the water. In contrast, other areas of Andhra Pradesh with 31.50 per cent of the area gets 62.50 per cent of the water supply.																					It remains to be seen how viable the demand for a separate Telengana remains after the polls. In the 1971 general elections, the chief minister at the time, M. Channa Reddy, had agitated for a Telengana state under the banner of the Telegana Praja Samiti. Following his election victory, however, he merged his party with the Congress and Telegana moved to the back-burner; only, it seems, to be rejuvenated 30 years later.

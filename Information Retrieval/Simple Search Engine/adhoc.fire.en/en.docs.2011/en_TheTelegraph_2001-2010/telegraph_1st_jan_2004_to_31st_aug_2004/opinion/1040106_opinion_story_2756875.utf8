The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004  ON A HOME RUN 
 - The NDA will probably move from strength to dominance in  2004  Mahesh Rangarajan The author is an independent political  analyst and researcher The new year, 2004, will witness  the fourth consecutive general elections in which Atal Bihari  Vajpayee will lead the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies  into battle. No former Indian prime minister, save for Indira,  the original Mrs Gandhi, has done so. Of course, there were  three Lok Sabha polls in quick succession between 1996 and  1999. But this will be a poll with a difference, in more  ways than one. The National Democratic Alliance  will have completed, or almost completed, a full term in  office. The unlikely gaggle of two dozen allies, sans  a few that have jumped ship, has held together. The  all-important foreign policy issue of the last polls was  Kargil, a short war that worked in the ruling coalitions  favour. This time, it appears the peace pipe will replace  the Kalashnikov and the diplomatic acumen of the prime minister  will be the leitmotif of the alliance.  First in war and first in peace  can go down well with the electorate. Foreign policy issues  have deep domestic implications. The NDA will stress the  holding of the first free, fair and open elections in Jammu  and Kashmir since 1977. The ceasefire on the border and  the start of a dialogue with the Hurriyat will showcase  the claim that the BJP in power is pragmatic and willing  to go further than previous regimes were, in the search  for peace.  Note also that this is the first  government to parley on Indian soil with the leading secessionist  rebels of them all, Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Swu of the  National Socialist Council of Nagalim. The gains via  cooperation with Bhutan, vis--vis the United  Liberation Front of Asom and other secessionist groups in  the North-east, also indicate a deep engagement with the  region. Yet it is domestic issues which  will dominate. Here, the contrast with the earlier poll  campaigns of the BJP is striking. Even in Uttar Pradesh  in early 2002, not to mention Gujarat, Hindutva was  very much in the forefront. True, these were states where  allies hardly mattered and the party could pull in the combined  forces of the sadhus, sants and mahants  who are so critical to its mobilization strategies. But  in late 2003, Hindutva, though never absent, was in the  background of the poll campaigns in the four Hindi-belt  states.  This will set the keynote for  2004. All parties, even ideologically aligned formations  like the BJP, do change tack with the wind. The appeal to  the Ram temple has waned with the times in north India as  caste-based identities have become far more deep-rooted,  especially so in the valley of the Ganges.  Over time, the realization that  allies will not play ball on the issue has also made the  chief proponent of the issue, L.K. Advani, speak the language  of compromise and negotiation, arbitration and settlement,  that he once associated with his allegedly pseudo-secular  opponents.  Attendant on this is the core  shift in the polity that is working in the partys favour.  Memories of the Gandhi family in office and of its undoubted  achievements hold little appeal for a whole new generation  of Indians. Indira Gandhi was assassinated almost two decades  ago; Rajiv Gandhi bowed out of office in late 1989. Even  P.V. Narasimha Raos premiership came to an end eight long  years ago. With time, there is a new polity  in place, in which the Congress seems to be the party of  yesteryear, unable to reinvent itself. It is not able to  speak out for the under classes strongly enough to woo them  away from smaller, rival formations. Nor is the vocal and  growing middle class enamoured of what the party old guard  stands for. This crisis of direction, indeed of identity,  of the Congress has been central to Vajpayees own strategy. Without in any way giving way  on its core ideology, the BJP has stolen the clothes of  its rivals. Where Indira Gandhi had Pokhran 1974, Vajpayee  has his May 1998. Kargil supplants the Bangladesh war in  national memory, a process aided by 24-hour television channels.  Nor have the non-Congress parties  been spared. The logic of federalism underlined the BJPs  opposition to the Congress demand to dismiss the Karunanidhi  ministry in Tamil Nadu in 1997. Most striking of all have  been the adoption of reservation and the expansion of the  list of other backward classes in 1999, which even brought  the Jats into the ambit of positive discrimination. The  same Arun Shourie who breathed fire against V.P. Singh in  1990 now is party to wider reservations.  On a positive note, and this is  for the polity as a whole, it will not be the rhetoric of  a Mandal or a mandir that will dominate the headlines.  Rather, the rulers will point to the achievements in governance,  especially the up-turn in the economy.  Yet it would be a repeat of the  historic weakness of the polity over 50 years were there  to be no serious, determined critique of Vajpayee on what  looks destined to be a home run for the NDA. The positional  and logistical factors all favour the NDA. Its alliances  have held, by and large, and there are replacements available  where some like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam are on the  way out. But the polity requires a check  for at least three reasons. When it suits the party, and  even Vajpayee can do little at such times, it can and will  play the Hindutva card. It did so in Gujarat and not so  long ago during the rath yatra of 1990. Such actions  will not only multiply insecurity for all, but they will  also undermine the rule of law, a development that will  have long-term negative consequences. The need for a strong  and principled opposition to such actions is more acute  than ever before. In the absence of such a rearguard action  from within the political class, one has to make do with  the brave and determined efforts of the judiciary, the press  and citizens groups. Second, the BJP, despite its federalist  posturing, is very much a centralizing force. The appeal  of Article 356, for instance, will grow once the party gets  ahead of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha which will happen  in August of the new year. How far the regional groups within  the NDA will be able to resist such trends will be worth  watching. Third and finally, there are a  variety of ways in which the retreat of the government from  regulatory functions has to be supplemented and accompanied  by an expansion in welfare and livelihood functions. It  is extraordinary that save for the president, A.P.J. Abdul  Kalam, no figure of note, at least not from the Congress,  has focussed on the decline in job generation and the increase  in joblessness. Only a strong opposition can keep the government  on its toes and push for strong public action. The year, 2004, will probably  see the NDA move from strength to dominance. How its complexion  will change will play a larger role in determining the future  course of action of the BJP. The latter in turn will be  on test to see whether its moderation is a posture or a  genuine change of heart.

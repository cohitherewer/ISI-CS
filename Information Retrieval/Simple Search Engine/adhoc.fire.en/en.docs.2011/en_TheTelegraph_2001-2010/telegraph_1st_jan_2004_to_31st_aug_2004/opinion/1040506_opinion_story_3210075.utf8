		 Thursday, May 06, 2004  The indicators of security
						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the assessment at the 27th session of the Committee on World Food Security, 2001				 	 Taking stock																														The relationship between the benchmark indicator and international cereal prices has not always been consistent...when the ratio was substantially above the 17-18 per cent minimum range, international cereal prices rose and remained high. This was despite the availability of adequate physical supplies...However, international cereal prices continue to be depressed...if not falling in some cases.																														A substantial revision was made recently to the historical cereal balances for China. The revision resulted in a significant increase in the estimates for cereal stocks in China and hence the world estimate of cereal stocks. This development further undermined the relevance of the benchmark ratio as an indicator of the status of global food security. 																														While the continued use of a benchmark ratio would be possible by re-calculating a new minimum safe range using the revised Chinese cereal stocks and the original methodology, this may not be appropriate. The Secretariat has realized that the original methodology did not directly incorporate features that are more relevant to current market indicators, such as prices, which have a direct bearing on issues related to the access to food. 																														In light of the changes in the international cereals market reflecting increasing transparency in policies and market signals, improved communications and more efficient movement of commodities in international trade, the Secretariat recognizes the need to develop more market-sensitive indicators to assess the changes in the factors that affect global food security. 																														In the meantime, there are other indicators of global food security that are still relevant for assessing the situation... The Committee may be assured that the Secretariat is continuing to monitor the situation and to take the necessary steps to identify and develop alternative measures of global food security.																														Selection and monitoring of core indicators: For purposes of cross-country comparison and to provide a manageable dataset for monitoring progress towards the goals established during the World Food Summit, the Committee on food security reviewed a core indicator list representing a pool of variables that are currently assumed to be most closely related to food security, nutrition and vulnerability.																														In order to present the pool of indicators from which the final selection was to be made, an extensive review was undertaken of the various indicator lists that are in use or under discussion for monitoring developmental goals in different international settings. They are organized according to the fifteen information domains or modules for the Key Indicators Database System under development by the global Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping Systems initiative...																														The different conceptual backgrounds of the indicator lists are reflected by varying priorities given to the information modules. Nevertheless, some indicators are suggested by both the United Nations-system lists and at least one of the FIVIMS-related lists which shows a high degree of inter-agency agreement.																														It may be noted that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development list does not currently include any indicators that refer explicitly to the WFS, although several of those included for monitoring other global developmental goals, particularly those of the social summit, are very relevant. 																														Following a series of very positive discussions between the Food and Agriculture Organization secretariat and that of the OECD, it appears likely that one or two goals explicitly related to the WFS will be added to the OECD list when it is next revised.

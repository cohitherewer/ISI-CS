The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 13, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																True to script				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjee should have been a script-writer instead of being a politician (Mamata mother attacked, May 11). She has the florid imagination and appetite for histrionics that would have brought her instant success in Tollygunge. A crowd of rowdies from the left parties enters Banerjees home when she is away, roughs up her 70-year-old mother and her two sisters-in-law, and leaves with impunity  the sequence of events is almost laughable. May one ask what Banerjees Trinamool Congress men were doing when all this was happening? After all, not too long ago they were more than capable of giving as good as they got. And what happened to the police who are supposed to guard the house of Banerjee, who is after all a member of the Union cabinet? If Banerjee is not making it up as she goes along, it must be said that all the excitement in the world is reserved for her. Perhaps it has gone to her head.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Ramani Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Conversion formula				 																																																				Sir  Nivedita Menon must be congratulated for having the guts to ask, Why is religious conversion essentially different in a democracy from other kinds of conversion? (All ye faithless, May 6). No one questions Zaheer Khans integrity when he shuns his home state, Maharashtra, and converts to playing domestic cricket for Baroda; or Kumar Sanus when he leaves Calcutta for Mumbai. Gone are the days of Sailen Manna or Chuni Goswami who remained faithful to Mohun Bagan throughout their career; footballers nowadays play for any club that pays a larger pay packet. Scores of doctors and engineers, who come out of government-subsidized colleges, forsake their motherland to make a quick buck in the West. Still they are regarded as the pride of India. But all hell breaks loose if one converts in the hope of greater economic and social benefits. 				 																																																				Religion is the holy cow of Indian society. Indians who boast of being citizens of the largest democracy in the world are yet to accept a basic tenet of democracy  the right of an individual to adopt any religion he chooses. Moreover, being a secular country, if conversions to Islam turn India into a Muslim-majority nation (which is next to impossible), no one has the right to object. India is not of the Hindus alone, so the state should ensure economic and social security for all those adopting another faith. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Nivedita Menon asks  So what if Hindus become a minority one hundred years from now? Nothing, except that the country will then be an Islamic state where non-Muslims are persecuted. In no Muslim-dominated country, except Turkey, is secularism practised. The former Soviet Unions boast of being a paragon of communal unity fell flat when all the Muslim-dominated states proclaimed their Islamic identity. Even in India, it was in the Muslim-majority states that the demand for Partition rose. On the other hand, look at Nepal, a Hindu country, where Muslims are not persecuted. India has been secular until now. But for how long, given the way the so-called secularists have been hammering into the minds of Muslims the fact that they have a separate identity?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Religious conversions are different from other kinds of conversions because religion goes back generations. Though most conversions take place in the hope of economic benefit many a Hindu who has converted finds that he is not considered at par with his co-religionists. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Conversions usually take place among tribals and Dalits, most of whom are victims of the taboos created in the name of religion or have been bribed with women, liquor or food. These conversions have been rightly described as fraudulent. Conversion is, thus, not about religion but about society. Conversions may fetch the under-privileged short-term benefits, but they do not improve their lot. 				 																																																				In the course of time, some distortions creep into a religion; for example, sati in Hinduism. Not removing these damages the religion. As such, there should be reforms in a religion from time to time. Or else its growth will be stunted. Conversions are a crude way to escape from social problems. Instead, the religion itself must have a repair mechanism so that all those who are at the receiving end will be benefited.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Nivedita Menons observations on conversion are not in sync with the basic tenets of Hindu philosophy. The Bhagvad Gita states in unambiguous terms that its better to follow ones sva-dharmah even though one may perform it imperfectly than to accept anothers dharma and perform it perfectly. Had she bothered to probe the intent of Islamic and Christian missionaries instead of confining herself to Hindutva-bashing, it would have served her purpose better. Mahatma Gandhi too opposed conversion. He wrote in the Harijan on January 30, 1937: Why should a Christian want to convert a Hindu to Christanity and vice versa? Why should he not be satisfied if the Hindu is a good or godly man? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

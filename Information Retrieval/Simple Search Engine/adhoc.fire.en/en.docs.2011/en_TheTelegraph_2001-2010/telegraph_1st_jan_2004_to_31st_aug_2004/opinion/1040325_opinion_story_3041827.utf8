		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 							 																						NOT TO BE MADE THE GUILTY PARTY 															- Document  Excerpts from Negative Choice: sex determination and sex selective abortion in India by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Question of choice																														Unlike the previous provision (prohibit advertisements that publicize technologies for sex determination orclinics where the tests are available by making any violationa punishable offence) that can be considered an important tool to limit the unethical promotion of SD, another clause that deems the user of these services as having committed a punishable offence was considered problematic. The user of the technology is a pregnant woman. Therefore, a provision such as the above could well result in women being tried and punished for seeking SD. 																														The law of course can be open to broader interpretation in a court of law. Nonetheless, it rests very much on the individual willingness of a judge or lawyer to do so based on his or her understanding of the socio-cultural motivations behind a womans action. This makes it evident that SD and sex selective abortion are less often the result of a womans independent decision or desire. There are provisions in the Act to protect women from being made out to be the guilty party. Butthe past use of laws in cases of rape, female infanticide, dowry do not present positive evidence nor promise too much hope in terms of safeguarding womens interest and well-being in the court of law...																														Key areas of critique have focussed on the fact that in adopting the route of registration of clinics and equipment, the law ends up sanctioning the private industry that has sprung up around provision of SD under the guise of pregnancy screening. Registration could well serve to legitimize these clinics as having a stamp of approval but it might not be effective in monitoring misuse or misconduct. Another critique has been the short-term view the law has taken with regard to reproductive technologies limiting it to include ultrasound, chorionic villious sampling and amniocentesis and all technologies for SD. However, even as this law was being debated new pre-implantation and preconception technologies were being introduced in the country by doctors trained abroad as well as manufacturers who considered India to be a good market to promote these technologies and harvest profits. As a result of this limited definition of the technologies that were included in the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994, Lingam (1998) points out that the law almost immediately appeared obsolete.																														The use of law to regulate RTs has often served to generate a debate with regard to the effective implementation of those laws. In India, in particular, laws have for long been accompanied by a culture of misuse resulting in both corruption and extortion. The discussion tends to get blurred between framing a good law and issues to do with its effective implementation which often results in the idea of any type of regulation by law being shot down rather than any effort being made to guarantee its effective implementation.																														It is worth noting that most countries have some set of guidelines with regard to the sale, provision and use of pre-natal diagnostic technologies that serve as a proxy to having a law on the same... The far-reaching potential of these new technologies and the consequences they bring to bear on issues of birth and procreation is being recognized and the need to discuss their appropriate use and regulation has indeed been the subject of national debates...Although the content of the discussions has at times been divergent from the Indian one, today there is a growing consensus that regardless of what the tools might be to regulate these technologies, regulation is essential.

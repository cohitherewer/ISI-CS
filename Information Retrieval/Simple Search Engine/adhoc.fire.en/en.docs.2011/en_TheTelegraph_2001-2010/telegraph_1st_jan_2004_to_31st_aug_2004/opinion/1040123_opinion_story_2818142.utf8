The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 23, 2004 							 																						FIRST IMPRESSIONS				 	 Easy on the eye																														When submitting a manuscript for publication you can increase your chances of making a favourable impression by ensuring two things. One, adhering to a fairly standard physical format. Two, ensuring that the book doesnt contain superfluous matter that only adds to bulk  and hence increases production costs  but nothing to its value. 																														Of course there are no rules regarding what a manuscript should look like or what is the extra baggage that one can do without. There are just guidelines based on common sense. The rule of thumb for formatting and presentation is easy readability, keeping in mind the linguistic standard of the potential reader. The last is very important because success often depends on whether readers can comprehend the text, on whether the vocabulary and sentence structures are within the range of their learning and experience. 																														The basic point first-time writers must bear in mind is that desk editors, who take the decision to publish or not, simply have no time. In a medium-sized publishing house that brings out about 30 new titles a year, five to ten unsolicited manuscripts turn up everyday. Most of these are doctoral theses  a straight no-no  but there are a few that need to be looked at. Even a cursory examination for language, style and relevance of the subject to the market would take a couple of hours; more, if it holds the promise of final acceptance. An experienced editor may only have to look at a few pages to know whether a book is worth spending more time on, but all the same it takes time. How much time can an editor, who also has the responsibility of overseeing works-in-progress or in the press, spare if the manuscript is not properly presented? 																														As for the second point, Isaac Babel once said, Your language becomes clear and strong not when you can no longer add but when you can no longer take away. This is easier said than done, especially for first timers who suffer from a kind of verbal diarrhoea where they want to put in everything they know or have experienced. More than half the unsolicited manuscripts are rejected because too much is written about too little.																														How should the novice go about cutting his manuscript to the bone? Obviously he cant do it on his own and must go to an experienced editor and pay him a fee for the necessary surgery. But experienced editors are almost as difficult to find in India as literary agents. But former book editors could be persuaded to take on the job. 																														What about the fee and time-frame for delivery of the edited manuscript? There are no fixed rules here. The fee would have to be suggested by the editor, not on a per-page basis, but the amount of time spent on straightening the manuscript. The time-frame, too, may be suggested by the editor.																														Authors tend to push editors to do a quick fix at the lowest possible rates. But this doesnt help; even if the publisher accepts the manuscript, the market would sooner or later reject it. In the long run, both publisher and author lose out  and also the reader who may have been conned into buying the book.						RAVI VYAS

		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 							 																						OF SONS AND DAUGHTERS 															- Document  Excerpts from Negative Choice: sex determination and sex selective abortion in India by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi Ravi Duggal, CEHAT, and Vimala Ramachandran, Health Watch, were joint coordinators of this national project The author of this paper is Rupsa Mallik				 	 One of each																														Intersecting sites of discrimination against female children: It is through relationships rather than roles and rules that the interaction of structural constraints, practice, and agency can be understood. (Palriwala; 1994:3).																														For women, family-based relationships are a source of support as well as sanction. However, this support often rests on conformity with predetermined norms. Childbearing, in particular the birth of sons, is one such norm and results in support as well as reduced disadvantages for women within the family network. The availability and use of diagnostic technologies for sex selection coupled with an increased desire for smaller families have created a new dynamism in family building strategies...In this section some of the factors that have served to create the context within which sex determination and sex selective abortion is legitimized and practised in India will be discussed.																														The emergence of the contemporary phenomenon of sex determination should not be viewed as a sudden consequence that has arisen as a result of the easy availability of diagnostic technologies. It should be seen as an additive strategy (Goodkind: 1996) within the existing continuum of discrimination and violence against women and female children that has resulted in excess female mortality and contributed to a decline in the sex ratio since the turn of the century.																														Son preference  the socio-cultural context: There are numerous accounts of the prevalence of strategies for discrimination against girl children. This has ranged from female infanticide...to care and food related deprivation... 																														Son preference in turn rests on norms surrounding kinship building that almost always favours sons over daughters. One such example is patrilineal descent where sons are necessary to continue the family name. Prescribed patrilocal norms (exogamy) in building marriage alliances for daughters create conditions within which son preference continues to persist. Principles of exogamy when strictly applied result in marrying the daughter outside her natal kin, clan or village. Sudha and Rajan argue (1999) that exogamous marriage makes women vulnerable by separating them from their natal families and at the same time placing them amongst marital families who are virtual strangers. In such situations of extreme vulnerability, one of the ways to gain acceptance and prove themselves as good daughters-in-laws is to give birth to sons.																														Mutharayappa et al, have described three major factors that result in sons being favoured over daughters in India: First, is the continued belief in their economic utility. Sons, it is believed, are more likely than daughters to provide family labour on the farm or in a family business, earn wages and support their parents during old age. In addition, they can attract a substantial dowry during marriage.																														The second factor that guides son preference is their socio-cultural utility as patrilineal descent and inheritance continues to be the predominant form of kinship building.																														The third and compelling factor can be linked to religion where sons have been accorded the unique privilege of performing various rituals and functions including the funeral rites for deceased parents.

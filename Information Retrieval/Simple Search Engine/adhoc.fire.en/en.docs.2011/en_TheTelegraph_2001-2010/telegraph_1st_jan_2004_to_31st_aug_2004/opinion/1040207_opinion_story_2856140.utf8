The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 07, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Putting it wrong				 																																																				Sir  Greg Normans birdie is likely to ruffle a few feathers (Stop women playing with men, says Norman, Feb 4). His comment proves that the psychology of male sportsmen remains unchanged since Billy Jean King battled Bobby Riggs. The likes of Norman forget that women have an equal right to participate, compete and enjoy all kinds of sport. Also, tennis and soccer have benefited immensely from female participation, which has brought in greater media coverage and money. Perhaps the misogynist Norman is afraid that he will share Riggss fate if more women start playing golf.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Kunal Mukherjee, Calcutta 
				 																Feathered foes				 																																																				Sir  After Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and mad cow disease, it is now the turn of bird flu to spread panic among people (Chick deaths in Bengal under test, Feb 4). No vaccine has yet been developed for bird flu. 				 																																																				The emergence of such contagious diseases may be attributed to the unregulated consumption of meat. Vegetarian food is the safest in this regard, and many Westerners have now started shunning meat. Even eggs, the consumption of which is now being encouraged through advertisements, may not be safe after the bird flu scare. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Ram, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The detection of bird flu among chicken in Karachi may affect the peace process and the India-Pakistan cricket matches starting next month (Delhi feverish after Karachi flu, Jan 28). The Pakistan authorities should see to it that the virus does not spread to other countries in the subcontinent. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Despite our advances in medicine, epidemics like bird flu prove that a lot remains to be done. India and other nations faced with this crisis, should curb their defence expenditure and invest in medical research to ensure that a remedy is found at the earliest.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arko Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  One shudders to think what will happen if the bird flu spreads to India. Given our appalling healthcare services, slow-moving government and huge population, people will probably drop dead like flies.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P.G. Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																Torching history 				 																																																				Sir  It is a sad commentary on contemporary Indian democracy that the vandals of the Sambhaji brigade, who destroyed the priceless archives of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune, continue to be unrepentant (Bonfire of cupboard of history, Jan 19). The tendency of most Indians to be silent over such cases reflects their lack of faith in the institutions of democracy. Our self-appointed culture police lack all credibility because they are imbued with narrow political interest. Unless we protest, and protest now, India will soon be ruled by intellectual dwarfs who will set our society on a path of mediocrity.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kaushik Chakrabarti, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is strange that both the left and right establishments should ban books ( A ban on reason, Jan 21). Political exigency, rather than reason seems to have guided the banning of James Laines Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India and Taslima Nasreens Dwikhandita. We are increasingly turning into a nation where people have very little patience. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  After the vandalism on the Bhandarkar Institute, the destruction of Chittrovanu Mazumdars paintings is another example of hooliganism (Vandals target Calcutta painter, Jan 30). Mazumdar is the victim of cultural terrorism which is firmly taking root in India. The vandals wield considerable clout and will most likely be untouched. But the government, which has cocooned itself in the complacent belief that India is shining, is oblivious to such dangers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

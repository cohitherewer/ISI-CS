The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 08, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																These ears are not for lending				 																																																				Sir  In India, elections are usually routine affairs with mud-slinging, floor-crossings, rigging and violence. People have stopped expecting any novelty in this five-yearly (often much more frequent than that) rigmarole. This time, however, we have already had at least one novelty  campaigning through SMS. Undoubtedly, this is an innovative way of reaching out to the urban middle classes, the section which is swinging dangerously between apathy and indifference towards the electoral process. But the annoyance index of this device is very high. A person, waiting for a call from his brother who is in hospital beside their critically ill mother will not be pleased to hear for one and a half minute what one Atal Bihari Vajpayee has to say about his term. Can Vajpayee help him in his hour of crisis? If not, then what right does he, or his spin-doctors, have to take up his airtime? No amount of such technological bullying can lure the voter to Vajpayees side.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,A.S. Ahmed, Calcutta
				 																Easy kill				 																																																				Sir  It is disgusting to learn about the rampant use of medical ultrasonic devices and abortions as an economical way to get rid of the female foetuses in West Bengal (Cheap and easy for girl-killers, March 5). Besides being a criminal offence, sex-determination also constitutes professional misconduct on the part of the involved physicians. Under Section 7.6 of the Code of Ethics and Regulations of the Medical Council of India, the medical licenses of these doctors are to be revoked. Unfortunately, no doctor has ever been punished for female foeticide even though charges against no less than 96 nursing homes and diagnostic centres in Calcutta alone bears testimony to the pervasive nature of this crime. 				 																																																				Although ultrasonography may be performed by a technician, licensed doctors have to be at the helm of such medical tests. Abortions can also be advised and performed only by the registered physicians. 				 																																																				The complete loss of trust between doctors and patients in recent years is the result of this depraved behaviour of a sizeable fraction of the medical community. The problem stems from the absolute lack of accountability of doctors in India not just in cases of illegal abortions, but also in cases of medical negligence. In the absence of stern punitive measures, there is no chance that these medical crimes will be checked. Unless a complete overhaul is done in the medical administration system, better survival record for the female foetus can never be guaranteed.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph deserves our thanks and congratulations for considering as its duty the defence of the girl child. Leave alone the illiterate and the disempowered, even literate husbands and in-laws blame women for giving birth to female children. Many of them are aware that it is the chromosome of the father which is responsible for determining the sex of a baby. 				 																																																				There is one other important aspect to consider. If we let this trend of female foeticide continue unchecked, we will be inviting disaster by tampering with the male-to-female ratio determined by nature. And, for those conservative souls who hate the idea of a girl-child, soon there will be no girl for their suitable boy to marry. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Being Forsaken by husband for giving birth to girl (March 3) is not a case in isolation. The killing of female foetuses is not new to Calcutta. The mushrooming of fly-by-night clinics in the city is evidence of the growth of this practice. The problem in Calcutta, which has seen a dramatic demographic shift in terms of the Bengali-non-Bengali population ratio, will only compound if something is not done to curb this evil trend soon. No matter how far we travel along the path of technological advancement, the myths surrounding the birth of a female child are yet to be busted. Things can change once women in our society are properly educated and empowered. But the perceptions of men need to change as well. As long as they think they are justified in deserting their wives if they give birth girls, the darkness will not lift from our society. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia, Assam

				 																																																				Sir  Every once in a while, we are forced to wake up to the fact that there is still a significant population in the world which suffers from a poverty of culture. Oftentimes, this poverty of culture can be alleviated through broad-scale education, but where education fails to engender moral values and responsibilities, the solution should be legal punishment. Desertion of a new-born girl and her mother by the father and his family amounts to torture and abuse. Surendra Pratap Sau should be charged with criminal offence, although the mother and daughter will be better off without him to vitiate the domestic atmosphere. But he should nonetheless be made to pay the hospital bills and support his wife and child financially. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debjani Chakrabarti, Mississippi, US

				 																																																				Sir  Philosophical and legal questions apart, the case of the forsaken girl-child and her mother raises a few other questions too. Why, for instance, is the hospital not releasing the mother and the child? Even if the husband, Surendra Pratap Sau, has signed the admission form, the hospital authorities should have no problems in releasing the mother and child if the womans parents are willing to pay. Is there a murkier story involving the hospital within the story as we know it?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  At the risk of sounding unforgivably parochial, I have to say that the influx of people from the cow-belt into Calcutta is responsible for the sharp decline in the sex-ratio of the city. While the sex-ratio in the rest of the state (934) is higher than the national average of 933, Calcutta lags behind with the miserable figure of 828. Had Calcuttas sex-ratio been anywhere near the national average, the ratio of the state would have improved by a significant margin. The high son-preference index of the BIMARU states has rubbed off on Calcutta, it seems. 				 																																																				The West Bengal government may not be able to check the infiltration of people from the Hindi heartland, it can at least see to it that the advances in medical science are not misused to perpetuate biases and prejudices against the female child. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why would a person in his right senses, not want to have a girl, in an age when girls are leaving them behind in many fields? All he needs to do is to have a chat with parents who have been ill-treated by their sons and daughters-in law.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rimli Dutta, Calcutta

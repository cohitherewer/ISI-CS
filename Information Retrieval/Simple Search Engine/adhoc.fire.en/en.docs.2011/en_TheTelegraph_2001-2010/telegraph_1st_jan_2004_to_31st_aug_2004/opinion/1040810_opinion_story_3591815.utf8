The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 							 																						JUNK THAT OLD HAT Malvika Singh																					When one reads in the newspapers that the politburo member, M.K. Pandhe, is busy suggesting that the CPI(M) will pull the government down if the Congress doesnt rethink its policy on FDI, one loses whatever respect one had for the left. This silly rhetoric sets the CPI(M) back in time, makes them appear stuck in the confused web of rigidity for the sake of it. If the left feels this way, then they should pull the rug, cease the chatter on how fascist the opposition is, stop talking about their fight against those who are destroying the social fabric of this country and revert to their isolation from the mainstream. No point carrying on this charade if the politburo believes so strongly that FDI in the service sector is anti-poor.																					One way the Congress, which Pandhe claims does not have a mandate (the left has 60-odd and the Congress has 140-odd), can come up trumps and do for the workers in the many public sector companies what the left has not been able to do for over fifty years, is by giving them sweat equity. The workers will have a stake, become productive and render the presently unproductive unions redundant. This is how the Congress can pull the rug from under the feet of the stale rhetoric that has been resurrected once again. 																					For the left to think that it alone is concerned about the lesser privileged is unacceptable. There are other ways of dealing with the issues that confront India, and an attempt should be made to address the problems differently from the way they have been in the past, since past attempts have failed miserably. Lets get out of the time warp and its tangled strands, where people continue to wallow in abject poverty, where basics such as electricity, water and roads have not been forthcoming even in left-run states. Junk the irrelevant rhetoric of the past and begin the process of delivering the goods. Get on with the area of infrastructure and leave the service-sector alone. The latter will generate more employment than any left, right or middle government can pull off.																					Soap-box rhetoric																					A plea to the left  stop threatening to drop the government. Thats old hat. It is predictable and regressive. Even China has seen through it all. Talk, hear, comprehend, adjust  that is the new way. Enough of this soap-box rhetoric. Lets give the people what they deserve and they definitely do not deserve futile rhetoric any more.																					Sadly, political play in India has remained rather juvenile. Everyone seems to be going for each others jugular often for the heck of it and at the cost of this country. If there are two arms that let India down, they are the administrators and politicians who, particularly over the last two decades, feathered their nests, encouraged and allowed the country to wallow in corruption, extortion, mismanagement, and all the horrors of an exploited society. Their posturing was laced with the right social rhetoric that was hollow and baseless. They were authoritarian within the democratic frame and ran roughshod over all. To get out of that avatar will be a humungous task that will require the fervour that comes with belief. They have to first believe and accept that they were responsible for the terrible stagnation as well as for the wholesale exploitation of a patient people. A new generation of Indians will not permit them to run amok anymore and hopefully will make politics and government accountable.																					If only there was some intelligent discourse, some sharing of ideas, and the taking on of challenges, we would be respected across the world. Today, the shenanigans in parliament, indulged in by our elected representatives, make us, the citizens, who pay for them to be there, squirm in shame. Their conduct is embarrassing. Their boycotts are foolish. Their rationales for bad behaviour are mindless. Live television coverage has exposed them once and for all.

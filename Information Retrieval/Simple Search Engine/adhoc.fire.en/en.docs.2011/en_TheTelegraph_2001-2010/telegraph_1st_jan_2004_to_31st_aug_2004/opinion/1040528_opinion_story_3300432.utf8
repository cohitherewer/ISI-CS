The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						WATER IN PERIL																														Still waters do indeed run deep in West Bengal, although in a strictly metaphorical sense. Even as groundwater levels in the state are beginning to touch a critical low, its environment department is backing a draft bill that could spell doom for Bengals waterbodies. The state seems bent on making it easier for promoters to fill up ponds, and even larger waterbodies, for indiscriminate construction. The disappearance of ponds from Calcutta and its outskirts, and even from the districts, is adding up to a major scandal, and to an imminent environmental crisis. It is ironic, indeed sinister, that the draft bill is being pushed by the environment department, since it indicates not only a complete lack of awareness of its ecological implications, but also a larger and deeper nexus of greed, corruption and complicity involving promoters, politicians and the administration. This bill, if passed, would allow the filling up of waterbodies up to 10 acres in area, whereas the existing laws protect waterbodies larger than five cottahs. Most reasonably-sized ponds would therefore slip through this new bill. It might also deprive individuals, NGOs, civic authorities, zilla parishads and panchayats of the right to litigate against the filling up of waterbodies for construction. The existing Central laws actually empower the state pollution control board to police and stall such development. But it is now the norm that the board never exercises its prerogatives. So the filling up of waterbodies continues unchecked, sustaining a market where the stakes run to crores of rupees. The entire Silver Springs episode last year, with Mr Jyoti Basu intervening to ensure the building of the complex in spite of the various legal and environmental bars to it, gives a sense of how wide this market casts its net.																														A corrupt and brazenly illegal lack of concern for waterbodies, together with the Calcutta mayors gleeful hacking down of the citys trees, makes evident the extent to which the environment, and an environmentally-conscious civil society, are in peril in West Bengal. It is also ironic that the fisheries department is trying to fight a losing battle to save the states waterbodies for its own ends, since the existing laws had actually been formulated and tightened up originally under pressure from that direction. Environmental activism in the city and in the state is therefore having to battle against ignorance, callousness, greed, clueless planning and sometimes even a criminal nexus  and all this in the name of development. The city must grow and there must be more housing. The lack of a larger and longer vision of this growth might just be the end of an ecologically-balanced Bengal with a proactive and participatory citizenry.

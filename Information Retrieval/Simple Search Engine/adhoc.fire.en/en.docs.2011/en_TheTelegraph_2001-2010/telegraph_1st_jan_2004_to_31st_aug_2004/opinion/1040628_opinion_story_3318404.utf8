The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 28, 2004 							 																						DONT WORRY, ITS JUST A JOKE Gay-bashing in commercial Hindi films strengthens existing discriminations against the sexual minorities, writes Uddalak Mukherjee Under CoverMasti , a film directed by Indra Kumar, is supposedly a light-hearted comedy about the nuances of marriage and adultery in urban India. In reality, the film  a poor adaptation of The Seven Year Itch  consists of slapstick humour, an inane plot and some unimaginative acting. But what makes this film different is its distorted representation and vilification of homosexuality. Films like Masti and Kal Ho Na Ho  which have the dubious honour of making gay bashing fashionable in Bollywood  mirror heterosexual Indias deeply entrenched phobia for same-sex love. For those who feel that sexuality, like some of the other crucial things in life, is a matter of individual choice and freedom, Masti and KHNHs perverted take on homosexuality is a disturbing development. 																														The thin plot revolves around the lives of three college friends, Amar, Meeth and Prem (played by Vivek Oberoi, Aftab Shivdasani and Ritesh Deshmukh) who are driven to despair by their obsessive wives. The trio decide to indulge in adultery  clean but straight fun. In their search for a woman, they get entangled in a plot that sets in motion a bizarre chain of events involving transvestite lovers, blackmail and even murder. Finally, they manage to untangle themselves from this hopeless situation with the help of (who else?) their pativraata wives. It is also learnt that these women had hatched the plot in the first place to punish their straying husbands. 																														So far so good. But what makes Masti disturbing, even sinister, is the character of a doctor (played by Satish Shah) who suspects Aftab and Ritesh to be a gay couple. His attempts to shun and ridicule the two are clearly intended to make up the lighter moments in the film. In one sequence, the portly Shah is seen hiding under a chair, hopelessly inadequate for his ample girth, to avoid the friendly overtures of Ritesh, who happens to be his colleague. 																														On another occasion, Shah mistakenly believes that Ritesh and Aftab are engaged in fellatio. In reality, poor Ritesh is only trying to fix Aftabs zip. The scenes, as expected, make the audience laugh; but at all the wrong things and for the wrong reasons. Shahs disgust merely reflects the larger physical, moral and cultural discrimination against homosexuals. 																														In India, the social identity of homosexual men and women is defined strictly in terms of their sexual preferences. To make matters worse, the perverse humour directed at homosexuals in films like Masti  their lives, mannerisms and desires  only goes to strengthen the collective prejudices against them. The question is: should films, which have immense potential to influence the public mind, have the right to debase and ridicule sexual minorities on questionable moral grounds?																														Lesbianism has not been allowed to slip through the morality net of commercial cinema either. Fire (1996), a film by Deepa Mehta, faced the ire of the Hindu right. Activists of the sangh parivar went on rampage all over the country, protesting against the depiction of a phenomenon which they felt was alien to the Indian cultural ethos. Many cinema-owners stopped screening the movie in fear of the arm-twisting tactics of the saffron brigade. Similarly, Karan Razdans Girlfriend has recently come under fire for daring to depict lesbianism. Funnily enough, the controversy in the case of Girlfriend is unnecessary and even puerile. For all its claims of being a daring and honest cinematic projection of a taboo, the film only aims at titillating the male audience. The act of two men making love puts off most straight Indian men. But the same lot wouldnt mind casting a furtive glance (or two) at the portrayal of sex between two women. 																														Cinematic distortion of homosexuality has wider and deeper ramifications. Moral policing and gender disparity are common in Indian society. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code confounds homosexuality with sodomy and deems it an act against the order of nature. As a result, homosexuality is a punishable offence under Indian law. This section also legitimizes the unjust harassment and discrimination of homosexuals in the hands of our legal custodians, most notably, the police. More disturbingly, it is now also being identified as a cause of HIV/AIDS  that is, a threat to sexual health. It is not uncommon to find facts that point to the irreversible connection between homosexuality and the rising number of AIDS cases in India. 																														Some non-governmental organizations fighting AIDS in India have identified homosexuality, and not the practice of unsafe sex, as one of the most important causes of the epidemic. The agony aunt columns in national dailies often advise those harbouring an attraction for members of the same sex to undergo counselling and therapy sessions to bring them back into the fold of normal life. 																														Such distortions, along with the repressive social conditions, alienate sexual minorities from the social mainstream. By putting homosexuality under the moral scanner, these distortions cleverly prevent homosexuality from entering the ambit of civil rights. They also prevent the creation of mistrust, prejudices and a frightful absence of dialogue with, and empathy for, homosexuals. 																														Consequently, very few people seem to understand or believe that homosexuals are entitled to enjoying social, political and cultural rights like heterosexual men and women. Homosexuality is not a medical or a moral issue. It is an issue of basic rights, played out on a cultural battleground that captures a wider set of discourses; private versus public, individual versus society, inclusion versus exclusion and so on.																														Commercial Indian cinema has largely restricted itself to the debasement of homosexuality. This however, is not the case in all film industries in the world. For example, in the United States of America, films have occasionally given a voice to the gay movement. Philadelphia (1994), a film directed by Jonathan Demme, tells the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks), a gay man and an AIDS patient, who is fired by his employers for being so. He hires Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) as a lawyer, the on-screen representation of Americas homophobic masses. As the film progresses, Miller confronts and overcomes his own parochial views and sides with Beckett. Philadelphia, in sharp contrast to Masti, casts an honest look at the experience of being a homosexual and the discrimination that surrounds this experience. 																														Significantly, the goings-on in the real world are refreshingly different from what we witness on screen. Despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them, many gay men and women are coming out of their cloistered existence. Perhaps the best example of this social visibility is the increase in the share of their public space  buying tickets at Calcuttas underground stations, sharing an ice cream at Victoria Memorial or just laughing at some private joke in a cafeteria. The political empowerment of hijras, and media interest in transvestite fashion shows in south India are some other examples of this. 																														However, the fact that homosexuality is peering out from tiny slits in an otherwise puritanical social cloak is the result of wider social and cultural processes  economic and social globalization, the sparse but enlightened activism of like-minded persons and organizations. Bollywoods demonization of homosexuality actually represents the failure of the desperate attempts to brush the issue under the carpet.																														In an ideal world, perhaps most Indians would undergo a transition similar to the one which Miller undergoes in Philadelphia. But in a society where very little is perfect, it is likely that the doctor in Masti would have the last laugh over Miller.

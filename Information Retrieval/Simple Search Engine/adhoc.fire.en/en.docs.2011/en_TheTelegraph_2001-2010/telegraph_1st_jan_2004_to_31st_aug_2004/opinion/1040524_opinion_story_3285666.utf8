The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 24, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The wiser half 				 																																																				Sir  Who would make a better finance minister than Manmohan Singh? His wife, Gursharan Kaur, of course (Wifes priority: Cooking gas, May 21). No, this is not being suggested in jest, and neither is it cynicism. The experts may reject Kaurs concerns over the rising prices of LPG cylinders and other items of everyday consumption, as those of a simple housewife who has no idea of the pressures of a bloated subsidy-bill, of rising global oil prices, and so on. Perhaps, these complicated economic matters escape the comprehension of simple home-makers like her. But dont these simple home-makers constitute half of the electorate and shouldnt their concerns be deemed important? After all, these are the bread and butter issues that effect everyone, even the prime minister who runs a household. In truth, if only finance ministers heeded the sage wisdom of their wives they would do a better job of balancing the books at the national level. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ritam Shahani, Calcutta
				 																In the left backyard				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees complete turnaround  from giving priority to information technology in the first three years of his tenure, he has now relegated it to last place on his agenda  shows that the hunger for power is the only thing driving the West Bengal government (No place for IT in CMs fav five May 19). Perhaps the recent electoral drubbing of N. Chandrababu Naidu and S.M. Krishna explains Bhattacharjees sudden change of direction. Rural development and agriculture have become his top priority now  perhaps with an eye on the voters in rural left Bengal. The dream of West Bengal taking its place alongside Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in IT has been abandoned. Even an upcoming industry like food processing is strangely missing from his list. Perhaps the chief minister has pushed IT to the end of his priority list because he does not think IT professionals are his vote-bank. The left in Bengal have been successful in driving out all industries from the state. And now IT businessmen, who had started to see the state as a new destination, are being shown the door. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sayan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The communists are also set to play an active role in the new Central government. But there is no reason to be apprehensive about this development. If we can do business with China, we can certainly do so with the left in India. On the positive side, this may be Bengals chance to come up as a major centre of knowledge-based industries in the coming years with the left in ascendance at the Centre. The combination of abundant power, communication facilities, intellectual talent and a responsive government could help attract fresh capital investment for the state.

				 																																																				Sir  The West Bengal government may announce big-ticket tie-ups in business process outsourcing, but it has done nothing to improve the communication infrastructure for smaller IT services companies (Double deals sealed with big tech duo, May 15). 				 																																																				I run a BPO service and an important means of communications for us is the direct internet access service from BSNL, a 128 kilo-bytes-per-second, 24-hour, always-on internet facility.				 																																																				Over the last two weeks there has been a sharp deterioration in the speed and continuity of this service. At one point, the speed of the connection was found to be 9 kbps, which is too poor to be of meaningful use. There has been no improvement despite several complaints, verbal and written. Worse, it appears that BSNL is unable to diagnose the problem, as various officials cite different reasons for it  a virus, excessive allotted connections compared to available bandwith, installation of new PPS software, and so on. BSNL officials now tell me that it could take 10-15 days to sort out the problem. You can imagine the inconvenience caused to me by such poor communication facilities.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees comment that the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund cannot dictate the policy of the country only shows his ignorance about modern economics (Statements on privatization trigger collapse, May 15). This is the era of the globalized economy, with the discrete economies of countries linked closely with one another. To the orthodox left ideologues, however, such economic integration between different countries is unfathomable. 				 																																																				They should look at Russia which has abandoned communism and joined the global economy to improve the lives of its citizens. The problem with the communists in West Bengal is that they have been in power for far too long, with no one to challenge their ideas. One can only hope that these perverse economic ideas by the Indian left do not find a place in the policies adopted by the next government. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

				 																																																				Sir  Politics is strange indeed. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) will be friends with the Congress at the Centre but enemies with it in the states it rules in  West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. In these states, the Congress is its main rival. The latter drew a blank in Kerala and Tripura, and in West Bengal, it managed just six seats. Under the circumstance, the CPI(M) support for the Congress-led Central government will lead to a piquant situation during later elections. Besides will the CPI(M) oppose economic measures proposed by the Congress if it feels they are against its tenets? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P.V. Seshadri, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The left has swept the state this time. While the Trinamool Congress has been decimated as a result of Mamata Banerjees rash decisions, the Congress has done well in the Murshidabad belt. Pranab Mukherjee did well to woo the poor voters in Jangipur, but the left was dealt the most severe blow by Adhir Chowdhury, the Murshidabad Congress chief, who has made a dent in the left base in the district ever since he bagged the zilla parishad in 2003. Except Ketugram, a Marxist bastion, he has put the Congress stamp on every corner of the constituency. But party-workers have to be as flexible as the leaders to strengthen the Congress further.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, Murshidabad

				 																																																				Sir  Mamata Banerjee must realize that people do not appreciate opposition to everything. If the government initiates a development project which may cause hardship to a section of the people, it has to be viewed in a larger context. Agitating at the drop of a hat suffers from the law of diminishing returns as the electorate demonstrated in their latest verdict.Yours faithfully, 
Sunil V. Khaitan, Calcutta

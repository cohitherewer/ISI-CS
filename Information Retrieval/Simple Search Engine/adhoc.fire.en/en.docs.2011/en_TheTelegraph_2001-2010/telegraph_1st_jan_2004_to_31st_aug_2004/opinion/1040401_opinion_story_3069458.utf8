The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 							 																						NEW TRICKS TO TRIP THEM Gouri Chatterjee																					It is just the stuff of April fool jokes: politicians accusing the press of not focusing on the real issues. It isnt.																					BJP poster boy Arun Jaitley did turn on Arnab Goswami of NDTV 24x7 last week for questioning the use of film stars by the political parties. If we release a statement on serious issues, he retorted, we will not be covered by the channels and will just get a small mention in the papers. But produce a star and the picture will be all over the media. Something he had also told Outlook magazine the week before. In other words, if you cant beat them, join them. 																					Its not just a BJP leader fulminating at the secular press. Echoes of Jaitley can be heard in arch-rival Kapil Sibal. Criticized for calling the deputy prime minister names like toady, Sibal defended himself on television by saying he had made substantive comments on governance in the same discussion, but the media had chosen to highlight only his personal attacks on L.K. Advani. In other words, the Congress is still an innocent in the big bad media world.																					Even editor-turned-minister Arun Shourie, who at least can claim to know what he is talking about, is severely critical of the ways of the media. Last week, the Central minister lambasted his former brethren for not portraying a correct picture of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees shining Bengal, just as they had failed to reflect properly the economic stagnation of Jyoti Basus Bengal. In other words, a stated communist-hater has learnt new tricks but not the media. To expect otherwise would be like expecting politicians to keep poll promises.																					City plus																					If exchange4media says so, it possibly is so. A highly reliable media website, exchange4media, reported this Tuesday that Times of India is coming out with a city newspaper in Mumbai soon, to be called the Bombay Times Plus. The Times bosses may have larger corporate interests in mind  such as teaching Mid-Day, the immediate rival of the new paper, a suitable lesson for refusing to sell out to the Times group  if and when it is launched. 																					Whatever it is, as a spin-off from its hugely successful Bombay Times, the Times Plus would also mark the next stage in a phenomenon the Times itself first tapped into when it launched Bombay Times in the mid-Nineties: the voracious demand for city news that papers had been quite unaware of. Globalization notwithstanding, or possibly because of it and the several means it offered to stay in touch with the world, the interest in local news, especially lifestyle news, became enormous. 																					Started, as most innovations in the media, to mop up advertisements from city slickers who couldnt afford the rates the full edition commanded, Bombay Times soon became an editorial triumph, spawned a new school of journalism called Page 3 journalism and fed a consumer boom that has India shining so brightly. All newspapers and even magazines have followed suit, in keeping with the new mantra, think global, act local. The Times Plus may spawn its own imitators one day.																					How can you tell?																					First the good news: a leading English newspaper is devoting an entire page to comics. And now the bad news: its the edit page thats been axed to make way for it. The newspaper bosses reason that a mere fraction of its readers goes through an editorial. And most of them are the serious types and, therefore, market-indifferent, if not downright unfriendly. Comic strips, on the other hand, attract all the money-spenders  right from youth and home-makers to business executives. The newspaper introduced the new page today, but not many seem to have noticed the change. When Dorothy Parker was informed that Calvin Coolidge had died, she famously said: But how could they tell! When Via Media pointed out to some readers that the newspaper had dropped its edit page to accommodate comics, the reaction was pretty similar  just how could one tell? Readers may write to gouriabpmail.com to tell us what they think of the change.

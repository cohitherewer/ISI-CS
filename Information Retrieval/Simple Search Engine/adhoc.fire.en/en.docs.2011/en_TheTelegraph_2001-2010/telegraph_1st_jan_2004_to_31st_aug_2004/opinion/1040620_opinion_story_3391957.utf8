				 																																																																														 Is there a larger Dalit design which the Congress is trying to put in place? Only days ago, it seemed certain that Mayavati was all set to adorn the chair of the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, allegedly at Congress-prompting. The Dalit queen had packed her bags and left Lucknow in a jiffy to file her nomination. The political game in UP may now change all that, but that is a different story. But even if there is no Dalit queen in Rajya Sabha, there might be a Dalit-Christian in the upper house after almost 33 years. JD Seelam, the 1984 batch IAS officer, who was in the personal staff of CK Jaffer Sharief, has been given the go by the party from Andhra Pradesh. In the political corridors of Delhi, however, it isnt the political design that is being talked about. In the present atmosphere of tyag and self-effacement, there is hardly any room for it, and most certainly in Seelams own mind. JD is said to have fallen on hard times after having quit the services to contest the Lok Sabha polls in which he failed to win. The succeeding years, according to the rumour mills, had seen him trying to get back to the IAS and even scrounge for postings in the staff of ministers. The association with 10, Janpath and its benevolent occupant, changed all that. Just the stuff myths are made of!				 																																																																														 Red in the face. That is how one could best describe Nilotpal Basu, one of the lefts most media-savvy members, as he found himself harassed by the SPG at the PMs house last week. Niloo had landed up at 7, Race Course to attend a dinner thrown by the PM, but Manmohans securitymen just would not let him enter. Matters got from bad to worse till the PMs house was informed about this strange man at the gate. As it turned out, it was the wrong gate that Basu was trying to enter. Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi both personally apologized for the mishap. Soon to follow them with profuse sympathies was none other than Arun Jaitley. But all of it met with cold response from Niloo, who later commented, I know what they want. They want to create a wedge between the communists and UPA. Forestalling the seventh blunder?				 																																																																														 Sonia Gandhis political secretary, Ahmad Patel, has a peculiar problem. As a man so close to the most powerful woman in the country, Ahmad is chased everywhere he goes, even to mosques. A faithful Muslim, Ahmad likes to offer his prayers in mosques, and the favour-seekers have got wind of it. Now, each Friday, he apparently seeks a different mosque to pray in to give the men a slip. And each week they manage to meet him  right outside the mosque. 				 																																																																														 Sonia Gandhi is fast becoming a professional hazard for scribes. This is how. At a meeting in Murshidabad during the elections, Sonia, in her inimical accent, said, Ab jaldi hi parivaartan ho jayega (Soon there will be a change of government). Bengali journalists, with their limited knowledge of Hindi, particularly Sonias, took it to be, Ab jaldi hi parivar tantra ho jayega (Soon there will be dynastic rule). They rushed to their desks to file their copy  there couldnt be a better story. After they finished, a few of them dropped in at the hotel where some of the visiting Delhi journalists were staying, and narrated the tale. Shocked, one of the Delhi scribes refused to buy it and asked a TV journo to replay the speech. The error was pointed out and the Bongs rushed back to rewrite their copies. 				 																																																																														 Arun Shourie is in  the BJPs list for Rajya Sabha nominees that is  and probably already out to get his detractors. There was much hoopla in the media, and possibly not without prompting, when his name did not figure in the list initially while those of hotelier Lalit Suri and the controversial Dilip Singh Judeo were in it. There were allegations of personal motives being behind the denial of nomination. But, obviously, there were larger issues, voiced in the senior party leaders meeting held a few days back. Sushma Swaraj had pointed out that Shourie had neither campaigned for the party, nor rooted for it on the telly, nor had he been active as a parliamentarian. Sushmas views had been endorsed by others who thought Shourie was too individualistic and self-absorbed. All that hasnt deterred Shourie, writing his nth book and getting ready for another term in the upper house. Ram help those who didnt help themselves.				 																																																																														 Shadow-boxing with 70 men isnt an inviting idea, but that is precisely what the PM seems to be doing. His circular, asking ministers to avoid foreign travel other than urgent official matters, has been brushed under the carpet. A colleague has left for the US on a free junket of an airliners inaugural flight. Another is abroad to attend an AIDS-meet, although he is not in charge of health. Another is leaving soon to attend the marriage of the daughter of a steel magnate, and several more will be going for religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. Flying high, arent they?				 																																																																														 Madams juggling continues. Now that she is through with the Rajya Sabha nomination, she has to get busy with the AICC and state committee reshuffle and appointment of governors. The the old war horses are already racing far ahead the younger breed, which means filling the gubernatorial posts wont be difficult for a party dominated by septuagenarians. The alterations in the states may prove more troublesome because the contenders are many. The frontrunners are however Srikant Jena in Orissa, Hanumatha Rao for Andhra, Adhir Chowdhury (you had it coming) for Bengal, Prabha Thakur for Rajasthan. The changes in both Kerala and Punjab, where the party lost miserably, may be even more acrimonious. But at the top of the list of concerns is filling up the slot in Uttar Pradesh, where Rahul Gandhi has begun a titanic battle. The fight may not be complete without an organizational overhaul. The names of Sanjay Singh, Rita Bahuguna and Salman Khurshid are doing the rounds. But wags claim there may be a major surprise in store. Will it be Rahul Gandhi?

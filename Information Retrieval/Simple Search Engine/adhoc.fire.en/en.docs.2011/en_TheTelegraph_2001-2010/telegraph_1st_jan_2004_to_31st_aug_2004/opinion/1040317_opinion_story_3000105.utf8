The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Starry, starry days				 																																																				Sir  Looks like it is going to be a battle between two avatars of Vishnu in the Mumbai northeast constituency  the Bharatiya Janata Partys Ram (as in Ram Naik) against the Congresss Govinda (Govinda to take on Ram, March 16). Govinda, (in)famous for his loud acting and worse dancing, and parliamentary duties  the two are about as similar as chalk and cheese. But Govinda may find that bashing up reel baddies and gambolling around trees are a cakewalk compared to winning elections. Perhaps he will woo the voters with the promise of opening a dance school that teaches his brand of pelvic gyrations? But it is futile to put all the blame on the poor star. Govinda is only doing what he can to ensure another profession, now that his films are not doing too well. The real culprits are the Congress and the BJP who are roping in popular screen idols to mask their lack of suitable candidates and ideas. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Gautam Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																Resident strangers				 																																																				Sir  The Jammu and Kashmir permanent resident (disqualification) bill  in the cold storage now, after Sonia Gandhis intervention  was an extremely regressive piece of legislation (Marry out, lose status in J amp;K, March 5). The silence of women members of the state assembly over this issue is more shameful.				 																																																				It is often argued that the demand for reforms should come from the Muslim women themselves. But how can the ordinary Muslim woman stand up and fight for her rights if educated and powerful women legislators do not do so? This is especially strange since even Islamic laws permit women to inherit property. The chief minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and his party have no business restricting a womans right to inherit just because she has married outside the state. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhis plea that the controversial bill seeking to rescind the resident status of women who marry outside Jammu and Kashmir be referred to a select committee, is a political gimmick at the time of elections (Sonia, Atal pad up for women, March 9). The supporters of the bill  the Peoples Democratic Party and National Panthers Party from the ruling coalition, and the National Conference from the opposition  have little sense on their side. The freedom to inherit property and hold jobs should be the birthright of every citizen, including women. Also, why must only Kashmiri women who have married outsiders be banned from selling and transferring property to their husbands? What about men who have married women from other states?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The bill at the centre of the controversy in Jammu and Kashmir may have a sinister fallout  further alienate the state from the mainstream. The PDP leader, Mehbooba Mufti, has admitted that the bill aims to preserve the identity of Jammu and Kashmir (Valley allies set for bill brawl, March 10). As formulated by the maharaja, Hari Singh, the bill was originally meant to stop the British from buying property in the state and intervening in its politics. Why is it being given a strange twist now, disregarding gender equality and nationalist sentiments? Besides, the PDPs haste and belligerence are unseemly. 				 																																																				Perhaps the re-introduction of the bill is a shrewd political gambit. Now that India and Pakistan are trying to resolve the Kashmir issue, the bill sends out a clear message that any solution must allow for some independence of Jammu and Kashmir. This is the reason PDPs rival, the National Conference, also supports the bill. The judiciary, the Centre and political parties should unite to foil this plan.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Jammu and Kashmir permanent resident (disqualification) bill violates the norms of the Constitution. It also goes against human rights, equality of sexes and the spirit of the United Nations charter. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
V.J. George, Safat, Kuwait

				 																																																				Sir  The controversy over the bill underlines the need to take a second look at Article 370. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  It is a shame that the PDP, which is headed by a woman, Mehbooba Mufti, supports the bill that seeks to deprive women of the state. Womens rights activists should ensure the bill is buried quickly. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																Like a rock?				 																																																				Sir  The article, Down to earth (March 3) in Careergraph, is an incomplete career guide for students who want to take up geology in college. It leaves out Jogomaya Devi college in Calcutta as well as the Durgapur and Ranigunj colleges in West Bengal. The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, has a big post-graduate department of geology and geophysics. There is also a geological studies unit at the Indian Statistical Institute. The article fails to mention that there are job opportunities for post-graduates in geology at the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. Also, every branch of geology has its specializations and application fields. The specialized fields of marine geology; palaeontology and micropalaeontology; mineralogy and igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic petrology, and sedimentology also needed special mention. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Asok Kumar Bhattacharya, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The questions under the head, Are you a nerd? (Careergraph, March 10), were provocative. Most of the criteria were peculiar and irritating. By this scale, everything from reading encyclopaedias and dictionaries, to knowing how to convert Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius degrees, or even wearing glasses makes one a nerd. Also, does a yes to even one question make a person a nerd? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dhruva Mukherjee, via email

				 																Utterly crass				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph has certainly broken all records in sensationalism, bad taste and inappropriateness in its choice of headline  Formula One driver who broke all records (March 15)  for Vilayat Khans obituary. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Supriya Chaudhuri, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 04, 2004 							 																						A PEEK INTO SHENZENNeha Sahay																					The press here has been carrying regular reports about the post-election drama in India. The fact that an Italian was elected Indias future leader left most Chinese open-mouthed.																					But, what left many non-Chinese here open-mouthed was the presence of more than 30 foreigners at the annual session of the Shenzen Municipal Peoples Congress  something like foreign diplomats and executives being invited by the municipal corporations of Mumbai or Bangalore to witness their proceedings.																					Shenzen is no ordinary Chinese city. Transformed 20 years ago by executive decision from a coastal fishing village to leader of the special economic zone for foreign investment, Shenzen is today Chinas reform showpiece, the mainlands rival to Hong Kong, one of the countrys four most modern cities. It boasts an economic growth rate of 17 per cent compared to the national rate of 9 per cent. It has almost $50 billion of foreign investment, and attracts foreigners from all over the world, including India.																					For the first time this year, Shenzen decided to invite foreign observers to the annual meeting of its municipal congress. Forty consuls, and 40 foreign movers and shakers such as principals of international schools and university teachers (native English speakers are in great demand all over China as English teachers) were invited. The observers were provided with a simultaneous English translation of the proceedings, and for the first time, an English translation of the mayors report. 																					Uncomfortable queries																					The annual session wasnt a formal affair. The 340 deputies discussed everything, from the previous years work report to future development plans for the city. Among the more contentious issues raised was the failure to clean the citys polluted rivers. The inquiry draft (which needs an official reply) on this issue also asked what would be done with officials who had failed to fulfil the commitments made at the congress held in 2000.																					A prestigious high priority tourism project to be managed by a firm, which already ran three major theme parks in Shenzen, became the focus of controversy. As many as 11 deputies raised an inquiry draft about the possible pollution to drinking water by the two golf courses included in the project. The courses were to be located within the rain catchment area of a reservoir which supplied drinking water to more than a million villagers. The very rationale of the courses was questioned. At 250 yuan per person per round, How many people will the two golf courses serve? asked a deputy. 																					Was this a little drama enacted to impress the (mainly Western) foreign observers that democracy was alive in China? Who knows? After all, the consuls didnt just attend the opening session, they sat through the 5-day meet and witnessed the mayors election by secret ballot on the final day. But the deputy who questioned the golf course project wasnt simply performing to script: the previous year, this man had successfully persuaded the government to drop the idea of building a potted landscape park on another Shenzen mountain.																					Selective welcome																					Some of these consuls had previously observed city lawmakers at work elsewhere in China. For Shenzen, this first-ever invitation to foreigners was aimed at accelerating the development of Shenzen as an international city. The standing committee of the congress stated that foreigners investing and working in Shenzen are eligible to attend as observers.																					This is a far cry from the time foreigners in China were officially and popularly reviled as foreign devils. But, for the people, some foreigners are still persona non grata. Japanese products are boycotted by some Chinese. Last year, a three-day orgy involving about 500 Chinese sex workers and 268 Japanese tourists, which coincided with the anniversary of the 1931 Japanese invasion of China, aroused so much anger that the two hotels where it was being held were temporarily closed down and the two hotel employees instrumental in arranging it sentenced to life imprisonment.

A woman prisoner of war shall not be awarded or sentenced to a punishment more severe, or treated, whilst undergoing punishment, more severely, than a woman member of the armed forces of the detaining power dealt with for a similar offence...																														Disciplinary sanctions: 																														Article 89: The disciplinary punishments applicable to prisoners of war are the following:																														(1) A fine which shall not exceed 50 per cent of the advances of pay and working pay which the prisoner of war would otherwise receive ...during a period of not more than thirty days. (2) Discontinuance of privileges granted over and above the treatment provided for by the present Convention. (3) Fatigue duties not exceeding two hours daily.

In no case shall disciplinary punishments be inhuman, brutal or dangerous to the health of prisoners of war.																														Article 90: The duration of any single punishment shall in no case exceed thirty days. Any period of confinement awaiting the hearing of a disciplinary offence or the award of disciplinary punishment shall be deducted from an award pronounced against a prisoner of war.																														The maximum of thirty days provided above may not be exceeded, even if the prisoner of war is answerable for several acts at the same time when he is awarded punishment...The period between the pronouncing of an award of disciplinary punishment and its execution shall not exceed one month.																														When a prisoner of war is awarded a further disciplinary punishment, a period of at least three days shall elapse between the execution of any two of the punishments, if the duration of one of these is ten days or more 																														Article 95: A prisoner of war accused of an offence against discipline shall not be kept in confinement pending the hearing unless a member of the armed forces of the detaining power would be so kept if he were accused of a similar offence, or if it is essential in the interests of camp order and discipline.																														Any period spent by a prisoner of war in confinement awaiting the disposal of an offence against discipline shall be reduced to an absolute minimum and shall not exceed fourteen days...

Without prejudice to the competence of courts and superior military authorities, disciplinary punishment may be ordered only by an officer having disciplinary powers...as camp commander, or by a responsible officer who replaces him or to whom he has delegated his disciplinary powers.																														In no case may such powers be delegated to a prisoner of war or be exercised by a prisoner of war. Before any disciplinary award is pronounced, the accused shall be given precise information regarding the offences of which he is accused, and given an opportunity of explaining his conduct and of defending himself. He shall be permitted, in particular, to call witnesses and to have recourse, if necessary, to the services of a qualified interpreter. The decision shall be announced to the accused prisoner of war and to the prisoners representative.

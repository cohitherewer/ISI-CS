		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 							 																						HALF THE BATTLE																														Winking at a crisis is not the best way of dealing with it. If the Orissa government has failed to weed out the Maoist menace in parts of the state, it is largely because of its unwillingness to face the reality. Orissa seemed to seek comfort in the false belief that its problem was not half as bad as that of Andhra Pradesh or Jharkhand. The daring attack on policemen by guerrillas of the outlawed Peoples War of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) in Koraput should break that illusion once and for all. The way the rebels struck in broad daylight in the heart of a town suggests two things. First, the PW activists in Orissa can be as desperate as their compatriots in neighbouring states. Also, their audacity could be in direct proportion to the inadequacy of Bhubaneswars policy. By failing to take on the rebels, the government has abdicated its responsibility to protect the rule of law. More ominously, the states complacence can only embolden the Maoists to spread to other parts of the state. 																														No one can object to Mr Naveen Patnaiks offer of peace-talks to the PW. He could draw on Andhra Pradeshs experience of negotiating peace with the same rebel outfit. More to the point, however, are the lessons Orissas chief minister could learn from Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh about fighting them. Once the government has shown its will and determination for the fight, it could talk peace from a position of strength. The topography of western Orissa and its nearness to the Maoist-infiltrated areas of other states make it absolutely necessary for all of them to draw up a common strategy to tackle the problem. Mr Patnaik, however, has a different battle at home. Koraput, Kalahandi and Keonjhar are still among the poorest districts in the country. The tribals who inhabit these arid places do not even get drinking water for most of the year. If the state passes these people by, Maoists or other marauders will certainly find them easy pickings. And reaching the fruits of governance to these people can wait no longer. Guns alone can win only half the battle.

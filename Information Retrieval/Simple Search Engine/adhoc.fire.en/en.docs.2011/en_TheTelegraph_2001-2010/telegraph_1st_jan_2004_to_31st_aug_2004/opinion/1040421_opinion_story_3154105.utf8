		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 							 																						OF LINES AND PLACES Shobita Punja																					Objects of art and monuments are significant to us for a variety of reasons. Some, like the Taj Mahal, are of aesthetic and historic value, others, like the temples of Bishnupur, are one of its kind in the world and need to be preserved for this value that is inherent in them. However, we need to make a case for some seemingly more obscure sites that are of value to us, as a country and in terms of our place in the world. 																					Up in Mussourie, in the new state of Uttaranchal, is a very interesting place called Park Estate. This is where the 78th meridian passes through our country, cutting the nation into two almost equal halves. The state government has put up a rather ugly, uninspiring platform just where the geographic imaginary line runs along the globe. You can stand on the 78th meridian and look out onto the foothills of the Himalayas to the north, or look southward and imagine the line taking you down to the tip of India. It is a wonderful experience for many. It has significance for a variety of reasons. First, it places us on the map of the world, it gives us a position and place. Every child, who is fortunate enough to reach class VI-VII in school, learns about longitudes and latitudes. Even fewer people are fortunate enough to know where they could stand on an imaginary line that cuts our little planet into sections, like an orange.																					Greenwich, a small town outside London through which the longitude passes, is hailed as a major tourist site. Through an arbitrary process for which the history of the world is famous, this was chosen as the meridian from which global standard time or Greenwich Mean Time is calculated. All the other longitudes are numbered after the one in Greenwich. Thousands of people flock to this longitude each year to have their photograph taken  to stand on an imaginary line that matters. School children are taken there to learn about navigation, the international time-line, and perhaps why England, at the height of its power, set the standard.																					Standing on time																					Indian standard time is far more complex. Because we are such a large country and the variation of time from sunrise in Arunachal Pradesh to sunrise in Dwarka in Gujarat is over 120 minutes, it was decided that there would be one standard time for India, calculated from the 82.5 degrees East line of longitude (which corresponds to an exact 5.30 hours difference from Greenwich) that runs through Allahabad, called our Standard Meridian. We could make Allahabad a major tourist attraction and get the people of India to visit the line and also set their watches, so that they can occasionally be on time. 																					The significance of the 78th meridian up in Mussourie is that a man called George Everest (pronounced Eve Rest), after whom the highest mountain in the world was finally named in 1865, bought the Park Estate in 1829-1835 and lived there in a house that now lies ruined. He was at that time the surveyor general of India, and with his team, had undertaken the arduous task of mapping India for the British empire, using the 78th meridian as his only constant.																					Is the name of Everest important? Is the highest mountain in the world of any significance? Do we have a case that every Indian child should learn about longitudes and latitudes and also about the Himalayas? Should we declare the site of Everests neglected cottage perched on a hillock overlooking the Doon valley and out towards the Himalayas a place of value and significance for India, and more correctly, for the whole world on the basis that it marks an imaginary line which makes a difference to all of us for working out who we are and where we are on this planet?

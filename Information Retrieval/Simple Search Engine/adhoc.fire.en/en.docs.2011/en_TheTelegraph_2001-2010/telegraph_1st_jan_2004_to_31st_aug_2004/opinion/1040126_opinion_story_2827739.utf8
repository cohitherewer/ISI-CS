		 Monday, January 26, 2004 							 																						DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS 															- Document Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 In disguise																														Studies in south Asia reveal that more women die from violence-induced causes than from maternal mortality (the region has one of the worlds highest rates of maternal mortality). The lives of millions of women in this region are defined by traditions that enforce submission to men and endorse unequal treatment. In some countries, for example, it is reported that young girls and women are sometimes killed by their relatives even if they are raped, as they are blamed for bringing dishonour to the family. Women from Bangladesh who have been in the sex trade also fear being killed by their families. Apart from traditional mindsets, another reason for such manifestations of violations is the lack of access that women have over familial assets, exacerbating socio-economic insecurities. Since young women and girls lack education, there are limited livelihood opportunities available to them, especially since the existing social support mechanism around them is inadequate. Such skewed socio-cultural realities and trends seriously challenge the right to development for many, besides infringing their basic human rights. Women living in these insecure conditions are vulnerable to trafficking and sexual violence and, therefore, to HIV. 																														Gender inequities and stereotypes in south Asia increase the vulnerability of young women, and to a lesser extent young men, to HIV and create an environment in which it is easy for HIV to spread. The taboos around the open discussion of sex and the social value that is placed on the ignorance of women and girls with regards to sexuality, safer sex and relationships create a situation in which women and girls engage in sexual relationships without the basic information, resources, confidence and skills needed to protect themselves from HIV.																														The strong pressure on women and men to conform to widely held gender ideals creates a situation in which it is often socially unacceptable for both women and men to seek information on sex that would empower them to protect themselves from HIV. For women, ignorance of sexual matters is valued as a sign of purity and innocence, while knowledge about sex is seen as a sign of immorality, making it difficult for them to seek information on sexual matters. Men, on the other hand, are expected to conform to a masculine ideal which values sexual knowledge and experience with a variety of partners, often making it hard for them to admit ignorance on sexual matters and seek information...																														In addition to the existing cultural value placed on sexual inexperience in women, it has been seen that the HIV epidemic can prompt older men to seek ever younger partners who they believe will be less sexually experienced and therefore less likely to be infected by HIV. This makes young women more vulnerable to being infected by older men with wider sexual experience.																														Sexuality and vulnerabilities; men who have sex with men: Sex between men is common within south Asia, as it is in other societies. However, such sex is generally not viewed as homosexual and those men engaging in it are rarely part of any gay community. Moreover, such activities are taboo and not widely talked about, and are also officially outlawed in most south Asian countries, often by old British colonial laws that have been left in place. Despite this, it appears that in many countries young men have their early sexual experiences with other young men and that many go on to continued bisexual activity in later life. For example, fifty per cent of male university students interviewed in Sri Lanka reported that their first sexual experience had been with another man. TO BE CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, February 08, 2004 							 																						THE GRAND MOGUL 				 	 Abdul Qadeer Khans lifestyle The Bomb wasnt the only passion  in Abdul Qadeer Khans life. He was also a successful hotelier,  a collector of vintage cars, and a magnanimous philanthrope.  He lived in a heavily-guarded palatial bungalow in Islamabad  with vintage cars from the early 1900s lining his porch.  Once when he planned a holiday, he imported a US$400,000  Teflon tent from Florida and he gifted BMWs and bungalows  to his daughters.																														His gift to his Dutch wife, Hendrina, was a hotel in Timbuctoo in Mali, which he named after her. A fellow-scientist and right-hand man of Khan reportedly told Pakistani investigators that he had overseen the transfer of carved wooden furniture from Islamabad to Timbuctoo in a Pakistani Air Force C 130 transport plane. And he spent Rs 50 million on a media campaign to promote himself as the father of the Pakistani nuclear bomb.																														Khan also had an altruistic streak. He donated hundreds of computers to private and government schools, supported schools and medical clinics in Islamabads suburbs, and funded institutes of higher education. 																														Khan once heard that the hall of the Faisal Mosque near his house was unbearably hot in the summers. A single phone call by Khan and Karachi businessmen installed an airconditioning plant in the giant mosque.																														Another phone call, and the Islamabad municipality agreed to foot the mosques additional electricity bill.						 BY IMTIAZ GUL

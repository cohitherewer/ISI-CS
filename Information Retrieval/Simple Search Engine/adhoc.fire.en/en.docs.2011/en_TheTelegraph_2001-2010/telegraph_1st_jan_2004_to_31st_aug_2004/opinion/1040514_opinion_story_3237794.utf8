		 Friday, May 14, 2004 							 																						WAITING ON THE MINISTERJourneys through Babudom amp; Netaland: Governance in India By T.S.R. Subramanian, 
Rupa, Rs 395The favourite topic of discussion in India today is the economy and its twin engines  industry and agriculture. Debates are, of course, an essential part of a democracy. But lately, aided by media inputs, the educated middle classes have developed an avid and vocal interest in public issues. 																														Social scientists in general take 1947 as the benchmark when mapping the progress of the nation. However the pillars of independent India  its institutions, establishments and social codes  are of far older vintage. Of these, the civil service, a legacy of the British, is an institution which can take credit for much of the state of affairs today.																														It is interesting to get an insiders view on the nations history starting from its post-independent infancy. T.S.R. Subramanian was in school when he heard Jawaharlal Nehrus historic Tryst with destiny speech. Now a seasoned bureaucrat  he was in Gujarat during the post-Godhra carnage  TSR can claim to have seen it all.																														He narrates his experiences in Journeys through Babudom amp; Netaland. Entering the civil services in 1961, TSR held several senior posts, retiring as the cabinet secretary to the government of India. TSRs insights are laced with humour, and the netas and babus in his book come across as simple, earthy people. The narrative focuses on individuals rather than on the system.																														For instance, would many know that the former prime minister, H.D. Deve Gowda, dug his nose and gargled with a mouthful of water at an international conference? For the author, such incidents reveal the reality of the rustic politician  Deve Gowda being its epitome.																														TSR gives many instances of the legendary corruption, nepotism and inefficiency of the Indian bureaucracy. But the question is, how is it that governance in India has not given way to complete anarchy, given the forces pulling it in different directions? TSR does not answer this question; he has the air of a self-righteous man in the midst a system accepted to be imperfect. But such an admission of impotence does not ring true or augur well.																														The book ends with four morals TSR has learnt in his long career in the civil services. Administration is conducted for the benefit of the administrators; in a conflict between private and public interest, the former shall prevail; the country belongs to the haves and the have-nots do not exist; and a public servants output and rewards are inversely related. 																														Does TSR believe that morals of this nature will help Indian intellectuals get their act together? Another problem with this book is TSRs verbosity and anxiety to tell a tale that people will sit up and take notice of. 						SRINIVASAN SUBRAMANIAN

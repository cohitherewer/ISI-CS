		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 							 																						ANTIQUE SPECTRE																														One of the fundamental principles of communism has now disappeared from the constitution of the worlds largest communist country. The parliament in China amended the constitution to protect private property. Public property and private property will henceforth be treated similarly. The amendment is a logical sequel to the economic reforms which have transformed China. These reforms are driven by the private sector and are based on the unshackling of individual initiative, choice and enterprise. The success of the private enterprise, if it has to be viable for a period of time, has to be predicated on the security of private property and private capital. The amendment thus completes a process that was begun when China opened up its economy and allowed private enterprise. The decision of the Chinese parliament underlines the conclusion, suggested by China-watchers for quite some time, that Chinese political leaders are driven by realism and not by ideology. They have been quick to recognize that the new economy of China, as it has taken shape, cannot survive unless the safety of private property is legally guaranteed. Instead of being ideologically obdurate, the Chinese communist party has decided to accept reality even if it means conceding crucial ideological ground.																														The most important question that remains after this legal recognition of private property in China is the very relevance of communism in the realm of praxis. Certain terms, once worshipped by the comrades  like revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat  have already disappeared from the communist lexicon. Now, the abolition of private property  a slogan that sent thrills of fear in the ranks of the propertied, and projected since the time of Karl Marx as the touchstone of communism  has made a quiet and dignified exit. Those who proclaim themselves as communists will now have to ponder what they exactly stand for in ideological and programmatic terms. Or they have the option of declaring the communist party of China to be revisionist and renegade. But these two terms are also seldom heard these days on the lips of comrades. Ideological irrelevance has significant effects on rhetoric and vocabulary.																														The changes taking place in China are symptomatic of a global ideological shift. If the first half of the 20th century was dominated by the revolution in Russia and the emergence of communism as a powerful political and socio-economic force, the second half of the century was dominated by the collapse of communism. The Chinese learnt in their own inscrutable way to adapt to the changing environment and to welcome, without too much fuss, private enterprise. One consequence of the adaptability has been the survival of the communist party without communism. The shell has remained, the content has been transformed. Communism emerged in the 19th century as the ideology of the impoverished, the world is now witnessing the impoverishment of communism.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 							 																						FREE TO KILL																														Those who trade in terror can only be enemies of freedom. There is thus a dark symbolism in the Assamese rebels once again drenching an Independence Day celebration in blood. The fact that there were five children among the 17 victims of the bomb blast at Dhamaji makes the tragedy particularly shocking. The children and the other victims had assembled on the premises of a school to celebrate the countrys 57th Independence Day. By choosing to target them, the killers struck at the peoples love of freedom. Rebel groups in the North-east routinely call for the boycott of Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations, and indulge in violence on these days. All this apparently to symbolize their defiance of the Indian state. But the offensives usually result in the spilling of innocent blood, as in Dhamaji. Year after year, the rebels go through their cruel ritual, killing common people and achieving little in their secessionist war against the state. The United Liberation Front of Asom has now taken responsibility for the latest mayhem, as an act against the government. In the past, it has routinely issued warnings to the people against joining such celebrations. 																														There is, however, a more important message underlying such tragedies. They bear testimony to the peoples courage in the face of the rebels threats. The statewide protests over the killings once again reflect the public revulsion at the rebels politics of violence. It is possible that part of the public anger will be directed at the state governments failure to prevent the killings. But the chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, needs to read the public reaction carefully. He should see the popular disapproval of the rebels as a major source of strength for the administrations battle against the insurgents. But, more important, the tragedy should make Mr Gogoi rethink his policy on peace negotiations with the ULFA. Only recently, he had made tentative offers to start such talks, hoping that the rebels would respond positively. No one can underestimate the importance of peace overtures if they lead to an end to Assams long and sad tryst with militancy. But the chief minister needs to be more circumspect and must not allow the ULFA to use violence as a pressure tactic in the run-up to the talks. With Manipur burning next door, Assam cannot afford to relax the vigil against agents of subversion.

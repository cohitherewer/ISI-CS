The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 19, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																On the backfoot				 																																																				Sir  Contrary to what Javed Miandad says, there is nothing unethical about his being sacked as the cricket coach of Pakistan (Unethical act: Miandad, June 18). Miandads performance has been below par, going by the form of his team  an early exit from the World Cup and a humiliating series loss to India. His replacement, Bob Woolmer, is the right man for the job. Also, Miandads demand for more power is unreasonable as selectors, along with the skipper and the coach, should have an equal say in matters such as selection. That explains the success of other teams like Australia and India.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Arnab Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																Give it a spin				 																																																				Sir  The controversy over the legality of Muttiah Muralidharans bowling action is a matter of grave concern for cricket-lovers as it raises questions about the fundamentals of the game (SLC for change in law, June 10). One is tempted to ask how is legal arm action defined? What is the meaning of tolerance limit? The issues are likely to baffle any neighbourhood cricket enthusiast, especially since former players themselves have failed to find suitable answers. 				 																																																				The bowling action involves rotation of the shoulder so that the ball is not simply thrown. Let the legality of bowling be determined by measurements of this shoulder movement, and not by fine calculations of those of the wrist and elbow. Unfortunately, the real agenda of those behind the controversy is hardly the game itself. Or else, how does one explain Muralidharan being hauled up after he has already established himself as one of the most accomplished spinners of all times? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ashutosh Pandey, Ranchi

				 																																																				Sir  Muttiah Muralidharans decision to opt out of Sri Lankas tour to Australia owing to the criticism of his bowling action came as a surprise (Murali confirms pullout, June 16). The absence of the worlds highest wicket-taker in Australia will give his rival, Shane Warne, a chance to surpass the Sri Lankan bowler. It will also give a new life to the chucking controversy. Under the circumstances, it will be better if Muralidharan reconsiders his decision.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  All this talk about Muralidharans faulty bowling action only goes to show the inherent racial bias of the International Cricket Council. The bowling of Brett Lee, the Australian fast bowler, has also been suspect for some time now. But Lee has been spared Muralidharans ordeal, presumably because he is white.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Moloy Sen, Calcutta

				 																The right note				 																																																				Sir  Nothing in the Bharatiya Janata Partys history should have led us to believe that it would accept defeat gracefully. From its agitation for the Ram mandir to the more recent Bharat Uday Yatra, the party has shown it has no qualms in using its divisive ideology, gimmicks and cheap propaganda. Githa Hariharans light-hearted take on the post-electoral histrionics of the Bharatiya Mundan Party (Silence or ruckus?, June13) expresses the present mood of the nation. The electoral verdict clearly shows that the India Shining campaign was one of the biggest failure of our times because it mocked the plight of the common man. Nevertheless, nothing could have prepared the nation for the tamasha staged by Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti. The mock mundans and resignation dramas were in sharp contrast to Sonia Gandhis dignified renunciation. Much like the India Shining campaign, the mundan drama also backfired on the BJP.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Preeti Chaturvedi, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Silence or ruckus, reflects the inherent prejudices of the pseudo-secularists. The likes of Githa Hariharan never find time to write about displaced Kashmiri pandits. Neither do they think it important to criticize the inclusion of tainted ministers in the cabinet. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Ramesh Dewan, Chennai

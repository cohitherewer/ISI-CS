		 Friday, April 30, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																The darker shades of desire An affair of honor (Vintage, 4.55) by Richard Marius is the third novel in a loose trilogy set in fictional Bourbon County, Tennessee. The author has captured the spirit of baroque in a fast-paced but carefully detailed novel of over 590 pages. Violence, blackmail, revenge, and fear form the core of an intricate story in which love and faith are as colourful and as extreme in expression as the more sinister passions. She: Short Stories of Rabindranath Tagore (UBSPD, Rs 225) translated by Joyasree Mukerji is a collection of ten stories thematically bound by the figure of the woman. The volume ends with Letter from a wife, that is Streer Patra, which voices, perhaps most clearly among his short stories, the elation and pride of a woman emancipated from patriarchal values through her intense experiences. The translator feels that she identifies with these women of Tagore, not just mejobou of Streer Patra, but with Haimanti and Kadambini, Kumu and Charu. One of the longer tales is Broken home, or Nashtaneer. The translation is lucid and easy-flowing, but not always flexible enough to take Tagores most piercing moments in its stride. In spite of such momentary stumbles, it is a good, short volume with which to access some of Tagores best short stories. Blue gold: The Fight to stop the corporate theft of the worlds water (LeftWord, Rs 195) by Maude Barlow and Tony Clarke shows how the growth imperative of transnational corporations has brought them into direct collision with nature. The net result is the destruction of natures resources  this volume focusses on the most dangerous assault, that on water  and the impoverishment of the already vulnerable segments of humanity as a result. But the thrust of the book is towards active resistance of the theft of water rights. The authors express their indebtedness to an international family of water warriors. The a to z of islam (Vision, Rs 190) by Ludwig W. Adamec is enormously useful as a quick reference work on Islamic history, religion, philosophy and political movements. The entries are precise, but with adequate information for a non-specialist looking for information. It is also a timely book: it seems particularly important that a professor of Middle Eastern studies from an American university and a specialist on Afghanistan should author a dictionary that might help in some way to counter ignorance about a religion.

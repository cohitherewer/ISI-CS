The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Distorted images				 																																																				Sir  First it was Jassi who wooed audiences with her ugliness in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin, and now it is the turn of Nikki to play another ugly duckling in the forthcoming television serial, Dekho Magar Pyar Se (Jassi success sparks soap import rush, July 25). Such serials are a welcome break from Ekta Kapoors brand of saasbahu melodramas. Most of the latter variety (incidentally, all the names start with K) sell themselves as depictions of real life, but they are far from it. They either show heavily made up women in gorgeous kanjeevarams pottering around in the kitchen, playing the ideal wife, or have nymphets clad in sequinned tank-tops trying to steal the men of these sati-savitris. Yet, no matter how different they are, even serials like Jassi or Dekho Magar Pyar Se do not give the clear picture of contemporary life. Why do directors always have to go for the extreme, either in looks or behaviour, in their portrayal of modern Indian women? Why cant they talk about the smart, independent and normal women of our times?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Damayanti Sen, Calcutta

				 																Constricted flow				 																																																				Sir  Today, water has already become a scarce commodity over which major wars are fought. As the dispute over the Cauvery waters makes evident, a river is not only a lifeline (for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in this case), it is intrinsically associated with state pride. The impasse over the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal reflects similar compulsions. Securing rights over the rivers flowing through India and Pakistan may even be seen as a major factor behind the festering Kashmir problem.				 																																																				To minimize the chances of such conflict, a uniform and non-partisan national policy needs to be evolved for the equitable distribution of water. The attempt to interlink rivers must continue in order to avoid floods in one part of the country and severe droughts in another. Efforts should also be made to make sea-water potable.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

				 																																																				Sir  The dispute over the SYL canal has graduated from being a face-off between the Punjab and Haryana governments to one between Punjab and the Union government. The latter is even mulling over the idea of approaching the Supreme Court and the president of India. But these constitutional steps should be the last resort for political parties under the banner of the United Progressive Alliance. For both the Congress in Punjab and the UPA at the Centre, it is Sonia Gandhi who is at the helm. She should try to make Punjab understand that the interests of a single state cannot be placed above national interest. The failure to do so will indicate that her leadership is ineffectual.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Punjabs defiance of the SYL canal agreement goes against federal principles as also against humanitarian concerns. There are already signs of a major trouble brewing. The Haryana chief minister, Om Prakash Chautala, has threatened to restrict Yamuna waters to Delhi, which would leave the city thirsty. Since there will be politicians to take advantage of the situation, riots may even break out in places. 				 																																																				It is possible that the presence of a friendly government at the Centre may have heavily influenced the decision of the Punjab government against the non-Congress government of Haryana. The Centre should have taken up the issue in parliament immediately and tried to pass a bill nationalizing all rivers. If Punjab continues to be recalcitrant, the UPA should sack the state government, impose presidents rule and take steps to complete the SYL canal. By doing so, not only will it enhance its prestige but also help keep the unity and federal structure of the country intact. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																Growing numbers				 																																																				Sir  World Population Day was celebrated in India on July 11. But with India all set to overtake China as the most populous country in the world, it was certainly no cause for celebration. Yet India inhabits about one-third of Chinas land. It is clear that with such a population boom, sustainable growth is impossible in India. Unlike China and Singapore, which have successfully implemented strong legislative measures combined with a system of incentives and disincentives, India has always fought shy of applying similar measures to combat this problem. Although every government announces a population policy, it always includes non-definitive measures like educating the people and generating greater awareness. What makes things worse is the view that a growing population is an asset which can be utilized productively for economic growth. Planners do not seem to understand that in the present globalized economic scenario, industry throughout the world is aiming to achieve higher productivity with less manpower through the use of technology. Rapid reduction of production costs has made it impossible for labour intensive small sector industries to survive. This has led to a rapid shrinkage of employment avenues. Due to the increase in population, unemployment has been growing at an alarming rate every year. No amount of industrial investment in this present situation can reduce the figure. Unless we take bold measures, the aim of the national population policy, 2000 to achieve a stable population growth by 2045 will remain a pipe dream.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raja Sen, Dhanbad

				 																																																				Sir  Unchecked population growth is a predominant feature among the illiterate poor. Educated and healthy children are assets to the nation and the increase of their population should always be encouraged. Over the past few years, however, there has been considerable change in the middle class. As both men and women are engaged in demanding jobs, many of them choose to marry late and have only one child. Many choose not to have children at all. Thus the campaign for population control should be directed mainly at the poor and illiterate people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Haralal Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The enormous population of India makes it impossible for the country to nurture the idea of having a social security net. Yet that alone could have helped the poor.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

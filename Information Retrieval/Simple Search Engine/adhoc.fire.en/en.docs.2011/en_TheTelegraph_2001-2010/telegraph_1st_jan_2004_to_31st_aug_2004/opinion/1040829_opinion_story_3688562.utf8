The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 29, 2004 							 																						SINGING THE BLUES AWAY																														A hundred days is hardly a Mosaic jubilee. And most certainly, Mr Manmohan Singh has very little to celebrate after one hundred days in office. But for a government whose birth certificate had a curtailed longevity inscribed on it by the spin doctors, one hundred days in power provide an occasion to look back and to steer ahead. Mr Singhs accession to the prime ministership was unexpected in more ways than one. For one thing, the Congress came round the bend to overtake the Bharatiya Janata Party in the electoral race. For another, Mr Singh became the prime minister only after the favourite choice, Ms Sonia Gandhi, declined to accept the mantle that was hers for the asking. This was the first hurdle that Mr Singh had to negotiate. He was not the partys first choice, maybe not even the second choice. He had the prime ministership thrust upon him by Ms Gandhi. His second obstacle was the coalition which he had to lead. The left parties, even though they opted to stay out of the government, decided that they would play a critical role in determining government policy, especially economic policy. Mr Singh had to establish the fact that he was the master of his own government.																														The prevailing objective conditions were not best suited for a stunning debut by Mr Singh. The monsoon, the perennial driver of the Indian economy, seemed to be performing below par. Prices were soaring. Inflation was fed by rising oil prices across the world. The stock market, the index of the economys performance, experienced a meltdown because of the anti-liberalization rhetoric of the left. For Mr Singh and his colleagues, especially the finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, this was a test of nerves. That test was compounded by a concerted effort on the part of the opposition to bring governance to a complete standstill by disrupting proceedings in the Lok Sabha. Mr Singh has passed all these tests without the slightest possible hitch.																														The crisis in the making was not Mr Singhs own creation. He took immediate steps, in the teeth of left opposition, to restore investor confidence. He controlled the impact of rising oil prices by slashing excise and import duties on oil. On the political front, he first appealed to the good sense of the opposition leaders to allow the Lok Sabha to function. When this failed and when the opposition tried to bypass the debate on the Union budget by submitting a memorandum containing suggested changes in the finance bill, Mr Singh very firmly put the opposition leaders in their place. The leaders of the National Democratic Alliance now know that Mr Singh is not the kind of man to accept any kind of nonsense. Mr Singh needs to show this side of him more often and that too to even some of his cabinet colleagues and to the comrades in Gopalan Bhavan. Mr Singh is growing into the position that he occupies and he has no reason to feel unhappy with his first hundred days in office. Most important, the trademark blue of Mr Singhs turban continues to stand for unimpeachable integrity.

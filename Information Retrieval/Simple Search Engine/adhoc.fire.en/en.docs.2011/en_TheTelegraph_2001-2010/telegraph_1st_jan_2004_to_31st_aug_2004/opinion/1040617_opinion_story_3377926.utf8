The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 							 																						OBSESSED WITH EXOTICA Gouri Chatterjee																					It began with a small report in Hirakhand, a now-defunct Oriya newspaper, in the summer of 1985. It became news when the Indian Express picked it up and displayed it prominently in its Delhi and Mumbai editions. It created a storm when other papers across the country followed it up, and it reached a climax when India Today put it on the cover and touched the heart of a freshly-minted prime minister. Kalahandi became a byword for poverty and hunger in modern India  transforming forever the tragic facts of starvation, whether in Amlashol in West Bengal or Potaram in Andhra Pradesh, into news worthy of banner headlines and ensuring, too, that worse did not occur. 																					Precisely as Amartya Sen wrote, years ago. A really bad famine, as happened in China in the mid-Seventies when thousands died, cannot occur in a democracy, the Nobel-winner wrote, because the media would make sure that the authorities did something before things unravelled. The Sabars of Amlashol should escape death by starvation  at least, for a while now. It is a role that a media obsessed with exotica, like souffl recipes and the right way to eat caviar and reviews of Italian and French restaurants, would do well to remember. It can make a difference between life and death for many.																					Its all about niche																					When the wife of the MTV youth icon and a member of the countrys leading business family comes out with a magazine to celebrate our silver citizens (anyone over 55), you have to assume it makes hard business sense to do so. Even if the first issue of Tina Ambanis Harmony, that hit the stands this week, makes you wonder if Maurice Chevalier was all there when he said that old age wasnt so bad when you considered the alternative. May be the 45-year-old Tina Ambani will grow into her mission to bring back the sunshine into her readers lives.																					The media business is one area where the Ambani touch has so far failed to work its magic. The Business and Political Observer, the newspaper that Dhirubhai Ambani launched with much fanfare in the early Nineties, was such a mega-flop that journalists are still running scared of new entrants to their trade. Money alone does not make the news business go round.																					But news alone no longer makes the media business go round. Niche is the name of the game today. Advertisers of expensive products like niche. If you want to reach, say, golfers, why waste your ads on a horde of non-golfers you would also get with the more general-interest newspapers, magazines and TV channels. Worse, such mass-market vehicles will never provide you with the proper ambience (through glossy paper, pictures of beautiful people, etc.) that would best showcase your costly goods. Hence the rise in celebrity-studded glossies that crowd the news-stands. Harmony fits neatly into the slot for seniors with healthy savings. 																					If Harmony goes the way of BPO (and Im taking no bets), it wont be because Dhirubhai Ambanis daughter-in-law got her business calculations wrong. But there is still more to media than totting up numbers. 																					Locked in a struggle																					The Wall Street Journal, soon to be brought to a news-stand near you by the Times of India group, has already picked up some distinctly Indian traits. The journalists of Americas most reputed business daily, that swears by the free market and small government, are locked in a struggle with their management that smacks of hardcore trade unionism. It is even being said that unhappiness over salary and benefits may result, for the first time in the organizations history, in a newsroom strike. And now, they have gone Gandhian. Wall Street Journal reporters plan to withhold their bylines from stories for two days this week, as contract negotiations with their employer, Dow Jones amp; Co., turn increasingly rancorous, Associated Press reported on Wednesday. For any reporter in the world that is supreme sacrifice indeed. Are we slated to get a WSJ complete with a human face then?

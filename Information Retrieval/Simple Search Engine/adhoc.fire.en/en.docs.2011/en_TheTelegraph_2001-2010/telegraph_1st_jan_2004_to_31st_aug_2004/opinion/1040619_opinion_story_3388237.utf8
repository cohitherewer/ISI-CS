		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 							 																						SIN OF REGRETExpressions of regret about past acts of violence have become dime a dozen. They are meaningless and often resonant with insincerityRenunciation of worldly power, the flavour of the month in India, is apparently the sign of a mahatma; regretting past sins is the call-sign of a Johnny-Come-Lately. It has taken the Vatican, the headquarters of Christian orthodoxy, over 800 years to ask for forgiveness for the Inquisition, which was instituted by Pope Gregory IX in 1233. Pope John Paul II did not go down in sackcloth and ashes like Henry IV at Canossa before Pope Gregory VII in the 11th century, but he has officially expressed an apology for the Inquisition. A few words of regret to atone for a policy that killed and tortured thousands of people for alleged anti-Christian activities. It will be recalled that a few years back, the Roman Catholic Church said sorry for what it had done to the Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei. The irrelevance of, and the hypocrisy inherent in, such expressions of regret are underlined by the fact that the Vatican did not ex-communicate Adolf Hitler. The Vatican openly did business with Benito Mussolini and signed with him the Lateran Treaty, which allowed Vatican City to become a closed society hiding various shenanigans. The world waits expectantly for an apology for all these, as it does for the massacre of the Cathars in the Albigensian Crusade and other acts of violence. A few words of apology cannot wash away the blood on papal hands.																														The infection of regret has spread beyond the Catholic Church. The list of recent apologetic figures is long and distinguished. The Indian prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, is contrite about what was done to the Sikhs in 1984. The former prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is sorry that raj dharma was not followed in Gujarat in 2002 when Muslims were killed there in a pogrom. The chief minister of West Bengal has expressed his personal anguish that people should die of starvation in his state. The irrepressible Mr Bill Clinton has admitted that his fling with Ms Monica Lewinsky is morally indefensible. There is a growing body of opinion in the United States of America which demands that Mr George W. Bush should beg the worlds pardon for the invasion of Iraq. The list provokes the question about the relevance of such feelings of regret. Of what consequence are they to those who were affected by the actions for which pardon is being sought? Conscience, unlike Minervas owl, cannot fly only after dusk. When it does fly in twilight, it flies over bodies of the dead and the bones of the tortured for whom words, even sincere ones, have lost all meaning.																														The contrast to the clutch of regrets is the attitude of Colonel Blimp in his London club or at the local. He is unashamed about what he did to the natives in the colonies or about what he continues to do in places like Iraq. Conscience and the White Mans Burden are incompatible. It is as difficult to see the British prime minister, Mr Tony Blair, as Blimp as it is to see him with a conscience. He is brazen and undisturbed by the distant cannonades of historical evaluation. Avoiding Mr Blairs smarmy indifference as well as the others expressions of meaningless regret, the conduct of human affairs must find ways in the present to heal the wounds of the past. After some kinds of knowledge there can be no forgiveness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 16, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Divine injustice				 																																																				Sir  A leopard seldom changes its spots. Or in the case of Uma Bharti, saffron seldom changes colour. Cocking a snook at her seniors in the Bharatiya Janata Party who said that Ram had given way to development after the elections in the four states, Bharti is on a temple building spree in Madhya Pradesh (Three temples, a cowshed amp; Uma is home, Jan 15). The saadhvis flirtation with divinity may make sangh parivar leaders happy but heritage activists are frowning. The official residence of the chief minister boasts of a rich history and constructing temples at such a site can only be termed vandalism. Bhartis actions also prove that despite their recent dove-like posturings, the top rung leaders of the BJP cannot shed their hawkish Hindutva image. Finally, using the public exchequer to finance her religious fervour only confirms that Bharti is no different from her predecessor. The more things change in politics, the more they remain the same.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Arunabho Ghosh, Calcutta
				 																Over the patients body				 																																																				Sir  The report, Doctors fight during surgery (Jan 10), of a scuffle between two groups of doctors inside an operation theatre, even as the patient lay unconscious on the table, may be comical, but it reflects very badly on our doctors. Such disgraceful behaviour is utterly unacceptable, and the incident also shows that the doctors were indifferent to the possibility that the patients may die as a result of their juvenile behaviour. The doctors involved should be punished for failing to maintain the minimal ethical standards and needlessly endangering the life of a patient. Unfortunately in India, where instances of gross medical negligence are swept under the carpet, one can be sure that this incident too will be forgotten. Unless a sense of accountability is instilled among our doctors, there is little chance of improving the healthcare system. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

				 																																																				Sir  The Confederation of Indian Industry team which will visit Abu Dhabi to showcase India in general and the city in particular as an affordable and quality healthcare destination should carry a copy of the report, Doctors fight during surgery (Healthcare hardsell team to Gulf, Jan 10). It would warn the targeted clientele of how doctors in the state think nothing of assaulting each other in the operation theatre  the stakes in their case will be much larger after all. There are some good doctors, but for a large section of the medical fraternity, money matters much more than the lives of the poor patients. Indeed, a surgery in India affects the patient not only physically, but also financially. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				 Sir  The incident at the Raiganj government hospital, where doctors clashed even as the patient lay unconscious on the operating table, is fit to feature on Ripleys Believe It Or Not, a popular programme on a satellite channel. The incident clearly shows the declining sense of responsibility and decency among doctors. Despite the recent negative publicity doctors have got and the media spotlight on the abysmal state of healthcare in West Bengal, they are yet to mend their ways. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dipankar Bera, Howrah

				 																																																				Sir  The incident in Raiganj government hospital is nothing new; many cases like this take place all over the world but most go unreported. Doctors are accused of being more interested in making money than in the well-being of their patients. But there are some doctors who provoke their fellow professionals beyond endurance with their objectionable behaviour and give the calling a bad name. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nilanjana Sanyal, Calcutta

				 																																																				 Sir Scuffles in the operation theatre portray doctors in West Bengal in very poor light. But, one should not generalize on the basis of one incident. There are doctors like Parthasarathi Saha of Nadia who prove that the profession can still boast of some real heroes (Doctor breathes life into girl with blood, Dec 26). Saha has proved that despite the gloom, there is light at the end of the tunnel.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Poor service 				 																																																				Sir  BSNL and Calcutta Telephones have lately been coming out with colourful advertisements boasting of its service. But the reality is very different. My residential telephone went out of order recently. Despite lodging a complaint with the fault repair section of the exchange, nothing happened. Some days later, a fault repairman rang up and declared my telephone was alright. After he hung up, I found, to my utter surprise, that the phone was still dead. Another complaint to the repair service failed to any results. How long does BSNL think it can survive the growing competition by making empty promises?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				SirAlthough BSNL has partially implemented the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India guidelines on telephone tariff, different rates are charged for the same services. For long distance landline calls, BSNL charges Rs 4.80 per minute, whereas a call from a landline to a mobile costs Rs 3.60 per minute. It also charges Rs 2.40 for calls made from a mobile to another mobile. Such differential tariffs from the same operator cause confusion. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

				 																																																				Sir  BSNL charges higher rates for ISD calls to Nepal and other south Asian countries. While Reliance and some others charge as low as Rs 10, BSNL levies Rs 24. The company should lower the rates immediately in the interests of better relations with our neighbours.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Roshan Sharda, Calcutta

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  Sandip Rays Bombaiyer Bombatay is a commendable effort. The film is in sync with the times and uses technology to good effect. The acting too is more than competent, particular that of Sabyasachi Chakraborty as Feluda. All comparisons are odious but one cannot help comparing the old with the new. The special something that Soumitra Chaterjee brought to the old Feluda, under Satyajit Rays direction, is missing in the new. The new Feluda relies more on brawn than on brain to win his battles. Also the new Jatayu is no match for the talented Santosh Dutta. But the satisfaction of movie-goers shows that even so, the film managed to please Feluda fans.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rabin Das, Calcutta

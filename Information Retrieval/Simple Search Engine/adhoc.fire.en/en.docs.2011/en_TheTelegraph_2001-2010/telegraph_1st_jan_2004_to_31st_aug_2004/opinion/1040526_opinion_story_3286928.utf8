The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Different strokes 				 																																																				Sir  One can only imagine the desperation that drives the residents of Hetkahan village in Purulia. By not participating in the governments pulse polio programme they risk their childrens lives in the hope of securing a supply of drinking water (Protest tool: polio drops, May 25). The choice between seeing their child thirsty or crippled for life cannot be very pleasant. Ironically, the Hetkahan report was placed just below another one titled, Govt to tap Europe for drinking-water loan, on the Bengal governments approaching the European Commission for a loan to tackle the drinking-water problem in Howrah, Asansol, Durgapur and Siliguri. The municipal affairs and urban development minister, Asok Bhattacharya, feels a need to develop infrastructure to cope with the fast growth, and the changing needs and aspirations of the people in these areas. Obviously, the needs and aspirations of remote Hetkahan are yet to feature in Bhattacharyas priority list. In future, the villagers should perhaps consider staying away from the polls too. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Chaitali Chakraborty, Calcutta
				 																Power play				 																																																				Sir  The mad scramble for lucrative ministerial berths among the United Progressive Alliance leaders like Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan brings to mind the picture of a pack of wolves fighting for a share of the kill (Paswan joins, with a warning, May 24). Whom do they think they are fooling? All the post-election victory talk about concern for the country and the need to tackle poverty was obviously a sham. The poor and illiterate who voted for Yadav and Paswan may have been either coerced or swayed by sentiment. But the more discerning know that personal interests take top priority with these leaders, followed by the interests of family members and close associates. Party, constituency and state may come next. Of the funds allocated to the ministry, the least reaches the people of the country. Why does the media give so much time and space to these men? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The appointment of ministers with serious criminal charges against them in the new Central cabinet is not surprising, given that corruption has always been a feature of Indian politics (Tainted Bihar trio finds place in ministry, May 23). This is in contrast to the United States of America, where Richard Nixon had to step down as president over charges of obstruction of justice, even though he was never formally convicted. But in India, leaders who have been to jail over charges of corruption are regularly made ministers at the state and Central levels. Little wonder then that corruption pervades almost every aspect of public life in India. If someone with a criminal record can become a minister, why would anyone lower down the rank care to be honest in his job? 				 																																																				But the argument that these tainted leaders have been made ministers because they were elected by the people who were aware of their scandalous pasts, cannot be ignored. George Bernard Shaw once said that democracy was a device which ensured that we are governed no better than we deserve. But the reality is that in India, democracy is frequently subverted through the abuse of power and deception practised on ignorant voters. Even so, Indians do not deserve to be ruled by crooks.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The Congress has done a good job of allocating ministries in a fair and transparent manner. But the allocation of railways to Laloo Prasad Yadav indicates that Biharis may be favoured in railways recruitment as they have always been when railway ministers were from Bihar. The creation of a separate ministry for non-resident Indians is welcome and shows the new governments seriousness about tapping the wealth of this segment to further Indias growth. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur

				 																																																				Sir  The harassment of train passengers in Bihar is common knowledge. Yet Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh have given in to Laloo Prasad Yadavs demands for the railways ministry. Now that the railways have indeed become the property of Yadav and his cadre, one shudders to think of the plight of railway passengers in the state. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pranabesh Chandra Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Laloo Prasad Yadav is a shrewd politician. He had demanded the post of deputy prime minister and other plum portfolios knowing full well that he would not get any of them. In the end he got railways, which is probably what he always wanted. The Congress must now ensure he does not take us for a ride with his gimmicks. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Geraldine H., Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief was so insistent on the home ministry because he wanted to influence the corruption cases against him. A man charged in corruption cases, as Laloo Yadav has been, should never have been allowed to contest the elections. The government says that it is adhering to the tenets of the Constitution, but by its actions it is encouraging criminals. What happened to the Constitution Review Commission on which crores were spent? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  When Laloo Prasad Yadav says that he is the railway minister of not just Bihar but the entire nation, does he mean that he will now extend the scenario in Bihar to the whole of the country? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hemant Krishna, Bangalore 

				 																																																				Sir  With P. Chidambaram getting the finance portfolio, the Indian economy will now be put on the right track. Hopefully, the middle classes can also expect sizeable income-tax benefits.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,R. Sekar, Angul

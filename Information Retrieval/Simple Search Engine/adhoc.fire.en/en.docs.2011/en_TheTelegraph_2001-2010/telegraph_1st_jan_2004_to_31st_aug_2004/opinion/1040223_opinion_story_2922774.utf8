The reasons cited for not using contraceptives were: Fear of some of the contraceptive methods; the study conducted by Rural Womens Social Education Centre in Tamil Nadu indicated that some women reported that they could not use oral pills or intra-uterine devices because of their side effects. It was also reported that women believed that oral pills dry up the blood in our body, thereby preventing them from doing hard physical labour... 																														Irregular supply of oral pills was cited as a reason why some respondents did not use them and ended up becoming pregnant in the study conducted in Andhra Pradesh by Praksamma.																														In some studies women admitted that while the condom was the safest method of contraception, husbands did not always cooperate in using it. In the RUWSEC study, for example, it was reported that men tended to be inconsistent and irregular in use of condoms or complained that condoms interfered with sexual pleasure.																														There was also a perception articulated that IUD led to pain and discomfort. This may be an outcome of poor quality of care  especially if the IUD is inserted without proper pelvic examination or in settings where basic hygienic conditions are compromised.																														Female sterilization as the first and final method of contraception: As indicated in some of the studies, women find the reversible or spacing methods of contraception inconvenient or unacceptable and after giving birth to the desired number of children, they opt for sterilization. However, since the desired family size is measured in terms of surviving children, typical couples wait for a few years to ensure the survival of their children before accepting a permanent method of sterilization. During this intervening period, if women become pregnant, some of them choose to abort the foetus. Thus abortion is resorted to for pregnancy that occurs while women are waiting to undergo sterilization. Curiously, women who opted for abortion in such situations reported that it is a better option as compared to relying on IUD or oral pills. Women also indicated that after abortion they did not require much rest and they could resume their daily routine work almost immediately. (Radkar)																														Low risk perception for becoming pregnant: Further, some women who have infrequent sexual contact either because their children are grown up or married or because their husbands are often away for long periods, feel that occasional sexual contact will not lead to pregnancy. However, when they realize that they have become pregnant, some of them prefer to abort the foetus rather than bearing a child.																														Perception that abortion is safe: All the qualitative studies were conducted in the states where availability of safe abortion services is fairly good, especially for married women.... 																														Abortion for desired sex composition of children: While direct questions on sex selective abortion were not asked in most of the studies, almost all the studies pointed out that couples and their extended families opted for abortion not only to limit family size but also for achieving desired sex composition of children. 																														The internalization of preference for sons was so widespread that studies conducted by Barua, Radkar, Ananldhi, Visaria all reported that couples resorted to female selective abortions after undergoing a sex determination test. The reasons for why sons were preferred were expressed in terms of supp ort in old age, continuing family line (as expressed in a study conducted in Maharashtra... ) TO BE CONCLUDED

		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 							 																						BULGING RESERVES																														Indias foreign exchange reserves are close to $120 billion  more than adequate by any indicator. For the first time in independent Indias history, they have also crossed the size of external debt, no doubt an important signal. However, the policy implication of this embarrassment of riches is yet to be worked out. Left to the market, the rupee will appreciate, notwithstanding further trade or capital account liberalization initiatives. Appreciation hurts exports, and because protection declines, makes further trade liberalization difficult. However, the Reserve Bank of India can prevent appreciation only through dollar purchases, and this requires sale of government (or RBI) securities to keep inflation in check. Given that it was running out of marketable securities, for a while it had seemed as if the RBI was opting for the rupee appreciation route, especially because this helped reduce the rupee costs of oil imports. But the RBI seems to be back to dollar purchases now. Left to the market, the rate of appreciation will equal the interest rate differential between India and the rest of the world. Since interest rates abroad are significantly below Indian interest rates, under the assumption that the RBI cannot indefinitely purchase dollars, this ought to discipline Indian interest rates. Unfortunately, Indian interest rates will not drop until fiscal deficits and government borrowings are slashed. 																														The argument is often advanced that forex reserves are used inefficiently and should instead be used for pushing infrastructure. This too is effectively an argument for reducing interest costs, sectorally if not across the board. Many Indian companies can now borrow abroad, at less than 5 per cent. The RBI tries to control what these borrowed funds can be used for, such as for not repaying rupee loans. But this is impossible to enforce. The short point is that the interest rate differential permits arbitrage, of the non-resident Indian variety or otherwise, stimulates dollar inflows and triggers rupee appreciation. The answer lies not in declaring arbitrage illegal, although special treatment to NRIs should stop, but in removing the root of the problem  high domestic interest rates. Indeed, excessive forex reserves should be used for further capital account liberalization. But such liberalization again creates additional avenues for arbitrage. And at least potentially, the seeds are sown for sudden capital flight of speculative inflows. Capital account liberalization is a phased process and does not occur overnight. But before imbibing significant doses of capital account liberalization, the deficit house has to be set in order. That is the moral of the bulging reserves.

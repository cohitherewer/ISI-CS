		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 							 																						SNAPPED LINK																														Water has a unique way of changing alliances in politics. The Punjab termination of agreements bill, 2004, was carried through in the Punjab assembly two days before the Supreme Court deadline for the Centre to take over completion of the Punjab portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal. Support for the bill was unanimous: it was proposed by the Congress state government, and supported by the Shiromani Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party combine in opposition. This politics is different: it has to do with perceived interests of the state, especially of its farmers. In this case, 15 lakh farming families will lose their livelihood if the canal is completed to ferry water to Haryana, according to the Punjab chief minister. But even apart from such realistic considerations, the question of releasing water to neighbouring states when water levels are erratic always becomes an emotional issue. Instructions from tribunals or the judiciary become associated with the sense of neglect or injustice, and are tied in with the history of linguistic, ethnic or regional ascendancy or alienation. Politics becomes fiercely regional, ignoring party divisions within the state in order to reassert the division between states.																														In Punjab, the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal has been in trouble since it was started in 1982. The agreement to release fixed amounts of water to Haryana and Rajasthan has never been implemented, since the completion of the canal was always foiled by agitations in Punjab by various groups, including the extremists in the Eighties. And now, with water levels dropping in rivers all over India, Punjab is claiming that it has nothing to give. There is, in any case, no question of releasing the amounts fixed on in 1982. Meanwhile, Haryana has completed its section of the canal, evidently waiting for water to be released once Punjab completes its own section. In Haryanas perception, a sabotaging of the earlier water-sharing agreement is an assault on the federalist structure. Certainly, Punjabs new bill puts serious strain on the relationship between states. Each side has its own arguments, but it is difficult to see why an understanding could not have been rationally worked out before this. The moment a water-sharing crisis comes to the negotiating table, presided over by prime ministers and members of the Central government, the old politics of Centre-state equations takes over. This has happened repeatedly with the Cauvery water dispute. But Punjabs bill, overturning the earlier agreement and trying to evade the instruction of the Supreme Court, is likely to precipitate a crisis with the legislature and the judiciary.

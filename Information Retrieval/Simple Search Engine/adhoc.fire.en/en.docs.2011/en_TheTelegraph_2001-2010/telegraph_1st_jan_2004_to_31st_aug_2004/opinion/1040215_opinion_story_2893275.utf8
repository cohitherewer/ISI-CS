The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, February 15, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Irresponsible people				 																																																				Sir  As both the murdered activists, Sarita and Mahesh, wished it, their Shabdo is likely to remain a model village, but one never to be replicated (Borders melt in Shabdo protest, Feb 13). A similar lesson was given in Rajasthan by the rape of saathin Bhanwari Devi, who opposed child-marriage in her locality. The judiciary later observed how her own actions were responsible for the reprisal from the upper-castes. The Bihar administration too, perhaps, believes the activist duos enthusiasm was responsible for their death. Which is why the accused roam freely while celebrities mourn the murder. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, M. Sikdar, Calcutta
				 																Road rage				 																																																				Sir  Many people in this city do not see the problem of safety in a reasonable way. Which is why fathers still think it safe to ride with school-going children in tiny scooters (Fathers fear comes true as trailer kills schoolboy, Feb 10). Ashok Sarkar, who recently lost his son, also travelled the same way from Dasnagar in Howrah to Hindu School in College Street, crossing on the way some of the most troublesome traffic spots of the city like the approach of the Howrah Bridge, the truck-infested Strand Road, Burrabazar and other roads. 				 																																																				The loss of the Sarkars is irreparable. Parents have to know that two-wheelers are not the safest mode of transport on Calcuttas roads, although one may argue that other vehicles are not much safer. But one has to remember that in recent years, the scene on Calcuttas roads has become particularly chaotic, given the steady increase in traffic and the lack of road etiquette. Add to that illegal parking, flagrant breach of traffic rules and you have a situation readymade for frequent accidents. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

				 																																																				Sir  In Trouble on wheels (Jan 7), letter-writers have aptly narrated the multiple folly of the West Bengal government in deciding on a life-time road tax for private vehicles. This assured source of revenue would not only cease to contribute to the annual state revenue but also create many transport and road-related problems in the near future. But then the state administration does not seem to have a comprehensive plan on improving either the traffic or road network. It undertakes patch-work repair only under intense pressure from local representatives just before the elections. The complete lack of policy is evident from what is happening in the Eastern Bypass, built to facilitate traffic. Unplanned habitations on either side of the road will soon turn it into the VIP road. The government seems to have gone berserk in its quest for easy money and show of unprecedented progress. Has it thought of what will happen if a war or natural calamity demands quick transport from one end of the city to another? Yours faithfully, 
 Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 				 																																																				Sir  The illogic of the life- time road tax surprises. For some old cars the stipulated road tax is even higher than their resale value. Why does the state minister for transport always try to make such fools of private car-owners? Yours faithfully, 
 Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta 				 																																																				Sir  The road stretching along the Basanti Highway from No.1 government colony towards Bamunghata is miserable and poses a real danger not only to pedestrians and the local people, but also to vehicles that ply on that road. The potholes are gradually spreading throughout the road and the vehicles which travel at high speed have to change the lane to avoid turning over, which is dangerous. The highway is an important transport route in the state. The state government should immediately look into the matter.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chetaita Paul, Hadia

				 																																																				Sir  The government should sit up and take note of the escalating accident graph in the state. There should be more surveillance on the streets during the morning school time. Apart from rash-driving the hindrances placed on the road due to repair work is particularly bothersome. Such areas should be completely blocked and the traffic diverted.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																																														 Advantage vikas purush, the lauh purush can take a walk or a ride (which is exactly what he is doing). For anyone still in two minds about where the two leaders  LK Advani and AB Vajpayee  stand, the Vision Document 2004, with its 54 pictures of the prime minister in 48 pages, should provide the answer. To give the devil his due, lets assume that Vajpayee is not entirely to blame for most of the things carried out in his name by the people who feel obliged to beat his drum the loudest. The Vision, supposedly, is also part of this operation. The draft document that was sent to Vajpayee for his approval bore no resemblance to the one released by the party president on March 30. The twist was provided at the PMO, where the photographs were inserted and the deification of Vajpayee was made complete. Only a little more was left to be done. Once the document was released and the adverse reaction became palpable, there remained the task of dissociating oneself from it. Is that why Vajpayee asked in complete innocence, Why was I not shown the document earlier?				 																																																																														 A general election is also a season for love to blossom in the most unexpected of places. Look at Bihar. Only months ago, there was no love lost between Laloo Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan. The enmity spilled across the border. While Paswan sulked at the Pakistani establishments showering of accolades on Laloo, the RJD chief sniggered at Paswans attempts to fit into the picture General Musharraf clicked with Laloo. All that is past now. Laloo has given Paswans Lok Janshakti Party twice the number of seats allotted to the Congress. Sceptics will say that cold electoral arithmetic is at work. Paswan with his Dalit base is destined to bring to the RJD far greater number of votes in caste-ridden Bihar than the limping Congress leadership. But lets not speculate over the honeymoon yet.				 																																																																														 What has Varun Gandhi gained from throwing his weight behind the BJP? Nothing so far. His more illustrious cousins continue to get better coverage in the media. What is worse, even his party seems to be ignoring him. For one, his demand for an aircraft to travel across the country was turned down. His other expectation that the party would garner no less than 3,000 people for each of his public meetings has also fallen flat. Has Mama noticed how crestfallen her babe looks?				 																																																																														 Meanwhile, another Nehru-Gandhi is not merely baby-sitting. Anticipating what a flop brother Rahul might turn out to be, Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra is readying herself for her inevitable role. The grapevine has it that she has been spending as many as 12 hours in the company of noted academics and scholars from the Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University, ad-gurus, public-speaking experts and those well-versed in Indian economics, foreign affairs and so on  all the ammunition she may need to face the likes of Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj. In all probability, she will kick off her campaign from the South  possibly why Bellary kept waiting for her candidature till the last hour of the filing of nominations. Next time then?				 																																																																														 The new chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University, AM Ahmadi, is reportedly not too happy with the hospitality accorded him  all the rooms of the guest house, where he has been put up, do not have airconditioning. AMU pleads a resource crunch, but there is another story behind it. Ahmadis predecessor, who apparently did not visit the university even once during his tenure, had had an undisclosed amount of money (estimated to be around Rs 50 lakh) spent on refurbishing a room in the guest house for his likely visit. The visit did not take place. Which is why the room supposed to accommodate the chancellor has all the creature comforts, while those meant to house the family, does not. Selfish, isnt it?				 																																																																														 Self-less, if you take him at his word. We are talking about Ajit Jogi, who has been trying to point out that he did not attempt to secure a ticket for himself in the coming polls (how could he?). He is, apparently, only too happy to rejuvenate the party in Meghalaya, Arunachal, Nagaland, Sikkim, Manipur and Mizoram. Any takers?				 																																																																														 The BJP, which swears by Bharat, has forgotten Bharat ne Manoj Kumar. The former actor has expressed to party higher-ups his dissatisfaction at being trumped by juniors like Dharmendra. Thank saffronites for small mercies.				 																																																																														 By her own admission, the chief minister of Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje Scindia, has been without the idiot box for six months (although one could still express doubts over whether this has had any positive impact on her intelligence). The reasons are many. First there was the backbreaking campaign for the assembly polls. Then came the victory celebrations. Then the burden of chief-ministership and immediately after, the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls. Then came the manoeuvrings over drawing Laxman Singh, husband of a dear friend and brother of Digvijay Singh, into the BJP-fold, and after that the wrestling with the party leadership over the allotment of party tickets from Jhalawar in Rajasthan and Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh. Vasundhara had initially wanted Jhalawar for Laxman, but when the leadership did not comply (giving Laxman a ticket from Rajgarh instead) she wanted Jhalawar for son Dushyant. Given Vasus importance to the party, the wish was granted. And so there is now the campaign to be done for Dushyant. A pretty busy CM, isnt she?

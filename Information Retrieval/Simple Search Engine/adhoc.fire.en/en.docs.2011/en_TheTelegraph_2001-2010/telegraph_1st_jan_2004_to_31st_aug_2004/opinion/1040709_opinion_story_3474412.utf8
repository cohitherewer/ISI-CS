		 Friday, July 09, 2004 							 																						BY A REFORMER FOR POPULISM																														When a reformist is trapped inside an armour created by a left-driven common minimum programme, his condition is comparable to the existential dilemma faced by Prince Hamlet. To be reformist or to be populist is Mr P. Chidambarams big question. In response, the finance minister, author of a dream reformist budget in his debut as finance minister in 1997, has been a bit of both. The budget is part reformist, part populist. The budget thus lacks a clear identity. Like the curates egg, it is good only in parts, depending on the parts one wants to bite and chew. Most flag-bearers of liberalization and reform will find plenty here that is palatable. Equity caps on foreign direct investment for telecommunications, for civil aviation and insurance. Similarly, one of the relics of a regulated economy, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, has been scrapped and replaced with an Investment Commission. However, what is unclear is whether this commission will have a regulatory role or not. The taxing of long-term capital gains, another remnant of an economy driven by illusory socialist aims, has been abandoned. There was a pressure emanating from the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to eliminate the revenue deficit by 2007-08, but there was no compulsion to reduce the revenue deficit by more than 0.5 per cent of the gross domestic product this year. But driven by a buoyant economy and a good revenue prospect, Mr Chidambaram has provided for 2.5 per cent (of GDP) revenue deficit and 4.4 per cent fiscal deficit. The finance minister has thus underlined the importance of fiscal consolidation.																														Hovering between reform and populism is the finance ministers promise about increased expenditure on social sectors. The advantages of this are mitigated by the absence of anything explicit about improving efficiency of public investments. There is also the danger of valuable resources being wasted on public sector units. A board has been constituted for reconstructing them when doing away with them would have been more relevant. Tax reforms have been put on the shelf for one more year, pending value added tax and resolution of the service tax issue. But this is somewhat in contradiction with the hike in service tax from 8 to 10 per cent. Mr Chidambaram might have started a new trend by establishing a record-breaking number of commissions. Commissions only breed delay and nurture inefficiency.																														Budget-making, by definition, is an exercise in political economy. But it is assumed that the second of the two terms chases the first one in political economy. In the instance of Mr Chidambarams second budget, exactly the opposite has happened. This is a budget whose economic aspirations are constrained by political considerations. For understandable reasons, Mr Chidambaram has been unable to free his economic thinking from the CMP of the United Progressive Alliance. He has walked on the razors edge and it may have been an ordeal which he would best like to forget. There is no figure more pathetic than an economist trapped in the armour of a politician.

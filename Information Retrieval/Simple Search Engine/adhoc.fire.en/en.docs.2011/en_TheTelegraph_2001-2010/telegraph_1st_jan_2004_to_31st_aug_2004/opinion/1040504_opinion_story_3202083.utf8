		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 							 																						CONSTRAINED BY SUPPLIES						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the assessment at the 27th session of the Committee on World Food Security, 2001				 	 The price factor																														The third indicator is the ratio of the volume of closing cereal stocks held by the major exporters of wheat, coarse grains and rice to the total disappearance of these cereals (domestic consumption plus exports)... For rice, a reduction in Chinas output after two consecutive years of bumper crops was largely responsible for the expected draw-down of its rice stocks by almost 6 million tonnes...Bumper crops in Argentina...and the United States of America helped to maintain adequate coarse grain stocks to meet increased domestic and global demand																														The fourth indicator measures changes in cereal production among the major cereal importing countries of China, India and the Commonwealth of Independent States against the trend and the preceding year. For 2000, the indicator points to a reduction by more than 5 per cent after an improvement in 1999. China was primarily responsible for the downturn in production during 2000 in this group of countries. Following a string of bumper crops, Chinas production fell in all cereal categories in response to policy changes and weather problems. While the output was mixed for the republics of the CIS, the Russian Federation, the largest cereal producer in this group, significantly boosted grain output in 2000 after two poor crop years. India experienced another year of bumper crops, especially for wheat, which could make it a net wheat exporter in 2000/01 for the first time in 6 years.																														The fifth indicator focuses specifically on changes in aggregate cereal production of the Low Income Food Deficit Countries, some 80 developing countries which are considered to be the most vulnerable to fluctuations in food supplies and international prices. For 2000, total cereal production in this group of countries fell by over 5 percent compared to the previous year. The bulk of the reduction occurred in China and parts of Africa. 																														Because production in China and India could heavily influence the overall magnitude of this indicator, the sixth indicator measures the changes in aggregate cereal production of the LIFDCs, excluding China and India. Using this measure, the reduction in total cereal output for this group of countries is not as steep (-1.7 per cent) as that when China and India are included (-5.5 per cent). In fact, many of the Asian LIFDCs had bumper cereal harvests in 2000 including Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines.																														The seventh indicator provides a comparison of export prices for the major cereals. Except for wheat, international cereal prices have continued to trend downward during the 2000/01 season. International wheat prices moved higher since the beginning of the season, reflecting stronger commercial import demand and the expectation of lower carry-over stocks in major exporting countries. However, the overall price increase proved limited due to large export supplies from a number of non-traditional sources such as India and Pakistan. In some wheat importing countries, such as China, a domestic production shortfall was mostly met by a sharp draw-down of stocks rather than relying on more imports. 																														For coarse grains, despite the anticipated expansion in world import demand, ample supplies in major exporting countries coupled with large sales from China and abundant supplies of competing feed quality wheat kept international maize prices under pressure during the first half of the season. World rice prices followed a falling trend in 2000 reflecting bumper crops in a number of traditional importing countries. As export availabilities were ample, the weakness of the market exacerbated competition among exporters which had a strong depressing effect on international rice quotations. TO BE CONCLUDED

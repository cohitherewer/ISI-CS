The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 19, 2004 							 																						AGAINST LIFE																														Breathable air and drinkable water are the basic elements of human life in any form of habitation. Calcutta is showing the most dismal signs of failure on both counts. It is proving to be a city that is, as it were, against life. It has failed  disgracefully, unabashedly  to legislate properly against cleaner air. The West Bengal government has failed to take the first steps towards implementing international standards of air pollution control. And it sees this as a minor triumph of legalism. It applauds itself for having managed to get by the law and thus save the state from its own definition of chaos. The water situation is proving to be yet another municipal disgrace, being handled with a sort of helpless candour and ineffectuality. The recent outbreak of water-borne diseases in greater Calcutta has been traced to the door of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The CMC had been aware of the contamination in filtered water-supplies in several city wards well before the onset of summer. But it now admits that it could do nothing about it because of a lack of time and funds. This has resulted in around 600 enteric cases in four days at the Infectious Diseases Hospital at Beliaghata, which is having to pull out all stops to tackle the medical emergency.																														The official response has been, so far, predictably cosmetic and political. Health department bureaucrats have made visits to the hospital and assured all financial support. And the people at the CMC have been fighting among themselves. The mayor feels that the Left Front is blowing up a trivial matter. Left Front councillors have walked out in protest against the failure of the Trinamool Congress-Bharatiya Janata Party board to deal with the water crisis. The health secretary thinks that the situation is almost under control (although the patients are still pouring in). He has also reminded Calcuttans that the CMC is not to be blamed entirely for making them ill  cut fruits, lassi and sherbet at roadside stalls are also to blame. There are problems on all fronts. First, the water-pipes are about a century old and badly maintained. Ad hoc repairs are not working any more, and a complete overhaul is needed, for which there are no time and funds  yet the entire city is being dug up, apparently to put in new water-pipes (although nobody seems quite sure about this). Having no money is understandable. But what keeps the CMC so busy that it does not have the time to discharge its basic duties? This points, therefore, towards a larger and deeper cluelessness regarding the very basics of vigilance, foresight and planning (of time and of money). With the lives of so many citizens at stake, this is a criminal failing.

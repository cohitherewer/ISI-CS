The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 13, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Sadly, size does matter				 																																																				Sir  Finding a connection between operas and fat buttocks requires a quantum leap of imagination, but not if you happen to run an opera in London (Its over as fat lady cant sing, March 9). The decision to boot out the famous soprano, Deborah Voigt, and replace her with a slimmer and lesser known singer proves that even in creative and supposedly egalitarian spheres like the performing arts, a womans physical attributes are more important than her professional skills. This is sexism at its very worst. Voigts unceremonious ouster proves that henceforth, even celebrities will not be spared.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Maya Sinha, Calcutta
				 																An unfair world				 																																																				Sir  Those who believe that things are different in West Bengal so far as gender discrimination is concerned will have second thoughts after reading Forsaken by husband for giving birth to girl, (March 3). The conduct of Surendra Pratap Sau and his family is beyond condemnation. It is even more shocking that the practice of female foeticide is quite common in the state. True, such practices are mostly confined to the non-Bengali community in the state. But who can say that a year from now, the phenomenon will not catch up with the Bengalis too? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Two women from Calcutta deserve to be felicitated by those who celebrate International Womens Day with great fanfare. One is the woman who stood up and identified her husband as her mother-in-laws killer, knowing full well that the disclosure meant that she would have to fend for her child and herself with no support from her husband (First verdict: life sentence, March 10). The other is the ragpicker who returned the wad of notes which could have been her passport to a new life (Riches pale before rags, March 12). 				 																																																				The Telegraph must be thanked for giving front-page recognition to these women. A picture of them would add to the appeal of the news.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Meeta Das, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  One reason for baby girls being unwanted in India could be the expenses incurred during their marriages. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Janaki Nairs Just another anniversary (March 8) has correctly pointed out that in the Indian context, International Womens Day holds no meaning. Problems of dowry death, son-preference and unwanted girl children are on the rise. Solutions are elusive, especially because in a patriarchal society like ours, the state does not play an interventionary role in protecting the girl. In many ways, the state has also failed to control crime against women. 				 																																																				The main problem is the absence of a permanent institutional support system to help victimized women with necessary financial assistance and vocational training. The acquittal of the accused in the Roop Kanwar case proves that a cumbersome and tardy legal system leads to a delay and denial of justice. In the absence of a cooperative society, the state must adopt a proactive role. But moralistic and protectionist legislations can only complicate matters further.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Amidst the celebrations surrounding International Womens day, there were also news of gender discrimination and sex-selection using ultrasonography for facilitating female foeticide. These corroborate the societys shameless double standards over affairs concerning women (Cheap and easy for girl-killers, March 5). On the one hand, there is no end to talk about womens emancipation and empowerment. On the other hand, the society uses all possible means to ensure that boys outnumber girls. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suresh Behera, Ranchi

				 																Missing digit				 																																																				Sir  There was a printing error in the article, Glory or gloom? (March 11). Japans per capita GDP in 2001 was $ 32,261.00, not $ 32,26.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dipankar Dasgupta, Calcutta

		 Saturday, May 15, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Memories of torture				 																																																				Sir  While the torture at the Abu Ghraib prison has been almost universally condemned, we in India cannot help feeling a sense of dj vu. During the Kargil war, several Indian soldiers were captured by Pakistan. When the bodies of some of them were finally handed back to India, the torture perpetrated on them revealed a scale of barbarism that even the most deranged sadist would shudder to think of. The American escapades seem a childs play in comparison. No one is claiming that Indian and Iraqi soldiers, much less Pakistan and the United States of America, , are equal, but surely a column or two could have been devoted to the memory of these jawans?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Binapani Dutta, Howrah
				 																Fallen heroes				 																																																				Sir  The Indian armys admission that some of its officers have fabricated claims of killing Pakistanis in encounters is shocking (Lid off Siachen fake encounters, May 8). This is one of the manifestations of the mad race for decorations and promotions in our armed forces. The fake killings are a disgrace to the forces and a blot on the memory of those who sacrificed their lives for the country. 				 																																																				No one can forget the heroism and valour of our jawans in the wars of 1965, 1971 and 1999. The contribution of the army in times of emergency and internal strife is invaluable. No one is denying the role played by the army in Indias polity. But it is important to clear the image of the army which is one of the most respected institutions in the country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  Ever since the Tehelka took the lid off, the Indian army has been in the eye of several major scandals  Kargil coffins, and now fake encounters. It was ridiculous enough to know that the Indian tax payer was having to cough up millions of rupees for the upkeep of a huge and mostly inactive force at those precarious heights. Now it is even more risible to think that he also has to give out rewards to these men for lying to them. 				 																																																				The Siachen force should be scrapped and inquiries made into all encounters that have brought rewards to armymen.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.B. Sinha, Calcutta

				 																Vanishing space				 																																																				Sir  Recently, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation reduced the width of the pavements on the A.P.C. Roy Road in Manicktala from 15 feet to 5 feet to create more room for vehicular traffic. Such a drastic reduction has made walking difficult for pedestrians. The mayor of Calcutta, Subrata Mukherjee, may have been right in observing that wide pavements attract a larger number of hawkers. But doesnt the corporations inability to ensure this signify its own failure to stop encroachment? Moreover, can the mayor guarantee that the hawkers will not occupy these narrow pavements as well? In Canning Street, the pavements are about 4 feet wide and vendors have encroached on this space as well. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Hawkers occupy many of Calcuttas sidewalks illegally. The CMCs plan to grant licences to hawkers would further aggravate this problem. At present, political parties and the police earn a regular income from hawkers. Now the CMC wants to poach on them by making them pay the licence fees. The hawker menace is forcing citizens to take to the busy streets despite the risk of being run over by passing vehicles. The granting of formal licences to hawkers will make sure that Calcuttas streets are never free of them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Renuka Biswas, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The increasing number of accidents on Calcuttas roads are caused by rash-driving and the shrinkage of pavement space. Given that the government has failed to instil discipline among drivers, surely it can do something to stop the citys pavements from vanishing?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nilanjan Maity, Calcutta

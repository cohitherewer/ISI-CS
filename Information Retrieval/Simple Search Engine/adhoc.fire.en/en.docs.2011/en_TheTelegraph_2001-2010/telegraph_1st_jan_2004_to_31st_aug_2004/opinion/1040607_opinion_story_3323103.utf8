		 Monday, June 07, 2004 							 																						GOOD TO COME TOGETHER The success of self-help groups in West Bengal may be a result of the states capacity for political and social mobilization, writes Alaka M. Basu Sense of belongingNot being an economist, I have little to say on the economic platform of the communist parties of India. In any case, it does appear that common ground is being forged in the new alliance between the communists and the Congress. This common platform might be largely tactical but it may nevertheless work because the former will hold the latter accountable for providing the economic growth with a human face that voters seem to be clamouring for and which the Congress has acknowledged as a policy goal, at least verbally.																														But of course this common ground is not going to be the end of communist party bashing from a mind-boggling variety of ideologies and plain rabble-rousers. I refer especially to two kinds of loud voices. The first belongs to the political losers, some of whom appear to have taken the partys loss a little personally. Sushma Swarajs shots at Sonia Gandhi and her simultaneous valorization of the symbols of widowhood are an affront to Indian feminism, if nothing else.																														To these tasteless tactics must be added the rantings of a remarkably juvenile portion of Indias non-resident community. The emails going back and forth within some of these non-resident Indian groups need to be read to be believed. Living in the United States of America, constantly moaning about not getting all the rights and privileges due to them as contributors of US national income, they are nevertheless swift to turn around and decry any rights and privileges that are given by law to non-Indians who have spent decades living and working in India.																														But that is not the central point of this article. I bring it up only to record the appreciation of many of us that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has not brought up the race and nationality factor in its disagreements with or opposition to Congress politics. That is such an easy and emotionally manipulative route to take. It is also so internationalist in some sense  for it is consistent with the right-wing conservative patriotism that is the hallmark of much of todays Western world, with the current US government at its lead, of course  everything here is justified as being done for the American people, for American interests. 																														It is creditable enough that the CPI(M) has not buckled in to communalism, that it remains unabashedly willing to call itself secular. But there is also something else that the governing party in West Bengal has achieved that is important for more than ideological reasons. Operationally, the economics of the CPI(M) might be debatable, but its social politics has done much to win the minds and hearts of the common man (to use a phrase current in the US; that is what the war in Iraq is periodically about: winning Iraqi minds and hearts).																														And perhaps that is the way to go  to first achieve the social and political participation of the population  even for economic progress. Contrary to expectations, initial reports suggest that West Bengal is beginning to fare quite well economically, despite its arguably unrealistic industrial policies. But the state has also been, for some years now, doing remarkably well in the rural and agricultural sectors. While economists have come up with some persuasive economic explanations for this rural growth, I think there is also a sociological explanation that cannot be ignored.																														Early this year, I had a chance to see what this social and political engagement is all about. I was able to visit a number of rural self-help groups in the state. Until this visit, I treated the SHGs the way I treat all the programme descriptions in the Planning Commission documents I periodically browse. As one more addition to my repertoire of acronyms to mindlessly recite when I am bored or in need of some elocution practice after having taught the occasional unsatisfactory class. So I repeat, in deliberately changing order: IWEP (Integrated Womens Empowerment Programme); BPL (Below Poverty Line); MWS (Million Wells Scheme); TRYSEM (Training of Rural Youth for Self-Employment); SITRA (Supply of Improved Tool Kits to Rural Artisans) and so on.																														Until these recent travels in rural West Bengal (I am sorely tempted now to say WB) SHGs to me were but one more much touted endeavour to plan big and achieve little. I had heard of some flamboyantly successful examples, especially in south India, but also much that was disappointing. There were reports that many SHGs are floundering; that the women in them often end up taking loans from moneylenders to repay the SHG loan; that women are being taught skills that have no market; that the over-enthusiasm of the district rural development agencies is pushing many women into membership of several SHGs at the same time; that getting a BPL certificate to qualify for SHG membership is only a matter of money; that the requirement of homogeneous SHG groups is making them exclusionary.																														All this must be true, but it seems to me to be less true in West Bengal. Thanks to a politically committed local administration, there is an infectious air of personal engagement among SHG members. All the women I talked to were articulate, excited and relishing the company of the group to which they belonged. Indeed, I think it is this sense of belonging to a larger world that is the hallmark of the successful SHG in India, not merely its income potential. All kinds of obstacles  from domestic violence to an intractable bureaucracy  can be more easily confronted with the support of a group; problems become easier to bear when there are sympathetic others to discuss them with; risky innovations are easier to adopt when others are doing so too.																														These are not abstract advantages. They get reflected in several statistics on Bengals social development (and perhaps in its rural economic development as well). To give just two examples: according to the National Family Health Survey of 1999, 23 per cent of women in the state believed that it was ever justified for a man to hit his wife (compared to 56 per cent in the country) and 90 per cent of pregnant women had had at least one ante-natal checkup (65 per cent in India and 74 per cent in the much richer state of Punjab). However, these same data suggest that too much political discussion also spawns some bad habits  40 per cent of men in West Bengal smoke compared to 30 per cent all-India.																														There is a growing body of material in sociology that suggests that group membership is good for the health and wellbeing of a population. It explains, for example, what is called the Hispanic Paradox  the fact that the Hispanic population in the US has levels of life expectancy and infant mortality that are similar to that of whites, even though their poverty and health insurance levels are similar to those of blacks. Much of this is attributed to the stronger community ties among Hispanics.																														But all this is not simply to praise the functioning of SHGs in Bengal. It is to ask if the very fact of the success of the SHG project in the state owes something to a preexisting capacity for social and political mobilization. I say this, because I found almost the same kind of articulate interest and public awareness during field work in rural Bengal four years ago. At the time, I was interviewing women (and men) on reproductive behaviour; but the interviews revealed much more than fertility preferences. They revealed an unusual ability to take decisions, to demand services and to step out of confines of the home. These are the very characteristics that in the long run result in the economic betterment of a people and perhaps, at least some of the political strategies of the state are beginning to now pay off.

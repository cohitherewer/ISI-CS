		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 							 																						ONE MORE ROUND																														A circular argument offers only one option. An alternative argument. The logic underlying the provisions against rape in the Indian law is elusively circular. The Supreme Court, bound by the terms of the codified law, can only regret that the changes asked for in the public interest litigation filed by a non-governmental organization cannot be granted. That would result in chaos and confusion and not be in the interest of the society. Various NGOs and social organizations have been trying to get certain provisions in the rape laws changed, in the context of a society that devalues, and even ignores, the serious consequences of violence against women. A part of their effort was to enlarge the definition of rape from penile-vaginal penetration to forcible penetration of all kinds with the penis or with other objects. The effect of the latter is exactly the same: a destructive assault on the sexual and personal integrity of an individual. For the court, as things stand, such an extension of meaning is confusing. The premises of the relevant sections make clear that rape in its technical legal sense is directly related to the conventional meaning of sexual intercourse, that is, penile-vaginal penetration in heterosexual intercourse. Everything else should come under unnatural offences. This would imply that there is something natural about rape, since it is penile-vaginal penetration, even if forcible.																														It is impossible to locate the starting point of a circle. The assumed relationship between rape and heterosexual intercourse might offer the clue to change. The makers of the law could not have been unaware that boys are raped too. Neither could they have been ignorant of the effects that forcible penetration of any orifice can have on anyone. They must have had a purpose in limiting the definition of rape, thus also creating a hierarchy of penalties against penetrative violations, a hierarchy that begins with the division between unnatural and the presumably natural. But the thing to notice is that violence is not the issue, nor the destruction of a womans dignity or sense of self. The sacredness of the vagina alone is the issue. The concept of rape is thus premised on not just any heterosexual intercourse, but that privileged by marriage. Its focus is chastity, whether of the virgin or the married woman, and the law aims to punish violation of an object conceptually or legally belonging to one man. It is the same logic that refuses to recognize marital rape. In order to enlarge the scope of the word rape, it is necessary to break away from the circular logic and shift the focus of the argument to violence and violation.

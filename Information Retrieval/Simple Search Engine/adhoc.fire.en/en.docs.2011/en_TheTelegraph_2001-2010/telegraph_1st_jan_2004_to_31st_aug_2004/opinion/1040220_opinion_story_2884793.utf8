By Adrian Tinniswood, Jonathan Cape, pound; 12
The Great Fire of London of 1666 was far more destructive than both world wars put together if the sheer extent of damage is taken into account. 																					In this book, Adrian Tinniswood trawls through a vast corpus of data quarried from an impressive array of sources to build up a picture of the Fire and its causes and consequences. He has already written a biography of Christopher Wren called, His Invention So Fertile. This book takes off from that, for Wren was one of those who submitted plans for the rebuilding of London after the Fire, but had to content himself with redesigning St Pauls Cathedral, all but destroyed by the explosive combustion of Stationers Company stock stored in its basement.																					The book is well produced and illustrated from contemporary sources; the pictures are not mere embellishments but really serve to illustrate and clarify the text. It is an excellent guide for the lay reader, telling the story with a fine balance between meticulous detail and dramatic colour. For the scholar, it has value in that it stitches together material from many disparate and scattered sources, ranging over personal letters and testimonials from ordinary people, legal records, the diaries of Pepys and Evelyn, popular ballads, military despatches and state papers. It has all the strengths of good empirical research, with enough statistics, damage estimates, sociological data, blueprints, woodcuts, facts and gossip to delight young and old. 																					This book is not a scholarly history in the accepted sense. Although it is novel in weaving many unrelated narratives into a coherent whole, the reader will not find any startling revelations here. Nor is there any attempt to delve into the socio-political subtext of the Fire and its aftermath, and the urban society it radically rearranged.																					This is not to say that the book is without merit: Tinniswood is doing a difficult job here. It is hard to get the reader emotionally involved with an urban ecological disaster without sensationalizing it. Perhaps because of this, his style is competent rather than brilliant. This is a pity, because there is much of interest to recount, such as the millenarian sects who had been prophesying death and disaster in the year of the Beast, the secret societies creeping about with mayhem in mind, the madman who insisted on being hanged for the crime without a shred of evidence linking him to the Fire, the adventures of William Taswell, a schoolboy who roamed in the ruined St Pauls among corpses thrown out of their crypts and people roasted where they stood, and the tergiversations of various astrologers trying to predict the Fire after the fact.																					Tinniswood is strong on his portrayal of the effects of the Fire on individual people, especially the psychological fallout of seeing their city burned to the ground, and the terrible chaos, paranoia and larceny that followed. 																					He gives credit to the king and his officers for the low mortality for their prompt action averted the worst. He also bears out the traditional view that an opportunity for stopping the Fire was lost by the incompetent mayor, who arrived early on the scene of the outbreak in Farriners bakery, and famously remarked, Pish, a woman could piss it out, and went to bed. 																					A non-British audience would have appreciated a little more on the complicated theological, political and economical reasons behind the English quarrel with the Dutch. Tinniswood does go into the after-story of the Fire, when the scare over Charles IIs brother turning Catholic caused a revisionist view to blame it all on the Papists. Once the smoke has cleared away, one is left feeling that the Fire was essentially a local calamity. Nevertheless, the book has real virtue and repays study.						RIMI B. CHATTERJEE

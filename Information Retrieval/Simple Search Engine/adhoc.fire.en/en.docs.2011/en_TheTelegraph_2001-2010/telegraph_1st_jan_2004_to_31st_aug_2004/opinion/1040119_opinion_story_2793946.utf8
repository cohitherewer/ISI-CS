The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 19, 2004  EVERYTHING FOUL AND UNFAIR 
 With the vandalization of the Bhandarkar  Oriental Research Institute in Pune, the monster of fascism  has crossed the threshold, writes Ananya Vajpeyi		 In the name of the father The Bhandarkar Oriental Research  Institute has been an important part of Punes urban culture  for almost a century, and certainly a hub of national and  international scholarly activity throughout the postcolonial  history of India. To see, today, its ravaged book-stacks  and decimated card-catalogues, its walls bare of portraits  and the glass on its cupboards shattered, its ancient manuscripts  in tatters and its elderly denizens in shock, is first and  foremost to stare intolerance in its ugly face.  In no civilized society in the  world, in no time from the deep past to the twentieth century,  has a vandalized library ever boded well for a people. When  centres of learning and repositories of knowledge become  the sites of political violence,citizens must sit up, take  note and take a stand. Some were prescient enough to know  that this day was coming to us years ago, when Salman Rushdies  Satanic Verses was banned. When the Babri Masjid  came down, the writing was on the wall. When the shooting  of Deepa Mehtas proposed film on the widows of Benares,  Water, was forcibly stopped, alarm bells rang loud  and clear. With the storming of BORI by hooligans, the monster  of fascism no longer growls at the gate  it has crossed  the threshold, into the house that Gandhi had built. The public in Pune, in Mumbai  and in the rest of the country, knows it is witnessing a  sign of some sort  an event that points to not one but  several realities  but is utterly confused about which  way to look, and what to look at. Where are we to turn our  attention, as vanloads of policemen occupy the premises  of a decrepit old building that houses an irreplaceable  archive of research material recently attacked by a mob?  Is this about the protocols of  academic writing? Is it about standards in publishing? Is  it about the legalities of authorial rights and constraints?  Is it about historical truth? Is it about community pride?  Is it about the regional politics between Brahmins, Marathas  and other castes? Is it about Maharashtras peculiar electoral  arithmetic? Is it about Indias national honour and Western  neo-orientalism? Is it about the delicate relationship between  cultural sensitivity and scholarly practice? Is it about  the freedom of speech? Is it about the responsibility of  the state to maintain law and order, and to protect its  citizens and their public as well as private property? Which  of this welter of problems thrown up by the ravaging of  the Bhandarkar Institute, are we forced to address first  and foremost? My suspicion is that the most  critical question is in fact the one that, as Dilip Simeon  points out again and again, almost no one seems to be raising.  And that is  are we prepared to defend acts of violence  perpetrated in the name of our identity, our beliefs and  finally, our sentiments? The work on Shivaji by the American  professor, James Laine, must be judged on the cogency of  its arguments and the propriety of its methodology. Instead,  we are asked to judge it on the basis of the nationality  of its author.  Oxford University Press, Laines  publisher, must be judged for the quality of the book it  has put out, not for the feelings its publication may arouse  in some individuals or communities. BORI must be judged  for its ability to maintain, or conversely its tendency  to mismanage, the precious old and new texts that are in  its care, not for the caste of its fellows, administrators  and employees, or for the colour of the skin of those who  use its bibliographic holdings.  A claim about Shivajis parentage,  made by anyone and put into the public domain, should be  judged for the degree to which it is or isnt grounded in  empirically verifiable historical sources, not for its emotional  effect on those who might cling to baseless myths about  the great kings antecedents. The Sambhaji Brigade, as a  political force, must be judged for the extent to which  it respects or disregards democratic norms in building,  mobilizing and representing public opinion. Let us say, for arguments sake,  that Laines scholarship is mediocre, or even downright  irresponsible. Let us say that OUPs editorial procedures,  in this case, are not up to the mark; that BORI is a bastion  of upper-caste and foreign scholars, and that any conceivable  doubt about who sired Shivaji has long been settled in favour  of Shahji, the lawfully wedded husband of his mother, Jijabai.  Let us say Marathas, like any  group, have every right to choose their preferred symbol  and assert its sanctity and centrality to them. But does  any of this justify barging into the Bhandarkar Institute  before it opens for the day, terrorizing the skeletal staff  on duty, breaking furniture, and tearing up fragile books  and priceless manuscripts, in other words, what happened  on January 5?  In this country there are constitutional  instruments equally available to all, should different actors  in a dispute want to make claims and counter-claims about  what is true and what is false in history. In recent memory,  the blasting of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan and the  looting of the Baghdad Museum in Iraq ought to serve as  reminders of where we do not want Indian cultural, social  and political life to end up, right before our bewildered  or blind eyes. It is our prerogative as well  as our responsibility, as citizens of democratic India,  to reject the politics of injury and offence, which can  lead to no other place  promises about the revival of golden  pasts or the creation of utopian futures notwithstanding   but straight to national self-destruction.

		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 							 																						WHY SOME FEARS PERSIST Sankar Sen																					While ordering a retrial of the Best Bakery case outside Gujarat, the Supreme Court came down heavily on the Gujarat state government, accusing it of subversion of the justice delivery system. The presumption underlying both the Supreme Court directive and the earlier National Human Rights Commission application for a transfer of the case is that if the trials are held outside Gujarat, the witnesses will depose without fear of reprisals and justice will be done.																					That, however, could be an unrealistic expectation. Even outside Gujarat there are chances of witnesses turning hostile. The police can exert pressure on them in hundreds of ways and instil in them a sense of uncertainty and a fear of reprisals. This brings to the fore the question of the protection of witnesses, a subject likely to crop up increasingly in the next hearings.																					The Malimath committee, in its report, had highlighted the need to ensure protection of witnesses without affecting the right of the accused to cross-examine them. It said, The witness has no protection whatsoever and there is no such law. Yet protection of witnesses is considered crucial in most countries in the West.																					Protect them																					In the United Kingdom, the proposed definition of intimidated witness is somebody who, as a result of actual intimidation or threat of intimidation, may be in genuine fear of going to court to give evidence. Section 271 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1995, provides statutory measures such as giving evidence from behind a screen, or by television link, informing the court in cases where it is necessary to withhold names and addresses of certain witnesses. Many states and even cities in the United States of America have witness protection programmes and ways to coordinate the delivery of protection services to witnesses who are victimized. In any such programme, the role of the police in ensuring escort, transport and protection of witnesses is very important.																					The Best Bakery case has also brought to light the problem of perjury. This assumes particular significance in India since the prosecution here relies mainly on oral evidence. Witnesses are administered oath under the Oaths Acts, 1969, which makes it legally binding on them to state the truth. 																					In practice, however, witnesses often make false statements. Sections 193 to 195 of the Indian Penal Code provide punishment for perjury. Section 195 (1) B says that no court shall take cognizance of perjury under these sections unless there is a complaint in writing from a court. Section 344 provides an alternative summary procedure when witnesses wilfully give false evidence. However, as Malimath noted, such summary provision is rarely resorted to. To deal with the offence, the country has to enhance the prescribed punishment.																					More responsive																					The demand for retrial outside Gujarat was made because the investigation carried out by the state police was thought to be perverse and partisan. A partisan police are however not exclusive to Gujarat. The police are politicized in all the states. Structural reforms to insulate the force from external pressure and grant internal autonomy have been recommended by the National Police Commission and the NHRC, but to little practical effect. Which means, even in Mumbai, the Bakery case may not have an entirely impartial police to assist it.																					Another point in this case deserves mention. While hearing the case, the Gujarat high court had merely accepted at face value the evidence tendered by the witnesses who had resiled from their previous statements. The court had become an umpire in the contest between two parties. Yet in Ramchander vs State of Haryana, the Supreme Court had noted that when such a thing happens, the trial develops into contest between prosecution and defence with the inevitable distortion flowing from the combative and competitive elements entering the trial procedure. Judges cannot remain passive referees. They have to play a more pro-active role in cases as significant as this one.

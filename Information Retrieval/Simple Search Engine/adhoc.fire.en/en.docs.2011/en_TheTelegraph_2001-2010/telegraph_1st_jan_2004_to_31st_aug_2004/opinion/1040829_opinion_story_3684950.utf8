The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 29, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Dining out				 																																																				Sir  A dinner conversation could not have been more inane. The guest reciting his well-mugged lines on the states economy and the host politely acquiescing to it all (Rahul gets Mulayam bear hug, Aug 27). Dinner over, each knows he will be back to his old political tricks. Yet the tax payers money must be wasted to revive a useless tradition of socializing which two previous chief ministers found useful to further their own political interests. Ever wondered why Indian politics seems to be going perpetually downhill?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Trial and error				 																																																				Sir  Akku Yadavs case is not only hair-raising but also disturbing because it shows us the working (or the non-working) of our law and order machinery (Goon lynch case Aug 19). Popular justice is people taking law into their own hands. This happens only when the state machinery fails to protect its citizens. Akku Yadav could not have acted in the way he did had he not been sure of his immunity from law. The question that should now be asked is not if the women who killed him are guilty, but why did the state allow such a situation to arise where the women saw a collective murder their only way of escape? The incident is an eye-opener for those at the helm of affairs. But will they be willing to see the truth?Yours faithfully, 
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 				 																																																				Sir  It has become routine for the men in uniform and peoples representatives to indulge in the very crime they are supposed to protect people from. Which is why a rapist is found sipping tea with the policemen who are supposed to arrest him. No wonder complaints are not registered, and, more often, not heeded even when registered. 				 																																																				About the judiciary, the less said the better. Bails and anticipatory bails are given to even the most hardened of criminals. The state should either set its machinery right or else face summary justice from people. To reduce the alarming growth of crime and criminals, courts should restrict the grant of bails and insist that the accused appear before the court. There should also be a provision of keeping photographs of both litigants and their lawyers so that there is no misrepresentation.Yours faithfully, 
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 				 																																																				Sir  I agree with the editorial, With sticks and stones (Aug 21) that the actions of women in Nagpur and Barasat were not accidental. The two incidents show the publics, especially womens, distrust of the legal machinery. There is little doubt that in India today it is money that can buy one justice. No wonder many opined prior to the hanging of Dhananjay Chatterjee that he would have escaped his fate had he the money to fill the right pockets. The Nagpur incident will go down in the annals of womens movement in India as one of the most daring acts ever committed. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  Not a single media report thought it fit to use the words terrorist attack to describe the bomb blasts on two mosques in Maharashtra (Mumbai blasts, Aug 27). Had the same attacks taken place in a public space like a market, or, god forbid, a temple, we can rest assured that it would have been called a terrorist strike. If an attack on a temple is a terrorist act, why is an attack on a mosque not one? Yours faithfully, 
S. Gopalakrishnan, London

		 Friday, January 09, 2004 							 																						MYTHS IN REAL LIFE Diya Gupta				 	 Fiction unto facts																								Shining Hero By Sara Banerji, Flamingo,  10.99																								Sara Banerjis Shining Hero transfers the legendary hatred between Karna and Arjuna from The Mahabharata to contemporary times only to reveal that the issues of pre-marital sex, illegitimacy, sibling rivalry, the search for love and a sense of waste are as relevant today as they were some 2,500 years ago. Banerjis modernization of characters from the ancient Indian epic is innovative. Koonty becomes an impulsive and wayward yet dream-filled village girl betrothed to Pandu, the zamindars son; her seducer, the sun god, a Bombay film star; and the charioteer, Adhiratha, Karnas foster father, is a chauffeur. At the same time, the framework of legend is established by a four-line prelude to every chapter and chapter titles  Seduction by Suriya, The Song of the Gandharvas, and so on. 																								The characters themselves also recall myths by delving into the richness of their inherited past, the mythical realm functioning to shape their very consciousness.																								The book opens by evoking the legend of Soma, of Vishnu rescuing an endangered elephant from the Nagas, and then turns to the world of Hatipur village. The river flowing through this village becomes the dominant symbol connecting myth and fiction. The river, and an immersed idol of Durga, emerge as external representations of the workings of destiny  saving Karnas life by delivering him to his foster mother, Dolly, and dragging Koonty into a cesspool of guilt for abandoning her baby. 																								The novel is built around the juxtaposition of the wealthy, educated zamindars heir, Arjuna, and the travails of Karna, who has to combat life on the pavement, drug trafficking, sexual abuse and accidental murder in his struggle to reclaim his rightful identity. But both boys share an emotional vacuum at losing their parents. Karna and Arjuna, though, true to the original legend, never share brotherly feelings. The episodes demonstrating their fierce competitiveness  in wrestling, acting, politics, love  reach a climax with the car race from Calcutta to Bombay. Banerjis treatment of this final contest is sensitive. She moves swiftly back and forth from one brothers consciousness to the others, portraying the birth of hopes of reconciliation, which are rendered futile by Karnas death.																								As in Karnas life, protest at the unfairness of destiny also finds expression in the other strands of the story. Koontys sister, the dark-skinned and tall Shivarani possesses all the unconventionality of Draupadis beauty, but without its allure. Turning away from tradition by refusing to make an arranged marriage, Shivarani becomes involved with politics and activism. She is aided by Bhima, who, in being low-born and swarthy in complexion, is equally a non-conformist and just as committed to his cause. The major developments in the novel are thus punctuated by the rise of Communism, demonstrations, womens rights movements and child welfare organizations. Nevertheless, the subplot too contains potential for personal fulfilment in the imminent marriage of Shivarani and Bhima. The tragic is associated with Karna alone.																								The stigma of illegitimacy, against which Karna has to contend, is challenged by the cynicism of the end, when Bika, a woman with whom Arjuna earlier had an affair, tries to pass off her son as his. The reaction of the characters to Bikas accusation shows that, for the rich and famous, the genuine claims and the fake are all the same  baggage of a past towards which they are now indifferent.																								Banerjis comment on the notion of heroism is also telling. The epic dimensions of The Mahabharata entail that its heroes fight real battles and achieve glory. In Shining Hero, the heroes are actors; the battlefield becomes a movie set. Only Karna dies  untimely and unmourned.						DIYA GUPTA

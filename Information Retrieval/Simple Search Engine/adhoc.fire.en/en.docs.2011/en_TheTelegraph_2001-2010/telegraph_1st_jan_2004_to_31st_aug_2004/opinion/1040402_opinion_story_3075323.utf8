The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 02, 2004 							 																						POLL SHINE																														A test match has only once had political implications. This was when the Bodyline series nearly snapped diplomatic ties between Britain and Australia. Indias historic win over Pakistan in Multan  the first ever by India on Pakistans soil  has a different kind of political implication altogether. It feeds into a number of objective factors that swing things in favour of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The last quarter of the financial year has registered a remarkable 10 per cent growth. The rupee is at a four-year high against the dollar. And finally India is winning in cricket against Pakistan. There seems to be no apparent link between these developments and the political fortunes of Mr Vajpayee. But they do have an impact on the perceptions of people because they make them feel better and proud about their country. The common man who reads the daily newspaper or watches the evening news on the box hardly ever sits down to analyse the background of the news that he reads and hears. He does not sit back to contemplate whether Mr Vajpayee is actually responsible for the economic growth or whether it will last or not. He gets the basic information in the headlines and feels good about what he reads and sees. And somewhere subliminally and even irrationally relates that feel-good to the leader of the country. The euphoria about cricket adds to the general sense of pride and well-being. The net result of all this is a swelling of Mr Vajpayees goodwill among the electorate.																														The prime ministers spin doctors have cashed in precisely on these sentiments. They have played up the sense of goodwill and well-being through the India Shining campaign, and with a subtle juxtaposition of images, they have successfully linked Mr Vajpayee to the idea that India is shining and shining at long last. Mr Vajpayee thus appears as a kind of deliverer for a country that was a laggard who always sat below the salt in the international banquet-table. The India Shining campaign breaks this impression and conveys exactly the opposite one: India never had it so good, and Mr Vajpayee is responsible for this incredible state of affairs.																														It is obvious to almost everybody that the victory in Multan has nothing to do with Mr Vajpayees leadership. But given the following that cricket enjoys in India, a victory against Pakistan creates an almost fantastic sense of jubilation. Reason has very little to do with the spread of as intangible a perception as the feel-good factor. There is very little inclination to listen to a reasoned argument about the transient nature of this economic spurt or to the simple truth that one victory does not win a test series. The pre-election clustering of all the good tidings suggests, to those inclined to believe in such things, that the stars are in favour of Mr Vajpayee. Mr Vajpayees government has pushed forward economic reforms and this has contributed to the economic growth figures. He also took the initiative to revive cricket between India and Pakistan. These are now returning to shape the feel-good factor. India may or may not be shining, but the stars are shining on Mr Vajpayee.

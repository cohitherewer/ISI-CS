The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 							 																						PRECIOUS AND FOR SALE Shobita Punja																								The UNESCO convention of 1970 was held in Paris and its significant focus was to urge its member countries, among which India is one, to adopt measures to safeguard and protect its cultural property and to find ways of preventing cultural treasures from being stolen, exported and sold for exorbitant prices. The problems of illegal trade in antiquities are manifold.																								The first is that antiquities are so easy to come by for the smuggler and the thief. In 1982, silver objects were stolen from the Indian Museum in Calcutta by thieves who used just a ladder to reach a window that they broke open. In 1968, silver objects were taken from the Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai by a thief who just hid himself during closing time and let himself out of the building at night by climbing through a window. If this is what happens to protected antiquities, then try to imagine all our cultural heritage that lie unprotected.																								The government of India protects only 8,000 of her historical structures, monuments and sites. This number is ridiculously low for a country the size and antiquity of India. Literally thousands of unprotected buildings, havelis, palaces and ruined forts can be found around the country  with no one to care for them.																								There seems to be no particular favourite among thieves who steal anything, from sculptures to religious images ripped off walls and edifices of unprotected structures, paintings, illustrated or palm leaf manuscripts, medals, arms and jewellery and textiles.																								In response to the UNESCO convention the Parliament passed the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act in 1972 to regulate the internal and external trade of antiquities by the registration of those objects termed antiques  that are more than a 100 years old and of historical value.																								Without proper documentation of art objects, collections in museums, and legal protection of heritage sites that are not protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and the state departments of archaeology, there is little we can do once the object is stolen. There is no picture to show the customs officer what has been stolen and no description of the item. Police and customs officials are helpless against antique thieves as the sale and purchase of art objects are now an established business. As long as there is a hunger and desire to own antiques from other countries, there will always be those who are willing to supply them, by any means, even theft. To catch a thief We need to train our police to  identify an antique  imagine what a task that would be,  to train custom officials how to trace a rare butterfly  species smuggled in a suitcase and an equally rare historic  coin.																								Once caught, the penalty for the crime of exporting antiquities is a maximum jail sentence of six months or a fine. Under German criminal law, theft is punishable by imprisonment of up to five years or a fine. Many would argue that the Indian punishment does not fit the crime and hardly deters the thief from selling the rare and valuable art treasures abroad.																								Another problem is that different countries have different laws. There was a case in 1988 when a person took 212 bronzes, 66 paintings and 500 wooden objects as personal belongings and the free port laws of Singapore did not necessitate the disclosure of personal effects. The Indian mission was helpless.																								India is today a major sufferer from crimes of illegal trade in antiquities. We should urge the government to protect our cultural property and try to curb the alarmingly high incidence of theft of antiquities. It must be ensured that they remain in this country for purposes of research, scholarship and for people to use them as a rare window into the past.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 							 																						RITUAL RONDO																														Politicians in India follow certain fixed rituals. There are rituals of protest and rituals of exhibiting power. Power is displayed by removing governors, and protest is registered by disrupting parliament or by boycotting its proceedings. The newly-installed United Progressive Alliance dispensation dismissed governors, and members of the National Democratic Alliance, now occupying the opposition benches, stayed away from the presentation of the railway budget. The boycott is token since the NDA parliamentarians have promised to be back in the Lok Sabha from today. They have not promised, however, to maintain proper parliamentary behaviour. The NDAs so-called protest is being led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which stayed away from the all-party meeting that had been called by Mr Somnath Chatterjee, the speaker of the Lok Sabha, before the present session of parliament began. The BJP has shown itself to be very poor losers and now it is making a public display of the fact that it is miffed. Disruption of the Lok Sabha is, however, not a vice exclusive to the BJP: other opposition parties in their time have played the same game and with an equal absence of decorum and shame.																														The houses of parliament are two of the main forums available in India for settling differences and debating issues. To boycott these forums is to display a propensity for perpetuating dispute and disagreement. To stop discussion through disruption or boycott is one way of stopping debate. The BJP seems destined to go down this path. The argument that other political parties do the same  or have done the same  means nothing. The BJP and the NDA are not concerned with democracy or with principles. Their sole concern is to stonewall the functioning of the UPA, lest the latter makes a success of governance. It is indeed ironic that the helmsman of the NDA is Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Indias most experienced parliamentarian. But such ironies do not deter Indian politicians. Either they have short memories or they genuinely believe that the public is short on memory. Thus the participants in yesterdays power rituals are the perpetrators of todays protest rituals.

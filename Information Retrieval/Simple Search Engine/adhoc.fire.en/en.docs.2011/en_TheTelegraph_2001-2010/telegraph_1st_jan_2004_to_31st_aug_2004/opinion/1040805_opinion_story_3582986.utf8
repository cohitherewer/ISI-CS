		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 							 																						IS THIS HOW A ZERO FEELS?						A DAY IN THE LIFE OF Cheques often have a zero or two, and all hell breaks loose if you get them wrong																					This problem I have with cheques, it must have begun with the zero. The zero has always terrified me, waiting in ambush to pounce, unnoticed, on my carefully put together sums of ones and twos and threes, scattering the precious herd like frightened rabbits. An extra zero, or a misplaced one  the effect is the same. I never notice it till catastrophe comes, because it is zero, cipher, nought, nothing: an abstraction within an abstract universe. The injustice is staggering.																					Cheques often have a zero or two, and all hell breaks loose if you get them wrong. There is something fearsomely intimidating about cheques. The first line goes, Payor bearer. The hand trembles, the mouth dries. For it demands that you know exactly who or what you want to pay, the precise name and its spelling. You must be certain. From the first scratch to the last, you must be perfect, you and your pen. It must not dry up in the midst of the mysteries. Dates, figures, strange strokes and codes  A/C payee, for example  must be literally at your fingertips. You must also take grave decisions regarding whether or not to write only. Does one write only after, say, Rs 18,000? If so, why? Does it depend on sense of scale, or good breeding? Writing a cheque demands that you be infallible. But I was not born to be infallible, I have my human condition to prove it.																					On top of this, a cheque imprisons you. It forces you to one signature, one identity. Perfectly respectable philosophers through the ages have told us that the individual is a myth. We are all divided, of many identities. How do I know what identity I am inhabiting at the time of signing a cheque? Signature is relative, or should be, in the best of all possible worlds. I know that this is not, for I write my name the same way everywhere so as not to forget what I must write on the cheque. One is incarcerated for life.																					It is all a conspiracy to cow you down, to keep you in your place. The cheque is an instrument, they say, of that shadowy institution that looms menacingly over your life  the bank. But it is there for your own good, they say again, expecting you to sigh in relief. Without money, with zeros attached, where would you be? And without banks, where would the money be?																					Going to the bank is a horror of another order. The frantic effort to look indifferent as doors swish unexpectedly apart, and glass panels with heads gibber at you, is enough to shatter the nerves of any sensible creature. In some banks, you are made to feel like a creep for trying to interrupt the lady behind the counter in her banana-eating, in others, you gaze like a moron at fast-talking, super-efficient beautiful beings from a more developed planet. They both make you feel small  no, tiny, with your rapidly fading memories of defiance.																					Its how a zero feels, Im sure.						BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 							 																						WHAT ORWELL KNEW George Orwells vision of the future appears prophetic now, when terror justifies the abuse of the individuals right to privacy, writes Lubica Hauswaldova 				 	 Fingerprinting at the JFK airport, New York																														I am a target. Every day I get envelopes stuffed with offers and messages from corporate entities, advertisers and political groups which I am not even a member of. It is not an ordinary mass-mailing of stereo-typed advertisements for the general public. The senders are very well aware of my interests, habits and hobbies. I regularly get offers to shop for a particular style  even size  of outfits, artistic materials, invitations to become a member of a music or arts society, requests to contribute to environmental causes... My e-mail inbox gets flooded by offers to travel...not just to anywhere. To my favourite destinations. By now I realize that somebody has been watching patterns of my behaviour, collecting and analysing them and trading in them. Big brothers of big companies, organizations and institutions consider whether I am potentially useful for them. It is mind-boggling what they already know about me. 																														Like Winston Smith of George Orwells Nineteen Eighty-Four, I am not a private person anymore. Last week was the 101st birth anniversary of the British journalist and author, George Orwell. The centenary of his birth last year caused an outpouring of essays, articles and other written material about Orwell, including two new biographies re-evaluating his life, work and legacy. Very interesting and revealing are some new facts from his personal life, files from recently opened archives of the KGB and material released by the British Foreign Office.																														Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, in the former Bengal Province (now in Bihar), into the family of a British colonial officer. He left India as an infant and never came back, but also never completely lost touch with the country. Apart from his Anglo-Indian heritage and its influence on the Blair family, especially the awareness of class and caste and their impact on society, young Eric served in the Indian Imperial Police Service and was posted in Burma. 																														Witnessing the unfairness and injustice in dealing with native Burmese and Indians while being a part of the system administering them, he developed strong anti-imperialist views. The five-year experience from colonial service was utilized in the novel, Burmese Days, published already under his pen name, George Orwell. During World War II, he worked for the Indian section of the BBC and broadcast his talk programmes for Indian students in Britain and for Indian audiences worldwide. The beginning of his essay, Reflections on Gandhi, written after Gandhis assassination  Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent  has become one of the classic quotations. His second wife, Sonia Bronwell, was also born in India.																														His two most famous and most compelling books, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, were written in a decade between 1938-49, when the world experienced the terror of Hitler and Stalin, followed by the horror caused by the explosion of the nuclear bombs. Both works have been widely accepted as a satire on the Soviet Unions totalitarian communist regime while partly reflecting Nazi Germany, too. In the new, post-September 11 world, it is increasingly accepted that Orwell, in his writings, went far beyond simple criticism of the Soviet regime. In Animal Farm, we cannot actually find any conclusion or implication that a socialist society was not workable. 																														His criticism is directed towards certain corrupt individuals and the willingness of animals/masses to tolerate them. This tolerance is eventually a basis for unlimited growth of corruption and arrogance among the rulers. The lesser the alertness and resistance of the masses, the bigger the exploitation, oppression and deception. More than condemnation of the Soviet system, Animal Farm is a critical reflection of political naivete, ignorance and often just plain stupidity. Contrary to some popular perceptions, Orwell himself claimed, Every line I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it.																														The novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, published in 1949 shortly before his death, is definitely not just a description or portrait of a totalitarian regime, whether Nazi or Soviet. Orwell goes much further. He puts the events of the book into the future, into 1984, when totalitarian regimes of Nazi Germany and Soviet Union would have been the matter of the past, and Britain would have succumbed to a much worse form of totalitarianism.																														Reading Nineteen Eighty-Four today, we cannot avoid a comparison of its prophetic vision of the future with the present-day Western, scientifically-advanced, computerized civilization. A world where an individual has already lost so much freedom, privacy and anonymity, where almost every motion is somewhere recorded, collected, stored and correlated. Those are not just the usual records of birth, education, employment and eventual death. Your picture is taken several times a day: when entering your office, when shopping for your groceries, on parking lots, at sport stadia and airports. When entering American territory, your fingerprints are recorded as well. Surveillance helicopters make rounds over your heads. 																														Political parties use similar methods in identifying their target groups, their potential vote-banks and individual voters. It is, therefore, a big temptation for any government to identify its political adversaries and enemies in order to eliminate them. According to the Patriot Act of the United States of America, the government can legally spy on its citizens even without official approval of a judge. For instance, libraries in America have to turn over their records to the FBI when requested. Air companies compile lists of passengers for various degrees of scrutiny. If you have a certain name or origin, you may be subjected to intense search or eventually prevented from flying. A passenger with an unfortunate name, who underwent a thorough search before every single air journey protested against his inclusion in the watch-list. He was advised to change his name.																														The ongoing war on terrorism has become a convenient pretext for many governments to invade and abuse personal privacy. Without an appropriate legal framework, the growing disjunction between advancing science and moral standards gives enormous opportunities to unscrupulous politicians to track almost every move of citizens and political opponents. 																														Huge numbers of people, even in democratic societies, frightened and confused by recent events, by the constant and systematic media barrage and war efforts, are willing to give up some of their personal freedoms and civil rights in order to enhance and protect the security of a people and a country. Instead of pressure to create enough checks and balances to control our personal information being collected, circulated, exchanged or traded, they are prepared to give up our fundamental right to privacy.																														When the world is being increasingly dominated by technological progress and amoral politics, I re-read Orwells work as an acute warning.

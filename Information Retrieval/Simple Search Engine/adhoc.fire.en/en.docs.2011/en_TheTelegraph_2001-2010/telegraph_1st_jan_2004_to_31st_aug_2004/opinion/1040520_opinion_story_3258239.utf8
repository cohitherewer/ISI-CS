The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 							 																						DID ANYBODY WIN? It wasnt so much the Congress besting the BJP or vice versa, as the winners benefiting accidentally from the others misfortunes, argues Sarmila Bose				 	 A bad harvest, all around 																														Badalna hai, said the young man simply, standing outside his empty shop in Vishakhapatnam in coastal Andhra, when I asked why he was going to vote for the Congress in this election. No other reason. His co-workers agreed. They were discontented. There was too much mehngai  price rise. It was hard to make ends meet. They had voted for Telugu Desam before. This time they would vote for Congress.																														In the scorching sun of Kadapa district in Rayalseema, the owner of 20 acres of arable land was clearing the fields with a band of landless women, in the hope that rains come this year. The landless labourers described themselves as Christians. Landed and landless were equally discontented. Nothing had grown in two years because of the drought. Times were hard. They too would switch their vote from Telugu Desam to Congress. On whether the Congress could provide any solutions, they had no answer.																														Apart from discontent, the other palpable mood was cynicism regarding all political parties. Ankaiah, Lakshmanaiah and their group of goat-herders in Guntur, grazing cattle on fields that had also grown nothing in the last two years, would vote for the Congress. However, they neither blamed the Telugu Desam Party government for the lack of rains, nor expected the Congress to work any miracles.																														Even Congress workers had trouble putting a positive spin on the negative vote. T. Gangadhar, a local Congress president at Miryalguda in Telengana, was in full flow about the failure of the Naidu government to deal with the water shortage, until he stumbled over the Almatti project in Karnataka, which has allegedly deprived Andhra Pradesh of surplus water from the Krishna. Karnataka  I reminded him  was ruled by his own party, under the chief ministership of S.M. Krishna. Well, each state can only be expected to look out for its own people, conceded Gangadhar. And no, if the Congress won in Andhra Pradesh, he did not expect the Congress government in Karnataka to give a single drop of extra water to its parched neighbour.																														But of course, that scenario did not arise. Just as the TDP government of N. Chandrababu Naidu was voted out in the state elections in Andhra Pradesh, the Congress government of S.M. Krishna was voted out in Karnataka. The ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu was swept to oblivion in the parliamentary elections. A thousand miles away in the Punjab, the ruling Congress managed to win only 2 seats to the Lok Sabha. In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where the Congress was voted out of power six months ago, it lost the parliamentary elections as well in the wake of that anti-incumbent verdict. In Maharashtra, the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance won less than 50 per cent of the Lok Sabha seats and the Congress chief ministers wife was defeated. Even the formidable Narendra Modi in Gujarat was unable to prevent the loss of half-a-dozen Lok Sabha seats for the Bharatiya Janata Party, though he still managed to win more seats than the Congress.																														In all these states where the ruling party was humbled, the principal opposition benefited. In Andhra Pradesh, the principal opposition party happened to be the Congress. Had the main contest in Andhra Pradesh been between, say, two regional parties, as in Tamil Nadu, the other regional party would have won as the natural consequence of the anti-incumbency vote against the TDP.																														Sonia Gandhis leadership had nothing to do with the Congress victory in Andhra Pradesh except that the dynastic presence of Mrs Gandhi is the sticking plaster that holds the tattered remains of the Congress together. When she visited Andhra Pradesh, Sonia Gandhi did not even mention the free electricity promised by her local party leader or the separate Telengana promised by her partys ally, Telengana Rashtra Samity. If Sonia Gandhi had not campaigned in Andhra Pradesh, the result would probably have been about the same.																														The new Congress chief minister, Y.S. Rajsekhar Reddy, is making good on his campaign promises of free power to farmers and one free light-bulb per poor rural household without appearing to have put much thought into how much these policies would cost and how he was going to pay for them. Possibly all the TDP has to do is wait till the next elections to benefit by default from the tendency of voters to take their frustrations out on whoever happens to be in power. This may come sooner than five years if YSR manages to create a big enough financial crisis in the state, as poor economic conditions hit the poor the hardest.																														The Indian voter has long been known to vote negatively. With little to differentiate parties, all the voter feels able to do is vent his discontent by punishing the incumbent. However, equally interesting are the states where voters dont seem to punish the ruling party, even after years of poor governance. Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa are major states that buck the anti-incumbency trend.																														Interestingly, all three states are in eastern India and all are considered economically backward. In Bihar, the Laloo-Rabri raj may have wreaked havoc in the eyes of beholders, but after 14 years in power the Rashtriya Janata Dal still swept the polls. In West Bengal, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) rules virtually unchallenged since 1977, in spite of the states fortunes having taken a nose-dive on their watch. In Orissa, Naveen Patnaik has not been accused of any spectacular development achievement, yet the BJP-Biju Janata Dal alliance won 18 of the states 21 parliamentary seats. As it happens, the winners in 2 of these 3 states are on the Congresss side this time.																														Just as the defeat of Naidu, Krishna or Digvijay Singh threw up the question  does modernist economic reform spell electoral doom in India?  the victory of Laloo Yadav or the Bengal communists may well prompt the question  does developmental failure ensure electoral success? One possible explanation may be that economic backwardness and political backwardness go hand-in-hand. Perhaps performing chief ministers bite the dust because their people have come to expect even more, while the non-performing states are stuck in a vicious cycle of going nowhere.																														Did anybody win the Indian elections? Proclamations of a Congress victory are somewhat off the mark. The Congress won 145 seats, a success rate of 35 per cent (seats won/seats contested). The BJP won 138 seats, a success rate of 38 per cent. The difference between the two is a mere handful of seats and both are a long distance away from majority (272). The rest of the seats are occupied by a multitude of parties most of which are willing to align with either the Congress or the BJP, depending on circumstances.																														The largest chunk of Congress seats comes from Andhra Pradesh (29), where irresponsible populism may undo this accidental advantage fast. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu contribute 13, 12 and 10 seats respectively. The BJP, by contrast, won seats in the double-digits in 7 large states, in several of which the anti-incumbency factor may bite the next time. While the coalition of parties fighting the elections under the banner of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has lost, the winners seem more the accidental beneficiaries of others misfortune. The only certain outcome is the fragmentation of Indian politics into numerous unprincipled parties capable of almost any grouping in their quest for a share of power.

		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 							 																						TREAT ACCIDENTS SEPARATELY						DOCUMENT From the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention by the WHO, Geneva, 2004				 	 In safe hands																														The experience of several countries indicates that effective strategies for reducing traffic injury have a greater chance of being applied if there is a separate government agency with the power and the budget to plan and implement its programme... However, in the Sixties, Sweden and the United States of America created traffic safety bodies, separate from the main transport departments, that oversaw the implementation, in a relatively short period of time, of a range of new road safety interventions.																														The Swedish Road Safety Office was established...with responsibility for road safety. Though it lacked significant powers or resources, the number of road deaths between 1970 and the mid-Eighties was reduced...																														In 1993, the SRSO merged with the more powerful and better-resourced Swedish National Road Administration, to which the ministry of transport and communications delegated full responsibility for road safety policy.																														In the US  against a background of sharply rising road casualties  the Highway Safety Act of 1970 created a traffic safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA delivered the first set of vehicle safety standards and encouraged a new way of thinking about traffic safety strategy. The agency is responsible for reducing deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. It aims to accomplish this by setting and enforcing safety performance standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, and by providing grants to state and local governments to enable them to conduct effective local road safety programmes. 																														NHTSA investigates safety defects in motor vehicles, helps states and local communities deal with the threat posed by drunken drivers, promotes the use of safety belts, child safety seats and air bags, and provides consumer information on motor vehicle safety topics. NHTSA also conducts research on traffic safety and driver behaviour.																														While giving responsibility for road safety to a stand-alone agency is likely to increase the priority given to road safety, strong political support and actions from other agencies are essential to bring about major changes. If the establishment of a stand-alone agency to coordinate activity is not possible, then an alternative is to strengthen the existing road safety unit, giving it greater powers within the government transport ministry.																														The experience from a wide range of countries is that, whatever the organizational structure, it is important that the lead governmental organization for road safety should be clearly defined, with its specific responsibilities and coordinating roles set out.

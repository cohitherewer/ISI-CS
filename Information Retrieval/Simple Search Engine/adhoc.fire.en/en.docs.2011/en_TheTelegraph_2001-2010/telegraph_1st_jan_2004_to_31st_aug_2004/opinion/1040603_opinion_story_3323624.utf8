The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 							 																						FROM PINK PAPER TO PM Gouri Chatterjee																					A few days ago, Rajdeep Sardesai was anchoring a programme on the common minimum programme with D. Raja of the CPI, Brinda Karat of the CPI(M) and Sanjay Baru, chief editor of the Financial Express, on the panel. In line with TVs convention, the last named was evidently there to provide the counterpoint to the two left leaders. Except that, Baru wouldnt play ball. Sardesai was visibly discomfited at a discussion that just refused to flare up into the usual slanging match that television loves. 																					Barus mild stand on the CMP was truly surprising. After all, even the election results hadnt dampened his pro-reform zeal. For instance, he had explained away N. Chandrababu Naidus defeat as the fallout of a revolution of rising expectations because of which the voter demonstrates an anti-incumbent mood even though there has been a modest improvement in the standard of living. In other words, its not that the people of Andhra were unhappy with what theyd got from the Naidu government, its just that they wanted more. 																					Now we know why. Baru is going to be the prime ministers press advisor. He was just getting into shape for his new role as spin-meister of the Manmohan Singh government.																					Its not a role pink paper editors are familiar with. Most press advisors, in India and abroad, have been senior political journalists as managing the political fallout has always been seen as their chief job. A whisper in the presss ear that the PM is unhappy with Narendra Modis handling of the Gujarat riots for instance, while the PM waffles about rajdharma. But what does an apolitical prime minister with a supreme leader to take care of such tough issues need a politically savvy press advisor for? He would probably be served better by someone who can quietly leak to the press that the prime minister is unhappy with the lefts demand to review the Electricity Act  and thereby help the Sensex to go up. 																					For that the economics PhD from JNU, one-time rabid left, but now reformed, Sanjay Baru is eminently suited. As he wrote in his 20th May column, To be honest, the financial media is not particularly well equipped to understand the mood of the masses. Rather, we are into trying and understanding the mood of the markets. Now he can find out whether that is good enough, for a journalist and an economist.																					Beg your pardon																					It would be so easy to run down the New York Timess apology, eight days ago, about its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) reports that provided such legitimacy to George Bushs Iraq war. It took little courage or journalistic insight to do so now. The WMD issue has been all but given up for lost even by the Bush administration. Ahmed Chalabi, one of the sources that led the paper up the false WMD trail, has already been dumped by Washington itself. And the mood in America is no longer as pro-war as it was one year ago. 																					Still, the papers editors ought to be applauded, if only because they have done something they need not have and most, certainly in India and even in the UK, would not have: admit they were stupid, gullible saps. As Harold Evans, one-time editor of Times (London) and voted Britains best of all times, commented, American editors are not eager to admit error, but they rarely show the tenacity of British editors in holding fast to the unproven or the untrue. 																					Indians follow the British tradition in this too. Indian editors dont confess to being wrong unless threatened with a legal notice or other dire consequences. Have you heard anyone say sorry, we misled you about the elections?																					Yet again?																					Is Pioneers owner-editor and Rajya Sabha MP, Chandan Mitra, changing colour once again? The one-time Rajiv Gandhi fan had long transferred his allegiance to Lal Krishna Advani without any cause for regret. But guess what he was heard saying on BBC radio the other day? It is a tribute to the wisdom and sagacity of Soniaji that she has installed a man of such unquestioned integrity as the PM. Its sad that we cant see it as just sincere appreciation.

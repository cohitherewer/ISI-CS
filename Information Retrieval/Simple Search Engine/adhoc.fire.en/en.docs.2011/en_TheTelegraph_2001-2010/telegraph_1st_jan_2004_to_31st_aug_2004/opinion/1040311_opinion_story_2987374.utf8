		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 							 																						AGAINST FREEDOM																														The enemies of freedom cannot be the friends of poets and artists. Shocking it may be, but the murderous attack on the Bangladeshi poet, Mr Humayun Azad, is hardly an isolated incident. This was not the first time that religious bigots in Dhaka tried to stifle a writers voice. The attack on the countrys other major poet, Mr Shamsur Rahman, had earlier signalled the danger. There have been other pointers, including the killing of journalists, to the rising threat to the future of freedom in that country. But a far greater danger lurks in the governments response to this threat. A government that treats attacks on poets and journalists as common criminal acts is clearly underplaying the threat. Worse, such an indifferent response raises questions about the governments will and sincerity to seriously tackle the threat. One would have expected the prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, to be particularly careful about avoiding such suspicions. After all, the coalition she presides over includes the Jamat-e-Islami, which has a dubious record of opposing free speech and democratic cultural values. Ms Zia will condemn not only her government but also the countrys image if she is seen to be conniving at sectarian attempts at subverting democracy. For a country that depends so heavily on its donors goodwill, such a perception could be disastrous for its economy as well. Several countries and international agencies had earlier questioned Ms Zias commitment to fighting Islamic terrorism, protecting religious minorities and defending civil liberties. Its response to the attack on Mr Azad will surely put her government to another test, at home and abroad.																														But people may learn to do things while their government demurs. The public uproar over the attack on Mr Azad was, therefore, a sign of hope. The way students and teachers of Dhaka University joined other protesters across the country was reminiscent of the days of Bangladeshs liberation struggle. It is time to remember that poets, writers and journalists fought  and died  for the birth of this new nation. It was also hopeful for the countrys fledgling democracy that opposition parties raised their voices of protest as well. However, cultural freedom is too important to be left to political parties who have their own scheme of things. The threat to freedom is not an issue between the countrys two leading political parties  Ms Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League of the former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed. The government, the parties and the people have to rise to the challenge together.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 							 																						SUNSET, SUNRISE																														Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees dream of making West Bengal an attractive destination for investors moved a step towards fulfilment with the visit of Mr Azim Premji to the state. Mr Premjis company, Wipro, will provide employment to over 6,000 people in the electronics complex in Salt Lake, once it gets operational. This is not news. What is news is the fact that Mr Premji requested the chief minister, Mr Bhattacharjee, to provide him with a 40-acre plot for the development of a Wipro campus. This is a clear indication that the state of West Bengal  long considered benighted by investors  is now being looked at differently by businessmen. The information technology industry is at the forefront of this change and is its driver. The industry is now worth Rs 1,200 crore and is growing at the rate of 80 per cent every year. Various areas around Salt Lake and Rajarhat and even smaller towns like Durgapur and Kharagpur are creating spaces for IT industries and IT-related services. Calcutta enjoys certain locational advantages for IT: the existence of a pool of highly skilled personnel and low costs compared to Bangalore and Hyderabad. Bangalore, which leads the field in IT, may soon be surprised with competition coming in from its blind side.																														Mr Bhattacharjee, since he took over as chief minister, has staked his reputation on the industrial development of West Bengal. He has abandoned his past politics and past rhetoric. Investment has become his one point agenda. It cannot still be said, even by Mr Bhattacharjees supporters, that he has been completely successful in the project that he has undertaken. What can be said without a shred of doubt is that Mr Bhattacharjee has changed the investment ambience and perceptions about the state. Even a few years ago, it would have been impossible to even think of Mr Premji looking at West Bengal as a place to invest. Mr Premji is by no means the only one to see investment opportunities in West Bengal. Mitsubishi and South Asia Petro have already invested Rs 1,600 crore and Rs 450 crore respectively. Iron and steel have seen investment worth Rs 2,000 crore. The figures are not startling, but indicative of a trend. West Bengal now needs a big bang for the creation of a new universe of investment in the state. The present trend is by no means irreversible and the reverses can come from an absence of political support to the economic forces. Mr Bhattacharjee has to use the carrot and the stick. Carrot for the investors, and stick for the irresponsible elements within his party and for his political opponents. Capital in West Bengal can be notoriously sensitive.

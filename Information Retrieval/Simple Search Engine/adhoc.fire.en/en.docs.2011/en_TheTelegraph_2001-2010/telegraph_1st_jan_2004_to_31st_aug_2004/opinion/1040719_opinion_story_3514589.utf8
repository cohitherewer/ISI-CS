The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 19, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Sorry is hardly enough				 																																																				Sir  While it is well known that the National Democratic Alliance government had plumbed new depths of servility to the United States of America, its sheer extent was unsuspected. How else is one to interpret the earlier regimes silence following the body search of George Fernandes on two occasions, when he had visited the US? It is not enough to say that it was no big deal because Fernandes was not made to strip totally, or that most people who go to the US have to undergo the same. Fernandes was visiting the US as an official representative of the country and such treatment to him amounts to an insult to the nation. Can one imagine the uproar if any lesser nation had done the same to an American, not to say a secretary? Nor is Richard Armitages apology to Fernandes enough (Strip-searched George gets an apology, July 15). It is a sign of the hollowness of the NDAs claims of a special relationship with the US that the latter did not think twice about such behaviour when it would never have tried such things with, say, a Chinese minister.

				 																Balancing act				 																																																				Sir  Budget 2004-2005 is inflationary; what it gives with one hand, it takes away with the other. Already, inflation has risen to 6 per cent, as against the 4-5 per cent last year, and it may rise further. The thrust on rural development and the rise in the exemptions on the information technology industry are welcome. But prices of a number of items like housing, petrol, travel and so on will increase as a result of this budget. Thus the media euphoria over the budget rankles. 				 																																																				What is needed is a reduction of expenditure, not an increase in it by way of newer taxation. We do not need 70 ministries  6 or 7 should be more than enough. The bureaucracy should be pruned correspondingly. The industry and the economy can take care of themselves  look at IT. Whatever progress has been achieved over the past 50 years is in spite of the government and not because of it. Expenses can be cut down by over 50 per cent. Then we will have the funds for free primary education and other infrastructure needs. With over 30,000 children born every day, we need 40 schools to be opened daily besides millions of trained teachers. The government should restrict its presence to defence, home, foreign service, finance, social security and healthcare. All other ministries should be disbanded. This can be achieved by changing to a presidential form of government and getting professionals to run different departments. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramakrishnan Srinivasan, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is very irritating to find the left parties and trade unions cribbing over every measure the government takes to hasten economic reforms (Insurance blind lane ahead of Government, July 14). If the left wanted things to be done according to their dictates they should have joined the government and asked for the finance ministry. After that it would have been their responsibility if they ruined the countrys economy. Since they havent done so, they should keep their opinions to themselves. Hopefully good sense will prevail on Comrades Yechury, Karat and Pandhe.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Partys opposition to the proposed increase in the foreign direct investment ceiling on insurance and aviation from 26 per cent to 49 per cent is inexplicable. This is a party which had a full-fledged ministry for disinvestment and advocated economic liberalization while it was in power despite opposition from its allies. The BJPs opposition is proof of a negative attitude. The party must be careful not to act in any way that would show it to be as lacking in principles as the other parties.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It is good that P. Chidambaram is so firm on not rolling back the increase in FDI in various sectors (Tripe worry rocks budget boat, July 10). Even so, a few issues need to be debated. For instance, the increase in the FDI limit on insurance. The government must ensure that the insurance sector does not pass into foreign hands even as it is ensuring greater competition. Sadly, neither the government nor the regulator has evaluated the effect of allowing foreign players a 26 per cent stake in insurance companies a few years ago. It is not merely a question of bringing in capital. How much have these new insurers contributed to employment, excluding the numbers of commissioned-agents? Is the government satisfied that the majority Indian partner with 74 per cent stake calls the shots? Another and more worrying aspect is the smug feeling that 49 per cent will mean that control of the industry will remain with us. There is a possibility, in the cases of insurers which have multiple promoters, of the management passing into foreign hands. Also there are reports that the participation limits on foreign institutional investors should be excluded from the computation of the FDI limit. Surely, this is an indirect way of wresting control of Indian companies? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The 2004-2005 budget is confused, inflationary and anti-growth. It will have an adverse effect on the economy. Service tax, which is nothing but legalized extortion and must be scrapped, has been extended to 13 more services and hiked to 10 per cent. This budget also contains the innovative securities transaction tax, which will harm brokers and cripple the share markets.The 2 per cent cess on Central taxes is unwelcome too. To increase government revenues, there is a need to check evasion of income tax, excise and customs, and curb wasteful government expenditure. Besides, since the Income Tax Act takes care of the income of all service providers, there is no need for a service tax. Lawyers will make merry with the multiplicity of taxes, while the common man will suffer. Ronald Reagan had said, Government is a problem; not a solution. It is surprising why every government proves this statement to be right.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.G. Arora, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  Though the prime minister says that he will carry on with Atal Bihari Vajpayees Golden Quadrilateral project, it is evident from the governments lack of enthusiasm that the project will be discontinued in the near future. That would be really dreadful. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It has become quite a custom to offer symbolic sops to the army in the rail and general budgets. But what is needed are some meaningful concessions, such as raising the standard deduction to at least Rs 60,000 for those serving in the field, and taking the service pensions out of the tax net. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Raghubir Singh, Pune
				 																																																				Sir  Prabhat Patnaiks views seem to hark back to the second five year plan  which predicted that the public sector would make so much profit that taxation would become unnecessary (Just a little less brazen, July 14). Can he cite sustained profit making (not just showing profits in one particular year by manipulating the accounts) by any Indian PSU that faces unfettered competition and is not unfairly protected at the cost of the national exchequer? His recipe for unlimited spending by the public sector is an invitation to unlimited inefficiency, nepotism and corruption. If, as per Patnaiks arguments, the FDI cap in the telecommunications, civil aviation and insurance sectors is not raised, it would result in a further protection of the PSUs in these sectors from the competition that is needed to help these grow. What Patnaik does not seem to realize is that the protection of the virtual zamindaris of the incompetent employees of these PSUs will serve their interest, but only in the short run  it wont even help their children. For this protection prevents the rapid growth of these sectors of our economy and the consequent creation of millions of jobs that our country desperately needs today.

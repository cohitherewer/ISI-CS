The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 04, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Great expectations				 																																																				Sir  Whatever prompted Ashish Sinha to conclude that Nelson Mandela had won ultimate acclaim by becoming one among the many political idols of our Dalit queen (Mayavati crowns Mandela, Feb 27)? Mayavatis dream of emulating the South African experience  Mandelas fight for his countrys downtrodden and his opponents relenting in the end  is hilarious. Mandela earned a rightful place in history because of his genuine empathy for the people. His complete identification with his cause and his integrity assured his victory. It would require a lot of imagination to even visualize, let alone expect, Mayavati to be of the same calibre as this great South African leader. If her corrupt past and brazen attitude have not already made her Mandelas antipode, perhaps her sole objective to grab political power everywhere should. A pity that a right cause in our country should be taken up by the wrong person.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Pragya Sen, Calcutta
				 																Killing us softly				 																																																				Sir  Amit Chaudhuris The ceiling crumbles (Feb 29) is timely and based on incontrovertible facts. We have become totally impervious to the monstrous sham being enacted around us in the name of development. The Gariahat flyover was constructed at a time when it was least needed, hawkers having been already evicted from Gariahat. Equally dispensable is the storm water project on Southern Avenue. For many months, immense distress was caused to residents and traffic on that vital artery, under the plea todays pain tomorrows gain. However, one was appalled to see the place once again flooded during monsoons last year. 				 																																																				The A.J.C. Bose Road flyover is useful to only those who want to go from Park Circus to the race course area directly. Most vehicles are headed for destinations lying between the two ends  in or around Camac Street, Sarat Bose Road, Lee Road, Rawdon Street et al. As for the Park Street flyover, the pace of work belies all norms of public accountability. Incidentally, the same contractor is also responsible for the mess around Gariahat.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sandeep Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Amit Chaudhuris article reminded one of how natural it has become for Calcuttans to accept things the way they are and criticize the government for the potholed roads, the speeding buses, the bandhs and so on. This is in stark contrast to the scene in Glasgow, where I am pursuing higher studies. A consensus is always obtained from citizens for anything that is done for the city, and the media plays an active role in this. There are live broadcasts of debate sessions  be it with regard to new taxes or new roads  where the citys residents can highlight their concerns. Why cant the Doordarshan or Metro channels try doing something similar? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The citys development is restricted to south Calcutta only. It is probably not a coincidence that the roads or areas frequented by high-profile people are the ones undergoing repair or some development. People living in north Calcutta are hardly ever beneficiaries of the changes. Take the A.J.C. Bose Road flyover. Since public transport is not allowed on it, only a particular class of commuters which has its own transport can use it. 				 																																																				The roads leading to Sealdah and Howrah present a stark contrast. To reach these places, one has to pass through Mahatma Gandhi Road or Burrabazar, the plight of which is terrible. A ride from Lalbazar to Baghbazar via Chitpur Road and from Wellington to Shyambazar via College Street or from Howrah to Sealdah via M.G. Road is harrowing. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arun Ladha, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The relaying of tram tracks from the Gariahat tram depot to the Park Circus crossing is being done without any consideration for pedestrians safety. This stretch of the road is among the busiest in south Calcutta. Pedestrians using the narrow and littered sidewalks are at the risk of being run over by speeding buses. A large stretch of the road between the Beckbagan crossing and Ice Skating Rink plunges into darkness in the evening as careless shifting of utility lines has snapped the power supply to the street lamps. Work had started on this stretch with an impressive array of modern equipment. But construction has progressed at a snails pace, using mostly manual methods. Would it not have been prudent to complete the work between Gariahat tram depot and Gurusaday Road crossing first? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sakti Biswas, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Remember the numerous trees that lined the streets of Calcutta, from Moulali through Ananda Palit Road, Park Circus, Ballygunge Phari, Golpark and Dhakuria, right up to Jadavpur? Now all we see are burnt-out stumps where the trees once stood. The civic authorities are cutting down trees under the pretext of widening the roads. Under the new plan, sidewalks are to be narrowed. Naturally, the trees that once stood on one side of the footpaths have been cut down brutally. No one is bothered about planting five saplings for every tree cut down. Neither the authorities nor those cutting down trees seem to have knowledge of such a rule. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nikhilesh Bhattacharya, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I am a student of Class V of Modern High School for Girls. If you had passed by our school just about three months back, you would have remarked that our schools nature club was efficient. Now, if you drive along the same street, you will be forced to think that you have come to the wrong place. All the trees by the side of the road, which have been our friends since we were first admitted to this school, have been chopped down to make the street wider. We want to know what right the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has to cut down those trees. We have planted them, looked after them and watched them grow. The corporation has also displayed its cunning by cutting them during the vacation so that schoolgirls had no opportunity to protest. By cutting down trees indiscriminately we are reducing the city into a concrete jungle. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ameetosri Basu, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 							 																						INNER VOICE																														To get power and then to renounce it is to lay claim on a realm beyond the mere material. Yesterday, Ms Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president, began a journey of renunciation whose end is perhaps not known even to her. Contemporary India was witness to a phenomenon the like of which has not been seen since Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi refused the power and position that were his for the asking. Ms Gandhi, against the expectations and the opposition of a lot of people and political parties, was elected to the 14th Lok Sabha and subsequently was also elected leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party. Even a day ago, it had seemed that the question of Indias next prime minister was no longer a matter of speculation. Ms Gandhi was the obvious popular candidate. She has surprised almost everybody by exercising a more difficult choice. The Telegraph, in its leader on May 15, had suggested that the option of turning down the offer of prime ministership was always open to her. By refusing to be prime minister, Ms Gandhi has written herself into Indian history as a woman of courage and determination who is not lured by the trappings of office and power. She has put herself in an exalted position where greed cannot touch nor scandal diminish her.																														Her act of renunciation is endowed with significance because of what preceded it. This is emphatically not a case of the proverbial sour grapes. Ms Gandhi proved to her enemies that the people of India had no objections to accepting her as the prime minister. She could become prime minister, if she had so desired. The real reasons behind her renunciation will perhaps never be known. She has enhanced the enigma that has always surrounded her. Given the Indian ethos of valuing the notion of tyaga, the aura of mystery around Ms Gandhi can transform itself into the halo of the sacred. She has chosen her own path to serve India. It is not the well-trodden one, but the Mahabharata says that the path taken by the wise and the good is the true one. Ms Gandhi has opted for that path. A common saying has it that the top is a lonely place, but the cragged and steep moral hill that Ms Gandhi has decided to reach is even lonelier. At the political level, she sought to make the Congress a bastion of secularism. She has succeeded in this, but by a strange twist has perhaps made herself into a devi. The secular has been braided with the holy. To the new prime minister, she leaves behind an unenviable legacy. He will have to function perpetually under the shadow of a deity-like figure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 21, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Mistress of the game				 																																																				Sir  The deification of Sonia Gandhi and the undeserving comparisons with Mahatma Gandhi by sections of the media are a little early in the day. Her election to the newly-created post of a chairperson, more powerful than the Congress parliamentary party chief, means that Sonia will have Manmohan Singh on a tight leash (Sonia armed with coronation clause, May 20). The fourth estate has always undermined Sonias political acumen. First, she made a great show of renouncing power, thereby winning accolades from friends and foes alike. Then she proceeded to amend the CPP constitution  a move that gives her the power to sack Singh and nominate members in both houses. This proves that despite Sonias pious protestations, real power within the Congress can never lie outside the ambit of the dynasty. Singhs promise to run the show with the support of Sonia Gandhi is also an eyewash. With his wings clipped, poor Singh is a mere puppet who is bound to dance to the madams tunes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Alok Roy, Calcutta 
				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhi has taken the wind out of the sails of the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders. She has left her opponents deflated, belittled and with no issue to harp on. She has put to rest all debate about her credentials and ability. She has also proved that she is a class apart by the way she has single-handedly won the elections and then given up the highest elected office. This sacrifice has won her the respect of Indians as well as that of the international community. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ullas Pradhan, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  With Sonia Gandhi opting out, the elevation of Manmohan Singh to the top job may be a blessing in disguise. India will have a unique combination of men to head it for the first time. On the one hand is the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, an expert in his own right. And on the other is Manmohan Singh, an economist, whose expertise had opened up a new chapter in Indias economy. These two worthies heading the nation are exceptions to politicians in general, who are largely ignorant and power-hungry. These politicians were responsible for putting off people, especially the youth, from politics. If these two luminaries work in tandem, the Bharatiya Janata Partys India Shining catchline may come true very soon. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Aanton Mookherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhis abdication, though painful for die-hard Congressmen, has been a boon for India. It has given us Manmohan Singh as the prime minister. This is a dream come true for all those who always wanted a technocrat at the helm of affairs. But only time will tell whether he will be allowed to function properly by the assorted allies around him, and moreso by Congressmen themselves.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Whatever be Sonia Gandhis reasons for not becoming prime minister, one should keep in mind that they are personal and should be respected (Clock strikes nine and new script unfolds, May 19). No one can deny that she and her children have suffered immensely as a result of their association with the Gandhi family. Leaders of the Congress and its allies, who were seen urging Sonia to become prime minister, are a selfish lot. Immediately after Rajiv Gandhis assassination in 1991, Congressmen had begun cajoling Sonia to take up the reigns of the party  not even giving her or her children the space to grieve in private. Congress leaders may boast that their party is the oldest in India, but they are yet to attain maturity. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sonali Mukherjee, Middlesex, UK

				 																																																				Sir  It was very brave of Sonia Gandhi to decide that she would renounce the prime ministers post in the larger interests of the country. Her selflessness is in keeping with Hindu culture and her act is the best proof of her Indianness. She has shown that she is superior to BJP leaders like Sushma Swaraj who have been creating unnecessary ruckus over her foreign origins. But Congressmen too over-reacted to Sonias decision  it would have been more dignified if they had acquiesced in it at the outset. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhi has made a very calculated move. It shows that she has got the hang of Indian politics at last. Despite choosing not to become prime minister, Sonia can continue to influence the government since she remains party president. By her actions, she has gained immensely in terms of popularity in the media. She also has a better chance of making a comeback in the event of mid-term elections in case this government proves incapable of lasting a full term. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Saugata Chatterjee, Chicago, US

				 																																																				Sir  Indians have put their faith in the Congress in the 14th general elections. Given this, Sonia Gandhis reluctance to become prime minister is unfathomable. Is it because she fears that the new government will not last long or is it the fear of constant vilification by the opposition? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chintan Kaur, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  It has taken a foreigner to teach the BJP leaders a lesson in civilized behaviour. The biggest tragedy is that even Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not condemn the conduct of his partymen. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shailesh Gandhi, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhi has not only shown an inherent decency but she has also saved India from disaster. Had she decided to go ahead and become the next prime minister, she would have laid herself open to violence by Hindutva forces. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Ahmed, Dhaka

				 																																																				Sir  By continuously maligning Sonia Gandhi and her family, the BJP has only shown how petty it is. The Congress and its allies won the elections because they worked for the poor. The BJP, on the other hand, failed to impress with its rath yatras. The man on the street prefers leaders who are concerned about his problems and can reduce his sufferings  not those who want to breed hatred among communities. The Congress under Sonia has shown that it has secular and nation-building qualities. Sonia should consider grooming her children for prime ministership. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Geraldine H., Mumbai

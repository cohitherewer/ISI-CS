The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 							 																						THE CORRECT EQUATION Unlike most other parties, the CPI(M) knows that it can hold on to power only if its development strategy is woven into its politics, writes Ashis Chakrabarti Message on the wallAs you watched the exit polls predicting the exit of N. Chandrababu Naidu and, possibly, of S.M. Krishna as well, you probably wondered how these performers could lose elections. How do you explain the fact that they did so much to develop their states and could still perish at the hustings? Some had asked the same question last October when Ashok Gehlot and Digvijay Singh lost in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh respectively. 																														The bewilderment at the electoral demise of the performer-chief ministers is compounded by the examples of Bihar and West Bengal. How does Laloo Prasad Yadav prosper while Bihar continues to be in the pits? If not as bad as Bihar, Bengal, too, so far lagged behind the more prosperous states but still voted the Marxists in elections after elections. 																														So what is the relation between development and electoral fortunes? Or, is there a relation at all? 																														Struck by the fall of one development icon after another, we are now trying to find some answers to the puzzle. We are discovering that these prima donnas of development and good governance did it all for too few a people to win the support of the masses. They performed, we are telling ourselves, only for the rich, the upper classes in the urban areas who felt good about their regimes, while the vast majority of the people sulked. It was all a media hype, even we in the media are saying, and these leaders paid the price for believing the medias  and their own  propaganda.																														Then there is the other, familiar argument: in a vast country like India, you can never develop enough in five or even ten years to win the confidence of enough numbers. In other words, development is never enough. 																														The most common explanation is, of course, the anti-incumbency factor, which says that no matter what a good government does and even if it is for the greater good of the greater number of people, there is always this desire for change at the time of elections. The problem with this argument is the counter-argument as to why the people should want to change a government if they feel it is doing them a lot of good. And how is it that the anti-incumbency factor does not work in Bengal or Bihar? 																														Some would, of course, accept Mamata Banerjees answer to explain why the Marxists have stayed on in Bengal for 27 years. They would argue, like her, that this has been possible only because the Marxists have so corrupted the system that a fair poll is impossible in Bengal. The Marxists are here, she argues, because they manage to rig the polls the way no other party can.																														No serious analyst of Bengals electoral politics has ever accepted this as the proper explanation for the lefts survival. It is generally accepted that rigging is part of the malaise of the Indian electoral system. Some states have it more than the others. But to attribute electoral performances entirely to a partys ability or inability to rig the polls is the stuff of cheap political campaign and not a serious analytical exercise. 																														To get back to the question of whether development matters in electoral politics, it is possible that several of the popular assumptions were wrong. We are at a loss to explain this behaviour of the electorate possibly because we had very confused ideas of the relation between economic development and electoral politics in India. It is precisely because our assumptions were so wrong that we could not make sense of the defeats of Gehlot and Singh. 																														In fact, when Singh lost in the last assembly elections, some analysts wondered why his schemes to decentralize the government by investing powers in the panchayats  a la Marxist Bengal  did not help him as much as they were expected to do. Gehlots loss was partly attributed to successive years of drought, as is now being said about the farmers anger at Naidu or Krishna. 																														All these factors  anti-incumbency, drought, lopsided development priorities, and so on  may have played their part in the unseating of successful leaders. But I find a big hole in these arguments. Few point to what I think is central to the question of how development affects elections. This, to me, is the crux of the issue.																														Development does matter. In fact, it matters much more to the poor and the common people than to the urban upper classes. The rich can migrate to a more prosperous place if his native town or village is not prospering. Or they can stay back and still survive. But development is a matter of life and death to the poor and the common people. If the poor have to migrate to other places, it is primarily in search of food security. 																														So development is a desperate need for everyone. The problem starts when politicians try to don the mantle of economists. For Naidu, for example, the flattering image of the CEO of Andhra Pradesh Inc. may have endeared him to the chambers of commerce and done much good to the state by encouraging investments. But that is not exactly the image that could endear him to the cotton farmers of Karimnagar. The fallacy in the development theories is that it tried to turn a politician into an economist. To think otherwise might seem fashionable in these liberalized times. But the fact remains that economists, like all elites, deal with paper but politicians have no choice but to deal with people. So it is the political process, and not necessarily a development strategy, that sets the rules of the electoral game.																														The second point that is often missed is that a political party is primarily an organization and that the organizational factor can outweigh performances of a government. If Digvijay Singhs good efforts with the panchayats did not pay off in the elections, it was possibly because the Congress in Madhya Pradesh lacked the organization to influence or even manipulate the peoples perceptions. 																														One has only to compare this with the strategy of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Bengal. The party knows that panchayats can fulfil certain needs of rural development. But its real success lies in the manner it has built up a mutually beneficial relationship between the party and the panchayats. The result is that even if panchayats do not always live up to peoples expectations, they help strengthen the partys hold over the people. The strategy and resources for development are used to connect the people to the party. 																														A third factor  that helps Laloo Yadav in Bihar and the Marxists in Bengal  is the use of the political party or parties in marshalling the social forces. The Bihar leaders success has little to do with the states development; it is all the result of his ability to strike up a winning combination of social forces  Muslims, Yadavs and now Ram Vilas Paswans Dalits  at election time. All this translates into the right coalition that creates as perfect a polarization as possible. It is believed that the left wins in Bengal because of this polarization that prevents the splitting of left votes. 																														But even the left can no longer ignore development as an electoral agenda. Since the 2001 assembly elections in Bengal, the Left Fronts focus has shifted from sangram (struggle) to unnayan (development). Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is seen as the symbol of that shift  the Marxist who, unlike Jyoti Basu, has embraced reforms and is in a hurry to catch up with the likes of Naidu and Krishna. 																														No one denies that Bengal needs to make up for lost time in the development race. But make no mistake  the CPI(M) knows that it can keep Bengal only if its development strategy is woven into its political gameplan. And the partys organization is the pivot on which that plan revolves.

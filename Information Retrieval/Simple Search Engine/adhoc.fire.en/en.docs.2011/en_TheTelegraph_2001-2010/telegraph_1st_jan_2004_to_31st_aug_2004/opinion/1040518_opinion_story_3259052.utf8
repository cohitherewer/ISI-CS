The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 							 																						TRUE SACRIFICE																														High emotion will not change the Constitution. But the agony of Ms Sushma Swaraj is beyond being checked by such niceties. A television audience was granted a scene of this agony at its shrillest, as Ms Swaraj repeated her inability, as a patriotic Indian, to accept Ms Sonia Gandhi as prime minister. Ms Swaraj and her spouse are being compelled, they say, to resign as members of the Rajya Sabha, because it is only logical that, having fought on the plank of Ms Gandhis foreign origin, they would be unable to address her as Madam Prime Minister. Such logic confirms the wisdom of the Indian voter, for the argument is beyond not just logic, but all known processes of human thought. She needs to be informed that the defeat of her party is the defeat of the plank. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the National Democratic Alliance have gone through the electoral process and been found wanting. Ms Swaraj, in the summer days she thought would never cease, was sworn in as a member of the Rajya Sabha according to the rules of the same Constitution that dictates the general elections. To refuse to accept the outcome of the constitutional process is to refuse to be part not only of parliament but also of the democracy. Ms Swarajs nationalist logic should lead her to her greatest sacrifice, having to admit that she is not part of the Indian nation. 																														Evidently, the Constitution was alright as long as it kept her on strawberries and cream, or rather, on the three ministerial portfolios she held at different times. Given the total disregard for the Constitution she is now displaying, it is a small mercy that she did not wreak havoc on the nation when she was parliamentary affairs minister. But she is not alone, although the first off the mark. Ms Uma Bharti has found a righteous cause for her stridency, and Mr K. Govindacharya, out of the woodwork now that Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayees star is on the wane, has announced the Rashtriya Swabhiman Andolan, to redeem the nations self-respect. Defeat has not shaken the BJPs conviction that it alone can show the nation where its self-respect lies, and that it does not lie with the Constitution.

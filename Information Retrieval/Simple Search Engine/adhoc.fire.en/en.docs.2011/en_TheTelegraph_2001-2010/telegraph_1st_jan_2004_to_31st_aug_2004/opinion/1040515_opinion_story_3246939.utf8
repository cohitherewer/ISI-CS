		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 							 																						ARGUING THE CENTRAL QUESTION The CPI(M) can now be a determinant in the Union government, writes Ashis Chakrabarti. But will the party be brave enough to say yes this time?				 	 In a quandary																														The choice was a brave yes or a dry no, as Jyoti Basu later put it. The central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had to make the choice, as it met in Delhi on May 13, 1996. The whole country waited anxiously to hear of the momentous decision the Marxists were to take that morning about not just joining the Union government for the first time but also leading it with Basu as the United Fronts unanimous choice as prime minister. The rest, as we know, is history  Basu famously called it his partys historic blunder. 																														Exactly eight years later, this time on May 16, the CPI(M) central committee meets again in Delhi to make another such choice. Once again, the country waits anxiously to know whether the Marxists would finally take their first-ever place in the Union government. 																														History obviously has not repeated itself. There is a fundamental difference this time. In 1996, it was a United Front government, not comprising the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party, which the Marxists had to decide to join or not to join. True, the UF government could survive only on the support of the Congress from outside. 																														This time the big difference is that it would be a government led by the Congress. So, the CPI(M) can join it, unlike in 1996, only as a junior partner. That clearly is a major change but the question is whether the CPI(M) had readied itself in the intervening years for such an eventuality. 																														As we know by now, the central committee was divided in 1996 on joining the UF government and allowing a willing Basu to be prime minister. A majority of thirty-five members voted against the proposal to join the government and a minority of 20, which included Basu and general secretary, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, voted for it. Four members were undecided. 																														But the debate raged on within the party. It took the centrestage at the party congress in Calcutta in 1998, when the fall of the first government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee looked imminent. And this was how the party formulated its line in such an eventuality: In the event of the Congress being prepared to lead an alternative government, the central committee decided that we should support it from outside. The CC resolution at the Calcutta congress went on to add, Underlying this stand was the understanding that we should not enter into an alliance with the Congress but have an approach of issue-based support to the Congress government from outside. 																														But that was not quite the end of the debate. At the special congress at Thiruvananthapuram in 1999, the party came back to the question of joining a government at the Centre and amended the party programme for the first time since 1964. There was an explanatory note from the CC subsequently on the issue. Even at the Hyderabad congress last January, the CC maintained that the party would fight the Lok Sabha elections with the objective of defeating the BJP and ensuring the formation of a secular government at the Centre. It also categorically said that the party would not enter into an alliance or front with the Congress to realize that objective. 																														So the official line of the party remains that it would offer an issue-support to the Congress in case the latter comes to power in Delhi. 																														So when the central committee meets in Delhi this weekend, that remains the starting point for all discussions. Even the amended party programme says much the same thing that was there in the original programme  that the party can join a government only if it can play in it the role of a determinant. The difference is that while the 1964 programme had it for joining a state government, the same principle has now been extended to the question of joining a Union government. 																														Once again, Basu, who will be 90 in July, has struck a different note. Ever since the election results were announced and the exit of the National Democratic Alliance government became a certainty, he has been more forthright than the other party leaders. Interestingly, he has put his emphasis more on the fact that the next government would be a coalition than on the fact that it would be led by the Congress. 																														He is thus making a fine distinction and obliquely suggesting a possible shift in the upcoming CC discussion. What he is suggesting is somewhat like this. Joining a Congress-led government is not quite the same thing as joining a government which is led by the Congress but which is also a coalition government comprising several other parties. 																														Given the numbers that the Congress-led coalition has and the numbers that the left parties have, the CPI(M) may have at last found a situation in which the party can play the role of a determinant in the Union government. Those in the party who think like Basu also argue that now is the moment that the party must play this role. They think that it is absolutely necessary to join the government to give it stability. After the bitter lessons of past mistakes, which helped the BJP consistently improve its position, the CPI(M) cannot afford to be a party to any situation which may lead to the destabilization of a Congress-led government and a possible return of the BJP to power. 																														The other big argument of those who favour joining the government this time is that the party can play a major role in reining in the Congress from going the NDAs way in economic reforms. This, the section argues, is of crucial importance because the economic policies of the next government would be a burden the party will have to carry irrespective of whether it joins it or supports it from outside. In other words, if the party is damned eventually for a Congress-led governments policies, even the support from outside may not make any difference in the public perception.																														There is also the minor argument by the pro-government section that being in the government may at last help the party get out of its little kingdoms in the three states of West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. So a presence in the national government may at last help the party spread wings in the Hindi heartland, as envisaged at the Salkia plenum of 1978.																														Basu, however, knows he has another big fight on his hands. The present party line and the majority of CC members are still against joining a Congress-led government. He  and Surjeet  may logically argue that all the partys efforts to make the new government stable would lack credibility if the party declines to join it. How can the party convince Mulayam Singh Yadav or Sharad Pawar to join the government if it stays away?																														It is generally said that the biggest hurdle for the CPI(M) in sharing power with the Congress is the political situation in its strongholds of Bengal and Kerala, where the two parties have to fight each other. The argument is largely valid. But a bigger argument relates to the very basis of the party  it cannot go into a government which will cripple its core strategy of unity and struggle. 																														The country has to wait three more days to know if the CPI(M) has finally entered its brave new world or whether Basu ends his run with another experience of defeat.

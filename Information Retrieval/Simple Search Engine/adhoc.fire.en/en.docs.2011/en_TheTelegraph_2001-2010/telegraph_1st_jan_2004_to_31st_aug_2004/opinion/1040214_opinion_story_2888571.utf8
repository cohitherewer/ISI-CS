The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 14, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Whats in a show?				 																																																				Sir  Theres no biz like showbiz. The controversy surrounding the outrageous stunt of singers Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake during the Super Bowl Half-time Show last week proves it once more. Although people have long stopped doubting the extent to which stars can take matters to grab attention, the Lips buttoned on Janet expose (Feb 10) still shocked. For never before have artistes seemed so totally in control of music companies. So while an ambitious Timberlake got away with a fake apology, an established singer like Jackson had to take all the blame for a publicity stunt gone sour.

				 																Womens world				 																																																				Sir  The Bankura incident highlights the pitfalls of the increasingly common practice of compelling the rapist to marry the victim. The editorial, Old story (Feb 9), reminds us that the practice merely serves to perpetuate the crime since the rapist gets away without being brought to justice. In fact, it is a double punishment for the victim to get married to the very person who has violated her. Unfortunately, this practice has wide acceptance because the rape victim is still considered a social burden. It speaks volumes about our misconceptions.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sujit De, Sodepur

				 																																																				Sir  The recent trend of women marrying younger men may have crucial social implications for the future, especially since the practice is now neither restricted to famous personalities alone nor to foreign countries (More older women marrying toyboys, Dec 13). The trend, which breaks with convention, reflects the changing notions of marriage. Compatibility is the factor that keeps a marriage going, and here the social strictures regarding the age difference are hardly relevant.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Nilanjana S. Roys The, er, humans room (Feb 8) was a little confusing. She advocates loos that can be used by either gender, but how far is it possible in practice? In many countries, as also in India, loos are not always closets with commodes. In offices, mens loos are built in a way so that they are more cost effective. In this regard, Roys suggestion, though futuristic, is impossible to implement here in India.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Piyush Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is always good news when a criminal gets the punishment he deserves. The report, 10 years in jail for tease trio (Dec 20), is even more welcome because perpetrators of crime against women in India manage to get away some way or the other. What is more, the courage of the spirited Nargis Yashmin to fight back has paid off after all these years. It is this courage that has inspired her suitor and former tutor, Deshdulal Chatterjee. The incident has another dimension to it. The fact that religion did not come in the way of the marriage is another positive indicator for society. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N. Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  While evolutionary biologists have come up with their novel theories about why the beauty of a woman also signals that she has greater reproductive health and fertility, one wonders if the same can be said for the man too (More to beauty than what beholder sees, Feb 6). If the volume height index is a measure of female attractiveness, what does one look for in a man? What is the male equivalent of such an index? Or is it that such indices are not necessary at all?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vinita Rabbi, Calcutta

				 																With due respect				 																																																				Sir  This refers to the report, Bangladeshi tag on Allauddin (Feb 7). The minister of state for culture, government of Madhya Pradesh, Anup Mishra, has full respect for Ustad Allauddin Khan and has nothing against the naming of the Sangeet Akademi after his name. There is no proposal to rename Allauddin Khan Sangeet Academy. He wants another academy or institution dedicated to the memory of the great musician of India, Tansen.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pralay Shrivastava, department of public relations, government of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal

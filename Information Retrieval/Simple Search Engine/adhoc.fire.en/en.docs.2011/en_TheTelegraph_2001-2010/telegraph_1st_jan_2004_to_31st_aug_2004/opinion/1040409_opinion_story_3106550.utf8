I miss my mind. Thus John Sparrow, the quondam warden of All Souls in a verse entitled Growing Old. Ageing can be funny but it is invariably poignant. What can be more sad than a human being gradually losing control over himself? Some age gracefully and the really gifted ones manage to grow old with their humour intact. These select few laugh at their own foibles and make the world laugh with them.																														This book is a collection of poems about getting old. But in a direct and obvious reference to the idea of a second childhood, the inspiration of the book is A.A. Milnes classic Now We Are Six. All the poems here are a reworking of Milnes poems to fit the conditions of old age. Thus Cherry Stones becomes So Farewell Then whose concluding lines are Obituaries are not what you might call a cause for glee  /Unless, of course, the subjects are miles senior to me.																														If Only after Milnes At Home laments the passing of time and looks back a trifle nostalgically: I want a scorcher/ (A Page Three Scorcher);/ I want a nymphette to come to tea with me./ Id give her crumpets/ (Toasted, buttery)/ And chocolate Bath Olivers and Earl Grey tea.// Id love a bimbo/ (A dolly-bird, an eyeful);/ The sort of bird I used to know at twenty-one./ But now Im an old geezer/ (With short sight and dentures),/ I reckon Id be happy with just anyone.																														The refusal of time to move, the bane of retirement and old age and the growing indifference to all things are captured most movingly in If tea were lunch and lunch were tea,/ Id eat roast beef at half-past three./ If lunch were tea and tea were lunch,/ I frankly wouldnt care a bunch.																														Perhaps one of the best known of Milnes poems is the one describing a pious Christopher Robin saying his prayers. The poem was called Vespers. Here it is rendered thus, Little man sits up alone in his bed;/ Pulls at his ear-lobe, scratches his head/ Well, well, what do you know?/ Roddy Scott-Johnstone is reading Hello.																														The companionship of old age is captured when an ageing couple has no one else save themselves: Wherever I am, theres always You,/ Theres always You and Me./ Whatever I do, you want to do:/ Where are you off to today? say you./ Im going to visit some friends in Kew./ Well, oddly enough, you say to me,/ Im heading out that way too.																														The elderlys ability to laugh at their failings is memorably recorded in the following: Can anyone tell me?/ Does anyone know?/ Where does wind come from/ Down there below?/ I go to a concert/ Of Bach or Mozart / Up goes the baton,/ Out comes a fart.../ Im playing a bridge hand / The usual stuff / I bid seven diamonds,/ And suddenly guff./ Im sitting at dinner/ With stylish aplomb / I sneeze: the result is/ A hydrogen bomb./ Can anyone tell me?/ Does anyone know?/ Where does wind come from?/ And where does it go?																														Most of the verses here are as funny and as good as those that served as the inspiration. There cannot be higher praise than that.

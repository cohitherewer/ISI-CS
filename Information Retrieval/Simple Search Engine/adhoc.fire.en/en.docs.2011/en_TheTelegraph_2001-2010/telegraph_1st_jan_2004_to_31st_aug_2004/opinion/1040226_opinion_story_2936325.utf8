The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 							 																						FRAUD SEASON																														All politicians love play-acting, but elections are the time when they must put up their most innovative shows. Little surprise, therefore, that Jharkhands chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, thought up a novel one to woo the poorest of voters. He played the brides father at a mass marriage ceremony at which 720 couples from poor families tied the knot. Clearly, there is more to it than the good Samaritans story. Mr Mundas promise to allocate Rs 40 crore in the states budget next year for similar state-funded weddings for families below the poverty line is familiar stuff that Indian elections are made of. The idea obviously is to help the ruling National Democratic Alliance at the hustings more than to help the poor families. That such brazen political campaigns are carried out at the taxpayers expense betrays the cynicism that marks electoral politics in India. Mr Munda cannot hope to deceive even the supposed beneficiaries of the scheme that it can make a difference to their lives. 																														Yet his government could change things for the poor with some real poverty-alleviation schemes. For nearly half of the states population that lives below the poverty line, even the funds kept aside for mass marriages could be better utilized. The poor in Jharkhand need drinking water, primary healthcare and basic education much more than seasonal doles from the government. Linking remote villages to roads and other infrastructure could create conditions for their real economic uplift. The governments best bet is to reduce the economic deprivations and social injustices that often make the states poor tribals vulnerable to extremist politics. But a government that ignores all this and takes to clap-trap politics instead is guilty on two counts. It makes a mockery of the basic tenets of governance. Worse still, such a ploy is an elaborate fraud on the poor themselves. Mr Munda may himself feel good about his poll histrionics, but he cannot be unaware that it is no solution to the problems of Jharkhands poverty. But then, elections are the season when politicians tend to get more unreal than usual.

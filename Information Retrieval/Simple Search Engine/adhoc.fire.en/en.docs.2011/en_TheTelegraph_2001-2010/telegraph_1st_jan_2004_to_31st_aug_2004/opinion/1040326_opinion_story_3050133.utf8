		 Friday, March 26, 2004 							 																						SMALL IS PROFITABLE				 	 Size doesnt matter																														The book business, newspapers, films and television have everything to do with words or pictures, or both. So they are clubbed together as the communications industry. But there is an important difference between book publishing and its much richer cousins  unlike the latter, it can operate on a much smaller scale. To give a rule-of-thumb analysis: For the survival of print or visual journalism, you need a market of at least 30,000 copies (a rock bottom figure) plus advertisement revenues to break even; In the book business, you could make do with a print run of 500 copies. In fact, print runs have come down to just 300 copies, especially for specialized academic monographs. Hence publishers have been doing well for themselves.																														Basically, there are three factors responsible for this phenomenon. First, very low overhead costs; second, recent advances in print technology; and finally, outsourcing work that minimizes fixed costs.																														Low overhead costs imply cutting down of establishment expenses, plus a small but competent editorial and production staff. Usually publishers operate out of two-roomed establishments with a skeletal staff who do everything  from typing the manuscript, editing and designing it on computer screens, and then passing on the finished product to the printers on a CD or magnetic tapes.																														While in-house work has cut composing costs (usually 15 per cent of the total cost of production), the biggest savings have been made because of advances in print technology. Unlike the mid-Nineties, when the printer had to make film positives and then superimpose them on photosensitive plates, films are no longer a necessity; the printer can get his output straight from the CD or magnetic tapes, eliminating film costs. This ensures a further saving of at least 10 per cent.																														Marketing is the biggest hurdle Indian publishers have to cross. Owing to insufficient retail outlets, nearly half the staff is employed in the sales and marketing departments. The cost of sales, that is, the discount that has to be given to the retailer has gone up to 40 per cent of the book price.																														Here is the breakdown. If the cost of making a single copy of the book is Rs 20, and the price is Rs 100 (for most general books, the ratio between cost and price is 1:5), the publisher has to give away 40 per cent which leaves him with Rs 60. Take away 10 per cent for authors royalties, and a further 10 per cent forsundry overheads, and the publisher is left with Rs 20. This is not enough as there is no guarantee that all the copies would be sold.																														So, the publisher tries to eliminate the bookseller to the extent possible, and go to the buyer directly. He does this by mailing the publicity materials to the potential buyers or by handing over the entire stock to a wholesaler at say 50 per cent, and let him organize the marketing and sales. Although not the best solution, this cuts down the marketing and sales staff and makes the operation viable.																														Over the last five years, a large number of small publishers has cropped up. They understand the nuances of this business, and manage to survive with small print runs and a tight control on costs. Quite a few have done well by publishing quality products for niche markets.						RAVI VYAS

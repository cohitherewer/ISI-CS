The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 17, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The real king				 																																																				Sir  The Brian Lara versus Sachin Tendulkar duel has been decisively settled in favour of the Trinidadian given his versatile cricketing skills (A shot in the arm for Windies, April 15). Lara has won and saved numerous matches for the West Indies, something Tendulkar cannot lay claim to. Unlike Tendulkar, the Carribean skipper shoulders the Windies batting-burden virtually alone. Laras captaincy, in sum, has also been much better than Tendulkars. Finally, Laras superlative feat at Antigua is in stark contrast to Tendulkars struggle against the likes of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami.

				 																Rising son				 																																																				Sir  In all the hullabaloo over Rahul Gandhis decision to contest from Amethi, the Indian media seems to have forgotten that politics has never been the first love of either Rahul or his father  it was forced on them (Heavy artillery booms on both sides, April 6). The former prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, was compelled to take up the reigns of the country after the death of his mother, Indira Gandhi. Similarly, the entry of an initially reluctant Rahul Gandhi into politics is owing to the electorates refusal to accept his mother, Sonia Gandhi, as their leader. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  The frenzied response in Amethi to an inexperienced politician like Rahul Gandhi exposes the lack of political awareness among the electorate. The manner in which the Nehru-Gandhi name is still being exploited by the Congress is a matter of shame. The speeches of this fifth-generation Gandhi show that though the family name may see him through this election, he needs several more elections to gain political maturity.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avinash Gupta, Hooghly

				 																																																				Sir  Rahul Gandhis official entry into politics is proof of the fact that Indians cannot do without an icon. The people of this country love to emulate their heroes, be they political or filmi. Rahul Gandhi may hail from a family which has produced several prime ministers, but why should the ordinary Indian underestimate himself? The people of India should show some confidence in their abilities instead of following their icons blindly.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T. Bandyopadhyay, Middlesex, UK

				 																																																				Sir  Though opinion polls indicate that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance is likely to return to power, Rahul Gandhis induction into politics may queer the pitch for the ruling alliance (A matter of opinion, April 4). 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Rahul Gandhis candidature will add some teeth to the Congress campaign. But the partys slogan, BJP ka Lanka, jalayenge Priyanka is amusing. One wonders what kind of connection is being hinted at. After all, Hanuman, who destroyed Lanka, was male and a great devotee of Lord Ram.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Our superannuated netas need to be replaced with young politicians like Rahul Gandhi to inject fresh blood into Indian politics 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta

				 																Go slow?				 																																																				Sir  In The road less taken (April 11), Avijit Ghosh writes that truck drivers do not use the Mumbai-Pune expressway frequently. Instead of finding fault with the project, Ghosh should have tried to educate potential users about the advantages of the expressway. The expressways main aim was to reduce traffic congestion. The fact that one does not see a vehicle for minutes together is testimony to its success. Also, carcasses of lorries were not seen earlier, since they plunged straight into the valley. Now someone can at least rescue the driver, if not the vehicle. Finally, Ghosh should be reminded that in western India, we prefer smoother roads than the ones found in Calcutta.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

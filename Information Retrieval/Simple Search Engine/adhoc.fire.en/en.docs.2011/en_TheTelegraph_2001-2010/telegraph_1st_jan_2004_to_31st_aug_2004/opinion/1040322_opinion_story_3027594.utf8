The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 22, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Women beware				 																																																				Sir  Even if the Election Commission has framed a model code of conduct, it obviously does not give sleepless nights to the Bharatiya Janata Party chief in Uttar Pradesh, Vinay Katiyar (Gandhari-Helen parallel poisons air, March 19). Katiyar stretched his imagination a little too far to conclude that a woman in the Indian political scene can only spell disaster. Surely his own comrades from the fairer sex will keep him at arms length from now. He went on to comment that Sonia Gandhi was responsible for all the ills that befell the Nehru-Gandhi family ever since she became a part of it. Katiyars comments could be used by the EC as examples of what should not be said during an election campaign. And shouldnt he brush up his history before insisting that Sonia Gandhi improves her Hindi? Any school history textbook will tell Katiyar that Helen of Troy was as much responsible for World War II as Sonia Gandhi was for the deaths in the Gandhi family.

				 																Testing times				 																																																				Sir  In a re-run of similar allegations in 1997, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has once again been held responsible for the mathematics paper-leak this year (Board denies math leak but probes, March 16). The secondary examination is possibly one of the most crucial examinations for students, who judge their capability on the basis of the marks they secure in this examination. Incidents of paper-leak are not only ignominious for the board, but also for the state. 				 																																																				The private television channel concerned had reportedly faxed the papers to the board office and informed the police about the matter. Despite this, it is amusing that the board president, Dibyendu Hota, could casually term the events as mysterious and unusual. Despite being fully aware of the chain of events, he insisted that it was not a leak as his office had received the faxed papers six minutes after the examination started. Hota now admits it was a lapse rather than a leak. WBBSE is already much-maligned. Hota should at least try and be more gracious about the WBBSEs lapses.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, Gokarna, Murshidabad

				 																																																				Sir  Samir Mandals suicide was shocking. What was more shocking was the attitude of the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, Dibyendu Hota, who believes a mistake is a mistake (Suicide prompts board English apology, March 11) . Hota reflects the non-professional way the board is being run. Little wonder the board gets embroiled in controversy almost every year. Hota has piously declared that it is unfortunate that the mistakes in the English paper were overlooked by the question-setters. It must be kept in mind that these paper-setters are the products of the lefts matribhashaai matridugdha (mother-tongue is like mothers milk) policy and are hardly expected to spell common English words correctly. The state government, which oversees the affairs of the board by financing and nominating its key officials, is more concerned about retaining its political power than in running the board efficiently. Otherwise, it would have nominated efficient people to run the board. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

				 																																																				Sir The WBBSE, especially Dibyendu Hota, has gone to great lengths to give the impression that the incident of the Madhyamik maths paper-leak was a conspiracy to malign the left before the elections. However, a Madhyamik candidate told me that upon reaching the examination hall, she was informed by her friends of three particular theorems which were bound to appear on the paper that day. She did not believe them then but changed her mind after seeing the paper. How can the board authorities be so sure that it was not a case of paper-leak when some students had prior information about the questions? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Agarwal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  School students in West Bengal are under tremendous pressure, especially before major examinations. The maths paper-leak is reprehensible because it unduly harasses and distracts students who have to deal with difficult questions, including those outside the syllabus. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I have appeared for the Madhyamik examinations this year. The controversy regarding the English paper is quite justifiable. Besides containing difficult questions, the question paper was strewn with spelling mistakes. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jishnu Chakraborty, Burdwan

				 																																																				Sir  The hullabaloo over the Madhyamik maths paper makes one wonder if Madhyamik is the only board examination that happened in the city. What about the fact that the Indian School Certificate mathematics paper this year had two questions wrongly printed? Dibyendu Hota should not be made the only scapegoat. The ISC board and its officials must also be brought to task. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Abhinaba Jana, Gokarna

				 																																																				Sir  There is little point in complaining about difficult question papers. Most students do not follow the textbooks thoroughly. Had they done so, they would have been able to answer any question, however framed. As for printing mistakes, even with advanced technology, printing cannot be entirely error-free. However, such mistakes are best avoided so as to save the students unnecessary worry.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ardhendu Mukherjee, Jhargram

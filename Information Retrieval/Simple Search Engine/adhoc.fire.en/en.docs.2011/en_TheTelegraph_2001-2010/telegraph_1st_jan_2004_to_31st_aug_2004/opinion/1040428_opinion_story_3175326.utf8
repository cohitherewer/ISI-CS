The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A momentary lapse of reason				 																																																				Sir  No one would have thought that Murli Manohar Joshis decision to slash fees at the Indian Institutes of Management would one day provide comic relief. But when it becomes an election gambit used by the former Uttar Pradesh assembly speaker, Kesri Nath Tripathi, in Machlishahar, one cannot but smile (IIM lollies stream in the sun, April 24). At one level, this speaks volumes of the malaise in Indian politics. Poverty, the lack of development, corruption  there is so much of all these in the UP heartland where Tripathi is contesting from. But Tripathi side-stepped all of these issues to pick on something that was far removed from his voters lives and experience. One wonders if anyone from Machlishahar knew of the existence of the IIMs before Tripathi brought up the issue. The people of this constituency arent probably even dreaming of sending their children to one. But the Tripathis are insistent. IIM fees must be cut before all of Machlishahars children can go to school.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Shaoni Das, Calcutta
				 																Development hero				 																																																				Sir  In his article, Foundation of development (April 24), Ashok Ganguly conveniently omits mentioning Jawaharlal Nehrus negative traits which far outweighed the positive ones. Nehrus biggest flaw was probably his ignorance of contemporary statecraft; he lived in a world of his own, well removed from reality. His foreign policy, for instance, comprised inanities like bhai-bhaism and projection of India as the worlds conscience-keeper. But his most damaging contribution was his destructive Kashmir policy. Nehru placed the interests of his home state above those of the rest of the country, displaying unmatched parochialism. It was this partisan policy which was perhaps instrumental in the rise of Hindutva. He rekindled the Naga insurgency with his arrogant handling of northeast Indias most sensitive issue. What really sealed Indias fate was his weakness for the kursi, exemplified in his eagerness for Partition, which was the only way he could get the prime ministers job. Nehru was the most unsuitable first prime minister of an independent India  Valabhbhai Patel or Bidhan Roy would have been better options. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Jawaharlal Nehrus contention, Religion in India will kill that country and its people if it is not subdued, is even more true today  as Ashok Ganguly rightly points out. But the question is, why are we regressing? Perhaps , it is because Hindus in general have not protested against the Brahminists who profess to be spokespersons for the community. Hindus are a diverse lot  they believe in different gods and goddesses, some eat meat and some are purely vegetarian, some are liberal while others are not. Animosity between religious groups or between the sects of a religious group exists everywhere, in varying degrees. But this hatred has nothing to do with religion  its roots can be traced to ethnic hostility or economic disparity. But casteism was a novel invention of the Brahminists and led to permanent social hierarchies. Whoever dared to disregard it or switch to some other religion drew their wrath. Nehru, who criticized this caste hierarchy, incurred the wrath of these Brahminists, who have now reincarnated as the Hindutvawadis. As Ganguly says, revisionism has infected Indian history. It is time to discover India anew.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																Soft targets				 																																																				Sir  The two recent incidents of molestation of women belie the West Bengal governments claim that the state is an oasis of peace (Young women harassed at home and outside, April 22). Although one member of the gang which assaulted a young woman at Hridaypur railway station was arrested after the chief minister expressed shock at the incident, in most cases the culprits go scot-free. Even if they are arrested, they get off on bail. What makes matters worse for the victim is the insensitive and inefficient police force. The fact that in the other incident in Barasat  where goons entered a house and beat up a housewife, and later threatened to kill her husband  activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India were involved, shows how deep is the rot. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  How many more incidents like the ones in Hridaypur and Barasat will it take to arouse the authorities? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may be doing all he can to revive the Bengal economy, but the state cannot get anywhere if it loses it ceases to respect women. Not long ago, anyone found teasing a girl was thrashed by the para boys. It is also worrying that the people around witnessed the womens harassment without protest. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Despite the incidents in Hridaypur and Barasat, West Bengal is, by and large, a safe place for women. Also, I do not think a change of guard will help, even though it is now proved that the miscreants belonged to the party ruling the state. The rise of such incidents must be put down to the influence of television and cinema. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mamata Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  There is nothing new about the incident at Hridaypur station. I have a similar experience to narrate. I had arrived in the city from Delhi, accompanied by a friend. As soon as we got off at Howrah station, we were mobbed by the coolies. A young man took advantage of the chaos and tried to molest my friend. Naturally, the trip was completely spoiled after that. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Parna Bhattacharyya, New Delhi

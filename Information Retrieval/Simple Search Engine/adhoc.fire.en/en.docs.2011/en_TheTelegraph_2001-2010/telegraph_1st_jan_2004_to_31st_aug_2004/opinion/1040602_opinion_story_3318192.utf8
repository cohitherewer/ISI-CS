The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 							 																						GETTING IT WRONG																														It is unfortunate that a new war of words between India and Pakistan is being played out before the media. This fresh tension, caused largely because of misperception and misunderstanding on both sides, must be contained before it blows out of proportion. It is critical, therefore, that the top political leadership in both countries takes immediate steps to clear the air and give a fresh impetus to the peace process. The latest controversy seems to have been created by Pakistan taking umbrage to the Union minister of foreign affairs, Mr Natwar Singh, over-emphasising the importance of the Shimla Agreement in his conversations with the media. Mr Singh is believed to have indicated that the dialogue with Pakistan would be within the framework of the Shimla Agreement. Pakistan seems to have interpreted the ministers remarks as suggesting that that the status quo should prevail in Jammu and Kashmir. This inference is based presumably on the belief that the prime ministers, Indira Gandhi and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, had arrived at a secret understanding in Shimla to settle the issue of Jammu and Kashmir along the line of control. Similarly, Pakistan reacted strongly to Mr Singhs assertion that the China-India model for conflict resolution should guide India-Pakistan relations. As is obvious, the application of this model would mean that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is kept on the back-burner while relations are normalized in other areas.																														Indeed, Pakistans foreign minister, Mr Khursheed Ahmed Kasuri, was so charged that he declared the need for a regime of rhetorical restraint in south Asia. Predictably, Mr Kasuri also asserted categorically that any solution based on the line of control was not acceptable, and that the status quo was part of the problem and not of the solution. In addition, Pakistans foreign minister also dismissed the idea of the China-India pattern of normalization being suitable for India and Pakistan. New Delhi has now reacted by suggesting that Pakistan had deliberately ignored Mr Natwar Singhs clear statement that the new government of India was committed to all post-Shimla agreements and declarations as well. 																														This latest heightening of tension is unfortunate and unnecessary. Misunderstanding and tension have been generated even before the new government in New Delhi has got its act together. Nor has there been any formal contact between Islamabad and New Delhi since the elections. It is vital, therefore, that instead of exchanging views through the media, the political leadership in India must begin the task of immediately setting a timetable for the resumption of a dialogue with Pakistan. It would be useful if New Delhi and Islamabad were to demonstrate sensitivity to each others concerns. Otherwise, given the fragility of India-Pakistan relations, it would not be at all surprising if bilateral relations derail once again. It would then require a tremendous effort to get them back on track once again.

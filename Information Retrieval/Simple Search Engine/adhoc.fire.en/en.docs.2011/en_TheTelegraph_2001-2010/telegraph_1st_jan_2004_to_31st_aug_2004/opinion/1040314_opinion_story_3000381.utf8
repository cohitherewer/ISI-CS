The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, March 14, 2004 							 																						STATE OF TERRORThe terror in Madrid is a reminder that within the structure of the modern state, there is no easy way to break the cycle created by terrorism and counter-insurgencyThere are few things more frightening than the fear of the invisible and the unknown. The spectre of terror that now haunts the entire Western world is one such. Nobody knows when and where terror can strike and how it will strike. The bomb blasts in Madrid only confirmed the unpredictability of the terror that has been let loose by the Islamic fundamentalists. There is very little that can be gained in practical terms by reiterating the heinous and destructive nature of this terror. Everybody knows this, just as everybody knows that only innocents are victims of terrorist bomb attacks. Making innocents the victims is, in fact, the precise purpose of terrorist attacks. Terrorist groups want to draw attention to themselves and to the cause that they uphold by shedding the blood of innocent citizens. To an extent they are successful in this aim. People who had no idea of the existence of al Qaida became only too familiar with its name and mode of operations after the attack on the World Trade Centre. The outstanding success of that attack served to boost the morale of Islamic militants a million times over. The bombs in Madrid can also claim a similar success albeit on a different scale altogether. All over the Western world, no one is safe any longer from the attacks of an enemy who cannot be located with any degree of definiteness.																														Terrorists use violence to right what is perceived by them to be unfair and oppressive. Violence is seen as a valid mode of achieving a desired goal. Terrorists thus transgress a monopoly since the use of violence is seen as the monopoly of the modern state. The latter is the repository of violence and coercion which it uses to punish wrongdoers and those who breach the social contract. In this sense, the growth of terrorism is the function of a failed state since terrorism appropriates for itself a right over which the modern state claims a monopoly. The modern states response to terrorism confirms the argument made in the foregoing sentences. The state attempts to reclaim its monopoly of violence by using violence against the terrorists. To meet an emergency, the modern state suspends the rule of law and the normal and quotidian operations of civil society. The omnipresence of security forces and security apparatus is the physical manifestation of the way the state prevails over civil society and the rule of law. One can see this in all airports in the United States of America and in the security forces that surround the Indian cricketers in Pakistan. The state has to do this because it attempts to eradicate terrorism by using violence. The use of this violence is the sign of its reclaiming its monopoly.																														Terrorism and counter-insurgency hold the world in a vicious cycle. Within the structure of the modern state, there is no way to break the cycle. It is also utopian, and therefore pointless in practical terms, to suggest a stepping out of the modern state into a society driven by non-violence. This is an elusive ideal much like the ever-receding horizon. The human predicament at the beginning of the 21st century offers no easy escape. The terror over Madrid only underlines the hopelessness of the situation.

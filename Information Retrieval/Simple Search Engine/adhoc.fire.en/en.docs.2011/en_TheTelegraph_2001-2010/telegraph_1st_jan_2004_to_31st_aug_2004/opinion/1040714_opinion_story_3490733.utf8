		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 							 																						AFFORDABLE BUT DANGEROUS						DOCUMENT From the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention by the WHO, Geneva, 2004				 	 DisadvantagedThe public health approach: The public health approach to road traffic injury prevention is based on science. The approach draws on knowledge from medicine, biomechanics, epidemiology, sociology, behavioural science, criminology, education, economics, engineering and other disciplines.																														While the health sector is only one of many bodies involved in road safety  and usually not even the leading one  it nonetheless has important roles to play...These include: discovering, through injury surveillance and surveys, as much as possible about all aspects of road crash injury  by systematically collecting data on the magnitude, scope, characteristics and consequences of road traffic crashes; researching the causes of traffic crashes and injuries, and in doing so trying to determine causes and correlates of road crash injury, factors that increase or decrease risk, factors that might be modifiable through interventions;																														Exploring ways to prevent and reduce the severity of injuries in road crashes  by designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating appropriate interventions; helping to implement, across a range of settings, interventions that appear promising, especially in the area of human behaviour, disseminating information on the outcomes, and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of these programmes; working to persuade policy-makers and decision-makers of the necessity to address injuries in general as a major issue, and of the importance of adopting improved approaches to road traffic safety;																														Translating effective science-based information into policies and practices that protect pedestrians, cyclists and the occupants of vehicles; promoting capacity building in all these areas, particularly in the gathering of information and in research.																														Road safety as a social equity issue: Studies show that motor vehicle crashes have a disproportionate impact on the poor and vulnerable in society. These are also the people with usually little influence over policy decisions. Even in high-income countries, poor children are at greater risk than children from more prosperous families. Poorer people comprise the majority of casualties and lack ongoing support in the event of long-term injury...																														In developing countries, the population groups exposed to the highest risks of injury and death from road crashes  for example, pedestrians and users of motorized two-wheelers  are from lower socioeconomic groups. They face a greater likelihood of injury, since affordable transport poses higher risks in these places than private car use. A large proportion of the road crash victims in low-income and middle-income countries are pedestrians and cyclists. They benefit the least from policies designed for motorized travel, but bear a disproportionate share of the disadvantages of motorization in terms of injury, pollution and the separation of communities.																														In high-income countries, the risks associated with walking, cycling and motorcycling remain very high in relation to those of car travel... 																														In many countries, the absence of a voice for the most vulnerable groups has meant that the safety of pedestrians and cyclists is often disregarded in favour of motorized travel. Equal protection for all road users should be a guiding rule, to avoid an unfair burden of injury and death for poorer people and vulnerable road users. This issue of equity is a central one for reducing the global burden of road crash death and injury. TO BE CONCLUDED

		 Monday, July 19, 2004 							 																						A BAG FULL OF CONSOLATION PRIZES Recognizing the need for gender-sensitive budgeting is all very well, but, feels Brinda Karat, Chidambarams announcements do not reflect this recognition				 	 Small relief																														Womens organizations have reason to be pleased that for the first time a finance minister has actually recognized the need of gender budgeting even if it is on the basis of only a limited understanding of the concept. There are three aspects of allocations for women. The first is direct allocations mainly through the department for women and child development under the human resource development ministry, although other ministries like those of social empowerment, labour, rural development also have women- and girl-child-specific schemes. The second is through a womens component within a general scheme applicable to almost all ministries which, according to a recommendation of a 1996 recommendation of the Planning Commission, should amount to one-third of allocations or alternatively, of beneficiaries. The third is the gender differential impact of mainstream projects and public expenditures such as increase in access to water, sanitation and so on which is more difficult to assess.																														What is the actual record? In the only gender budgeting exercise conducted by a group of eminent economists for the HRD ministry in 2002, it was found that the share of the womens component of composite public expenditure in total expenditure of the Central government showed a decline from 3.89 per cent in 1995-1996 to 2.82 per cent in 2001-2002. Of all credit given to self-employment projects, those to womens enterprises was less than 10 per cent. Even according to the estimates of the ministry for rural development, women beneficiaries were still at a low of between 11 to 17 per cent in its projects. Given that women are the poorer among the poor, the more discriminated among the discriminated, the more disabled among the disabled, a massive exercise backed by adequate funds and driven by an egalitarian vision is essential to tackle the gross discrimination that women face in successive budgets. 																														It is true that P. Chidambrams speech, with its concern for the rural and urban poor, the farmers, the minority communities, for the lakhs of families in traditional sectors  like the handlooms, which involve a large number of women  is a welcome departure from the sickening India Shining syndrome that had pushed these sections right off the national agenda in the six years of National Democratic Alliance rule. The finance ministers emphasis on education, housing, water, employment would in any gender budgeting exercise merit plus points. The two per cent cess on education, in addition to the increase in funds for elementary education, will help to expand the mid-day meal scheme, to retain more girl children in schools and strengthen access to education. The redesigning of health insurance schemes, including those for self-help groups, will help women if properly implemented. The thrust given to rural infrastructure and increased credit for farmers is necessary to reverse the anti-farmer policies of the previous regime which equally affected women farmers.																														However, even given that the budget was framed within the constraints of just the six remaining months of the year, there are several disquieting aspects as far as women are concerned. The basic problem is that the finance minister has retained the general framework of the World Bank-IMF blueprint of economic reform that is committed to bringing down the governments public expenditure. So while the speech is full of good intentions reflective of the common minimum programme, it is not backed up by the necessary funds, thus impacting also on women-specific schemes. Second, there is a wholly inadequate appreciation of the depth of the agrarian crisis gripping India and the terrible conditions of distress of the rural poor, particularly poor women. Thus while the supposed financial restrictions have been used to explain the meagre allocations, say, for the food-for-work schemes, such restrictions have not prevented the huge increase in defence expenditures. The stark contrast with the rest of the allocations raise disturbing questions of the governments priorities. Indeed, in some cases they are directly discriminatory towards women.																														The previous regime had shown its utter indifference, if not contempt, towards the issues of poor women by leaving unutilized over Rs 300 crore of funds allocated for these sections in the 2002-03 budget. This became the basis of a cut of Rs 200 crore in the interim budget presented by Jaswant Singh in February this year. Instead of reversing this trend, shockingly, the Chidambaram budget retains the reduction in all the schemes related to women and children under the HRD ministry. In the Integrated Child Development Scheme and child-care schemes, those meant for the most vulnerable sections of society, children of the rural poor, there is a cruel reduction of 58 crore. At present, about 23 million children are covered under the ICDS anganwadi projects, whereas close to 60 million children need the service. There is an urgent need for redesigning and expanding ICDS and child-care services, which require more funds not less. Womens welfare schemes, which in any case had a meagre allocation of just Rs 212 crore in 2002-03 have been further reduced by 37 crore. There is no rationale for doing so. On the contrary, widows and female-headed families in low-income groups require urgent help.																														The concept of gender budgeting relates not only to disaggregated gender based data or to increased allocations. It also relates to the design and focus of programmes, for example how far do budgetary allocations help advance the economic independence of women, say, through better training programmes, easy credit facilities, working womens hostels, child-care and crche facilities, maternity benefits and so on. In this respect there is hardly any difference between the previous budgets and the present one except for an increase in maternity benefits. Those schemes designed to help improve womens skills through training have received no attention. Even the Rashtriya Mahila Kosh created as the premier agency to provide credit to self-employed women and groups, has got just one crore rupees. The only welcome addition however is allocations for the rehabilitation of trafficked women, though the concept of rehabilitation needs to be designed keeping in view the demands and needs of the women. Clearly womens organizations have their job cut out in so far as educating the finance ministry on these issues.																														Another important area is that of health. The health ministry is divided into two departments, one for general health, the second for family welfare  a euphemism for population policy-related matters. Even the design of the reproductive and health services is geared more to the control of womens fertility rather than concern for her low health profile. Fortunately the emphasis this time is not on reproductive health programmes. The Rs 500 crore increase to the department is partly for polio eradication, and a welcome one-third increase in maternity benefit schemes. However the general health department gets only an added Rs 200 crore, which is far from the increase in health expenditure promised in the CMP. There are around 1.37 lakh sub-centres in rural India to provide primary healthcare services. If access to minimum healthcare is to be made a universal right under the commitment health for all then it is these primary healthcare centres that need to be strengthened, that need trained medical personnel and medicines rather than being used only for family planning programmes as they are today. The Chidambaram budget has no fresh planning for these centres and actually reduces the allocation by 30 lakh.																														There is an ominous message in the crucial area of food security, embedded in the wholly misconceived idea of targeting, first introduced by Chidambaram in 1997. It has virtually killed the public distribution system. This budget, instead of moving towards universalizing the PDS recommended by an earlier government committee and endorsed by the CMP, suggests a pilot project of further targeted food stamp schemes. Given the extent of malnutrition reflected in the starvation deaths across the country, such schemes are pilots for disaster. One of the most important issues before women when they voted in the last elections was the denial of minimum food rights by policies followed by the NDA regime. Chidambaram would do well to hear that message.																														Even as the finance minister has not been bold enough either in resource allocation or in gender affirmative action, he has raised the foreign direct investment levels in crucial sectors. This is certainly not in the national interest and should be reversed. 																														It is for all these reasons that women will raise only half a cheer for this budget.

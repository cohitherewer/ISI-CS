The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 							 																						STATIONS THAT LOOK LIKE PALACES Shobita Punja																					It was with particular reference to VT that Jan Morris humorously wrote (in Buildings of the Raj) that the British in India often built railway stations that looked like palaces and palaces that looked like railway stations.																					We often forget that heritage buildings matter for their functional significance and tend to be admired most for the grace and beauty that they give to the life of a city. A perfect example of this is what most of us affectionately and still rebelliously call VT. It is the pride of the city, ask any taxi driver and he will confirm it. 																					The Victoria Terminus Railway Station was built for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway by an English architect called Frederick William Stevens, in 1878, in the heart of Mumbai. One needs to remember that the first 21 miles of railtrack was laid between Mumbai and Thane and inaugurated by the GIP on April 16, 1853.																					When you approach VT from any side, its size and immense proportions might fill you with awe. The building has a high dome surmounted by a large figure representing Progress in fine Porbundar sandstone. The rest of the building is made of yellow sandstone and gray granite with highlights of arched windows and doorways in an assortment of coloured stones such as Italian marbles and choice Indian stones. 																					Progress in Gothic																					The building is in the high Gothic style with gabled arches. On the two gables of the west wing are groups of sculptures representing Engineering, and as you would expect, Commerce, the undisputed figurehead of Mumbai for the last 400 years. The stone carvings, figurative sculptures and the ornate iron work were all designed by Stevens and executed by students of the JJ School of Art not far away from this grand station.																					The building was based on the general pattern of great railway stations of England such as St Pancras in London. The notion of giving railway stations the look of a grand palace or even a majestic cathedral was fashionable then, as railways were the great new idea and the most fashionable new invention. We need to remember that the slow-moving horse and bullock cart, boats and ships and a pair of loyal feet were the means of travel in those days when the railways were invented and brought to India.																					Invisible powers																					K.N. Kabraji (Bombay: City Within) remembers that most Indians at first could not believe in the existence of trains, They saw no bullock carts, no horses were employed to draw the train and were convinced that the wonderful white man who could work miracles had employed some demons or other invisible powers to draw so swiftly and easily the enormous load of wagons and carriages, so they bought coconuts to the unearthly power and were ready to worship it.																					The mood of marvel was most beautifully captured in that famous scene in Satyajit Rays film of the boy seeing for the first time a steam engine racing across the countryside puffing clouds of smoke into the air. It gives us a sense of the wonder that accompanied the railways as they ploughed their way through the countryside taking millions from one place to another in a matter of hours.																					Today, because of the pressure of traffic, millions of commuters who come to Mumbai from the suburbs each day, walk through the station not knowing that this building is over a hundred years old and needs to be protected as a national monument of enormous functional value.																					VT is a symbol of all such grand railway stations that we have in Calcutta and Chennai, the beautiful stone and steel railway bridges and also the tiny hamlets, by the railways, that dot this country. Today we speak of the safety of railway passengers, of the environmental costs of railway lines across fragile ecosystems and the ruin of the country side, but we need not neglect or abuse the buildings that have served so many for so long.

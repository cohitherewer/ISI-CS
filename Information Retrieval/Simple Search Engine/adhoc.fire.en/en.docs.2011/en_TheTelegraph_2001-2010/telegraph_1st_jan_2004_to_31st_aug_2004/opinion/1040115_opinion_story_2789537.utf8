		 Thursday, January 15, 2004  CRIMES UNNUMBERED 
 - There are no proper figures for determining conviction rates  in India  Bibek Debroy The author is director, Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi I think the committee on reforms  of the criminal justice system has not received as much  attention as it should have. This is the Justice Malimath  committee. Roughly, two-thirds of our backlog consists of  criminal cases, although the proportion varies, depending  on whether we have the Supreme Court, high courts or lower  courts in mind. There has been some attempted reform of  the civil justice system. We should now focus on reforming  the criminal justice system and this is what the Malimath  committee is about. The recommendations are in the public  domain, some of which are about general trends. So they  do not have specific statutory amendments in mind. Others  are more specific. Why have the Malimath committees recommendations  not attracted more attention? There is a quote from Andr  Gide at the beginning of the report: Everything has been  said already, but as no one listens, we must always begin  again. Is it that we are too cynical about the process  and skeptical about any possible reform? Or is it the case  that the report has not always been easily accessible? Before we can talk about criminal  justice, we need to have some definition of crime. There  has to be an objective definition. Otherwise, your definition  of crime may be different from mine. In other words, crime  must be defined through a statute that applies to all society.  The core statute for defining  crime is of course the Indian Penal Code of 1860. But there  are other definitions of crime also under other statutes,  and this is sanctioned through sections 41 and 42 of the  IPC. Section 41 states, A Special Law is a law applicable  to a particular subject. Section 42 states, A local law  is a law applicable only to a particular part of India.  Data on crime originate with the National Crime Record Bureau  and are published as a report by the ministry of home affairs.  They are therefore divided into IPC crimes and crimes under  the special and local laws. There are 21 major statutes  under SLL.  In this article, I am not going  to talk about recommendations proposed by the Malimath committee.  Instead, I will focus on the state of criminal justice,  as evident from statistics quoted by the committee. From  that, since the criminal justice system is so bad, one derives  the logic for reforms. I have heard several people say  that the state of criminal justice in India is appalling.  Absolutely true. I have heard several people say the conviction  rate is less than 5 per cent. May very well be true. But  I have absolutely no idea where that figure comes from.  It is certainly not a figure quoted by the Malimath committee.  Nor is it a figure that, in an overall sense, you will be  able to establish using data from the NCRB.  Let us get one phenomenon out  of the way first. If the justice delivery system is unsatisfactory,  I may not bother to go and report a crime. It is simply  not worth it. There are parts of India where the only people  who can offer credible redressal against crimes are criminals  themselves. Therefore, there will always be under-reporting.  While acknowledging this, there is no way you can correct  for this statistically. There are no reliable surveys that  tell you what the extent of under-reporting is. That apart,  there will be regional-cum-urban/rural differences. If I  am in a village where there are connectivity problems, the  police station is several kilometres away and I lose a days  wages in reporting a crime, what is the probability of a  crime being reported, even if efficiency improves? To create further problems, we  have the distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable  crimes, courtesy the Code of Criminal Procedure. Cognizable  offence means an offence for which, and cognizable case  means a case in which, a police officer may, in accordance  with the First Schedule or under any other law for the time  being in force, arrest without a warrant. Non-cognizable  offence means an offence for which, and non-cognizable case  means a case in which, a police officer has no authority  to arrest without warrant. The First Schedule of the CrPC  gives me a listing of which offence is of what kind. So  do the IPC and assorted SLL. In a cognizable crime, there  is onus on the police to record a first information report,  visit the scene of the crime, arrest the offender and investigate.  We know that unless magistrates  specifically instruct the police, the police are simply  not bothered about non-cognizable crimes. Even in the case  of cognizable crimes, we do know that the police may simply  shoo the complainant away. How many people in India are  aware of their rights and push for them? The point I am  making is simple and is similar to what I said about under-reporting.  While these problems are genuine enough, there is no way  to correct for them. Hence my problem with the 5 per cent  or less than 5 per cent kind of figure. From the Malimath committee, or  outside, I only have data on cognizable crimes. That too,  cognizable crimes that are registered. I am not a lawyer,  or a policeman or a judge. But I simply cannot figure out  how anyone can obtain any data on overall crime. Back to the Malimath committee,  which has data on cognizable IPC crimes for 2000, the latest  year for which we have data from the NCRB. There were 1.77  million cognizable IPC crimes in 2000. This figure of around  1.7 million registered cognizable IPC crimes has been the  trend in the Nineties, with minor increases. However, the  number of cognizable SLL crimes was 3.4 million in 2000  and this has declined from 4.6 million in 1996. One should  not jump to the conclusion that Indians have become less  crime-prone. Nor is the argument about non-reporting having  dramatically increased very plausible. I suspect this declining  trend has something to do with liberalization. Thanks to  reforms, many socio-economic crimes have now ceased to be  crimes. If you normalize the total number of registered  cognizable crimes by dividing by the total population, you  will find that India does pretty well in cross-country comparisons.  From that, the deduction that Indians are less crime-prone  will of course be a leap of faith. We have a total registered cognizable  crime figure of 5.17 million in 2000. We also have a total  police force of 1.03 million in 2000. In a place like Delhi,  the police may be busy with other things like VIP duties.  In a place like Bihar, the police may be busy with anything  other than investigating crime. But the all-India average  workload per investigating officer is 42.6 cases per year.  That is quite a bit and does not do justice to the business  of investigation, especially because these are cognizable  crimes, and not total crimes. Nor do these figures cover  non-investigative duties.  However, do note that the workload  has declined from 60.4 cases per year in 1996, and this  is a continuous decline. Thats partly because the size  of the police force has increased and partly because the  number of SLL crimes has declined. All registered cognizable  crimes are not investigated by the police. More accurately,  every investigation does not necessarily result in a charge  sheet. For IPC crimes, the disposal rate by the police was  79.1 per cent in 2000, and for SLL crimes, it was 94.5 per  cent. Throughout the second half of the Nineties, the disposal  rate has been between 76 per cent and 80 per cent for IPC  crimes and between 85 per cent and 95 per cent for SLL crimes.  Admitted, these figures are only for registered cognizable  crimes. But these are not as bad as you would have normally  thought them to be a priori. The problem is much more serious  for trial courts. Stated differently, our cynicism with  the criminal justice system is due more to the low probability  of conviction, not necessarily low probability of prosecution.  But thats another story.

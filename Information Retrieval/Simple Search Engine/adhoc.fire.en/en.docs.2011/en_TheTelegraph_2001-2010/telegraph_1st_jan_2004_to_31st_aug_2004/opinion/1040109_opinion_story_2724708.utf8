The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 09, 2004 							 																						WHAT THOSE NUMBERS CONCEAL Gyan Pathak																								On the one hand, the Indian economy is set to record an unprecedented growth of over 7 per cent of the gross domestic product, and on the other hand, investment in all sectors of production has plummeted to a new low. Profit margins have swelled in certain financial and corporate companies while most of the medium- and small-scale industries are increasingly falling sick, and many of them have been compelled to shut down. It is the familiar case of the rich getting richer and the poor poorer. 																								It augers well for the external sector of our economy to have a foreign currency reserve of $ 100 billion, the sixth largest reserve in the world, and a reasonable level of stability in the exchange rate. But we are attracting potentially volatile capital, and this dollar resource is being invested by the Reserve Bank of India in low-yielding ventures, mainly in American government securities. It is painful that we cannot invest this huge money in high-yielding ventures like industries and agriculture.																								Our export growth rate is a mere 8 per cent of the GDP. India was once one of the three main trading blocks in the world, commanding 33 per cent of world trade. It came down to 27 per cent around 1750, then to 3 per cent in 1947, and now it is only 0.62 per cent.  Hard times ahead																								The accretion of Indias dollar holding can be attributed primarily to arbitrage and the prospect of a further appreciation of the rupee. Foreign institutional investors in the stock market are the single largest source of foreign capital, but the FIIs may take their money back without any warning. It is therefore, a potential threat to financial management. Any volatility in currency rates can create havoc in our system. New challenges await us: we are bound to undergo huge trade deficits, and global political pressures, including of the United States of America, will be on our currency to make it appreciate. So, in the time ahead , we have to show more political and economic guts. 																								Next, it must be said that a good monsoon is behind the healthy GDP growth rate, and not good governance. When the National Democratic Alliance government had taken over the reins of the country five years ago, the growth rate was about 6.5 per cent of the GDP, which fell down to 4.3 per cent last year. This sharp fall is reflected in the decline in job opportunities both in the public and private sectors. 																								Some financial sector organizations, such as banks and corporate organizations, are enjoying increased profit margins because they are allowed to sell their goods and services with incentives from the government at higher prices than their real worth. This is profiteering, and does not reflect the reality of economic growth of the country.  Bleak house																								At the same time that we have a $100 billion-strong reserves, we also have 29 crore people under the poverty line, earning less than Rs 300 per month, and about 30 crore unemployed people. The public and private sector companies are fast downsizing, while the government sees the unorganized sector, which gives full or partial employment to only 38 crore people, as the potential destination of the phased-off labour force. With the lack of investment in the productive sectors of our economy, there is little chance of job creation. 																								The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre may take political advantage of the monsoon gods benevolence. But in reality, this government has failed on all counts to revive the economy, and has made life more complicated for the economy in the long term. 																								While making our assessment, we should not look at statistics selectively. These statistics, for instance, will put the situation in the correct perspective. India has 17 per cent of the world population, but only 0.63 per cent of world trade, 1.35 per cent of the world GDP, and only 0.35 per cent share of the worlds foreign direct investment. These are the ground realities. We can hardly afford to ignore them.

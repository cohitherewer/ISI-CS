The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 							 																						HEAVY BURDEN OF HONOUR GOURI CHATTERJEE																					For Tehelka, the burden of expectations must have been heavy indeed. There was not one empty seat at the Siri Fort auditorium, the largest in the capital, during the launch programme of Tehelka the Peoples Paper last Thursday. 																					Its not just the bold and the beautiful like Pooja Bedi and Shobhaa De who have joined its bandwagon because truth is the only reality worth fighting for (as De puts it). Stories like a retired colonel sending it a lakh of rupees from his pension or a 20-year-old from Mumbai converting her sales commissions into a Founder Subscription or a university professor sending a cheque with no financial expectation from this investment so that good can once again triumph over evil(going by letters to the editor) are not just touching but humbling. 																					The first issue, which effectively appeared on the stands last Saturday and flew off the shelves within a couple of days, must have come as a rude shock to them all. Pages and pages (48 in all) of grey reading matter, unleavened by even a photograph of some politician accepting graft  it reeks of sober respectability but is hardly the stuff which built the brand of Tehelka.																					Of course, it would be impossible for anyone to deliver explosive exposs week after week. But Tarun Tejpal and his team must have known thats what people were paying them for. And was surely the reason for adopting Free, frank, fearless as the papers motto. 																					It could be the calming effect of print. As is its practice, Tehelkas reporters did go clandestine and assume Christian identities for the cover story on George Bushs conversion agenda for India. The story is well researched too. But the dense prose spread over eleven pages is unlikely to set any pulses racing. 																					Sadly though, if and when Tehelka begins to honour its pact with its supporters, India will have lost a great chance for a serious newspaper. Tehelka the Peoples Paper is the closest we have ever got to a magazine like the The New York Review of Books. But thats not the paper for which 172 Idealists (as Tehelka calls them) gave it Rs 1 lakh each.																					They are human too																					Last summer, when India was still dithering over whether to send troops to Iraq, Kanwal Sibal, the then foreign secretary of India, had gone to Washington and met key leaders of the Bush administration. In its report, the BBC referred to Kanwal Sibal as the foreign minister of India. A minor slip no doubt, made worse by the fact that the Brits call their ministers secretaries. But a mistake nevertheless.																					The way everyone, including the BBC, is carrying on in the wake of the Hutton report it would seem the BBC has never made a mistake ever. When Mark Byford, the BBCs new acting director general, was asked to comment on the fact that Andrew Gilligans story was 90 per cent correct, he retorted: 90 per cent is not good enough for the BBC.																					Getting just one fact wrong, not necessarily the most important one, in a piece of journalism devalues the whole story is the ideal attitude, the goal all journalists work towards. Not everyone achieves it all the time, not even BBC reporters. But journalists never want to admit to their fallibility. So Lord Hutton held them up to their own standards and found them wanting. The moral: journalists should acknowledge they are human too.																					Give em a bit of fun																					If readers of The Times of India hadnt been aware of a change at the top of the editorial heap, they would surely have suspected something by looking at Wednesdays paper. Never before had they seen the budget presented in quite this manner. 																					No matter that it was merely an interim budget. It was just the opportunity for the new executive editor to showcase his skills: packaging of news to make it fun. 																					Its a formula that he had used with great success in The Economic Times; it should work like a breeze in the Times. If in the process the news gets trivialized, the bosses wont complain as long as it draws readers in. And readers want fun, dont they?

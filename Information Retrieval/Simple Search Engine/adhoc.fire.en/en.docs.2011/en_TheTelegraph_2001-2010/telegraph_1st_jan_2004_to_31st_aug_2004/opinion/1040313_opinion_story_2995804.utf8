The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 13, 2004 							 																						MEMORY OF A DAWNThis Above All / Khushwant Singh				 	 Complete surrender																					Before the English consolidated their rule over India, the official language of communication between rulers of different states  Maratha, Rajput and Sikh  was Persian. It was also the language spoken by the elite. Famous Urdu poets  Meer, Ghalib (and later Iqbal)  preferred to write in Persian rathan in Urdu till they discovered that unless they wrote in the language spoken and understood by the common people, the impact of their writings would remain severely restricted. Persian went into desuetude. A dwindling minority read Rumi or Hafiz; many more read Omar Khayyam, not highly rated by Persian scholars. His full name was Abul Fath Omar Ibn Ibrahim. Khayyam, which means tent-maker, was perhaps taken from the ancestral business. He distinguished himself as a mathematician, physicist and astronomer. It was three centuries later that he was discovered as a poet. Though regarded as a minor Persian poet in his own country, he inspired Indian poets like Qazi Nazrul Islam, Harivansh Rai Bacchchan, Majaz, Josh and Agha Qazalbash. 																					Most of the English-speaking world know of Khayyam through translations by E.J. Fitzgerald. His translations first appeared in 1859. Many connoisseurs are of the opinion, with which I am inclined to concur, that his translations read better than the original. However, Professor S. Ainul Hasan of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, author of Studies in Persian Language and Literature, is somewhat condescending in his appraisal. 																					He writes: Though Fitzgeralds translation is comparable to the original in the sweetness and melody, yet the fact remains that the translator was unable to fully comprehend the ideas of Omar Khayyam. Despite my ignorance of the original, his view is unacceptable to me. I have not come across any translation of poetry to match Fitzgeralds. For whatever it is worth, I present myself as an example to prove my point. I memorized many of Khayyams rubais while I was student in college. They still remain in my mind. I quote a few examples from my memory:Awake! For the morning in the bowl of nightHas flung the stone that puts the stars to flight;And lo, the Hunter of the East has caughtThe Sultans turret in a noose of light.																					After this memorable description of the dawn Khayyam (Fitzgerald) spells out his views on the purpose of life:																					Dreaming when dawns left 																					hand was in the sky																					I heard a voice within the tavern cry																					Wake my little ones and fill the cup																					Before lifes liquor in its cup be dry																					Then the most exuberant exhortation to enjoy life while it lasts:																					A book of verse beneath the bough																					A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and thou																					Beside me singing in the wilderness!																					Ah, wilderness would be paradise now																					Khayyam was a rationalist. He did not accept the conventional theories of the origin of life put forward by preachers of different religions and was content to admit he did not know the answer:There was a door to which I found no keyThere was veil beyond which I could not see																					Talk while of thee and me there was 																					Then no more of thee or me.																					I could go on and on. But a 90-year-old should know when to stop.																					Through the eyes of a child																					Sukhjit Singh, who prefers to be known as a Brigadier, which he was, rather than the Maharaja of Kapurthala, which he is, occasionally sends me a clipping of an article which he finds amusing. This one is an essay written by an eight-year-old American boy on his concept of God. It reads:																					One of Gods main jobs is making people. He makes them to replace the ones that die, so there will be enough people to take care of things on earth. He doesnt make grown-ups, just babies. I think because they are smaller and easier to make. That way he doesnt have to take up his valuable time teaching them to talk and walk. He can just leave that to mothers and fathers.																					Gods second most important job is listening to prayers. An awful lot of this goes on, since some people, like preachers and things, pray at times beside bedtime. God doesnt have time to listen to the radio or TV because of this.																					God sees everything and hears everything and is everywhere which keeps him pretty busy. So you shouldnt go wasting his time by going over your Mom and Dads head asking for something they said you couldnt have.																					Atheists are people who dont believe in God. I dont think there are any in my town. At least there arent any who come to our church.																					Jesus is Gods son. He used to do all the hard work like walking on water and performing miracles and people finally got tired of him preaching to them and they crucified him. But he was good and kind, like his father and he told his father that they didnt know what they were doing and to forgive them and God said OK.																					His dad (God) appreciated everything that he had done and all his hard work on earth so he told him he didnt have to go out on the road anymore. He could stay in heaven. So he did.																					And now he helps his dad out by listening to prayers and seeing things which are important for God to take care of and which ones he can take care of himself without having to bother God. Like a secretary, only more important. You can pray anytime you want and they are sure to help you because they got it worked out so one of them is on duty all the time....																					If you dont believe in God, besides being an atheist, you will be very lonely, because your parents cant go everywhere with you, like to camp, but God can. It is good to know hes around you when youre scared in the dark or when you cant swim and you get thrown into real deep water by big kids.																					But you shouldnt just always think of what God can do for you. I figure God put me here and he can take me back anytime he pleases. And thats why I believe in God.																					And now for a checkmate																					Drawn by the crowd, I stopped at a famous bookstore in Calcutta that had a huge sign in the window reading, Newly translated from the original French: 27 mating positions. Inside, copies of the book were selling like hot cakes. It was only by accident that I heard one harried clerk of the bookstore say to another after ringing up his 423rd sale of the volume for the day, This is really the most extraordinary sale Ive ever seen for a chess book.(Contributed by Reeten Ganguly, Tezpur)

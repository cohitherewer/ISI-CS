The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 11, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Why on earth do we travel?Cressidas bed (Jonathan Cape, 12.99) by Desmond Barry is a historical romance based on actual events that took place in Britain, Calcutta and Bhutan in the early Thirties. It follows the journey of a fictional Englishwoman from Calcutta to Bhutan in search of her infamous father. She is accompanied by an English major, with whom she conducts a lusty romance, only to be spiritually bowled over by the Shabdrung (the Bhutanese version of the dalai lama). She is then devastated by colonial treachery and sexual disgust. The freedom fighter, Dinesh Gupta, puts in an appearance, together with a kshatriya Captain Mukherji and the Writers Building (sic). Barrys extensive research into the British Political Departments secret files seems not to have armed him against these gaffes. He also acknowledges the late Dudjom Rimpoche for information regarding the cosmology of the succession of the aeons. The title is Shakespearean, as is the epigraph. These devices [mixing history and fiction] are at least as old as Homer, were shamelessly used by Shakespeare, and so I feel no need for any apologies, says the authors note.From Plassey to partition: A history of Modern India (Orient Longman, Rs 250) by Sekhar Bandyopadhyay is a theoretically sophisticated and densely-written narrative  a continuing saga of adjustment, accommodation and conflict  of the emergence of India as a nation under the domineering presence of Western imperialism. It focuses more on the Indian people, than on the colonial state or the men who ruled India. It highlights the perceptions of the ruled, their cultural crises and social changes, their rebellion, their search for identity and their attempts to negotiate with a modernity brought to them through a variety of colonial policies. There is a useful chronology and an extensive bibliography.Where on earth am I?: Confusions of a travelling man (Penguin, Rs 150) by Jug Suraiya starts with the perennial question of travel  Why on earth do we travel?  and comes up with a quasi- Borgesian answer, The world we know is only one of an infinitude of narratives of which, unaware, we are a part. I would like to think that what we call travel is a faint echo of that never-ending story of which we are both the narrators and the subjects. These pieces span thirty years and several continents, from Castros Cuba to post-perestroika Russia, from Chinese-ruled Tibet to death-haunted Argentina. They have clever, and sometimes predictable, titles like Kerala in a Coconut, Youre no great sheikhs, Charlie Brown, Ode on a Grecian Turn, Magical Riolism and Last Tango in Buenos Aires.																												The swinging bridge (Penguin, Rs 250) by Ramabai Espinet is the writers first novel about the multiple displacements in the life and lineage of the protagonist, Mona Singh: I live in the eye of a storm. My whole life arches backwards and forwards according to the speed of the gust around me. Mona grew up in Trinidad and now lives in Montreal. Her great-grandmother had once crossed the kala pani that lies between India and the Caribbean.The dead (Headline, 6.99) by Ingrid Black is a thriller set in Dublin  the title alludes, rather presumptuously, to Joyces great story in Dubliners. There is a serial killer called Night Hunter, a series of slaughtered prostitutes, a former FBI agent called Saxon (a woman), and Detective Chief Superintendent Grace Fitzgerald and her team. Rain was general all over Dublin. It was falling on every part of the dark city...and invisibly into the sea, falling softly on quay, square and station, on stranded trees and ghostly cathedrals.

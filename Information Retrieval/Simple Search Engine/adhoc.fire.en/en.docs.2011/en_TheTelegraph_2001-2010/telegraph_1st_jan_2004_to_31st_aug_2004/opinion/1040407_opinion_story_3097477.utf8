The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Talking point				 																																																				Sir  In The human angle (April 1), Bharat Bhushan has advocated all-round dialogues to solve the Kashmir issue. When endless talks and clashes over the last 55 years have failed to solve the problem, isnt it wishful thinking that dialogues in the 56th year will be enough? That Kashmir is a disputed territory is a fact willy-nilly accepted by India. Had it really been an integral part, there would have been no reason for a dialogue. Did we go for a dialogue with the Portuguese over Goa? No. Besides, if disputes could be solved through dialogues, there would not have been any necessity for courts. The most important point in the Kashmir problem is not the process of dialogue, but the way to ascertain the desire of the common Kashmiri. If East Timor could opt for an opinion poll, why not Kashmir? A plebiscite in Kashmir should be held under the supervision of a small country like Norway, Niger or New Zealand, which has no axe to grind like the so-called superpowers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US
				 																Poor visibility				 																																																				Sir  The Congress poll manifesto and the Vision Document of the Bharatiya Janata Party are somewhat similar. Both parties pledge their support to economic reforms, a high growth rate, generating employment, education for all and so on (BJP drops one holy cow, picks on foreigner, March 31). But neither has any clue as to how it will go about meeting these targets. The two parties are also very little bothered about the corruption in public life. It was the Congress which had started the trend with the Bofors scandal, the urea, telecom and Harshad Mehta scams, and so on. The BJP later continued the legacy through its Unit Trust of India scandal, the coffin and tehelka scams, the Dilip Singh Judeo bribery case and others. 				 																																																				It is a shame that in spite of India being ranked one of the most corrupt countries in the world, no political party deems it fit to regard eradicating corruption as an important political issue. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tamal Basu, Kodalia, Hooghly

				 																																																				Sir  The Vision Document, 2004, released by the BJP is a cunning strategy to mislead voters. While the document indirectly endorses Hindutva to satisfy hardliners in the sangh parivar, it also resolves to adopt parts of the National Democratic Alliance agenda which run contrary to the saffron principles. It goes without saying that much of what has been visualized in this document will remain unfulfilled. The Election Commission should be empowered to de-recognize any party that fails to keep its promises after coming to power. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  In its newly-released Vision Document, the BJP has declared its commitment to building the Ram temple in Ayodhya through dialogue and negotiated settlement. But isnt the government duty-bound to go by the verdict of the courts?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The difference between the Congress and the BJP is the formers lack of focus  as is apparent from its manifesto. The Congress could have shifted the focus from India Shining to a concern about the opportunity to let all Indians shine. This would have automatically shifted the focus to unemployment, price rise, foreign investment, starvation deaths and so on. The party leadership could have concentrated on freedom of religious expression  that would have appealed to Indians of all religious persuasions. The Congress could have pitted the Gandhi-Nehru vision against the saffron vision of India. Unfortunately, it has not done so. It has also failed to draw attention to its own successes  secularism, science and technology, the Green Revolution, industry, education and so on. The Congress has a well-qualified and articulate think tank. Why are its members not so visible as the saffronites in the media?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Vijaya Kumar, via email

				 																																																				Sir  What is so visionary about the conclusion arrived at by the BJP in its Vision Document, that Indias economy is far more important than a Ram temple (Colour of office, April 1)? It would be too early to bestow trust in saffron pronouncements. We should also keep in mind that the emphasis on negotiations over the Ram temple in Ayodhya means that at any time after the saffronwallahs return to power, Ram might upstage the sound economic sense.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Pressing matter Sir  Sunil Gangopadhyays remark  that the shop called Signet on College Street has unfortunately  shut down is surprising (Coffee with Kafka, April 3).  I happen to be the manager of Signet Book Shop, which is  most probably the shop Gangopadhyay is referring to, and  I am quite sure that the shop is very much open. Also, Signet  Press, whose sales outlet the shop is, has no intention  of ever shutting it down. I have noted with interest Gangopadhyays  laudatory references to Signet Press and its founding partner,  D.K. Gupta, in his writings. The remark referred to above  contradicts the impression Gangopadhyay creates through  his comments. If Gangopadhyay really loved the shop, as  he says he did, would he have passed such an incriminating  remark without bothering to check its correctness? For not  only is Signet Press on the telephone directory, but Gangopadhyay  is known to its senior partner, Nandini Gupta, and also  the managing partner, Nilaksha Gupta. Yours faithfully,																															
B.C. Bagchi, manager, Signet Book Shop, Calcutta

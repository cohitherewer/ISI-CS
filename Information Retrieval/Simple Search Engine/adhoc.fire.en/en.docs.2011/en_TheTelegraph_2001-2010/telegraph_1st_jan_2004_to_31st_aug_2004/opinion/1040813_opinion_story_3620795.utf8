		 Friday, August 13, 2004 							 																						SMALL IS PROFITABLE				 	 Special interest																														The rapid advances in print technology have changed the publishing world enormously in the last three years. One conspicuous change has been the growth of small, independent publishers who have broken out of mainstream publishing and taken a chance on a quirky book that they feel will sell. Many of these are fly-by-night operators but there are some run by former publishing professionals who have broken out on their own and done pretty well because they know what is required for a successful book  content, language and style, backed by aggressive marketing.																														But will the small publisher survive the cut and thrust of the market place? Will he be able to market the book and pay royalties on time? The physical quality  paper, printing, binding and cover  of the finished book is not a problem because with computerized production procedures, a uniform quality is assured.																														There are three reasons why the small publisher will survive and do reasonably well. One, where the conglomerates tend to produce a mixed list of fiction, non-fiction, biography, travel and cookery, the small publisher tends to specialize. At a time when specialization is the key to success this makes sense, quite apart from the fact that it makes marketing much more focussed.																														Two, the small publisher continues to look in a book for an idea well expressed that will attract the intelligent lay reader. This is unlike a big publisher who sees himself as part of the entertainment industry, and his job being to simply produce new books every month. In the long run, this approach does not work and books are pulped to make room for more of the same kind. Three, small publishers have lower overheads and thus greater flexibility with trade discounts and credits.																														Prima facie, the small publisher should not go under if he moves carefully and doesnt fall into the trap of producing more titles in the belief that more is better. In this competitive market, it is quality that matters, not numbers.																														But a problem faced by small publishers remains: distribution and the recovery of dues from the market. Since the small publisher cannot afford a marketing team with field representatives to visit bookshops and institutions, he hands over the distribution to two or three wholesalers in different areas with hefty discounts and generous credit terms. The wholesalers, in turn, redistribute the stocks to small retailers. In theory, this distribution chain looks fine but the hitch is recovery of dues: the small retailer doesnt pay the wholesaler and the wholesaler holds up his payment to the small publisher who doesnt have the cushion of the big publisher. So, there is always a kind of cash crunch with the small publisher.																														Will small publishers survive? The odds against them  lack of resources and the muscle of the big publisher  can be tackled as long as they stick to quality in a specialized field, keep their overheads in check while chasing wholesalers for dues. They must remember that publishing is both an art and a business. 						RAVI VYAS

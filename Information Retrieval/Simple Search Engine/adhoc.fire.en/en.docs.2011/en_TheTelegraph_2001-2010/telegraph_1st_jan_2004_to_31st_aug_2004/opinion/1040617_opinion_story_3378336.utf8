		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 							 																						STILL IN PROCESS																														Peace processes cannot stop at a change of government. It is for the new government in New Delhi to signal this to the rebel Naga groups. In fact, it would do well to go one step further. It is possible that the rebels would take some time to read the new regimes mind before making their next moves. The government needs to move fast to assure them that peace talks have nothing to do with the political colours of the new rulers. It would be unfair to deny to the previous government of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee its successes with the peace process in Nagaland. Not only did it succeed in extending the ceasefire with the rebels, but it also managed to continue the dialogue with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim led by Mr Isak Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah. The new regime can carry on from where its predecessor had left the talks, when the two leaders visit New Delhi next month. In fact, there seems to be a better opportunity for the new government if it can persuade the leader of the other NSCN faction, Mr S.S. Khaplang, to join the peace initiative. This should not be too great a challenge, considering that Mr Khaplangs group had signed a ceasefire agreement separately with the Union government. 																														But the government has to guard against any partisan approach spoiling the peace process. It is no secret that the two factions of the NSCN have different equations with the mainstream political parties in Nagaland. The faction led by Mr Swu and Mr Muivah has often accused Mr Khaplangs group of being partial to the former chief minister, Mr S.C. Jamir of the Congress. On his part, Mr Jamir accuses the other faction of having sided with the anti-Congress coalition during the last assembly elections in the state. While the government must bring both factions to the peace talks, it must also take into confidence all political parties and other organizations like the Naga Hoho, an apex social group with much influence in the state. It would be disastrous for the future of the talks if political preferences cloud them. The government must not only act in a non-partisan manner, but also clearly appear to do so. The success of the peace process is crucial not just for Nagaland but for Assam, Manipur and Tripura as well. For all insurgent groups in the Northeast have long maintained close links with the Naga rebels. If the NSCN could be persuaded to abjure violence and pursue a peaceful agenda, it could lead to groups like the United Liberation Front of Asom joining the road to peace. It is time the North-east got the peace it needed for its much-delayed economic uplift.

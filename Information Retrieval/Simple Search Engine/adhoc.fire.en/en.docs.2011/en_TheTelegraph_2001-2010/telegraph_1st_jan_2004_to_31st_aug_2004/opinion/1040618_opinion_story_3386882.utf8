		 Friday, June 18, 2004 							 																						SAY IT WITH PICTURES				 	 Light and shade																														What is the use of a book, thought Alice, without pictures or conversations?  Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland.																														To begin with, look at the positive side. Book production standards have improved enormously in the last decade, partly because of the rapid computerization of the entire printing process and partly because of a highly trained professional staff. Paper hasnt quite caught up with the rest of the inputs but it can always be imported. 																														Nowhere are these exacting standards better seen than in the production of science and technical texts with a high mathematical content. We now have science graduates as compositors who can handle the most sophisticated mathematical keyboards because they can understand whether a mathematical equation makes sense or not. Because of the state-of-the-art computers, the latest communications technology and trained manpower, a steady stream of export-oriented setting has been coming to India from Britain and English language publishers in Europe, instead of going to the earlier destinations in Hongkong or Singapore. This is because of three reasons  first, an English-speaking technical staff; second, a much greater awareness that in business, quality and delivery schedules finally matter; third, competitive costs.																														However, there is a considerable lack as far as the domestic market is concerned. We dont have picture libraries worth the name and without pictures, a book is half-done because now most books are picture-driven, that is, the text is woven round appropriate pictures and illustrations.																														Apart from a few private collections, the only source we have are our government agencies like the ministries of information and broadcasting, or the state tourist bureaus. It is possible to requisition the core requirements like, say, Ajanta and Ellora Caves and other heritage sites, but the choice is extremely limited and the quality of slides not up to international standards. For a publisher who is looking for a range of photographs taken from different angles on a single theme to emphasize certain perspectives, there is no option but to make do with what is available and adapt the written text to suit the picture, instead of the other way round. Inevitably, this compromises the book.																														Why havent we built up picture libraries in different subjects over the years and what does a publisher have to do if he has to break new ground, especially for coffee table heavies or for school social science texts that require lots of pictures?																														If picture libraries havent come up in any sizeable way it is because Indian publishers dont pay adequately for slides. They hope to get them free or pinch them from other books, and now the internet. This doesnt make for the best quality reproduction, but if the consumer doesnt object, why bother? Second, picture libraries take time and resources to build up. We can never hope to get together anything like the National Geographic or the Hulton Picture Library but a modest collection, properly classified and easily accessible, can be built over the next few years by scouting around for what is available, commissioning others, or even from buying specific slides from abroad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 22, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Down the drain				 																																																				Sir  It would have been so much better had the chief electoral officers enthusiasm to arrange for safe drinking water in all the polling booths in West Bengal infected the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (Steps to beat poll-day heat, April 15). Even as the authorities pull out all stops to ensure the service in booths that will determine the states political future, several city wards continue to get their supply of contaminated filtered water and the incidence of enteric cases go on rising in the city. It is the same story in Bengals districts, albeit with minor variations. The concern for safe drinking water for electoral officers and voters stands out in sharp contrast to the indifference of the governments health department and the municipal corporation to their basic responsibility of ensuring potable water to residents of the state. To Bengals electorate, in case the government and its electoral body forget, the fleeting concern for safe water on polling day appears ridiculous. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Antara Ghosh, Calcutta
				 																Sounding of the gun				 																																																				Sir  Personal attacks are part and parcel of the political propaganda that is bombarding the nation during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. It is not surprising, therefore, that Sonia Gandhi should find herself being targeted once again in the Bofors case at this delicate hour of Indian politics. But the fact that she has come up with a retort, along with the one from the usually media-shy Rahul Gandhi, is a sign that the Congress is ready to take on the challenge from the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies (Sonia breathes Bofors fire, April 11). The BJP has cunningly raked up the Bofors issue despite the Delhi high court having recently exonerated Rajiv Gandhi in the case. Is this because the saffron party is no longer confident about winning public support solely on the basis of its vision? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Many among the Indian intelligentsia are coming to Sonia Gandhis defence in the Bofors scandal. Ram Jethmalani, who often brags about his closeness to the prime minister, has parted ways with his friend on account of the BJPs persistent heckling of Sonia Gandhi over Bofors. Questions have also been raised about why the Congress president herself wasnt interrogated in the last thirteen years.				 																																																				But then Sonia Gandhi is herself to blame for keeping Bofors festering. Had she wished to put the lid on the issue, she could have given clear answers to the recent doubts that have been raised instead of lashing out at the BJP in her customary style. But no. She probably relies on history  Jawaharlal Nehru has been forgiven for not being able to prevent Partition, Indira Gandhi has been pardoned for her Emergency and Rajiv Gandhi stands condoned in the Bofors case  to rid her of Bofors.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hemant Krishna V., Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhi gets defensive whenever the Bofors issue is raised. But she ought to be reminded of two things. One, Ottavio Quattrocchi, fellow countryman and close acquaintance, who was allowed to escape from India in unseemly haste immediately after news of the Bofors kickback was first relayed on the Swedish radio in 1987. The Italian has only recently been tried in the Delhi courts. Two, as many as eight questions have been put before her by Arun Jaitley, all of which she has deftly evaded. She has gone to the extent of predicting that the Bofors scandal will be thrust upon her great-grandchildren. If Sonia Gandhi hopes to prevent that eventuality, she should consider coming out clean with her part of the story. Not only will she be forgiven by the country then, her popularity ratings will also rise. But does she have that courage?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vinay Agarwalla, via email

				 																																																				Sir  The BJP is crying wolf by digging up the Bofors case after its recent burial. The party has not been able to handle the issue well during its five-year tenure. Its revival may backfire on the coalition now.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  The reopening of the Bofors case is a political move. The balances tilt towards the BJP, more so because the Congress has been unable to give a fitting reply to the Congresss inability to react properly on the foreign origin issue.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Abhinandan Prasad, Patna

				 																																																				Sir  In retrospect, it seems that the court verdict on Rajiv Gandhi could not have been the end of the Bofors story. Sonia Gandhi needs to remember that political power will not bring her peace. For her future is as much linked to her past as to her present actions. She is basking in the reflected glory of the Nehru-Gandhis, who also have a tainted history. If she wishes to benefit from the lineage, she also has to share the burden of that past.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Abu Sahabuddin, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  In the incessant hoopla over Bofors, people seem to forget the usefulness of the Bofors guns. These guns, widely used in Kargil, brought India victory on the perilous mountains.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																Give us a break				 																																																				Sir  The endless advertisements on television severely test viewers patience. Most channels resort to frequent commercial breaks during prime time telecasts. There should be a legally imposed limit on the duration of such breaks. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  The present deluge of advertisements on television has become a source of irritation for viewers. The authorities should ensure that advertisements are banned during the telecast of important programmes, be they related to news entertainment or sports.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dhiman Chatterjee, Hooghly

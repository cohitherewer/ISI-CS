The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A tricky wire				 																																																				Sir  The latest fiasco over the wireless-in-local-loop  more popularly WiLL  technology, designed to revolutionize telecommunications in developing countries like India, is a classic case of trying to run before learning to walk (Villagers prefer to stay out of the loop, Jan 3). But who would have expected the poor, naive villagers of India to catch the government out on this one, just when the latter was beginning to bank on their gullibility? The attempt of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited to thrust WiLL upon Indian villages, knowing full well that most of them have no, or irregular, supply of power, speaks of a callousness of criminal proportions. The fact that the villagers have themselves rejected the offer of a new, advanced technology, and with solid reason, restores ones faith in the judgment of the rural Indian voter. But what will happen if Indian villagers begin to see through the facade of every governmental benevolence? Where can our politicians hide then?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, T.K. Dass, Calcutta
				 																Waterfront woes				 																																																				Sir  It is a shame to see such prominence given to the sour and ill-informed views of Soumitra Das on the regeneration of the Calcutta waterfront (Seeing through the false front, Jan 1). It doesnt make sense to claim that the British have bagged the Hooghly project, or to suggest that local consultation has not been central to the progress made so far. The facts are these. Over the past six years, the London Rivers Association has offered its expertise  based on extensive knowledge of the regeneration of the London Docklands and other port cities  entirely free of cost to the city of Calcutta. Its role has precisely been to facilitate local discussion about the future of the waterfront. One of the early fruits was the Millennium Park, whose success  over a million visitors to date  speaks for itself. Several workshops have been held in which all local stakeholders have been invited to participate, most recently to discuss how the semi-derelict Strand Road warehouses could be restored. The resulting report  which Das does not appear to have read  carefully considers how the intense flows of traffic and pedestrians in the area could be radically improved as part of the areas regeneration. And how new creative and commercial uses for the warehouses would generate employment for local people. The report is only the beginning of the process. It is now entirely in the hands of the people of Calcutta whether and how they want to take forward the concepts advocated by the report.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Andrew Hall, British deputy high commissioner, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It was heartening to read in Soumitra Dass article what needs to be shouted from the rooftops, especially that of the Writers Buildings. I was among the 30-odd local professionals who participated in the workshop where the British team picked on our knowledge of the Calcutta riverfront. We contributed ideas and designs alongside the professionals from London and were assured, upon asking, that a copy of the summary of the workshop would be distributed among all the participants. It was not done. So much for local input and public participation. I did, however, manage to get my hands on the copy of the report which was finally prepared and submitted to the state government (Kolkata Waterfront Regeneration, Strand Road Warehouses  Vision and Strategy Workshop Report And Urban Design Framework). I was amazed to find the credit for the report read Alan Baxter and Associates, English Heritage, HTA Architects Ltd, London Rivers Association, and Urban Space Management, all from the United Kingdom. Everybody else was conveniently clubbed under workshop participants  as if the agenda was predetermined, leaving no room for the fresh ideas generated in the workshop. The request to invite ideas for the project from the opportunity-starved creative community of the city was also thrown out. 				 																																																				It was presumed that the project would be handled by the British. Why? If experience of handling the Thames riverfront be the only eligibility criterion, then maybe we should consider asking them to run the Writers too. The present government intends to choke all routes of competition. Why does the government think that local professionals will not be able to handle the renovation of three warehouses? Or for that matter, evolve a brief for our riverfront? It is the incompetence of the politicians and not of our professionals that gets reflected in these decisions. Even if these offers come with the promise of funds, it still means we are selling our future to foreigners.				 																																																				It is good to see that at least The Telegraph has chosen to take a serious and mature view of the situation, and pressed for an open design competition for such public projects which will automatically separate the grain from the chaff. But then, fair competition is an anathema in the current set-up. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashish Sharan Lal, Calcutta

				 																In sickness and in health				 																																																				Sir  Doctor breathes life into girl with blood (Dec 26) paints a positive picture of doctors in Bengal. Parthasarathi Saha, who donated his blood to save the life of a critically ill child, should be congratulated for his compassion. Yet, the incident exposed the pathetic healthcare situation in the state. If Sahas blood had failed to match the patients, the child, suffering from aplastic anaemia, would have died purely because of the absence of blood banks in the area. Health authorities often cite the absence of funds as an impediment to proper treatment. However, it is education and not money that obstructs the flow of proper treatment. It is likely that the necessary tests, mandatory before any blood transfusion, were not conducted in this case. Saha cannot be blamed for doing a good turn. But the healthcare department should be held responsible for failing to provide even the most basic infrastructure for an emergency blood transfusion. And what if the patient contracts a new disease from Sahas unprocessed blood? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Colombus, US

				 																																																				Sir  The good work started by Parthasarathi Saha must be taken to its logical end by funding Shyamalis treatment. The government could come forward to shoulder the responsibility, or organizations like The Telegraph could create a pool to assist poor patients like her. I am sure that the readers will be glad to contribute for a cause such as this one.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Calcutta

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  The Scripsi on Jan 4 has been wrongly attributed to Erich Fromm. The lines are from the poem, Birches, by Robert Frost. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

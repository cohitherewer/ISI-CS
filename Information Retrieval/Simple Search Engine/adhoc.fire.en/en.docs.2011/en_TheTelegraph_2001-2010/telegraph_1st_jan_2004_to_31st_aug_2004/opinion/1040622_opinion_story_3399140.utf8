		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 							 																						THE FUTURE IS IN THREAT						DOCUMENT From Compromising Our Children: a WWF-UK Chemicals and Health Campaign Briefing, June 2004				 	 Vulnerable																														Imagine how youd feel if you woke up to find that mankind had foolishly managed to pollute the entire face of the Earth with toxic chemicals, and that those chemicals were not only contaminating wildlife species such as otters, whales and polar bears, but also people.																														Then imagine how youd feel if you discovered that pregnant women couldnt stop passing those chemicals on to the babies in their wombs, and that those chemicals were affecting the brain development and intelligence of children. Scary, isnt it? Yet thats whats happening...																														But you dont need to take only World Wildlife Funds word for it. A report for the World Health Organisation concludes, exposure (particularly prenatal exposure) to certain endocrine disrupting chemicals (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls) can have adverse effects on neurological development...and behaviour ...delays in...cognitive development have been found to be associated with neonatal PCB exposure. 																														WWFs biomonitoring survey in 2003 demonstrated that irrespective of where we live or what we do, we are all contaminated with a cocktail of toxic man-made chemicals. Some of these chemicals can adversely affect the brain and the wider nervous system. The most well-known are the ubiquitous pollutants, now banned, such as PCBs and DDT. Unfortunately, the chemical industry does not seem to have learned its lesson: there are many other man-made chemicals still being produced and used today in everyday products in the home and workplace. Data suggests that these may cause learning and behavioural difficulties.																														In humans, the brain and nervous system are very vulnerable because development takes place over a long period. It begins early in the womb and continues through puberty. The developing brain is uniquely sensitive, and effects on brain function and coordination can occur in children at levels that would not cause permanent effects in an adult.																														Unless we take action now, it may be that our children wont be as intelligent as they might be because of man-made chemicals. Worse still, they may develop behavioural problems. Our children are our future  and our future is under threat																														Interference with our bodys chemical messenger system: Some man-made chemicals can disrupt the hormone system, and can particularly interfere with the sex and thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones play an important role in orchestrating normal brain development and, along with sex hormones, guide sexual differentiation of the brain. A large number of man-made pollutants are either known to alter, or are suspected of altering, thyroid hormone function, and exposure of animals to such chemicals during early development can result in permanent effects on brain function.																														While knowledge about a few neurotoxicants (substances that are toxic to the brain and the nervous system, such as lead and mercury) is good, very little is known about the neurotoxicity of the vast majority of chemicals. Past experience shows that effects of chemicals are often not fully understood until it is too late, when generations of children have already been exposed to unsafe levels. Exposure to neurotoxicants commonly found in the environment could account for a wide variety of cases of mental retardation currently classified as due to unknown causes. 																														This is a complex issue. Some scientists consider it likely that multiple effects may interact to produce observed effects. Whatever their precise mode of action, it is clear that some man- made chemicals can cause the wiring circuitry of the brain to go awry. TO BE CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 06, 2004 							 																						BEATING RETREAT If Mr George W. Bush is there,  can Mr Tony Blair be far behind?. The president of the United  States of America has announced that he would appoint an  independent commission to investigate the intelligence reports  that were used to justify the war against Iraq. The very  next day the prime minister of Great Britain also announced  a similar inquiry into intelligence reports on banned Iraqi  weapons. That just about sums up the special relationship  between the two countries especially between Langley and  what Mr John le Carr has immortalized in fiction as the  Circus. It will be recalled that even as late as July 2003,  Mr Blair had said that he had no doubt that evidence of  weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq. Mr Bush  had also expressed similar certainties and opposed the idea  of a probe. Both leaders have compulsions that are not entirely  dissimilar. Mr Blair has been facing tremendous popular  pressure and criticism regarding his decision to go to war.  Even the Hutton report that absolved him of the charge of  sexing up intelligence reports for justifying war has  not been able to rescue Mr Blair in the popularity charts.  Mr Bush also knows that he has to face an election soon  and that there are growing doubts about the reasons he gave  the nation for going to war. The declaration, I want to  know all the facts, only underlines how inadequate was  the information on which Mr Bush decided to take his decision. Mr Bushs position has been  genuinely compromised by Mr David Kay, the former chief  US weapons-hunter in Iraq. Mr Kay told a congressional hearing  that much of the intelligence about Iraqs weapons  of mass destruction was wrong. Needless to add that  Mr Bushs critics, especially the Democratic Party,  have seized upon this to embarrass him in an election year.  Given the track record of both Messrs Bush and Blair, there  are enough reasons to suspect that the probes which have  been ordered might just be a trifle economical with the  truth. Both the US and Britain have long and rich democratic  traditions. These should not be belied by making the inquiry  commissions more political than independent. Nobody denies  that Mr Saddam Hussein was evil embodied, neither does anyone  deny that terrorism needs to be eradicated. But these tasks  cannot be accomplished on the basis of falsehood or on the  basis of facts that have been massaged in a particular way.

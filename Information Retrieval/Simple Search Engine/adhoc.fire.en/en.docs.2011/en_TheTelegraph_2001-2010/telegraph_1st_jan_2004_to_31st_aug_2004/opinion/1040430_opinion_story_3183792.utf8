The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 30, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Who has more weight?				 																																																				Sir  It is amazing that whether Balika Bodhu was a hit in the Seventies should be an election issue in Calcutta Northeast (Twists and turns of the Panja procession, April 29). But where the contest is between an aged former actress and a modern-day stage incarnation of the 19th century saint, Ramakrishna, there isnt much chance of the electoral battle ending in a nail-biting finish. Issues as inane as who draws more crowds  the theatrical Ajit Panja, or the anything-but-balika-Mousumi Chatterjee  are bound to crop up. But while pleading with didimas to ensure that he wins, Panja might be forgetting a thing or two. One, despite having a didi as a Central minister, the Trinamoolis have been unable to sink their teeth into the red bastion. And two, Mohammad Selim might be a lightweight, but the fact that no less than the chief ministers wife has come out of her seclusion to seek votes for him will add all the teeth Selim needs to knock off both Panja and Chatterjee. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,J. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Defying science				 																																																				Sir  Now that astrology has been recognized as a science by the human resource development ministry, let it be used along with exit polls, numerology, the use of tarrot cards and so on to formally forecast the election results after the last exit polls have had their say. The print and electronic media should publicize the results and give credit to the respective teams or individual astrologers. The astrologers will, hopefully, make specific forecasts which will not be based on either wild predictions or at best a gut feeling about which way the wind is blowing. If saffronites cannot stomach exit polls, they will have less to complain about if predictions are made on planetary positions. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

				 																																																				Sir  All exit polls show how the Bharatiya Janata Party has fallen flat on its face. Atal Bihari Vajpayee will now have to pay an even bigger price than last time to return to the throne. In at least twenty Lok Sabha seats around Allahabad, the BJPs opposition had a ready-made campaign plank: while the BJP was subsidizing the Indian Institutes of Management, what was it doing for the poor in Uttar Pradesh? Both Murli Manohar Joshi and the BJP will lose the elections. Prior to the elections, countless boardrooms returned the saffronites empty-handed. The IIM alumni is a powerful body whose members occupy the top positions in business and industry, and some top government positions as well. They have already filed writs in the apex court and will continue to fight to guard the IIM brand equity. Only the foolish will take on the IIM fraternity. And the BJPwallahs are such men.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N.M. Havewala, via email

				 																																																				Sir  Opinion, exit polls and poll surveys are only attempts to ascertain voting trends before the actual elections. Their reliability and degree of error depend on the methodology used. It is certainly not true that these surveys alter the outcome of the elections. The Indian electorate knows better.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  The people who talk about basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution should remember that we have the right to information, not misinformation. Zees forecast of 265 seats for the National Democratic Alliance and India Todays forecast of 340 for the alliance is certainly misleading. Moreover, covering 12,000 voters of 120 constituencies means 100 voters per constituency. Can the views of 100 voters out of roughly one million voters of each constituency be the right way to judge the direction of the wind? These polls influence many fence-sitters who decide their choice of party or candidate on the voting day itself. Even a one per cent or a two per cent swing in such votes can tilt the tide in favour of any party in the era of hung parliaments and coalition politics. 				 																																																				Huge amounts of money may even have exchanged hands for predicting forecasts in a particular partys favour. Moreover, the essence of the election process is to maintain complete secrecy till the elections are over. This is the reason why all the votes are counted only after the last phase of election is over. Ballot boxes are kept sealed and no one is allowed to see which symbol the voter is stamping on or pressing the button for. No makeshift party office is allowed to be set up on the election day within a specific distance of the polling booth, as it can influence the voters. 				 																																																				The Congress was hanged by the media even before the battle began. No one can know the result of the polls which will be decided by the collective might of the people. If the poll predictions are to be believed, then the people of India are already faced with the horrors of a hung parliament and the spectre of seeing national parties being arm-twisted by regional parties during government-formation. What is the use of holding elections at the cost of so much time and money if exit polls can decide the matter so easily? Other than puzzling voters, exit or survey polls have no purpose. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The most recent exit and opinion polls of March/April corroborate the fact that the BJPs campaign peaked a little too early. The feel good factor has evaporated since it is impossible to sustain a euphoria for the entire duration of the long-drawn Indian elections. However, BJP strategists like Arun Jaitley and Pramod Mahajan can take heart. Prannoy Roy recently pointed out that the exit poll predictions of the 1999 elections had gone awry. Despite a rosy picture of growth, trumpeted across the nation, voters are still ambivalent in their support for the BJP.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dipankar Talukdar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Exit polls have already caused nervous trading in the stock market (Money exits stocks, money bag rattled, April 28). In rural India, they are encouraging people to loot the ballot. Should they still be allowed?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah

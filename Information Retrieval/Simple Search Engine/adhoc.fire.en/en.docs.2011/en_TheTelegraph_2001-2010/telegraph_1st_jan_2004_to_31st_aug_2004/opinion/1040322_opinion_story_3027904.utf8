The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 22, 2004 							 																						TRANSFERRED VIGIL																														It is unmistakably a vote of no-confidence. The Election Commission does not think everything has been fair with the poll process in West Bengal. Hence its special measures for the Lok Sabha elections in the state, which have predictably angered the ruling leftists and enthused the opposition parties. There is nothing new about the commissions decision to appoint special observers for the polls from outside the state. This has been done before, and this is being done this time in several other states as well. But the two other steps that the EC has taken for Bengal are clearly an indictment of the state administration. The EC has always routinely transferred district magistrates or superintendents of police who have failed to inspire the commissions confidence with regard to the conducting of fair polls. But it is the first time that the EC expressed its lack of confidence in three police officers in the state by ordering their transfer from their present posts. That no previous commission had done this is certainly no reason why it cannot be done. The moot point is whether the EC has unassailable evidence to justify its action. To go simply by allegations of political parties is not enough; after all, the commissions action is a permanent slur on the officers professional integrity. But the chief election commissioner, Mr T.S. Krishnamurthy, may have upset the leftists even more by promising to bring at least fifty per cent of the polling staff from outside the state. None of his predecessors had been as forthright in questioning the impartiality of unionized or party-affiliated government employees and policemen. 																														The parties may cry fair or foul, but the EC has a constitutional obligation to make the elections free and fair. Unfair polls are a fraud on the peoples right to exercise their franchise freely. And it is no secret that partisan administrations and unscrupulous politicians conspire to try to deny the people this right. The ruling parties obviously have far greater scope to manipulate the polling process than their opponents. Even the leftists cannot deny that an overwhelming majority of employees deputed for poll duty in the state are either members of unions affiliated to leftist organizations or are left sympathizers. Even if they played by the rule book, their neutrality and fairness could always be questioned. Some pragmatic step to remedy this situation was long overdue. In fact, the EC needs to do so, not just in Bengal, but in every other state where it faces a similar situation. Bengal could be a beginning for a long-delayed clean-up of the poll mess.

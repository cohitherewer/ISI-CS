		 Thursday, January 15, 2004  DOCUMENT GOVERNMENTS ARE SUCH PRUDES  - Document  Extracts from the UNDP report on HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 In the dark  Men who have sex with men (MSM):  Sex between men is not uncommon in south Asian societies.  Studies such as those carried out by the NAZ Foundation,  a New Delhi-based NGO, highlight the widespread occurrence  of such sexual practices in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan  and Sri Lanka. HIV prevention efforts among men  who have sex with men have focussed on providing information  on safer sex, in the hope that an awareness of the risk  of HIV would enable them to choose safer options. Bandhu,  a community-based organization in Bangladesh, carried prevention  information to the general population through public campaigns  and to MSM populations through peer educators. These efforts  were supplemented with the provision of sexually transmitted  infection diagnoses and treatment, condoms and lubricants.  Studies from India and Bangladesh show that while the availability  of increased information certainly leads to greater awareness  among MSM, it has not necessarily resulted in safer behaviour.  The failure to effect behaviour change has been attributed  to poverty and the lack of skills to negotiate safer sex,  as well as sexual abuse, stigmatization and the criminalization  of homosexual behaviours. Governmental policies for HIV  prevention are often at odds with the penal laws...homosexual  behaviour is a cognizable offence in south Asian countries  such as India. At the same time, governmental AIDS programmes  are committed to protect the rights and dignity of people  living with HIV, irrespective of their sexual orientation.  These conflicting governmental policies...detract from the  effective utilization of HIV preventive services by MSM  who fear exposure and subsequent legal persecution. Youth sexuality: A related  problem is the denial of youth sexuality and of their reproductive  health needs. A large number of young people also form part  of mobile populations, with associated vulnerabilities.  A recent survey in Bangladesh showed that adolescents in  both rural and urban settings had limited knowledge of STIs/reproductive  tract infections. Urban youth were somewhat more aware,  though not necessarily better informed, than their rural  counterparts...The government and a small number of NGOs  have begun an information, education, communication programme  to inform adolescents about STI and have begun to improve  reproductive health services for the youth. In India, some  pilot curricula for life skills education, which includes  sex education, have begun. However, across south Asia there  is a widespread view among influential groups (teachers,  parents, spiritual leaders, some politicians) that sex education  for young people only contributes to the early onset of  sexual relations. Indias reproductive health policies,  while using the latest jargon and concepts, are still influenced  by traditional attitudes and mindsets. The reason often  given by government authorities for not addressing adolescent  sexuality and sexual health needs is that these issues are  not relevant as young people are not sexually active. In Iran, social and policy changes  have affected youth (including adolescent) sexual health,  although no aspect of national policy explicitly speaks  about sexual health. Both young men and women are marrying  later than in previous decades, in part because of continuing  formal education, in part because of economic constraints,  and in part because of national policy raising the permitted  age of marriage. Couples who register to marry are required  to undergo medical tests for STIs. Premarital sexual relations  and pregnancy among adolescents (particularly among unmarried  girls) are strictly censured and subject severe punishment. TO BE CONCLUDED

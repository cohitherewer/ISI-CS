		 Friday, February 06, 2004 							 																						TALES WITHIN TALES Taj: A Story of Mughal India By  Timeri N. Murari, Penguin, Rs 275  It is ironical that the Taj Mahal,  the marble mausoleum hailed as the most splendid emblem  of love came to be erected in the Mughal period  tarred  by hatred, cruelty, torture, and fratricide. Timeri N. Muraris  novel, Taj, plays out this irony, highlighting the  paranoia which gripped the minds of Mughal princes and emperors  confronted with the bewildering choice of takt ya takhta  (throne or coffin). The novel cuts a swathe of 59 years  (1607-1666 AD) from Mughal history. It is conspicuously  marked by a warped time sequence as Murari does not stick  to the linear pattern of historical time. This time-tampering  in the narrative is coupled with the epilogue predating  the prologue. The monkey and the blind, old man episode  of the prologue projects the entire novel as a flashback,  underscoring the futility of power-struggles and individual  glories represented in history.																														The two parallel narratives contrived by Murari progress with varied pace in alternating chapters. The odd-numbered chapters are titled the love story and touch on events like Shah Jahans courtship, his marriage with Arjumand Banu (later named Mumtaz-i-mahal), Mehrunissas conspiracy, Shah Jahans flight from the Mahabat Khan-led Mughal force and his eventual accession to throne, culminating in Arjumands death  all happening in the years between 1607 and 1630 AD. The even-numbered chapters, titled the Taj Mahal, are devoted to chronicling the story of Murthi, a Hindu idol-carver who is somewhat mysteriously employed to fashion the famous marble jali around Arjumands sarcophagus. The mystery is later resolved as the full identity of Isa, Arjumands favourite eunuch and Shah Jahans trusted attendant, is revealed. This second narrative covers the time period 1632-66 AD.																														Another feature that distinguishes the two sections is the difference in the narrative voices. While the first proceeds through monologues of Shah Jahan, Arjumand and Isa, the second is basically a narrative. As a result, the immediacy of intimate personal details contrasts with the suspenseful narrative which brings alive the tricky twists and turns of politics. Each narrative has its own climactic points which are discreetly played against each other. Often the content of one narrative seeps into the other and the overlap turns up interesting perspectives.																														In the final analysis, Taj remains an expertly crafted novel with richly textured details, especially of violence and erotocism. It takes the reader through the corridors of history, pointing out lanes and by-lanes hitherto uncharted. Here the refrain of Mughal history The Kingship has no Kinship rings loud, reminding one of the life of those 22,000 architects who lived and died building the proud monument of love. The filmic quality of the novel may tempt a filmmaker to put it on the celluloid in near future.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

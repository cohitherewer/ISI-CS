		 Saturday, February 28, 2004 							 																						BEAR IN HIS LAIRThe stock market should be left free of state threats and intervention so long as the market abides by SEBI norms
The most famous bear in the world, Winnie-the-Pooh, declared very truthfully that he was a bear with a very small brain. But real life bears who stalk the bourses can by no means be described as having small brains. They are sharp and calculating. They play the market to their advantage by selling shares and precipitating a fall in stock prices. This is par for the bourses. Nobody in his right mind can declare this to be wrong within the prevailing practices of the stock exchange. There are certain clear norms laid down by the securities and exchange board of India for trading and, till they are violated, a bearish activity cannot be declared to be illegal. At the present juncture, the government has announced that it will sell the shares of six public sector companies. The response of the market was mixed: three of the six had good responses in the opening bids. This was not good enough for the government, especially with two more issues about to open. Among the two is ONGC, a behemoth by any standards. The disinvestment minister, Mr Arun Shourie, true to Indian character, discovered a conspiracy behind the markets somewhat tepid response. He put it down to the working of a bear cartel and threatened dire consequences. Not to put too fine a point on it, Mr Shourie was attempting to dictate the market. A market trend not fulfilling his own or his governments expectations was linked to a conspiracy and the stock exchange was shown the stick.																														This episode shows Mr Shourie at his most unappealing. He is a professed advocate of the free market. Yet when the free market does not operate in Mr Shouries favour, he panics and tries to control the market. This suggests that the reform mindset is still to strike deep roots even in a person like Mr Shourie. It raises suspicions about the governments commitment to free and open markets. Earlier, financial institutions like the Unit Trust of India would be pressurized to buy, now a different kind of coercion is used to make the market work in the governments favour. It is entirely logical for bears in the market to push down the prices of certain shares with the aim of picking up those shares later at a lower price. This makes perfect business sense as does the forming of a bear cartel to achieve this objective. The only concern should be adherence to the SEBI norms and the laws of the land. In this particular instance, no evidence of a bear cartel has been unearthed; neither has there been any evidence of the violation of norms.																														Mr Shouries sound and fury are related to his own haste to meet disinvestment targets. Mr Shourie is trying to drive the market in a certain direction and this is determined by political considerations. At the very heart of the reform agenda is the alienation of the economy and the market from the realm of the political and the state. Mr Shourie is involved in achieving exactly the opposite by intervening in the market process. 																														Mr Shourie is a believer in the free market but he owes allegiance to a party that believes in the maximalist state. Even a bear with a very big brain would find it difficult to live with that contradiction.

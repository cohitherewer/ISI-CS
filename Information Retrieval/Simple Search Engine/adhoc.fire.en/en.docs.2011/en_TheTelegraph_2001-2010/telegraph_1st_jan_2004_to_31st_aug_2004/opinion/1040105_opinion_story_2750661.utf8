		 Monday, January 05, 2004  DOCUMENT NO CHOICE BUT LIMITED MOBILITY  - Document  Extracts from the UNDP report on HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 Tied down  In a small survey conducted among  medical personnel in Sri Lanka in 1994, Bloom et al  found that 75 per cent of hospital staff agreed with the  statement that AIDS patients are very infectious and should,  therefore, be isolated in separate wards to reduce the risk  of infecting medical personnel and other patients. Thirty-six  per cent also said that if informed about a patients HIV-positive  status, they would inform other individuals without obtaining  the patients consent. HIV-positive status can also deny  access to life and health insurance. This will seriously  limit the ability of the affected person (or household members)  to afford financial implications for the family given the  high treatment costs and the premature death of a possible  breadwinner. In a region where public expenditure on health  is limited, and the private sector is the dominant provider  of health services, every incidence of ill-health could  lead to a debt trap for poor households. This situation  is further aggravated in the absence of universal coverage  by an affordable health insurance scheme to provide for  the health needs of the poorest sections of society. Individual liberties: HIV/AIDS  and its associated stigma and discrimination have significantly  curtailed individual liberties in the economic, social and  political lives of People Living With HIV/AIDS. Social ostracism  has often been accompanied by state-sponsored restriction  of liberties as well. In the Indian state of Goa, Dominic  DSouza, who had donated blood and was found to be HIV-positive,  was kept in solitary confinement under the Goa Public Health  Amendment Act, 1985, which put anyone testing positive for  HIV under mandatory isolation. DSouza was released from  confinement after a lengthy court battle, in which the court  held that it would no longer be mandatory to detain positive  people, except in justifiable cases. The GPHAA was later  amended and such isolation was made discretionary. Similarly,  in Pakistan, an HIV-positive housemaid was sentenced to  a three-month stay in isolation at a prison hospital in  1988. Such official policies also restrict  individuals freedom of movement and their ability to travel,  within the region and beyond, whether for employment, refuge,  education or, simply, pleasure. Testing migrants and those  seeking residence for HIV is a common practice globally  and there is mandatory testing for certain populations.  A study undertaken for the World Health Organizations global  progamme on AIDS, analysed the then existing immigration  laws in 40 countries, in terms of their ability to influence  mobility across national borders. It concluded that countries  have used one or more of two sets of justifications  reducing  public financial burden and reducing risks to public health   to restrict entry on health grounds. Such restrictions  are common in the south Asian region. In Iran, the standard  visa application form inquires whether the applicant has  previously suffered from a contagious illness. A worldwide  survey of immigration restrictions suggests that curbs on  PLWHA are also present in Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka  and Pakistan.  Given that south Asia contributes  a large number of workers and domicile residents, these  restrictive policies curtail livelihood options for people  in the region and violate human rights of migrants and travellers.  South Asian migrants working overseas are often deported  because of their HIV status with no support or counselling  provided. TO BE CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 							 																						DJ VU ON THE WAY AHEAD Malvika Singh																					Pranab Mukherjee was recently on a BBC programme hosted by Karan Thapar, where he came across very poorly. There was neither grace nor aplomb in the manner he conducted himself, shouting and screaming when caught on the wrong foot. Made one feel ashamed. His imperious arrogance was wholly unsavoury. He should be severely reprimanded for this crass performance on TV by his party high command. This government has at its helm a very dignified man. The cabinet has to reflect that too.																					The general whom Pranab Mukherjee was defending and promoting was to retire. But Mukherjee, for some weird and unfathomable reason, was in a tearing hurry to promote him, two or three hours before his retirement came into effect. The question is, why? 																					There are two explanations being given. One reason why he may have acted with such rapidity: General Sharawat, who is the present DGO (ordinance), retires on the August 30. Will this general, who has been rejected for promotion thrice, who has had a reproof issued against him by General Oberoi (who was vice chief of staff), whose promotion papers were once returned to the army HQ by Kamal Pande, the then cabinet secretary, be placed there in a critical chair, ordinance, that has the authority to spend for the army? 																					The second reason for the last minute extension is because it is believed that there is a cartel of a vested interest group working to ensure their man be placed in ordinance and not General DaCunha, that therefore his file had been deliberately delayed by this cartel, that this cartel has been gunning for General DaCunha since 2000. What has the army been reduced to?																					Mr Mukherjee, as defence minister, please do not begin fiddling with the army, leave it alone and do not attempt to politicize it. Let the army chief be brought in for his final advice. Expose who is doing what, where are these facts or fiction emanating from? As someone outside of these shenanigans, one wonders if there are some in the army and in the cabinet who have taken it upon themselves to discredit the prime minister and the Congress president by such conduct. We, the citizens and the press, have to be the watchdogs of such potential and possible wrongdoings. Constant questioning is imperative. Explanations are called for.																					Cling film																					August 20 was Rajiv Gandhis 60th birth anniversary. Young, even at sixty, when compared to the leadership we have to contend with today. Most of them were senior twenty years ago. I am surprised that these doddering leaders with their walking sticks are not embarrassed when they eulogize Rajiv Gandhi. Why dont they look at themselves in the mirror and retire gracefully? Why are they like cling film attached to their gaddis?																					The corroded mindset of those wily, manipulative, discredited, decrepit and backbiting leaders had, over the past decades, destroyed the reputation of the Congress. The people had rejected it. Recently, after much internal effort to change that image, there was a different attitude developing towards the party. A fresh energy had begun to emerge, a sense of possible cleansing. Sonia Gandhi had led this restoration process in an attempt to bring in a new ethos, or so it appeared. Many young people stood for elections in 2004 and won. A generation of leaders in their late forties and fifties were recently given critical positions in the party. 																					This is the only way ahead. The old image of political operators fiddling and fixing the system must never be allowed to return. Seeing their faces is a scary dj vu! Alas, there are some in the cabinet who represent that unpleasant residue. They bring back sordid memories of the past instead of new challenges.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, February 29, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Of fire and ice				 																																																				Sir  After Mayavati, J. Jayalalithaa. Their birthdays have made political headlines in recent times. But while the spotlight in Mayavatis case was on the squandering of public money, Amma would not brook such allegations  she absented herself from her own birthday celebrations. She utilized the time denying renomination to most winners of the 1999 assembly elections (Party cuts birthday cake, Jaya poll list, Feb 25). Mayavati has been busy making enemies too, spurning even those who have been soliciting her friendship. The difference is, Mayavati goes about it breathing fire, Amma breathing ice.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Zayn Naqvi, Bangalore
				 																Brown study				 																																																				Sir  It is not clear from Confessions of a coconut (Feb 21) why Ramachandra Guha feels that British colonization of India can be glorified. If one has read the history of British India, one knows that the British first arrived here for the purpose of trading, which began with the setting up of the East India Company. In the process, they surreptitiously converted India into a colony riding on their superior technological and military powers. The native Indian population was tortured and virtually enslaved. If the British constructed the railways and started English education, it was not with the aim of improving the lives of the Indians, but to set up convenient routes to strengthen their hold over them. Engaging in Indian cultural anthropology was a favourite pastime of the British educational zealots, to devise ways of keeping the natives at bay.				 																																																				Indian colonial history has never been one of benevolence and kindness. It is futile to ponder what would have happened if India were colonized by the French or the Dutch instead of the British. Why should we consider colonization as the inevitable destiny of India? To be indebted to the British for things that were never meant to benefit the Indians (but which accidentally yielded positive consequences) is to display ones ignorance of history and an inferiority complex. Thankfully, when we talk about the golden age of our history, we still mean the reign of Chandragupta Maurya and not that of Queen Victoria.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guha interacts well with the readers. He begins Confessions of a coconut recalling the letters of protest he had received after he had suggested in one of his earlier articles (Rooted cosmopolitans, July 22, 2001) that the cultural elite of Bengal were prone to be dual nationals. Lest people mistake his thesis to cover all Bengalis, in his subsequent articles, he clearly mentioned bhadralok intellectuals. That was nice of him. Guha, like the British he talks about, is a gentleman, in spite of being a philistine.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sujit De, Sodepur

				 																Holiday blues				 																																																				Sir  I have been wondering why Rajiv Pratap Rudys holiday in Goa caused such a stir in the media. I am a retired executive of one of the leading public sector undertakings in the country. Having worked for over 20 years, I have not only seen ministers misusing public money and facilities, but have watched even bureaucrats and personal assistants of ministers doing the same. Senior PSU officials are ever so ready to bend the rules to accommodate the wishes of the ministers and their cronies. The reason, obviously, is that the assessment, posting and promotion of these individuals are controlled by the ministries. Unless the PSUs are made autonomous, this kind of malpractice will continue to thrive.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If citizens and officials are to be honest, their representatives in Parliament and legislatures must also be honest. After all, the MPs and MLAs enjoy larger salaries and perquisites than the average citizen. This is why it rankles that ministers like Rajiv Pratap Rudy do not feel any pangs of guilt even after unceremoniously robbing the masses. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had promised that his party would be a party with a difference in honesty, seems to have forgotten to instruct his flock to practise the art of honesty. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

		 Sunday, May 16, 2004  RED LETTER DAY 
 They wooed Karunanidhi, played footsie with Sonia and befriended Sharad Pawar. For the Left Front, the canny election strategy has finally paid off. Bishakha De Sarkar reports on a campaign with a difference Caution first: Sonia Gandhi (top) and Harkishen Singh Surjeet 																														Elsewhere, thousands of people had milled out in the streets in front of their party offices, dancing to the frenzied drum beats of victory. And in New Delhi, a group of 60 men and women resolutely marched ahead with red flags and slogans. Lal Qila pey lal nishaan, a lone voice boomed. Maang raha hai Hindustan, chorused the remaining 59.																														On any other day, the sudden arrival of a group of slogan-shouting supporters would have shaken the portals of the A.K. Gopalan Bhawan, the central office of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). In the best of times, the air in the two major Left party offices in New Delhi is fairly somnolent. But no more. These days, the ambience is that of a bustling coffee house. Endless cups of coffee go by on trays as college lecturers sit in huddled corners, young student supporters troop in and out and old men with walkers shakily hug leaders they had once seen in short-pants.																														The communists have never had it this good. With a record 59 MPs, the Left Bloc is back on centrestage. For the last several months, its leaders were out on the streets, campaigning for party candidates and allies. Last Thursday, it became clear that the Congress would lead a coalition government at the Centre and the Left would support it. It was an historic win, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury croaks  having lost his voice in the dustbowls of a summer campaign.																														The Left now sits in sequestered quarters, debating on whether or not to join the government. That it will support the government was never in doubt, but in the last few days, pressure has been building up in and outside the Left, urging it to join the Congress-led government. The parties  mainly the CPM and the Communist Party of India (CPI)  have been informally approached by the Congress. Former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh has also asked the Left to take up the responsibility of governance. Apart from lending stability to the government, it will be a golden opportunity for the Left, says Singh.																														In 1996, when CPM stalwarts Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet were inclined to form the government at the Centre, they were outvoted by a section of party leaders, especially those from West Bengal. Party insiders insist that 2004 is not going to be very different. At a politburo meeting on Saturday, most leaders spoke in favour of staying out of the government while agreeing to support the Congress from outside. That would mean the CPI is out as well, since the two parties this time have decided to have a common position  unlike 1996, when the CPI had joined the government on its own.																														The CPM, the insiders hold, was under pressure from different quarters to review its 1996 stand. Left economist Prabhat Patnaik called on CPM general secretary Surjeet earlier this week, urging him to join the government. In the CPI office, among those pressing for a greater Left participation were lecturers from the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Unless you do so, you will never be able to make a mark in the north, an academic urged CPI secretary D. Raja. 																														For the Left, the stakes this time were higher than ever before. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was sitting comfortably, with its six-year-long, two-term innings, at the Centre. The Congress had lost its workers and organisational infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh, electorally still the most important state in the country. The anti-BJP vote was divided and the Left parties had only minor pockets of influence. 																														Today, the Left is back, wielding power at the Centre. The Congress is the single largest party and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has been routed. The Left, which worked on a possible scenario like this for months, has succeeded in reaching its target. This was a watershed election, says CPM Rajya Sabha member Nilotpal Basu.																														The turning point for the Left was the 2001 massacre in Gujarat  and the subsequent BJP victory in the state. Another term for the NDA would have meant another Gujarat, says Yechury. Adds Raja: It was Gujarat that really egged us on.																														Party leaders hold that they chalked out a comprehensive plan for the campaign that followed. Aware that a national alliance would not work in a situation where there was little to unite disparate parties, the Left focussed on regional alliances. For an alliance in Andhra Pradesh, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan persuaded Surjeet to join a front with the Telengana Rashtriya Samity (TRS)  a separatist front that the Marxists have been opposed to. You dont have to worry about the TRS, Comrade Surjeet, Bardhan told the CPM leader. We are going with the Congress, and its the Congress that has an alliance with the TRS, he argued. 																														In Tamil Nadu, efforts to rope in the DMK had started well before the elections. State units of the Left parties kept their channels open with the DMK, and once the party had broken off with the NDA, Surjeet and Bardhan travelled to Chennai to meet DMK strongman M. Karunanidhi. When Vaiko of the MDMK was arrested under POTA, the Left condemned the law, and when he was released, Raja made it a point to call him in Chennai to congratulate him.																														In West Bengal, even nonagenarian Jyoti Basu came out on the streets to ensure the defeat of the BJPs Tapan Sikdar from the Dum Dum seat. At a special party meeting, Basu urged two warring factions of the CPM  whose bitter infighting had apparently helped the BJP win the seat  to join hands for a BJP defeat. I live in this constituency, Basu told the workers. Before I die, I want to see the victory of the Left here. On Thursday, the Election Commission announced the surprise defeat of Sikdar and a CPM triumph.																														Elsewhere, Left workers helped the Congress in the ways it could. CPM insiders believe that the Left had a hand to play in the victory of Pranab Mukherjee in Jangipur. In the Chandni Chowk constituency, Kapil Sibal had asked the CPM to help him out when a few Delhi party leaders had voiced their support for a Janata Dal candidate who later stepped down in favour of Sibal. CPM workers were among those campaigning for the Congressman in the bylanes of the Walled City.																														Unity, clearly, was the buzzword for the Left. And coupled with this was the realisation that a mere plank of secularism would not work this time. Instead, the parties sought to focus on economic issues. We tried to make common cause on the economic front, says Basu. Its not enough to shout about secularism from roof-tops. We tried to establish the link between those who threatened secularism and who promoted policies that worsened the economic situation, he says. 																														The effects of the toil show. Yechury has lost his voice, and strain is writ large on Ardhendu Bhushan Bardhans face as he sits down for his lunch  a simple meal of rotis, some paneer and a glass of curd  in his office at Ajoy Bhawan. The CPI general secretary was the one who successfully hammered out an alliance between the Congress and Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) this spring. Sharad is an old friend, explains Bardhan.																														Bardhan persuaded Sonia to invite the NCP to join a common front, and forced Pawar to drop his anti-Sonia stance. During a meeting with Sonia, Bardhan pressed her to invite the smaller parties to form a front with the Congress. You have to invite the smaller parties because you are the bigger partner, Bardhan is believed to have told Sonia. Their stakes are smaller than yours. You want power, they only want a few seats here and there. 																														The Left has played a major role in this election. Except in Uttar Pradesh, where its efforts to coalesce a united anti-NDA front failed to materialise, it managed to cobble out such arrangements in every state. There was enormous discontent against the NDA. We didnt want the feeling to get dissipated, says Basu. This strategy worked everywhere except in UP, where we couldnt persuade the different parties to come together, says Basu.																														But the real battle  the party leaders stress  begins now. To extend support, the Left is going to make a few demands  including the setting up of an employment ministry, focus on food security, scrapping disinvestment for profit-making companies and form a review committee to look into changes made in text books. We have to make sure that the new government is not seen as revengeful, says Bardhan. We should not be on a witch-hunting spree.																														Yechury adds that the Left-supported government would not be anti-reforms, or against foreign investments. Corporate profit and peoples interests are not necessarily antagonistic to each other, he says.																														The government is yet to be formed, but the parameters are being laid out. The exercise, the leaders stress, is going to be a delicate one. We are not going to squeeze the government so much that it dies, says Revolutionary Socialist Party leader Abani Ray. The idea is to strike a compromise, he says.

		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 							 																						AT THE RECEIVING END 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Ethics and polices																														Judicial issues: Apart from the United States of America and Australia, the highest number of HIV/AIDS-related litigation has perhaps taken place in India. In 1997, the Lawyers Collective challenged the termination of the services of a worker on the ground of being HIV-positive though the person was otherwise functionally healthy. In a landmark judgment of the Mumbai high court, the worker was reinstated and paid back wages. More importantly, the Collective was able to obtain an order of suppression of identity because of which the HIV-positive person could sue under a pseudonym. 																														A study of 130 cases handled by the Lawyers Collective between 1998 and 2001 found that the most important legal issue for men related to employment. In the case of women, the major problem related to maintenance, custody of children and property rights (such as matrimonial or joint property rights). An increase in the number of divorce cases was also noted. It has been suggested that women remain vulnerable within the institution of marriage due to the unjust gender construction of sexuality in various Indian laws.																														Many of the south Asian countries have undertaken several measures to reform the legal climate surrounding HIV/AIDS. Some of them are: organizing and training a nation-wide network of lawyers to handle individual complaints; providing free legal services; organizing workshops to formulate policies for the protection of the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS and their families; and campaigning for the decriminalization of homosexuality and sex work and for formulation of laws covering issues such as HIV testing, confidentiality of HIV results and discrimination against people with HIV...																														Legislative reforms: The need for legislative reforms has been underlined at regional workshops on HIV law, ethics and human rights organized in the early and mid-Nineties by the United Nations Development Programme regional project on strengthening responses to the HIV epidemic in Asia and the Pacific. The issue still remains to be adequately addressed by most countries. 																														In most countries of the region, doctors who wish to prescribe anti-retroviral drugs to survivors of rape find themselves torn between government policy and medical ethics. These drugs are used as Post Exposure Prophylaxis for occupational exposure and to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV...However, many countries limit the use of PEP to occupational exposure and not to rape. This violates the rights of persons surviving sexual violence, compromises their treatment and care and infringes upon doctors ethical duties. Moreover, even in countries that have policies for PEP provisions in occupational exposure, there is limited knowledge about such provisions, reducing their operational efficacy...																														Entrenched conservative attitudes in most countries in the region renders the liberalization of laws relating to homosexuality difficult... 																														One issue that has dominated the law reform scene in India and Sri Lanka is the proposed repeal of the provision in the respective penal codes making it an offence to engage in carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal. This section applies to homosexual as well as heterosexual oral and anal sex. In 1995, Sri Lanka amended certain sections of the Penal Code and the repeal of the provision dealing with homosexual acts was recommended. In passing the amendment, however, the legislature not only decided to retain the section making homosexuality an offence but widened its scope to cover sexual relations between females by replacing the word males with persons. Such incidences have led to greater harassment of sexual minorities. TO BE CONCLUDED

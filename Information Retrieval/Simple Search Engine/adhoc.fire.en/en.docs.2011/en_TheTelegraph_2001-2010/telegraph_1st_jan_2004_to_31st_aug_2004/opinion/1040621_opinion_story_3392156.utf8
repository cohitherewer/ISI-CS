The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 21, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Fair but ugly				 																																																				Sir  Bolivias entrant in the Miss Universe contest, Gabriela Oveido, has described herself as a tall white woman and not a short Indian peasant. This proves that the phrase, beauty with brains, is not quite the way to appraise people like her (Miss Bolivia accused of racist insult, May 30). However, one cannot blame Oveido only for her racial views. The notion that white is beautiful is white is something which most Indian men believe in as well. A glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers would show that prospective brides have to be not just homely, but also fair. This leads to darker women facing discrimination and even abusive marriages in our country. Looks, rather than merit, often influence decisions to promote women at work. Such a bias also helps the cosmetics industry to make money by persuading unsuspecting consumers the indispensability of fairness creams and lotions. Oveidos racist remarks need to be put in place, but we also need to put our own house in order first.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Timir Basu, Calcutta

				 																Of love and other demons				 																																																				Sir  The violence directed at Girlfriend is an example of the dangers lurking within Indian society (Sena boys cant stand Girlfriend, June 15). In a healthy society, protests are organized in a civil manner. But in India, the self-appointed guardians of morality take the law in their own hands to protest against anything which they deem as unIndian. Unfortunately, the Shiv Sena cannot be blamed alone. In West Bengal, a group of intellectuals had asked the state government to ban Taslima Nasreens book, Dwikhandito, for hurting the sentiments of the minority community. While it is usual for any work made public to offend the sensibilities of a few, it is unacceptable that they be banned. Banning is a serious move which implies that the society at large cannot think or decide on a certain matter. Hopefully, Girlfriend will not be banned. 				 																																																				Homosexuality, in India, is often associated with the West. However, it is important to distinguish between what is foreign and what is fundamental. Many aspects of modernity  rationality and democracy  are products of the West. But the protection of the rights of sexual minorities is a fundamental human issue rather than an imported one. We should stop acting like some other conservative societies which reject modernity in the name of preserving indigenous values. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The assertion of the Shiv Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, that lesbianism doesnt exist in Hindu families is ridiculous. Lesbianism has forever existed in India and will continue to do so. The sculptures on the Sun temple in Konarak and some other temple sites display lesbo-erotic postures. Lesbianism is not restricted to any particular culture, religion, society, or class. Neither should lesbians be stopped from enjoying their fundamental rights because of they are a sexual minority. People like Thackeray should remember that vandalizing cinema halls will not brush the issue under the carpet. Their denials only expose their lack of knowledge about Indias culture, literature and history. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Indian film directors do not have the competence to handle complex issues such as homosexuality. One reason for this is their primary aim to titillate the audience for commercial reasons. They go for unrealistic situations, thus undermining the sincerity which these projects demand, unlike film-makers in the West. Films like Jism and Girlfriend have proved that Indian film-makers are hellbent on sensationalizing issues about which they understand very little.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

				 																																																				Sir  I am convinced that adults need sex education more than children.The makers of Girlfriend, as well as those who find it offensive, are cashing in on the controversy for gaining commercial and political mileage. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Shiv Sena seems to derive pleasure from demonstrating against anything which is alien to their parochial ideology; be it Valentines Day, cricket with Pakistan or movies like Girlfriend. Also, the Sena should not have directed its ire at theatre owners. If the censor board has passed Girlfriend, who are these people to protest? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Saket Yadav, Durg 

				 																																																				Sir  The double standards of our moral crusaders are shocking. What have they done for the widows of Gujarat? Why cant these zealots stand up for the women who die of poverty and starvation in Orissa, Bihar or West Bengal? Where were they when a mentally retarded woman was raped in a local train in Mumbai? The answer to all these questions is simple  these hoodlums indulge in such cowardly acts to hog the headlines.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Zahir Abbas, Pune 

				 																A different crime				 																																																				Sir  As divisional forest officer, Nadia-Murshidabad division, I strongly oppose the report,  Nexus behind felling amp; freebie (June 15) by Alamgir Hossain. I would like to confirm that neither Rana Dutta, assistant divisional forest officer, Nadia-Murshidabad division, had given any statement to The Telegraphs reporter nor was any forest official involved in such a type of forest crime.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.N. Paul, divisional forest officer, Nadia-Murshidabad division, Krishnagar, Nadia

				 																																																				Alamgir Hossain replies:				 																																																				I did speak to Rana Dutta, additional divisional forest officer of Nadia-Murshidabad division, who, after saying that he was aware that trees were being cut, refused any further comment. As for forest officials being involved in forest crimes, the Murshidabad district magistrate, Manoj Panth, himself has admitted that this was happening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 18, 2004 							 																						MAKING A PLANNED ENTRYNeha Sahay																					The 7.25 million students appearing for the just concluded college entrance examination across China signed an honesty bond aimed at preventing the large-scale cheating that takes place every year during this crucial exam. Like every official move in todays China, this one was also linked to the market economy. A Communist Party official pronounced that education on credibility was critical to a market economy, and that it had been somewhat missing under the previous planned economy. Signing the bonds prepared students for a future in a market economy.																					Did he mean that cheating in exams was pass in Maos times, or that exams were not taken too seriously then? That seems strange, for even those born after Mao died in 1976 recall that the paucity of universities in the Eighties made a college seat so prized that only the very intelligent considered appearing for the entrance exam, and among them, just a few got in. It was more difficult for those who were schooled in Maos China. Today, about 60 per cent of those who appear are expected to get into college, though perhaps not one of their choice.																					In stages																					Since 1978, China has had a four-tier education system: six years of primary school and three years of middle school, both compulsory (but not free). The student is by then 15-years-old. Then follows an optional three years of high school, and then college. Admission into the last three stages is on the basis of exams, conducted respectively by individual school, provincial and national boards. 																					The system is not much different from ours for the last two major exams: the same heavy syllabi, solving of the last 10 years papers, emphasis on marks and the same competition among schools for toppers. To ensure good results, some schools follow the system now under legal scrutiny in Mumbai: dividing students according to their performance. Schools encourage final-year students to spend all day at school, including the evenings.																					When D Day dawns, not only parents, but also the authorities give it all theyve got. The former wait outside exam centres, some with flowers. This year, the authorities held the college entrance exam a month earlier to avoid the July heat: temperatures are already at a record high. In Beijing, police diverted traffic and tried to ensure a noise-free environment at the exam centre.																					Select few																					Not surprisingly, school kids here are as stressed as in India, perhaps even more because this is the first one-child generation. Exam-related suicides are as yet uncommon (though not unknown), but the emphasis on performance takes its toll early enough. A survey of 1,000 six to 12-year-olds in Shanghai found 78 per cent of them unhappy, one reason being parental pressure on them to do well. Some provincial authorities have now forbidden middle schools from conducting entrance exams. One teenager threatened to skip her high-school exams when she found out that her mother had been scanning the messages on her mobile phone while she was at school in the evenings.																					Mobiles are common among well-off urban schoolchildren, and are put to good use during exams to receive answers. This year, students had to put up with cameras inside exam centres, and rules forbidding mobiles, pagers, calculators and visits to the toilet. Hiring others to write exams has been declared a strict no-no.																					In one respect, the market economy has changed education radically. Under the much-reviled planned economy, whatever the criteria for getting into high school and college (brains and the right political background?), it was certainly not money as it is now. Rural children are the most disadvantaged, dropping out because they cant afford high school, or because with both parents working in cities, theres no one to motivate them. Despite the obstacles, this year, rural students made up for 55 per cent of the total number of candidates for the college entrance exam. The worry is: how many of them will be selected over their slicker and better-connected city counterparts? And will these select few be able to afford life in big city campuses?

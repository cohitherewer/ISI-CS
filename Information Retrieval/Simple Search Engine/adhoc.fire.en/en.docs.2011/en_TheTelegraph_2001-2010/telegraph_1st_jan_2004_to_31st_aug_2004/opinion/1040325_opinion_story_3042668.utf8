The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 							 																						TO WIN GOODWILL																														The chant of victory is always sweeter than the sound of the ball on the willow. Even that fictitious entity called the non-partisan cricket-lover  there are a few masquerading as such  would have secretly participated in the jubilation that followed Indias victory in the one-day internationals against Pakistan. It was a hard-fought series, and the outcomes of the matches were decided mostly by very narrow margins. Both teams were under pressure because India and Pakistan are seen as traditional rivals and also because they were meeting on the cricket pitch in Pakistan after a number of years. The pressure was not obvious but it was ubiquitous. Throughout the series, cricket has not been of a particularly high order, neither was it expected to be. Both teams were under pressure as they were playing traditional rivals and also because both teams knew that there was more than cricket invested in this tour. From the beginning, the tour was billed as a goodwill tour  a part of the diplomatic package created by the Indian prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to establish normal relations with Pakistan. Cricket was laced with a heavy dose of diplomacy and goodwill, and the end result was a heady cocktail for politicians and cricket fans. The euphoria followed from the goodwill rather than from the quality of the cricket that was played.																														Politics was more important than cricket in the oneday internationals and will continue to be so in the test matches that will follow. In another famous event of the 20th century, sports was used as a part of a diplomatic initiative. This was when table tennis  or ping pong  was used as a thawing device in the relationship between Uncle Sam and the Great Dragon. Cricket is playing the same role in the relationship between India and Pakistan. Cricket-lovers will choose to remember their favourite shot from the bat of Sachin Tendulkar or Inzamam-ul Haq, but for Mr Vajpayee and Mr Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistan president, the most memorable image of the series will be two kites flying over the field at Lahore. One bore the Pakistan flag and the other the Indian tricolour. At least on the cricket field and among the spectators, the animosity and the hatred have evaporated. Mr Musharrafs presence in the matches at Rawalpindi and Lahore only underlined the fact that cricketers were playing at more than cricket. The purist cricket-lover may not approve of this meshing of politics and cricket, but the popular response will make the quest for purity, and winning and losing completely irrelevant. The goodwill aspect of the tour has prevailed over cricket, but it has perhaps created conditions in which cricket between India and Pakistan will flourish.

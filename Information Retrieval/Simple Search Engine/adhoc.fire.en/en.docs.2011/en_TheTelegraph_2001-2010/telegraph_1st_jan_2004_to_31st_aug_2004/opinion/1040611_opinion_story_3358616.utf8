		 Friday, June 11, 2004 							 																						PITCHING IT HIGHFor the genuine cricket lover, paradise is a test match in progress at Lords. This book (GROUND RULES: A CELEBRATION OF TEST CRICKET, edited by Barney Spender, Daikini, 44.95) is a little more than what its sub-title suggests. It celebrates test cricket through some of the great cricket grounds of the world. Lords heads the list, of course, as it should. The picture far left is however from Londons other ground, The Oval, and it shows the Middlesex twins, Edrich and Compton, running the gauntlet after winning the Ashes in 1953. Lords is celebrated through a piece of sacrilege and there no prizes for guessing which photograph this refers to. The incident occurred in 1975. Harold Larwood scored 98 in Sydney, and then there was a swish of the bat and he was gone. Those who do not know the young man looking elegant as he plays a drive on his knees are obviously new to cricket. David Gowers lazy brilliance is manifest in the introduction to this book.

		 Friday, February 06, 2004 							 																						THIS TOO IS TIMELESS INDIA 																														INDIA: THE DEFINITIVE IMAGES, 1858 TO THE PRESENT (Penguin, Rs 1,250), edited by Prashant Panjiar and introduced by Khushwant Singh, presents a political, social and cultural history of modern India through photographs. Photography is 160-odd years old in India, but the reigning presences in this collection are Raghu Rai and Henri Cartier-Bresson. This is how Rai captures Indira Gandhi as prime minister, in 1970, with her ministers at her office in Parliament House. He was doing a photo feature on a day in the life of Mrs Gandhi: She was the lone woman in the room and there was no mistaking who the boss was. It was often said that Mrs Gandhi was the only man in her cabinet, and this picture shows exactly why. It came to symbolize the phenomenal power one woman had in our otherwise male-dominated society. There are also photographs by Raghubir Singh, Sebastiao Salgado and Raja Lala Deen Dayal.

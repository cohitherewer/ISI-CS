		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 							 																						AT A GREATER DISADVANTAGE 															- Document Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Taken for a ride																														Attempts to establish intuitive links between mobility and HIV/AIDS have often resulted in stigmatization of migrants as well as restrictions on them, including forced testing for HIV and deportation of those found positive and limitations on the rights of women to move in some countries. The inhumane and exploitative conditions that most migrants face in source areas, during transit and within host communities in destination countries need to be changed and a comprehensive response needs to be developed to facilitate safe migration, thereby reducing HIV/AIDS related vulnerabilities. 																														It must be stressed that migrants are neither carriers of the virus nor are they responsible for the spread of the epidemic. They are often unaware of whether they have been exposed to HIV and of the potential harm this poses to their spouses and unborn children. Most of those returning home because of illness arising from various opportunistic infections are not aware that HIV is the cause of their poor health. Many, especially those in West Asia, are deported without explanation if found to be HIV positive. In the rare cases where they may have knowledge about their HIV status, the climate of stigma and discrimination makes them reluctant to disclose their status within their communities and even families. Importantly, the female spouses/partners of male migrants are further disadvantaged because existing asymmetrical power and gender equations make it difficult for them to protect themselves against HIV infection.																														Vulnerability of women migrants: The gender dimension of migration-related vulnerability presents a complex picture. The number of women migrating is increasing within south Asia. Globally, the percentage share of female labour in the total agricultural labour force is reported to have increased from 44 per cent to 48 per cent within the last 50 years, in spite of the share of agricultural labour within the total labour force declining by over 20 per cent within the same time period. Such gender-specific trends also give rise to particular migratory patterns, leading to what may be termed the feminisation of migration across the region.																														For many women, migration  in addition to being a livelihood strategy  is also an escape route from limitations imposed by traditional societies, oppressive laws and abuse or violence. A study in Bangladesh has shown that families tend to urge women to migrate when they are perceived as being a burden to the family. There are also higher expectations from women to send back remittances...																														The circumstances of such migration processes, coupled with the limited preparedness, may create conditions that lead to women  especially young girls  being lured with false promises of employment and marriage and being trafficked in to the sex trade, slavery and exploitation. Gender biases limit the access of women migrants to information and services that could make their movement safer. These women also lack support mechanisms within their source-communities, thus confining their knowledge to hearsay. All these factors exacerbate womens vulnerability to HIV. 																														Women migrants are often victims of violence and harassment. Reports of sexual assault by employers and others are common both within the region and overseas, and legal redress is rarely available or availed of...Contrary to popular belief, the vulnerability to HIV remains high for those migrating with families as well. When men migrate in search of work, women left behind are often exploited including sexually. As sole caretakers of the children and family they are especially vulnerable as the expected incomes from male migrants are often unstable or inadequate. 																														Trafficking and HIV/AIDS are presenting serious threats to the health, dignity and lives of young women and girls across the region. The nexus of poverty, HIV and the marketing of youth within and across borders is creating ever-widening circles of desperate insecurity and disproportionately threatens the lives of young girls, making poor people poorer through sickness, loss of livelihoods and rejection by society. The epidemic is severely undermining human security and human rights, destroying the lives of individuals and families and posing a serious threat to the social capital and the overall development of the region...																														The integral connection between HIV/AIDS, gender and trafficking through the nexus of vulnerability and sexual violence, can be summed up as follows: the factors, which determine the context of trafficking, are also the factors, which are associated with the increased vulnerability of women and girls to HIV/AIDS...;trafficking is part of a pattern of migration within and across countries...;those caught in the web of trafficking face an increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS...

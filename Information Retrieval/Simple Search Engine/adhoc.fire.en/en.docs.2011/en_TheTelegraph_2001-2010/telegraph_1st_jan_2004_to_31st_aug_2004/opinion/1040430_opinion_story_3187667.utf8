		 Friday, April 30, 2004 							 																						GIVE MEMORY A VOICE				 	 Legacy revisitedNo Womans Land Women from Pakistan, India amp; Bangladesh write on the Partition of India Edited by Ritu Menon, Women Unlimited, Rs 300Ashis Nandy had once famously said that the silence that pervades the subject of Partition is a joint venture of the victims, the historians and the State. It is not the silence of unconscious memories, it is the silence of a secret self. Over the years, the will to break this nexus of silence has grown stronger. Individual voices are being picked out from the grand saga of victimization, historians persuaded to go beyond seeing Partition as aberrant nationalism, and efforts made to share the burden of this history with those who have suffered the most  women.																					The earlier Borders and Boundaries: Women in Indias Partition, edited by Ritu Menon and Kamla Bhasin, was part of this attempt. No Womans Land is a continuation of that larger project. But Menon does not stop at Partition. Through the writings, reminiscences and interviews with women spread across the three nations, she tries to find out how the women are coping with this legacy today. Sometimes the story is carried into present-day America, sometimes along the tracks of the vehicles that carried recovered women and children across the borders.																					Where did Partition carry the women? Into Pakistan, or back to India, or across to Bangladesh? Nowhere, says Menon. That most modern thing, a Muslim nation or a Hindu nation, has no place for women... But why? Because they are the flotsam and jetsam of historical events  present perhaps, but of no great significance. Afterwards, they are called upon to pick up the pieces, clean up the mess, rebuild and resettle, somehow manage, somehow forgive and forget. Above all, forget.																					That is precisely what the sheikhnis have done. Forty years after she had left Muzaffarabad, Ranjit Kaur went back to find out how Hindu and Sikh converts were doing. The Hindu women, now known as sheikhnis, who had been forced to marry their abductors, had forgiven their tormentors, borne them children and lived happily. That is, all except one who could not forget so easily. She killed all the children she bore her husband-abductor. The last two she let go. By that time, she had given up hopes of being rescued.																					Menon says, A refugees right of return...was never available to Partition refugees, even though the thousands who fled at a moments notice were sure they would return when the fury of violence abated. Sometimes the return could be made possible only through terrible lies or after children conceived on the tortuous road had been abandoned. But most often, the walls that went up could never be breached. That is why Bibi Jaan, married only two kilometres away from her maternal village across the LoC, could not visit her parents in 50 years.																					It is not Menons intention to brood. For calamities can also make for opportunities for women. Had familial ties not broken, women would have found it difficult to make the headway they did during those years. In Bengal, activists like Manikuntala Sen and Phulrenu Guha witnessed the uncompromising spirit of the refugee women who started their own enterprise or joined left politics. As the work of rehabilitation fell on women, they negotiated, subverted, manipulated or bullied, as required, to do the right thing by (sic) the women in their charge.																					The women are never without agency. Whether they decide to consciously give in to the conspiracy of fate (as Basanti in Two women, one family), to abandon their nation (Papa and Pakistan) or to willingly partake of sexual pleasure (Lady camp commandant). Through their incessant compromises, they over-write all accepted notions of identity and allegiances. Their only unchanging identity is that of womanhood. Is that what Nandy calls the secret self?						CHIROSREE BASU

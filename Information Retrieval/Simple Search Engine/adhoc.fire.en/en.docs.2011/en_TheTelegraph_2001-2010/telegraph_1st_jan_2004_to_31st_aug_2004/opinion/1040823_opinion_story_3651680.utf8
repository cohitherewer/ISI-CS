The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 23, 2004 							 																						FOR THE FUTURE																														The Tata investment proposal in Bangladesh is not yet final. However, since synergies on both sides are tapped, there is no reason why it should not materialize. Two billion US dollars will be invested in a power plant, a fertilizer factory and a steel unit. The 1 million tonne fertilizer unit and the 1,000 megawatt power plant will use natural gas as raw material, and the steel unit will also be gas-powered. Bangladesh has an abundance of gas reserves and simultaneously faces demand for power, fertilizers and steel, with no domestic iron ore required for the latter. If the proposal is eventually approved, this will be the largest foreign direct investment project in Bangladesh. Given the size of the project and its time frame, the Tata group understandably wants guaranteed gas supply. While Bangladesh has agreed in principle, tricky issues like price of delivery remain under negotiation. However, a specific project that is good for Bangladesh and good for the Tatas, also has some general messages. For a start, Indias North-east continues to be marginalized and bypassed in the economic growth process and this manifests itself in undesirable political fallouts. Mainstreaming the North-east will not be possible without closer economic relationships with Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries. 																														The potential for Indo-Bangladesh trade has been enumerated ad nauseam and is about to result in a free trade agreement. However, implementation continues to be obstructed by insistence on rules of origin, local content and other procedural problems, including testing and certification procedures. But more importantly, the potential is even greater for cross-border investments, of which the Tata project is an instance. Bangladesh enjoys the status of a least developed country and in the foreseeable future, this ensures preferential duty access in third country markets. In addition to locational advantages, labour laws are also more flexible in Bangladesh. 																														Apart from bilateral agreements, liberalization is also contemplated in the BIMSTEC framework, even if one argues that the South Asian Free Trade Association is uncertain. Nevertheless, it is possible to jack up bilateral liberalization to cover services and cross-border movements of labour and capital. Protectionist fears on both sides are exaggerated. In any case, formal liberalization will often only legitimize illegal trade and movements that already occur. While the case for greater economic cooperation does not need reiteration, constraints are inevitably political. And this is reinforced by mistrust and lack of information. The south Asian countries have now been independent long enough for long-term economic visions to override short-term myopia. Much that has happened in Europe would have been regarded as impossible fifty years ago.

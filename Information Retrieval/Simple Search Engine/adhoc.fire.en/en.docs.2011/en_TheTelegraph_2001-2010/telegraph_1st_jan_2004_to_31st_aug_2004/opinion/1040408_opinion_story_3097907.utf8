The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 							 																						MORE THAN A PINCH OF SAFFRON The BJP is winning hearts and minds more than it is winning seats in Bengal. Ashis Chakrabarti wonders what this says of a new generation of Bengalis				 	 Family values																														Until Mamata Banerjee changed things, Bengal and the Bharatiya Janata Party  or any of its earlier avatars like the Hindu Mahasabha and the Bharatiya Jan Sangh  never went together. To BJP leaders, Shyamaprasad Mukherjees state was a lost horizon once it went the way of the communists. Even for Bengalis who did not like the communists, the saffron parivar was a distant, alien idea that belonged to the cowbelt. All that seems to be changing  the BJP is becoming as acceptable in Bengal as in any other state. 																														Most people would attribute that to Banerjee, and they would be right in doing so. Look at the BJPs own share of votes, as in the 2001 assembly elections when she broke away from the BJP and allied with the Congress, and you know how dependent the BJPs Bengal mission is on her. If the BJP has two Lok Sabha seats from Bengal today, it is due to its alliance with the Trinamool Congress. You dont need to be a political pundit to predict that the BJP still cannot win any Lok Sabha seat in Bengal on its own. 																														All that is pretty obvious. What is not so obvious is that the BJP is winning hearts and minds more than it is winning seats. Because of the political equations in Bengal, it may have no option but to play second fiddle to the Trinamool Congress, just as it is doing to the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh, the Biju Janata Dal in Orissa or to J. Jayalalithaas party in Tamil Nadu. 																														But I wonder if you have noticed a subtle change since 1998, when Banerjee first allied with the BJP for the Lok Sabha elections. The BJP is still the junior partner in the alliance, but its influence over the anti-left voters is rapidly outstripping its actual size and strength in Bengal. 																														Banerjee is still the leader of the alliance, but her moral authority is clearly on the decline. Her flip-flop politics has become a laughing matter. Most other Trinamool Congress leaders and workers are seen the way Congressmen have always been seen in Bengal  as a bunch of unprincipled politicians whose only claim to popular support is their opposition to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). You dont love them, but if you want to get rid of the Marxists, you cannot do without them. 																														The BJP, on the other hand, is increasingly seen and spoken of as a more serious, more acceptable party. In upper-class homes and cocktail circuits, where issues like the Ram temple or the ban on cow slaughter would draw the stiff upper lip until recently, there is suddenly a surge of cultural nationalism. 																														It is no longer a matter of shame to openly support Narendra Modi. The carnage in Gujarat is approvingly mentioned as a turning point in Indias political history. Any defence of minority rights or secular ideals is derisively dismissed. For the first time, the Bengali middle class is increasingly speaking in the political idiom popularized by the BJPs ideologues. 																														Banerjee may be giving the BJP some numbers in Bengal, but it is the BJP which is now giving credibility and acceptability to her. 																														And if you thought this is a typical middle-class phenomenon, you would be very wrong. The BJP has changed in popular perception from the party of non-Bengali businessmen to one of the urban middle-class, it is now changing even further. 																														In fact, the BJP leaders are particularly happy about the latest changes in the partys support base in Bengal. They know that the new support from the middle classes can be unreliable; these classes will inevitably see new virtues in the Congress if it manages to come to power in New Delhi. 																														It is, therefore, the support in the suburbs or the villages that gives new hope to BJP leaders in Bengal. After all, it is the rough-and-tough village youth, and not the chatterbox in the club lounge, who will join the party or one of the sangh parivar outfits and fight it out against the Marxists. 																														One has to travel only short distances from Calcutta  to districts like North 24 Parganas and Nadia  to witness the surging support for the BJP. These are known as the refugee belt, where the leftists were traditionally seen as the natural party of the people whose families had to leave homes and property in East Pakistan and then Bangladesh. It would be unfair to deny that the communists alone had fought for  and with  these peoples fathers to get their squatters colonies legalized. It was the leftists who helped them settle in various occupations and secured their grateful votes in return. 																														It is no coincidence that the two BJP members of Parliament in the last Lok Sabha  Tapan Sikdar and Satyabrata Mukherjee  won from this refugee belt. But the BJPs rural spread in Bengal is happening farther afield  in most other districts bordering Bangladesh where the fear of the Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators and the anger over the oppression of the Hindus across the border are cynically exploited to swell the partys ranks. A different strategy is at work to win over tribals to the party in districts like Bankura and Purulia.																														It is not entirely true that the BJPs slow rise in Bengal has come only with Banerjees help. In a book published first in 1993, the leader of the Communist Party of India and minister in the Left Front government, Nandagopal Bhattacharyya, noted the growth of the sangh parivar in Bengal. The revised edition of the book estimates that the membership of various parivar outfits in the state, which was less than 3,000 in 1989, rose to 4,20,000 in 1997. 																														One can reasonably say that the number has risen considerably from that since 1998 when the BJP came to power at the Centre. That would make the BJP the second largest party in the state in terms of members  second only to the CPI(M), which has a membership of 750,000, not taking into account the membership of the partys student, peasant or labour organizations. It is also to be noted that, unlike the Congress or the Trinamool Congress, the BJP is a cadre-based party like the CPI(M).																														So what does the future hold for the BJP in Bengal? Clearly, the party will prosper even more if, as all indications suggest, Atal Bihari Vajpayee becomes prime minister once again. It is also possible that Banerjees stature will diminish even further, while the BJPs grows. 																														The partys one big problem remains the absence of a mass leader. But till the party finds one, Banerjee is out there compensating for that lacuna. 																														I have only tried to capture a political trend new to Bengal. And I leave it to better analysts to judge what this says of a new generation of Bengalis. Some would see it as a new dawn of hope in Bengal politics, which would at last transform the proud and parochial Bengali into the cultural nationalist. But others might find in it yet another proof of Bengals cultural decline.

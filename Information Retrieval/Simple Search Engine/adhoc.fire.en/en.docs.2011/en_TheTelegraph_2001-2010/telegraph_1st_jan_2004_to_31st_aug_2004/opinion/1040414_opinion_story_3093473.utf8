		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 							 																						IN THE FITNESS OF THINGS Unfit or injured cricketers faking fitness should not be allowed to play and make the national team pay for their dishonesty, writes Raju Mukherji Retired hurtThe Age of Deception is on us. The chastening experience of carrying injured and out-of-form players to Pakistan for the one-day series did not rectify the short-sightedness of our selectors. For the tests, our selectors decided to rely on Anil Kumble and Ajit Agarkar (thankfully, excluded from the last), who had been out of action for months. The decision seemed to be based on the fitness certificates issued. But what about the match- fitness of the players? What about their current form? Kumble and Agarkar had not played any cricket for quite a few months. What made our selectors feel that they would strike top form the moment they arrived in Pakistan? 																														Today, the trend among some Indian international cricketers is to hide their injuries and make themselves available for selection to the national team. However, there have been instances earlier when brave men like Kapil Dev and Dilip Doshi have ignored their serious injuries sustained during the course of a test match at Melbourne in 1981 and bowled India to victory. But then they were special people who took pride in their performance, not the kind of mercenaries who hang around these days.																														What happens nowadays is that the injured player announces that he is fit and the authorities, without verifying facts, select him for the tour. While on tour, the player starts complaining about his injuries, gets treated abroad, moves around with the team as a passenger and gets all the perquisites and monetary benefits due to an active player. In this way, these players not only harm the cause of the team but their own careers as well. In recent months, we have had too many cases in which players have carried injuries without telling the truth to the Board of Control for Cricket in India  a clear case of putting self-interest above that of the national team.																														Here it may be pointed out that not too long ago, there was a cricketer who had done the opposite by sacrificing his own position in the XI for the greater cause of the national team. That man was Subroto Guha.																														In 1969, Guha had forsaken his own position in the test XI for the country. Never before or since has a player sacrificed himself as Guha had done on November 4, 1969, when he stepped down in favour of another player. 																														In the Sixties, Guha was undoubtedly the foremost pace-bowler in India. Among the high points of his career was his sending away Gary Sobers magnificent West Indies team to an innings defeat against the East and Central Zone combined team in 1967. Guha claimed 11 wickets in the match. His first class tally of 299 wickets was achieved mainly on spinning wickets which afforded little help to pace-bowlers.																														Guha went to England in 1967 under Tiger Pataudis leadership. In the first test at Headingly, Leeds, he made his debut. The Indian bowling attack was torn to shreds, with Geoffrey Boycott scoring 246 not-out. Apart from the magnificent Chandrasekhar, it was only Guha who emerged with some credit for being economical. But as the tour progressed, his knee caved in and he had to be treated for fluid in the knee. He missed the following tests as well as the subsequent tour to Australia.																														In 1969, with Bill Lawrys Australians in India, Guha was an automatic choice for the first test at Bombay. His name was in the playing XI. But on the morning of the match, a strange sight came into focus. The new chairman of the selection committee, former cricketer Vijay Merchant, walked out to the middle with his arm around Guhas shoulders. They conferred for a while on the pitch. On returning to the pavilion, Merchant announced that Guha had relinquished his place to Venkataraghavan!																														On Merchants request, Subroto Guha agreed to step down for the cause of the country. It transpired that Merchant was convinced that the pitch was more conducive to spin than pace. The fact that subsequently the Aussie pacers took the majority of the wickets to thrash India is another story.																														Subroto Guha played just three more tests on wickets that were tailor-made for spinners. Those days the selectors had little faith in Indian medium-pacers. It was indeed a sad end for a genuine swing-bowler, who had placed national interest way ahead of his own.																														The BCCI has to be very strict about a players fitness. Physiotherapists, doctors, coaches and selectors must all be made accountable. No injured player should be allowed back into the team until and unless he is able to prove his match-fitness by actually playing and performing in practice-matches. In Australia, even a player of Glen McGraths stature had prove his ability and match-fitness after a prolonged treatment before being considered for the national team. In the early Seventies, the great Dennis Lillee was out of cricket for more than two tears and had to prove his fitness and form before being brought back into the Australia XI.																														This time Zaheer Khan came into the team after his treatment without any evidence of fitness and form in actual match situations. His dreadful display in Pakistan should have been a pointer to the BCCI that such amateurish handling of injured players should not be repeated in the future. But that was not to be. Kumble and Agarkar walked into the team without proving their match-fitness. Under the circumstances, Kumbles performance should be considered a boon. As for Agarkar, after his non-performance in the two tests, he has been dropped in the third. 																														What is the point in using terms like bio-mechanics, video analyses, physiology, psychology and so on if we do not have the knowledge or the ability or the willingness to take advantage of these? Why cannot we enforce discipline among the Indian players? Cricketers who hide and carry injuries on tours should be heavily fined. Officials, doctors, coaches, trainers and selectors, who connive with them to issue fitness certificates, should be held responsible if unfit and out-of-form players are chosen and the team has to pay for the choice.

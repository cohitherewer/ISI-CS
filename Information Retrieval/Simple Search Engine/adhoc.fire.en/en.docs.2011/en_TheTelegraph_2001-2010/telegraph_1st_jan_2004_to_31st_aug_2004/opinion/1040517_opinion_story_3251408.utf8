The new governments policy statements will be scrutinized in foreign capitals for changes in nuance and emphasis, writes Chandrashekhar Dasgupta The views expressed in the article are those of the writer and not those of the Observer Research Foundation, where he is a Distinguished Fellow Change and continuity Indias foreign policy has maintained a basic continuity despite the periodic changes in government resulting from the workings of parliamentary democracy. Broadly speaking, our foreign policy rests upon a national consensus. Thus foreign policy issues hardly figured in the recent election campaign. This does not, of course, rule out fine-tuning of established policy or evolution of policy in response to new situations and challenges. Continuity does not mean immobility. For this reason, policy statements of the new government will be scrutinized in foreign capitals for signs of change in nuance and emphasis.The first and most urgent challenge facing the new government is to reassure the international community that there will be no slowing down of the pace of economic reforms. The world is well aware that the reform process was inaugurated by a Congress government and nobody expects the process to be reversed. Nevertheless, there are concerns that some of the allies and partners of the Congress party may oppose new reform measures that are necessary to speed up economic growth and expand employment. There are, indeed, important differences on certain reform proposals and decisions on these difficult questions cannot be taken overnight. Nevertheless, it is essential that the new government should send out positive general signals about its commitment to maintain and step up the pace of reforms. Policy statements should showcase the areas where the government aims to accelerate change. For instance, the chief minister of West Bengal sent out a very positive message when, in the course of a post-election television interview, he drew attention to his position on foreign investments. Repeated signals of this type are required to reassure international investors, pending hard but essential decisions on complex questions such as amending labour laws or lowering subsidies. International confidence in the Indian economy must be maintained. This should be seen as a top foreign policy objective, not merely a matter for the economic ministries.The United States of America is today the sole super-power and every country takes this fact into account in shaping its foreign policy. The Vajpayee government had a rather mixed record in its conduct of relations with Washington. On the one hand, it displayed a measure of skill in handling relations in the aftermath of the 1998 nuclear weapons tests and in cultivating a friendly lobby in Congress. On the other hand, pursuing a party rather than a national agenda and in contravention of international practice, it decided to appoint a second ambassador to the US, supposedly to build up ties with the Indian community. The exertions of this ambassador, with his close links to the sangh parivar, served only to deepen differences within the community.The new government should lose no time to correct this aberration and restore to our Washington embassy its full and proper mandate. It should also take an early decision on a major issue that is likely to resurface in Indo-US relations. The previous government came close to taking a disastrous decision to send troops to Iraq in response to an American request. The request is likely to be repeated quite soon, if the US succeeds in pushing through a Security Council resolution authorizing induction of an international force to protect UN offices and personnel in Iraq. The Congress party took the right stand on the earlier occasion but on grounds that may require elaboration. The stand that we contribute troops only when this is covered by a specific UN resolution will no longer suffice if the Security Council does adopt such a resolution. The real objection to sending Indian soldiers to Iraq is that it is not required by any vital Indian security interest  the only valid reason for sending the flower of our youth into situations where they may be called upon to make the supreme sacrifice. The legal argument is important but secondary. If the Security Council does pass a new resolution on the lines sought by the US and the United Kingdom, we would have to point out that the new force envisaged for Iraq is merely an international force, not a UN peace-keeping force under exclusive UN command. We have traditionally contributed contingents only for the latter type of operations and no other.Our relations with Pakistan followed a zigzag course during the Vajpayee years mainly  but not exclusively  because of sharp twists and turns in Islamabads policies. The latest phase, however, has witnessed some promising developments, justifying guarded hopes of some sort of a breakthrough. Immediately after our election results were announced, Islamabad issued a sensible statement to the effect that it expected the Indo-Pakistan peace process to continue. Congress spokesmen have rightly voiced similar sentiments. Past Congress policy statements have dwelt on the need to explicitly recognize the Simla Agreement as the basis of an Indo-Pakistan initiative. The ongoing peace process involves bilateral talks and is, therefore, in obvious conformity with the Simla Agreement. It may be appropriate to mention this for the record in a suitably non-controversial manner but it would serve no useful purpose to harp on this theme repeatedly or to require an open endorsement from Islamabad. The real challenge is to build up cooperation and mutual understanding; semantics are a secondary matter.After a temporary setback in 1998, our relations with China have shown continued improvement. Trade exchanges have registered rapid growth in percentage terms and there is reason to expect that bilateral trade will touch the $10 billion mark by next year. The adjustment of the Chinese position on Sikkim, as reflected in the new atlas depicting Sikkim as a part of India, is a significant step in strengthening India-China ties. A development of the highest importance was the initiation, last year, of confidential talks between special emissaries to seek a political resolution of the border issue. While carrying on this process, the new government would be well advised to consult closely with the outgoing prime minister and his national security adviser. Progress on the border issue requires a national consensus.Finally, since the end of the Cold War, Indias diplomatic style has undergone a significant evolution in response to the changed power realities. As a rule, we now take a high-profile role in international issues only when our national interests are directly affected. We have curbed the tendency to take up cudgels on other peoples behalf. Our current stance on Iraq is an excellent example. We have declined to get drawn into the Iraqi morass but have wisely refrained from airing reservations concerning US policy. No purpose is served by causing needless offence to the sole superpower. We should react forcefully whenever our own interests are challenged  as we did in 1998  but, in other cases, we should either side with the US or minimize our involvement, depending on the balance of advantage in each specific instance. The incoming government must maintain the new diplomatic style  a style that Congress leaders themselves helped to fashion in the Nineties. A statesman, unlike a columnist, is not required to pronounce on the rights and wrongs of every international issue.

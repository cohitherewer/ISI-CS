		 Friday, June 11, 2004 							 																						BIHAR ON WHEELS																														The indomitable spirit of Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav has found another way of expressing itself. And this time, on a national scale. There is no better way, perhaps, of propagating the essence of Bihar throughout India than making its most celebrated icon the Union railways minister. Bihar has always had its unique brand of topsy-turvydom. It is therefore most natural that its de facto ruler would turn lawlessness into a form of robust entertainment. Bihars idea of fun is now set to become an integral part of the experience of travelling by train. It is Mr Yadavs achievement that the novelty of such trivialities as earthen teacups and vegetable bogeys has managed to deflect attention away from the sharp increase of crime on trains passing through Bihar. The nature of these crimes is brutal. Within a fortnight, robbers have killed an inspector from the Border Security Force, a dacoit has been lynched on an express train, a passenger has been shot dead on another, and, most recently, two passengers have been killed in their sleep on the Danapur Express. Train robberies, with a few people being killed in the process, have been a staple in the Bihar-Jharkhand area. But the latest incident shows that armed conflict between rival gangs may now be played out with impunity in train compartments.																														There seems to be a complicated network of crime and politics around the latest killings on the Danapur Express. The suspected killer and his two victims have all been equally involved in an impressive range of criminal-political activities. That hyphen is indispensable in Bihar. It plays a significant role in the political careers of Mr Yadav and his kin. It joins caste warfare, extortion, abduction and murder to every level of political involvement, from the state assembly to the panchayati system. Legislators, mukhias and ward-council supervisors are the chief players in this murky game, rubbing shoulders with teachers, NGO workers and policemen. Brutal feuds over railway contracts and tenders keep railway security staff in a constant state of paralysing terror. And this is the empire that Mr Yadav  flush with his regional triumphs and national importance  has put on the tracks. It does not take very much in India for comedy to triumph over criminality. The evident wretchedness and brutalities of rural Bihar somehow pale into the background when Mr Yadav stages his mass-entertainment campaigns. Caricature invariably wins over corruption. If this is the show that the railways minister has decided to put on wheels for the benefit of the entire nation now, then travelling by train through his very own lantern-lit darkness could well turn out to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for some.

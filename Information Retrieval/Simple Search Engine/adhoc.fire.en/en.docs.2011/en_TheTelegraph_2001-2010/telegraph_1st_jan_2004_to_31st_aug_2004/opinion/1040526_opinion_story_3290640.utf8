The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 							 																						FOREIGN FIELDS																														The statement of the Union minister for external affairs, Mr Natwar Singh, that there will be no major shift in Indias foreign policy will be widely welcomed. It can only be hoped that the Congress-led coalition government will be able to give a fresh thrust to Indias engagement with the outside world and not get caught up in a web of ideological obfuscation. While there may have been much to disagree with in the Bharatiya Janata Partys worldview, even critics will concede that Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayees government followed a pragmatic policy on many fronts. Fortunately, there has been a national consensus on several issues, including the policy to normalize relations with Pakistan and settle all outstanding disputes with China. The new government will be expected to continue the existing policy with regard to both Islamabad and Beijing. There may be a temptation, however, for the Congress-led coalition to shift gear and direction on a couple of fronts. 																														Clearly, the issue of New Delhis relationship with Washington will be in focus, as there has been a growing perception, especially within the left, that the previous government was too close to the United States of America. There will now be pressure from the communist parties, in particular, to review this relationship. But it would be most unfortunate if India-US ties were derailed because of ideological reasons. The fact remains that the US is Indias largest trading partner and the worlds only superpower. It continues to be the most preferred destination for Indian students and professionals, and the Indian expatriate community is easily one of the most influential in the US. A sustained engagement with the US, under these circumstances, is not just desirable but essential. It is necessary, therefore, to not view the world through the coloured spectacles of the Cold War. 																														Similarly, there is a view that Indias close relations with Israel, during the previous governments tenure, have led to a change in Indias traditional west Asia policy. The left parties, particularly, have even called for abandoning New Delhis strategic relationship with Israel. Again, it would be short-sighted if the new government were to take this view. Most countries, including those in the Arab world, recognize that it is possible to simultaneously cooperate with Israel while stridently advocating the Palestinian cause. India needs to continue striking this balance. Indeed, Indias relationship with Israel has led to major benefits for the country, not only in the strategic and defence areas, but also particularly in agriculture and education. There are, of course, a host of other issues on which the new government will be tempted to take an ideological position. But the real challenge is to advance the countrys national interest through pragmatic policies, implemented with surgical precision, even while it may be easier to shout slogans or take the moral high ground.

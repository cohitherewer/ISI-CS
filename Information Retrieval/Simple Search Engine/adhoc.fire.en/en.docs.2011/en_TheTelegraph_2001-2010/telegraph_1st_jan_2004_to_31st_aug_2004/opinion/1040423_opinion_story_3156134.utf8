Who would have imagined that Kautilyas Arthasastra could galvanize an international racket into action? Who could have figured out the link between its 1,200 shlokas and a grisly chain of murders and attempted murders in a modern Indian city? Very few, until Daniel Raikar, assistant commissioner of police, crime branch, stepped in to help us.In The Circle for Vice, it all starts in Pune, not so much a happening place as a hub of academic activities. In the Gokhale Institute of Economics and Politics, R.Padmanabhan (Paddy) and Stanley Murthy (Stan) team up as registered scholars to pursue their doctoral thesis on Theoretical similarities between Western Economics and Kautilyas Arthasastra. They choose Laxman Mashelkar, an accomplished economist as their mentor.																														While they are making headway in the project, all hell break loose. Paddy is hideously murdered in his research cabin, which is vandalized. A few days later, Mashelkar lands in the hospital, severely injured in a car accident. Soon after this Stan finds himself engulfed in fire within his bathroom which is locked from outside. Though he has a close shave, he is convinced that his life, like his professors, is in danger and that their research project has something to do with it.																														Meanwhile, Raikar, and his aide Gaurangi Pande, were not sitting idle. Raikar pitches himself into dangerous encounters, until some fortuitous pieces of information put the investigation on the right track. Slowly but surely, a monstrous deceit comes to light.																														If Raikar dominates the first half of the novel, Justin Holden, a Carribean-fast bowler-turned-Interpol officer, plays hero in the second. The calm, bold and unflinchingly loyal and dutiful Gaurangi Pande, who takes a fancy to Stan, is charming throughout the novel. Rajadhyaksha looks admirably in control of his medium as the whodunit takes its suspenseful turns.																														Rajadhyaksha should also be thanked for the painstaking research that has gone into this fiction, though the long confessions from convicts occasionally bores the reader. 																														The novel takes a dig at the false vanity that sometimes informs Western scholarship and the outrageous deductions of the Western knowledge-system. In his preface, Rajadhyaksha pleads the readers to take the inherent mischief of the novel sportingly. But, never, for once, does he want them to overlook or ignore it. That is an important point to be noted.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

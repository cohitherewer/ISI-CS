		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 							 																						GOD MUST HAVE A FACEThis Above All / Khushwant Singh Object of worshipPritam Giani is an iconoclast (an idol-breaker) in more senses than one. He was born of Pakistani Muslim parents, given a Muslim name and brought up as one. He changed it to a recognizable Hindu-Sikh name, Pritam Giani. While a student of English literature in Cambridge University, he openly proclaimed himself to be gay. He continues to champion the rights of homosexuals. He has been in trouble with the police. He is looked upon by the orthodox as a renegade since he also declares he is an idolater: he worships Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. However, Lakshmi has not been very kind to him as he is always hard up for money.																					Pritam Giani lives in Abbotabad (Pakistan) and often writes to me. Some years ago he came to Delhi with his Pakistani friend. I took an afternoon off to drive them round the city. He was not interested in seeing monuments but agreed to visit Ghalibs grave in Nizamuddin. While his friend recited the fateha beside the tomb of the poet, he stood at a distance taking photographs. He showed no desire to go into the dargah to pay homage to Amir Khusrau or Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Instead, he went next door to the Ghalib Institute and handed over a set of his translations of Ghalibs Diwan. His letters often contain a few translations of Ghalibs couplets.																					In his last letter to me Preetam wrote; Anyone who has ever kissed the photo of a loved one should be able to understand the reason for idolatory. That, I think, is going too far. Most of us have photographs of people we love or admire on our walls or in silver frames on our tables but we do not worship them.																					However, one has to concede that the dividing line between respect, admiration and worship is often blurred. However much some religions decry the worship of idols, it manifests itself in different forms in all of them. Jainism and Buddhism question the existence of an almighty god and decry the worship of idols as symbolic representations of the divine. Nevertheless idols of Mahavira and other Tirthankars, and those of Gautama Buddha are the centre pieces of all Jain and Buddhist temples. Hinduism, which often maintains that god is nirankar (without form), makes no apology for representing the formless god in human or symbolic forms in practice. The only Hindu temples without idols I came across were in Bali. Reformist sects like the Brahmo and Arya Samaj, which tried to discard idol worship, failed in their quest.																					Sikhs, who also profess to be against idol worship, treat the Granth Sahib much the same way as Hindus treat their idols. The Granth Sahib is woken up in the morning (prakash) and put to sleep (santokhna) at night. It is draped in rich embroidered silks and taken out in processions. In homes of the rich, a room is set apart for the holy book (Baba ji da kamra), and fans or ACs kept going round the clock in the summer months.																					Christians deny that they are idol worshippers. However, the reverence they show towards the statues of Jesus Christ and Virgin Mary is no different from the reverence shown by idol worshippers to their deities carved in stone or wood.																					Muslims claim with pride that they abominate idol worship and regard idol-breakers (but-shikans) as their heroes. It is true that they do not allow pictures or idols of their prophet to be made, but Shias in Iran have pictures of Hazrat Alim Hasan and Hussain on the streets and on the walls in their homes. More Muslims visit dargahs where their holy men are buried to ask for favours than mosques to offer namaaz. Instead of worshipping idols they worship the graves of their peers, rightly described as Kabar-prasti. 																					Idol worship is inherent in human nature.																					Forgotten voice																					The name rang a bell; a somewhat faint and distant echo from the past. Who was he? Evidently an Indian or Pakistani Muslim, probably a Shia. Also, a man of letters, perhaps a poet. He had not been heard of for quite some time. Then it came back with a bang. Over 12 years ago when the Babri Masjid was pulled down, there was a protest meeting organized by students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Tabish Khair, who was on the editorial staff of The Times of India and made a name as a poet, was invited to speak or recite a poem. Before he could utter a word, he broke down and wept like a child who had lost its mother. So did many in the audience. It was the most eloquent protest made at the meeting. The India that Khair had dreamt of had been shattered like the three domes of the ancient mosque. He was not heard of any more. He migrated to Denmark and married a Danish girl. He is now an associate professor of English literature at the Aarhus University in Copenhagen and writes for English, American, Danish and South African journals. Indias loss became Denmarks gain.																					Khair was born in 1966, probably in Gaya (Bihar). I had not read anything by him until I received The Bus that Stopped. It makes for very pleasant and easy reading: short sentences, short paragraphs, short chapters  some not more than one line. It has the power of simplicity. Vivid descriptions of Bihars nondescript towns and villages, of common people ranging from bus drivers; cleaners; a thief and a bawarchi (cook); small town people of whom the richest is a migrant Sindhi family which owns a cloth shop; hijras; prostitutes and a sprinkling of foreign tourists visiting Bodh Gaya. Thrown in for good measure is a half-Indian-half-Danish with a suitcase full of currency notes to bribe a minister in Patna in order to secure a lucrative deal. Most of the tale is told during a bus journey between Phansa and Gaya with flashbacks to the passengers past lives to their finding themselves on the same bus. Reminded me of Thornton Wilders The Bridge of San Louis Ray in an Indian setting. I enjoyed reading it as much as I had the American modern classic.																					Meet expenses half way																					A senior-level marketing executive was lamenting the effect of inflation and the rising prices of consumer products. He said, My wife finds it difficult to balance the budget and meet all the household expenses.																					His colleague, who was known as a happy-go-lucky fellow, replied, My dear friend it is not at all hard to meet expenses. They are everywhere!																					(Contributed by R. N.

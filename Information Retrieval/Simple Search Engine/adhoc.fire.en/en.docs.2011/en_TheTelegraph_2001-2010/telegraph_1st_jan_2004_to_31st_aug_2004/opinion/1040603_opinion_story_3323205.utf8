The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 							 																						CHARITY STATE																														The way to bankruptcy is often paved with good intentions. Nobody will doubt the good intentions behind the National Employment Guarantee Act declared by the United Progressive Alliance. The act aims to provide for a minimum of 100 days of employment to at least one able-bodied member of every poor and lower middle-class household. The new government aims to provide minimum wages for these jobs and they will be used to create assets under public work projects. The proposal cannot be faulted on its timing since unemployment was one of the principal thorny issues that affected the largest number of people. It is understandable that the new dispensation has directed its attention to the problem: its critics and its supporters will watch, hawk-like, every move the government makes to tackle the hydra-headed monster of unemployment. The UPA government, even though it is led by Indias pioneer economic reformer, has chosen the easier and the populist option for the creation of jobs. It has decided to use the idea of state subsidies. Its decision is reminiscent of the one taken by Nawab Asafuddaulah of Awadh who in the late 18th century, during a period of famine, provided food for his subjects, who in return were made to build a palace for the nawab.																														There are other ways of creating jobs than through state largesse. The logic of the free market would suggest the enabling of competitive labour-intensive activities through private initiatives. The government in this context would only be required to spend a small quantum of money to facilitate the process which would add value and create profits. The process, however, is long and, like anything to do with the market, somewhat unpredictable. For these reasons, politicians with eyes on quick popularity and electoral dividends do not approve of this route. It is considered safer to have the government spend more money. There are a number of arguments against this kind of spending. For one thing, it might be unproductive, and for another, the number of people laying claims to such a scheme would be huge and impossible to regulate. The other problem with this kind of government project is that the money seldom reaches those for whom it is intended. Between the good intentions and the benefits falls the shadow of local level corruption. Above everything else, the scheme is not fiscally viable. At the end of this road lies the monster of fiscal deficit. In trying to find an immediate and popular way of handling unemployment, the UPA may have exchanged one monster for another.

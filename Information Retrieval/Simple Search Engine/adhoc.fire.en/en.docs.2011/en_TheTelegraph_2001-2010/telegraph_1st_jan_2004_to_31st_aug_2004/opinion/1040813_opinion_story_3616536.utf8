The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 13, 2004 							 																						OLD MAN RIVER																														Hope in West Bengal still sails on the river Hooghly. In the past, foreign trade, prosperity and the growth of the city of Calcutta were all dependent on the ships that came upriver to dock in Calcutta. History turned full circle on Wednesday when an agreement was signed between the West Bengal government, P amp;O Ports Australia and two private investors to develop a port in Kulpi in South 24 Parganas. The project will cost $235 million and can be registered as a personal triumph for the chief minister of the state, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. There are very good reasons for saying this as Mr Bhattacharjee is singularly responsible for beginning a process of perception-change about West Bengal. Long confined to the margins of investment, communist-dominated West Bengal has suffered from irresponsible trade unionism, non-existent work culture and above all from a hostility towards capital and business. Mr Bhattacharjee, as soon as he became the helmsman, began valiantly to change these circumstances and to revive business and industry in West Bengal. It was by no means an easy task as he had to overcome years of accumulated suspicion. But Mr Bhattacharjee has perhaps made the turnaround: suspicion is yielding place to faith, the bedrock of all investment decisions. Kulpi is the first sign that the ship of state in West Bengal has begun a long-awaited and elaborate manoeuvre.																														If the river brings hope, it also breeds despair. The rate of silting in the Hooghly suggests that no port on it can be viable for very long. Calcutta has long ceased to be a port of any consequence. Its survival, and to some extent even that of Haldia, is dependent on a massive dredging operation. It is a matter of time, maybe a decade or a little more, before the silt chokes the new port of Kulpi. The enormous cost of dredging is borne by the state and this makes the ports on the Hooghly a subsidized operation. As the Indian economy advances on the lines of liberalization, the subsidy will disappear and this will make the ports highly cost-intensive enterprises. The ports thus run the risk of losing their competitive edge. But fortunately, all this lies in the future. In the short to middle term, Kulpi can contribute to West Bengals industrial rejuvenation.																														Kulpi is also a strategic staging post to a new port to be located on Sagar Island. The long-term future of Calcutta  its trade, and the trade of its huge and rich hinterland lies in Sagar Island. In fact, that port, now only an item on the Centres road map, when it comes up will link the sea and the river and will also serve to complement the Calcutta-Haldia-Kulpi triangle. Mr Bhattacharjee, as captain, has set sail. It is a long time yet when he can say, tired but victorious, the fearful trip is done.

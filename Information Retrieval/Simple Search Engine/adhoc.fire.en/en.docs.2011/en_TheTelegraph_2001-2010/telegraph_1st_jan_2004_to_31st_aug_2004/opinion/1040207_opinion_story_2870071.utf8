		 Saturday, February 07, 2004  TILL THE COWS COME HOME 
 She came to power riding a development wave, but all Uma Bharati ever wanted was Hindutva, and more Hindutva. Now there is no stopping the Madhya Pradesh chief minister																														Saffron is as saffron does. There are some who believe the best way to lighten Hindutvas blazing saffron is by letting its advocates scale the rungs of power. Once in harness, the argument goes, the colour tends to fade. After all, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  an outfit that owes its sudden expansion to its strident campaign on Ayodhya  doesnt talk about temples anymore, at least not in public. And its leaders, especially when in power, tend to speak of rainbow hues.																														Not so, Uma Bharati. All around her chief ministers are playing it safe. Election fatigue, combined with the fact that the battle fatigues have to be donned once again for the general elections, has caused a lull in administration. But Uma Bharati has been, like the boy who stood on the burning deck, valiantly unfurling a seemingly enormous saffron flag from the word gau.																														Bharati rode to power in Madhya Pradesh riding a development wave. But her direction in power has taken a drastic turn. It now transpires that Bharati wants Hindutva, Hindutva and more Hindutva. Vasundhara Raje may be talking about tourism in Rajasthan, Raman Singh on tribal uplift in Chhattisgarh and Sheila Dikshit on rehabilitating people ousted from a resettlement bustee. Bharati will have none of those  she wants to start with the cow.																														Like Martin Luther King, she has a dream  that of setting up hundreds of cowsheds on riverbanks. The cowsheds would be initially funded by the government and, somewhat like institutions of higher education, later support themselves. And this, the 44-year-old chief minister points out, will be done with funds accrued from cow dung, which will be used to generate power and make fertilisers and joss sticks, and cow urine, which will be used to manufacture pesticides and medicine.																														Bharati has been busy. She has promised to rename Bhopal, possibly as Bhojpal. The name is derived from king Bhoj, who ruled over central India in the 11th century. But the city was actually founded by Dost Mohammad Khan in the 18th century. She has also turned two temple towns into holy cities, declaring them dry and vegetarian. Its quite another matter that Maheshwar  where her Cabinet held a meeting recently  makes the famed Maheshwari sarees, and its weavers are Muslims and mostly meat-eaters. 																														The chief minister couldnt care less, for she is on a Hindutva rampage. But her policies, while gladdening the hearts of all shakhawallahs, have begun to cause some merriment around her. The moo the merrier, says a wit about the policies she has put in place. Mera gau mera desh, says another.																														Uma Bharati was always something of a maverick. She was the one who kept Barbie dolls at home, fed journalists delicious home-made parathas, spoke frankly about her close association with party rebel K.. Govindacharya and occasionally welcomed old friends in an orange Benetton T-shirt and shorts.																														But the traits that made Uma Bharati what she was  the ability, for instance, to take the untrodden path  are characteristics that have turned her into an eccentric ruler. As long as she was out of power  and it is said that even when in power at the Centre she kept out of office, preferring to play with her dogs at home  Bharati was individualistic. In power, however, she is like an unguided missile. 																														Take, for instance, her decision to drive down to Hoshangabad on the banks of the Narmada for a holy dip every Tuesday. Her security guards  mostly men  stand around her, modestly averting their eyes, while quaking at the thought of a security lapse. Among the dozen-odd security guards who form the inner ring around her, only three are women  and none of the trio knows how to swim. So the men try and keep vigil without looking at the chief minister.																														But, clearly, the chief minister is doing what she wants to do. Always focused about her goals  her house in Delhi used to be lined with thick dictionaries and a thesaurus to help her learn English, a language that she mastered by diligently looking up every word she did not know  Bharati has rehabilitated two of her staunch supporters. She has asked Govindacharya and S. Gurumurthy, a swadeshi proponent not surprisingly unpopular among BJPs ruling reformwallahs, to chalk out a swadeshi economic plan for the state  a move that would not have had the blessings of the Prime Minister and his men.																														But then Bharati has never been particularly enamoured of the PMO. She has been in the camp of hardliners that has the powerful support of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Even in Bhopal, it is said that she is in the hands of the RSS. But the reference this time is not to the political outfit that calls itself a social body, but to three men running the Bharati show  nephews Rahul, Sidharth and Swamy, her brother. Swamy Prasad Lodhi, sources point out, is always around the chief minister, and when not performing pujas on behalf of her, is ordering transfers and postings to bureaucrats on the phone.																														Brother Swamy does the pujas while sister Uma pushes files. But nobody really knows for how long. Bharati has always been something of a free spirit. At the age of eight, she said she used to head for the forests, with cows and goats for company, reading philosophical works. Later, she was picked up by her mentor Vijaya Raje Scindia for her oratorial skills, and she went around the country delivering religious addresses. 																														The spirit, those who know her warn, may start to wander any day. Earlier this week, she started to weep at a public gathering, saying that she couldnt cope with the pressures of thousands of people who had so many expectations of her. I want a 10-5 job, she sobbed. The officials informally called off her public darshans with the people. 																														Somebody should have told her that a gaddi is not all cotton and foam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 12, 2004 							 																						BIRTH OF A SALESMAN				 	 Playing new roles																														When you look at the author at book launches these days, the conclusion is obvious: the marketing of books demands more than ever before the marketing of personalities. This means not merely the presence of authors at launches but also in book signing ceremonies in leading bookshops, talk shows on television and radio, even video clips in the ever-growing leisure and entertainment centres. Another trend  theatricalization  could be added to the list: the author is increasingly expected to be a performer as a panelist or interviewee on radio, TV and the print media.																														Why? Clearly, there are three reasons. First, the celebrity status of the author matters in an increasingly competitive market: the author has a circle of friends and area of influence which need to be exploited. Second, increasing specialization and the sheer volume of new books published every year have cramped shelf space in bookshops. Every marketing ploy to fill the gaps in the market has to be used to move out stocks. Third, the marketing apparatus of most Indian publishers is insufficient to cope with the vagaries of the market and the lack of retail outlets.																														To begin with the last factor, authors believe that because the publisher has been in the business for some time and has branches or sales depots all over the country, the book will take off on its own. What he does not know is that his is not the only book the publisher has to handle. Therefore no personalized attention is available. Because of these limitations, the publisher treats the book as just another product that needs to be sold off as quickly as possible. So he just concentrates on selling the stock on hand rather than promote and market it. Without proper promotion, which means cataloguing and mailing of publicity materials, the book sells a few copies before fading away.																														But what is much more disturbing is the fact that the sales representatives of many publishers simply do not know where to promote the book. Authors have to chip in and provide the contacts which could lead to multiple copy orders. Without the authors presence, his books would flounder because the publisher neither has the knowhow nor the time to promote the books.																														It is the numbers game that has gummed up the marketing of books. On the one hand, bookshops have little shelf space; they have to keep rotating the stock to accommodate new arrivals. Second, they have been pressing for better trade terms  higher discounts and credits, and the option to return unsold stocks after an agreed period  that publishers cannot really afford. The only way out for publishers, if they are to retain a reasonable margin for themselves, is to bypass the trade to the extent possible and go directly to the buyer, who could be an individual or an institution. The author, who is expected to be in constant touch with his field, could be of help here too. 																														Whether we like it or not, the celebrity status of the author does matter when it comes to the marketing and sales of books. Celebrities have a charmed circle of friends who are quite prepared to buy if only to oblige, in anticipation of whatever favours might come later. And to the publisher, it does not matter whether the book gets read as long as it is off his shelves.						RAVI VYAS

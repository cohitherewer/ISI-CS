		 Monday, February 23, 2004 							 																						DECENT PROPOSAL																														To mean to do something and to actually do it are obviously not the same thing. The difference, which can be a shifting, grey area in the mind, becomes crucial in the sphere of crime, because justice, ideally, cannot afford to recognize grey areas. The equation between intention and act is viewed from different angles according to the crime. In murder, for example, even after the act has been committed, evidence of premeditation becomes particularly damning for the accused. In rape, though, the equation is assessed on other grounds. The actual commission of rape, the Supreme Court has ruled recently, demands a heavier penalty than a failed attempt to rape. Even if preparations had been made for an attempt to rape, the failure to carry the act through would be considered indecent assault and be penalized with less severity. The logic here is unimpeachable, deriving as it does from the basic principle of the system: everyone is innocent until proven guilty. Although certain changes are now being made in the laws against rape, and the onus of proof in some cases being shifted to the accused, the basic logic naturally remains undisturbed.																														There is, however, a special need to reflect on the problems raised by violence against women. Because of womens unenviable situation in Indian society, sexual crimes affect their lives in far broader and more damaging ways than can be contained within the duration of one passing incident. Any sexual crime directly involving the body can destroy a woman socially and psychologically. This less material, but nonetheless more acutely destructive aspect of rapes and attempts to rape must be considered when formulating the logic of assessing the crime. As long as the offender remains the focus of the justice system, his moral guilt the crux of judicial perception, the damage to the victim is to some extent obscured. There is no doubt that this is a peculiar dilemma as far as sentencing is concerned. A rape and an attempt to rape are certainly not the same. Yet it is vitally important that the penalty for an attempt to rape should be not so light as to fail as deterrent. Unfortunately, it is easier to manipulate words than the realities of violence. An attempt to rape is exactly that, the presence of the word rape in the phrase has a weight that indecent assault lacks. The latter seems a dilution: it could be many things besides an attempt to rape. In a rethinking, the effect on the victim could become a deciding factor in the sentencing. It might after all be easier to gauge that effect, with or without a ruptured hymen to hand, than the degree of moral guilt of the would-be rapist.

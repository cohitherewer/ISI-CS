The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 							 																						OF POTS AND PANS AND OTHER BEAUTIES Shobita PunjaThey say that the United States of America is a country of magazines, and there is one for every fetish and situation. There is a magazine for left-handed golf players and one for sailors of sailing boats, one on how to repair old furniture and one for fat people.																					In India, we also need a specialized museum to enshrine the originality and creativity found in every aspect of our cultural life. There are the railways and aircraft museums in Delhi, the famous Calico Textile Museum in Ahmedabad and there are also museums that showcase our kitchen pots and pans.																					The Utensil Museum in Ahmedabad began with the private collection of its founder, Surendra Patel. He began by collecting unique kinds of pots while he travelled around India. He realized that clay pots came in many forms and differed in each part of India, depending on the nature of the clay in that region. So there are pots for storing precious water in the desert region of Rajasthan, which are huge and are decorated and piled one above the other according to size in the kitchen or the coolest part of the house.																					There are metal pots and pans, like the uruli in Kerala which was cast in a mould in enormous sizes to cook food for hundreds of people during rituals and marriage ceremonies. Metallurgy was an ancient art in India and can be traced back 5,000 years, to the Indus Valley civilization, when bronze objects were first made.																					Art of the everyday																					The founder of the Sanskriti Museum who set up a Museum of Everyday Arts in Delhi, initiated a similar idea. Here you can see different types of metal pans for cooking, for making idlis, for frying padas. There are rolling pins, moulds to make samosas and pastries. There are huge ornate brass dowry boxes and chests for storing money, jewels and other valuables. In the average village home, where there was a minimum of furniture, the storage containers for clothes and heirlooms were treasured items.																					Elegant vegetable-cutters with blades shaped like the long neck of a peacock, and flower-shaped sieves and pots in different shapes, are some of the intriguing objects in the museum. There is one metal pot that has encased within its rim tiny bells. So that when a woman washed her metal pot, or walked with it on her head from the well to her home, it played a joyful tune as it swayed to the rhythm of her movements.																					The size of the pots also speaks volumes about its intended usage and value  tiny metal jars for perfume and specially designed metal boxes for kajal and kumkum in the shape of a bird or a fish. The decoration on pots are equally elaborate, from the bellmetal objects decorated with silver or gold inlay called bidri or Ganga-Jamuna lottas made of two metals, brass and copper, welded together to show off their different hues.																					And the tradition of pot-making continues. There are some foods that taste best if they are cooked in a clay pot, and no fancy modern stainless steel pot can make the food taste just right. The best way to cool drinking water so that it is not too cool or does not harm the throat is the clay waterpot with a long narrow spout. As the heat draws and evaporates the water, the pots surface stays cool and the temperature of the water is comfortable to drink. Tea drunk out of a kulhad or a kulfi from a clay container, all have their special flavour. Is this not an experience that we need to give our children?

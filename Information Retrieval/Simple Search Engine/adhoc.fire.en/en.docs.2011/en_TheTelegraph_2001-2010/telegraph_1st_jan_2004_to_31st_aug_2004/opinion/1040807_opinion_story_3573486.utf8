The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, August 07, 2004 							 																						REBEL																													WITHOUT A																													PAUSE A man behind bars is viewed as either a criminal or a victim. Fortunately for Shibu Soren, he is being seen as the latter CASE DIARYGiridih, 1974: Mediated in a clash. Two died. Murder charge 
	Chirudih, 1975: Charged with murder after a crowd he addressed went berserk
	Jamshedpur, 1999: Violated Section 144. Warrant in 2004 for not appearing in court.																														It is no revelation that Shibu Soren has spent the greater part of his life on the wrong side of the law. Authority and he have never been great friends  not unless he appropriates it for himself. And following his incarceration, he may once again use the crisis to magnify his clout. Because, by putting him behind bars in a 29-year-old case, the BJP appears to have gifted a fresh lease of life to the countrys most powerful tribal leader.																														For the state though, he has been a troublemonger, even before 1980 when he was first elected to the Lok Sabha. (One of his batchmates in school remembers him strutting around with bows and arrows, vowing that he would rid the land of outsiders, his imagination having been fired by Sidho and Kanhu who led the rebellion against the East India Company in 1855, which the British crushed, mowing down 20,000 Santhals. Archery remains a passion and is mentioned as his hobby in the Lok Sabha directory.) But most of the cases against him lodged before 1980 were instituted by a vengeful state. It was the Nineties that saw him accused of bribery  in the infamous JMM bribery case  of which he has been absolved  acquiring disproportionate assets and, worse, of involvement in the mysterious disappearance of his private secretary, Shashinath Jha.																														A quintessential rebel, he first revolted after his father was killed by mercenaries hired by mahajans. The killers were never brought to book and Soren vowed to wage a war on moneylenders. He did not trust the police or the judiciary because both were seen working together to break the back of rebels, often on cooked-up charges. The state had no problems in getting eyewitnesses to implicate the rebels. But while fighting the establishment may have struck him a bit like banging his head against a wall, that did not deter Soren. He told the Santhals that it was time to fight for their land and their women. They were being forced to borrow money at exorbitant rates of interest. 																														The time was the late Sixties and early Seventies when Naxalbari had fired the imagination of the youth. Armed revolution was not just a pipe dream then  it looked a distinct possibility. Soren, only 26 years old in 1970, apparently never had any overt links with the Naxalites, but like them, he led his people on hit-and-run missions, targetting government offices, retreating thereafter into the forests and the hills to evade the long arm of the law. 																														In fact he enjoys the status of a kind of demigod of the Santhals, once sincerely believing that wild beasts held no terror for him and arrows no effect. In his younger days a strikingly handsome man with a wide forehead, large eyes, a shock of unruly hair, a distinctive beard, full lips and weatherbeaten but sharp features, he could elude the police and disappear like the wind and was fearless. 																														Much was made of his saintliness, the absence of concern for himself or his creature comforts. He was a teetotaller, a vegetarian, a hero. An eyewitness emotionally recalls on one occasion seeing hundreds of tribals prostrating themselves before him as Soren stood with his back to a setting sun, his long hair fluttering in the breeze.																														By the Nineties, though, Soren had lost much of his sheen. His involvement in the bribery case, his increasing affluence and eventually the suspicion that he could have had a hand in the disappearance of his secretary, contributed to the growing disenchantment with him. He lost elections and his political flipflop was seen as opportunistic. 																														He flirted with Laloo Yadav and was rewarded with a Cabinet rank and the chairmanship of the Jharkhand Autonomous Area Council. He also flirted with the BJP but broke off when the latter refused to accept him as the Chief Minister of the newly created state. He led the combined opposition to a spectacular victory in the 2004 general election and became the Union coal and mines minister in May. Barely two months later, he was forced to resign and surrender before a court as the BJP accused him of being an absconder from the law. Fresh warrants of arrest were issued and he was jailed.																														But the BJPs move may yet rebound on itself. While it is true that Soren has invited warrants by not appearing before the court, both charges against him and the evidence appear suspect. In one of them he is accused of defying prohibitory orders under Section 144 in 1999. In another case, he is accused of leading a mob of 2,000 tribals to a clash which resulted in the death of two persons in Giridih. This case had been closed in 1986 and eight of the accused acquited because prosecution witnesses declared that they had not seen the killing as claimed by the police. In the third case, for which he is now in jail, Soren is accused of rabble-rousing and inciting tribals to attack village Chirudih. Ten people died in the clash. Media reports have, however, glossed over the fact that the tribals were attacked first, that they were fired upon and their huts torched before they retaliated. 																														Soren has used the crisis to perfection. Notwithstanding the dripping sarcasm in the national media, he has successfully built up the suspense, played the role of the responsible statesman and has emerged looking like the victim of a political witchhunt. Soren, in or out of the prison, is a nightmare that is likely to haunt the BJP for months to come.

		 Sunday, April 11, 2004  FIRST TIME, FIRST POLL 
 							 - One-sixth of the electorate to make voting debut They learn geography from Discovery channel, figure out life from MTVs Loveline and surf the Net for scholarships. GenNext is now poised to explore the power of the poll button  but only on its own terms. Avijit Ghosh reports				 	 RARING TO GO: Eager young voters weigh the options for the forthcoming polls Photo : jagdish yadav																														In a pair of jeans that must have been blue in its better days and a hair style that has Salman Khan desperately written all over it, Rajendra Singh looks the sort of guy who may be more comfortable discussing Shilpa Shetty than Sonia Gandhi, or, talking multiplex movie timings than maladies that ail the Indian polity.																														But appearances can often be red herrings. And Singh, 19, a commerce student in New Delhis Zakir Hussain College, is a case in point. Grill him on India Shining, quiz him on stars contesting elections or test him on the role of corruption in the elections  he will offer you an informed view on India going to the polls. Will he vote? You bet. Its his first time and he just cannot wait.																														Singh is not a solitary case. Contrary to popular perception, GenNext  those who learn geography from the Discovery channel, who figure out life from MTVs Loveline, who play games but only on personal computers, who surf the Internet for foreign scholarships, who write love letters in SMS and who romance and dream on the staircases of shopping malls  is ready to push the electronic voting button. The children of liberalisation are ready to vote.																														Statistics support the story. According to a recent poll survey, only two per cent of the fresh voters are not willing to vote. The survey commissioned in 10 cities all over India showed that 49 per cent felt that voting is very important and 38 per cent thought it was somewhat important. 																														Veejay Gaurav Kapoor who travelled in Indias top cities this month for Big Vote, a three-part programme on young voters on Channel V, is emphatic. They are certainly not indifferent to elections. They do want to vote. Allegations of electoral apathy and indifference to voting can take a walk.																														Size matters but the exact number of first-time voters is still a matter of debate. Psephologist Navin Surapaneni arrives at a figure based on the latest Population Committee projections. One-sixth of the total electorate is likely to vote for the first time, he says. 																														With the total number of voters being 675 million, the new voters, roughly aged between 18 and 24, could be as high as 100-115 million. However, Yashwant Deshmukh of C-Voter feels the figure could be on the higher side.																														To political parties the varying numbers do not matter. They believe the category is significant and sizeable enough to demand special attention. 																														In many districts, the BJP has organised nava matdata sammelan (new voters conference) targetting first-time voters. Varun Gandhi is the partys mascot in such meets. The Congress too is trying to woo the freshers with a bunch of new faces ranging from Rahul Gandhi to Sachin Pilot, from Jatin Prasada to Milind Deora. Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal agrees. Political parties are taking the first-time voter more seriously than ever before, he says.																														The first-time voters were first targetted by the BJP during the 2002 Gujarat state elections. By all accounts, it worked. Now, the modus operandi  sending SMS notes and taped messages on mobile phones  is being replicated on a much bigger scale for the forthcoming 14th Lok Sabha polls. Even the lingo is changing. Party manifestos are being called vision documents these days, says Surapaneni.																														Politicians, psephologists and social scientists all agree that the first-time voter, who grew up in Manmohan Singhs liberalised, consumerist India, is different from his predecessors. Uninterested either in attending rallies or taking part in student politics, he views politicians and political parties the way a hard-to-please CEO looks at a companys production charts. 																														The first-time voters are efficiency-oriented. They have no political loyalties and do not view politics as something to engage in. They judge every issue on its own merit. The India Shining campaign is actually meant for them, says political scientist Imtiaz Ahmed.																														And psephologist Surapaneni, whose organisation Marketing and Development Research Associates has also conducted studies on Indian youth mindsets, agrees. They are more demanding, more critical. They want quick and visible results, he says. To them, it is a candidates performance, not his party that matters.																														This is also an independent, individualistic lot. And it reflects in its attitude towards voting. This generation doesnt want to stamp its ballots as told by elders. It wants to vote of its own free will. Since the new voter takes an individual decision, he has to be targetted individually. Which is why political parties are targetting them separately, says psephologist Deshmukh.																														Consequently, the family votes importance is going down, especially in urban India. Even in rural areas where community elders and caste panchayats often ensure a collective vote, the new voter is showing signs of breaking free. Despite differing social realities, spread of television and growth of regional-language media has triggered mindset changes among them as well. The rural youth is not as eager to follow the diktats of his community elders as the previous generation. He is more influenced by his peer group than his community, says Ahmed.																														The new voters use their own idiom to explain politics. Talking about the Sonia-videshi issue, commerce student Singh says, Look at Danish Kaneria, the only Hindu in the Pakistan cricket team. When bowling he only thinks about Pakistan. Which is the way it should be because he lives there. Similarly, Sonia has been living in India for so many years. Surely, she belongs to this country, he says, implying that, to him, the whole controversy is nothing but dirty politics.																														For all his apparent indifference, the new voter knows what he wants out of politics. He votes on the basis on what he wants them to do, says Ahmed. As if to prove him right, Kartik Balakrishnan, a 22-year-old Mumbai chartered accountant in the making, says, Politics is taking decisions that will affect the lives of a billion people. For instance, if the BJP comes to power and allows CAs to practise abroad, it will affect us directly.																														GenNext is ready to join the great Indian election spectacle. The first-time voters are playing the game on their own terms. And, in the coming elections, as their size grows, they might change the rules of the game forever.With inputs from Satish Nandgaonkar in Mumbai

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 							 																						THROW THE MEDIA OFF TRACK Gouri Chatterjee																								If history was made in Islamabad this week, thank Agra for it. Remember those fever-pitch expectations at that first meeting between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf, and the interminable discussions on their body language that followed? Well, it wasnt all a waste. 																								The government of India quickly sussed out where their biggest failure lay: in managing the media. Some BJP leaders even accused the ill-informed media of creating excessive hype that whipped up unwarranted euphoria (and, finally, caused them all the embarrassment). 																								It was a lesson well learnt. This time round, the media was not only kept completely in the dark about the prime ministers programme, but word was also put out that itll be just another SAARC meeting, something that always produces huge yawns in newsrooms. Many big-time editors who were thick on the ground in Agra didnt even bother to go to Islamabad, sending deputies instead.																								The governments strategy was that with such low expectations, even if the two leaders part with a smile and a promise to keep in touch, itll be deemed a breakthrough. It worked. 																								True, thats how diplomacy is played out, in small incremental steps, not one big bang and not in the glare of the media. Of course, thats not how the media works, but who would know that from recent events, whether in Islamabad or Iraq or wherever? 																								Of course, when it comes to foreign affairs, journalists the world over are usually patriots first. In our case, the governments task is made even easier with reporters fascinated by Taxila where Chandragupta Maurya defeated the Greek general, Porus or stunned that People in Islamabad are so friendly. I was expecting so much hostility on the streets.  Watering hole																								The Mumbai Press Club is just utterly delightful. All press clubs of course have the best of venues (the Press Club of India in New Delhi has just been given another huge plot in Lutyens Delhi); in this case, it is the heart of south Mumbai, one of the countrys costliest real estate. Housed in a lovely old building called the Glass House, it overlooks the Azad Maidan, quite like the Calcutta Press Club enjoys the open spaces of our Maidan. And, again like all the others, it is the journalists favourite watering hole with drinks the cheapest in the city, exempt as they are from those punishing taxes mere mortals pay. 																								But something strange is happening at the Mumbai Press Club. They have just come out with a calendar for 2004. A rather smart one, with fascinating photographs of their beloved Mumbai taken by the citys press photographers (duly sponsored of course). Stranger still, this is the fallout of a contest on Mumbai Moments conducted by the Press Club last year. A press club involved in anything remotely constructive! One lives and learns. 																								Press clubs are where journalists come to drink, eat, and share the days rumour. The rest is extra-curricular. Even press conferences, for which press clubs were once a choice venue. These days only NGOs who cant afford 5-star luxury or small parties that still dont have a plush office or the event manager who still has a lot to learn hold their press meets at press clubs. 																								Even the Delhi Press Club has nowhere near the sort of prestige that the National Press Club of America in Washington commands. Heads of states feel honoured to be invited to give a speech after lunch or dinner at the NCP. (In India, they might get landed with demands for airconditioners. Thats what the Indian Womens Press Corps in Delhi wangled out of a Kuwaiti delegation.)																								Mixing business and pleasure is always tough. Four years ago, the Calcutta Press Club tried to do something novel: institute best journalism awards. It failed. The members just couldnt agree on the judges. They didnt believe any journalist, serving or retired, could be found who would be impartial or objective. All press clubs in India have avoided such sources of bad blood. 																								At least they rise to the occasion when something as venomous as the recent attack on The Hindu takes place.

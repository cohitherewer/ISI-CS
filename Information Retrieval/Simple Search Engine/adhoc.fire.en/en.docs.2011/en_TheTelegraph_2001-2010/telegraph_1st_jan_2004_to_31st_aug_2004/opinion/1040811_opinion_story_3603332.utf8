The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Back to your desk, please				 																																																				Sir  What would the Faria Alams of this world do if we did not have an endless appetite for sex, lies and videotape (Girlfriend changes hands in soccer bosses secret pass, July 26)? Since Alam has launched herself in the business of feeding the scandal machines, she cannot crib about being called a prostitute. Be it Alam, or Sarah Marbeck or Rebecca Loos, the modus operandi has very little variety: it is either a straightforward kiss-and-tell or denial-and-affirmation. (Alam, interestingly, denied the charges till she was sure of her gains from the disclosure.) No doubt her story has been bought by the tabloids. If she goes on to write a book now, it will be all too predictable. What could be a welcome change is our refusal to help it become a bestseller. Once the link between money and high-profile promiscuity is broken, the Faria Alams will take to their dictation pads again.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sonali Ganguly, Calcutta
				 																Against the grain				 																																																				Sir  I have been following with interest the clash of the titans  Sanjay Subrahmanyam and Ashis Nandy. There is no doubt that Subrahmanyams article in The Telegraph, A guru and his followers (Aug 8), would not have been written had Amit Chaudhuri not turned out to be a Nandy follower (A climate of opinion, Aug 1). But Chaudhuri was merely trying to be fair and objective in his assessment. 				 																																																				Subrahmanyam is now complaining of the hate-mails he has been receiving. But he could have avoided them altogether if he had been a little more restrained in heaping abuses on Nandy and his alleged followers. For instance, I failed to find the relevance of his comments on the Bengal Renaissance to the debate about the state of secularism in India. Subrahmanyam has mentioned Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Tagore with some disdain, but he seems ignorant of their contributions in making us aware and proud of the culture of the so-called medieval period of Indian or Bengali history. While Bankimchandra described the period of Pathan rule in Bengal as a time of regeneration, it was Tagore who drew attention to the richness of baul and other folk traditions. 				 																																																				Indeed, observing the aggressive championing of secularism by people like Subrahmanyam, I am reminded of my college days in the Fifties, when the peace movement, largely financed by Stalins Russia, was having its field day. Some of the most violent chauvinists of the Bengali society were in the forefront of that movement. Their abusiveness and constant harangues for peace led poet Naresh Guha to write in a poem, Shanti jokhon singher mato garjay, takey darai (I get scared when Peace roars like a lion).				 																																																				Run as it was by people whose hands had been bloodied repeatedly, the peace movement of my youth had an ignominious end. I am afraid the same fate lies in wait for secularism (with the most serious consequences for the present generation of Indians) unless it can be rescued from such intolerant people like Subrahmanyam.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Sanjay Subrahmanyams scathing criticism of Ashis Nandy and Amit Chaudhuri reads like a tirade against the dominance of Bengali scholars in Indias intellectual life (although he does not forget to express his admiration for Gautam Bhadra and Partha Chatterjee). In spite of its veneer of objectivity, the article betrays Subrahmanyams resentment of the pre-eminence of Bengali authors in Indias intellectual history. The authors opinions are no less ill-informed than those he criticizes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  A guru and his followers does have a point. Ashis Nandy is not doing Indians a favour by leaning to the right in an India that has been through Gujarat.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Women beware				 																																																				Sir  Women speaking up for themselves is certainly needed (The lady doth protest too much, Aug 4). But the want of it is part of a larger problem  the individuals voice of protest against wrongs is gradually fading away. How often do we object to a person jumping the queue to the Metros ticket counter? Wont we rather screw up our nose and look the other way rather than protest against a person smoking in the bus? How many times have we objected to the bus conductor accepting half the fare for allowing ticketless travel? These are trivial incidents, but within them lie the roots of many a social malaise.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bedashruti Mitra, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Bad management of sexual impulses on the part of men invites irritation and disgust from women. Men must learn to control, channelize and finally sublimate these impulses. Denial and repression leads to the kind maladopted behaviour that Chirosree Basu so correctly describes. Why do we still find it so difficult to talk about sex and try to resist the introduction of sex education in schools? Many of us who are baying for Dhananjoy Chatterjees blood have similar beasts inside us. I strongly agree with Basu that the weaker sex has to assert and defend themselves. They cannot leave the issue of their protection in the hands of a few good samaritans.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta

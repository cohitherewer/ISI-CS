		 Friday, January 23, 2004 							 																						ITS STILL THE SAME OLD INDIA Beyond the Courtyard By Anees  Jung, Viking, Rs 250 Anees Jungs exploration of the  other India which lives in villages and small towns in  Beyond the Courtyard is more touching than any objective  historical account could ever hope to be. This is because  Jung deliberately adopts a fictional mode of narration which  ensures the readers attention does not flag. She also bases  her account on personal encounters and private conversations,  which generates a kind of voyeuristic interest. These are  held together by what may be called a tourist guide paradigm,  that purports to take the reader on an imaginative tour  through familiar yet uncharted terrains. 																														This volume is a sequel to Jungs Unveiling India written 19 years ago, which had created a stir internationally. Here Jung chronicles the travails and fortitude of the next generation of her other India, mostly young women living with the combined handicaps of caste, class and sex. Marriage and prostitution are the two major axes around which their lives revolve. 																														The scenarios are more or less equally bleak in all the states Jung visits  Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Hyderabad, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal and Kerala. Globalization has led to attitudes becoming somewhat liberal. Education has spread as has an enhanced awareness of the economic independence of women. But the ghosts of poverty, ignorance and superstition refuse to be exorcized.																														Reading the book, one wonders whether marriage and prostitution are any different for these young women doomed to servility from their birth. In the societies described here, female foeticide and infanticide are rampant; the birth of a girl child is a curse; and child marriage is not only common, it is the norm. Naturally, the home in such families is far from being a sympathetically shared space for all members. Ironically, it is the mother-daughter relationship which is most damaged, as seen in the case of Lallan Bai and Vimal in Jamkhed. The dehumanizing oppression and mute surrender lead to an extreme isolation in the adolescents who can only talk to a mirror, because talking to parents is unthinkable, to teachers improper, to friends impossible.																														Jung also notes stray efforts at resistance and resilience. There is Jayba, the 35-year-old woman from Kutch who has thrown off the veil; Kamla of Tilonia, who is an engineering graduate; and Sadia who defies the prospect of an early marriage and asserts her desire to be a doctor. 																														So, where do we end up? Brought face to face with contradictions so stark and absurd, we see that Jungs other India is not a seamless whole, but a multi-layered and intricately-structured society, or rather, cluster of societies. There has been no significant paradigm shift in social ethics. Something is changing, but too slowly and vaguely. But the book invites students of history to venture out of the secure courtyard of traditional historical knowledge to stare reality in the face.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

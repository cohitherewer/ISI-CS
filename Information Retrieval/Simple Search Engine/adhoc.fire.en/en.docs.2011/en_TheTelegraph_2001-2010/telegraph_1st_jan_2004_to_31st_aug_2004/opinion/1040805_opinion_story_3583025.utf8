The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 							 																						ONLY FOR NOW																														Opportunism, by definition, cannot be thoughtless. But impulsiveness always is, because it proceeds without consideration of consequence and precedence. That Mr L.K. Advani is somewhat on the backfoot within the Bharatiya Janata Party is because of his proneness to think only about the moment and ways to derive immediate advantage. In Mumbai, during the meeting of the BJP national executive, he suggested a return to Hindutva. This not only ran contrary to the BJPs declared position when it ran the government as the leader of the National Democratic Alliance, but it also had the potential of breaking up the NDA. Coalition partners, Mr Advani would have realized if he had paused to think before he opened his mouth, would find it difficult to ally itself with a BJP that was declaring itself to be an out and out Hindu party. Mr Advani had to backtrack in Goa: there the party, in the meeting of its think tank  chintan baithak to the faithful  replaced Hindutva, the dreaded word, with nationalism. This term bears the vintage Vajpayee touch since it keeps a window open for a subsequent identification of nationalism with Hindutva. This semantic legerdemain displays thought and foresight, while the advocacy of Hindutva, in the current political context, is nothing more than a knee-jerk return to ideological roots.																														Perhaps more embarrassing for the BJP was Mr Advanis espousal of an opposition to foreign direct investment in insurance, telecom and civil aviation. This opposition ran counter to the policies formulated and followed by the BJP when it was in government. Mr Advanis line was fraught with so many contradictions that even his loyal supporters within the BJP found it impossible to align themselves with their leader. Here, too, Mr Advani, taken up with the immediate need of opposing the present government, chose to forget the recent past. The urge to confront prevailed over past policies. On this issue, Mr Advani is left with the kind of support he would rather do without: he won plaudits from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch. It is necessary to bring out these features in Mr Advani since they are typical of many Indian politicians, irrespective of political affiliations. They are prone to react to the immediate and thus wear the badge of opportunism.

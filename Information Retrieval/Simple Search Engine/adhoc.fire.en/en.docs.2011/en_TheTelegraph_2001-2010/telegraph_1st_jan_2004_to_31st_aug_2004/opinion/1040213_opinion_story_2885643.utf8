ARTHUR MILLER: A LIFE By Martin  Gottfried, Faber, pound;18 An honest appraisal of Arthur  Millers life always comes with strings attached: those  that bind him forever to Hollywoods immortal sex icon   Marilyn Monroe. This is inevitable when a playwrights work  is permeated by strong autobiographical references. Besides,  Monroe is Monroe. Millers liaison with her and their subsequent  four-year marriage, are important sources of biographical  material, marking, as Martin Gottfried sees it, the beginning  of the darkest phase in his life and career. One of Americas  greatest living playwrights would henceforth endure a five-year  period of creative stasis and witness the steady, media-manipulated  erosion of his reputation as a master of theatrical success,  devastating for a man whose pride in his work was synonymous  with his self-esteem. 																														Despite Millers reference in his autobiography, Timebends, to his first sexual encounter with Monroe, voyeurs would do well not to raise their hopes too high with Arthur Miller: A Life. Neither Miller (who dissociated himself from this biography when he realized it would involve incursions into his private life) nor the author is about to dish out any dirt. What Gottfried does offer, however, is far more valuable: incisive portraits, based on his exhaustive research, of Miller, Monroe and others who peopled their world. 																														Probing the strengths and neuroses of his subjects, Gottfried manages to surprise us with his insights into the psyche of a man capable of moving a theatre to tears, while being privately perceived as a remote person. On receiving the news of Monroes death, for example, Millers response to her New York public relations representative was a shocking Its your problem, not mine. Yet, at the age of 80, he hit a journalist who asked him whether he still dreamt about the movie star. This dichotomy, maintains Gottfried, lies at the root of the equivocation that torments Millers protagonists. 																														Equally sensitive to the conflicting compulsions that drove the beautiful but psychotic Monroe, whose childlike vulnerability hid a cruel, manipulative streak, Gottfried hints that the American sex symbol may well have been a far better actress than people realized. Yet, his unkindest cuts are tempered by a wry humour, as evident in his sharply-etched cameos of theatre and film personalities, including the incorrigible Jed Harris and Elia Kazan. The author also tries to understand why influential American journalists spared no effort to bury Millers plays in an avalanche of venom, while their British counterparts clearly did not share their views. 																														Gottfrieds achievement lies in the multiple roles he performs with aplomb. As award-winning drama critic, he evaluates Millers work both individually and in a broader literary context, comparing Millers plays with those by Eugene ONeill, Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee, among others. With equal verve, he plunges into the nitty-gritty of casting, direction and stage production, enlivening his observations with fascinating vignettes. 																														Gottfried also plays historian of an era devastated by events that would leave indelible impressions on Millers life, convictions and art. Among those, the Depression of the Thirties haunt his entire body of work, as does the anti-communist witch-hunt. 																														Arthur Miller: A Life is a sincere effort to take stock of the man who would be king of Broadway one day and invisible not long afterwards, despite the partial salvaging of his artistic reputation in his twilight years. Miller failed to come to terms with this, or to resolve the bitterness that underpinned his memories of Monroe. Gottfried demonstrates a commendable detachment without sacrificing his empathy for his subject. Despite its seriousness of purpose, this biography is not a bore. And if the deluge of detail tends to slacken the pace of the narrative, the average reader is unlikely to complain. For in the detail lie such illuminating insights as Monroes last words on her failed marriage to Miller: I wasnt sweet all through. He should love the monster too... 						MITA GHOSE

		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 							 																						BAD THINKING																														Mr P. Chidambaram will not like being labelled a rollback minister. But clearly, some amendment, if not rollback, is on the cards for turnover tax in capital markets. In hindsight, the budget proposals were badly drafted. Abolishing long-term capital gains and reducing short-term capital gains tax to 10 per cent, the finance minister proposed 0.15 per cent turnover tax on transactions in securities on stock exchanges, with tax to be levied on the buyer. There have been two kinds of objections to the turnover tax idea. First, there is a conceptual kind of argument, opposed to taxing anything other than income and selective taxation of some asset markets at the expense of others. While these points are indeed valid on efficiency grounds, revenue compulsions seem to be the reason why the second kind of argument has assumed relevance. This holds the position that while turnover tax is preferable to the status quo of taxing short-term and long-term capital gains, it is the form of turnover tax that is objectionable. For instance, it should be levied on the seller rather than the buyer. This reflects imperfect thinking and inadequate drafting in the budget-making process. And this is also true of the idea of taxing all securities. Presumably, mandarins continue to equate the capital market with equity, ignoring the fact that debt instruments also exist.																														A large chunk of this is government debt, which has also been hit. Margins in the debt market are thin, and it is doubtful that the debt market will be able to absorb 0.15 per cent. The rollback will possibly incorporate an exemption of debt instruments and a switch from buyer to seller. There remains the more vexatious issue of the rate of tax in equity markets, cash as well as derivatives. Equity markets can possibly absorb 0.15 per cent. But brokers are up in arms, and day trade, significant in volume if not in value, will be adversely hit. And at least in principle, one discriminates against listed securities and drives transactions underground to cash-based business. However, in various industry meetings, Mr Chidambaram has made the point that turnover tax should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of the capital-market package. That is, he is willing to reconsider, provided there is an alternative revenue generation framework. Since that is unlikely, and no one, not even brokers, want reversion to the status quo on short and long-term capital gains, a reduction in rate for equity transactions to 0.05 per cent or even 0.10 per cent seems unlikely. The broader point is that tax proposals should have been better thought out.

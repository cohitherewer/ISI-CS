The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 							 																						IF ITS BOFORS, IT MUST BE POLL TIME Gouri Chatterjee																					Few journalists make their politics known as openly and as trenchantly as the Asian Age editor-in-chief, M.J. Akbar. Even an occasional reader of his Byline can be in no doubt about his uncompromising views on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.																					Sonia is the BJPs biggest ally because the Congress has no hope as long as she runs it  this has been the tenor of his Sunday column for quite some time now, of course expressed with his trademark passion and vitriol.																					On Friday, the day after the Asian Age screamed Bofors truth points to Quattrocchi, Sonia, Akbar was the chief guest at the launch function of Sonia Under Scrutiny, a book that examines her foreign origins and has articles by such leading NDA groupies as Jaya Jaitley and S. Gurumurthy. 																					For Akbar, once charmed into a brief fling with active politics by Sonias husband, has not just been spewing venom at his widow, he has also been seeing a lot of merit in Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																					How easy it was for the Congress therefore to accuse him of playing politics to benefit a particular party in the coming polls. How easy too it was for the charge to sound believable. Last weeks revelations in the Asian Age were no journalistic coup. This is not the first time Swedens principal investigator in the Bofors case is saying what he has said. But meanwhile, Bofors no longer raises electoral metabolic rates.																					Fifteen years ago, when Akbar, as editor of this paper had published the now infamous St Kitts documents (one of the two newspapers in the country to do so), few had been as quick to believe the story was a plant. Akbar had left The Telegraph to fight the 1989 elections on a Congress ticket before it came to light that St Kitts had been the Rajiv Gandhi governments lame effort at implicating V.P. Singh in his own Bofors. 																					Truly rural																					Hindi films and English newspapers have the same approach to village India: if you have to let the countryside in, let it be in the Swiss Alps (preferably with David Beckham and Posh Spice in the frame) or at least somewhere in Europe with lazy windmills in the background. 																					Hindi films do it to cater to the NRI audience, or so it is said. For English newspapers, the stock answer is reader interest. Urban yuppies dont want to read about the unwashed masses.																					It doesnt quite wash. Some years ago, The Times of India sponsored and then published a series of articles by P. Sainath that made for riveting reading and evolved into the award-winning, brisk-selling book, Everybody Loves a Good Drought. 																					The real explanation could be simpler: one, finding someone in the newsroom who has ever been to a village or is curious enough or cares enough to go and find out about one. And two, finding news managers ready to spend the money needed. Strange as it may sound, rural reporting doesnt come cheap. Special arrangements have to be made for power supply and transport and so on. The risks just add up.																					The result: a sati or a human sacrifice, a drought or an earthquake, it takes a lot for village India to finds its way into the English language press (unless, of course, it is election time). 																					Finally, things may be changing. At least at The Hindu, which is anyway Indias most serious, most politically-correct newspaper. The Hindu is appointing a Rural Editor and the first incumbent will be, yes, P. Sainath. 																					News of the screws																					After all the money that the tabloids have to shell out for their stories, reporters still have no respite. The News of the World, affectionately known as the News of the Screws  or sometimes, just Screws  has reportedly paid the highest amount ever for one single story to Rebecca Loos for her text messages and what not to David Beckham. But a reporter had to wait patiently and look encouragingly as Loos sent a final SMS to which Beckham responded with even greater enthusiasm  providing the Screws with its ultimate proof. What a job.

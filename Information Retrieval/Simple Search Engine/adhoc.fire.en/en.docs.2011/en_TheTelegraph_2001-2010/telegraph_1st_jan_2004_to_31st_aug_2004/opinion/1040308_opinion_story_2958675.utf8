		 Monday, March 08, 2004 							 																						ITS A DEAL, STUPID Gwynne Dyer																					Were going to get our troops inside Pakistan in return for not forcing Musharraf to deal with Khan, a former senior American intelligence official was quoted in Seymour Hershs article on relations between the United States of America and Pakistan in the New Yorker recently. Its a perfectly balanced deal, as elegant as a mathematical equation: both sides of it are insanely stupid.																					The deal, if Hersh is correct, works like this. Thousands of American troops will be deployed this spring in a tribal area in northwest Pakistan to hunt for al Qaida founder Osama bin Laden, allegedly in the area. In return, Washington will not press Pakistans president, Pervez Musharraf, to probe more deeply into the scandal surrounding the sale of nuclear weapons components to Iran, Libya and North Korea by the father of Pakistans nuclear bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan.																					Maybe Washington made the deal because it knows that any further investigation of Khans activities would show that Musharraf knew what Khan was doing years ago, or was even involved in it. The Pakistani president is now Americas indispensable ally in the war on terror, according to the Bush administration, so maybe they decided not to push it any further because theyd have to break ties with Musharraf if it came out that he was the master proliferator to the axis of evil. 																					Strange silence																					Or maybe the US authorities dont think Musharraf was involved, but suspect that other senior officers in the Pakistani army were  generals who might decide it was time for Musharraf to go if he turned the investigators loose on them. So well let it all pass to keep our guy in power. Its more important to have Musharrafs cooperation in chasing some al Qaida remnants along the Afghan border than to get to the bottom of an operation that was purveying nuclear weapons secrets and technology for years to the very rogue states the US is supposed to be so worried about.																					Instead of demanding a full account of the black-market nuclear operation, George W. Bush congratulated Musharraf on getting Khan to admit to past crimes, and made no protest when Musharraf refused foreign inspection of Pakistani nuclear facilities, refused to let foreign intelligence services question Khan, and declared the whole matter closed. It seemed almost incomprehensible behaviour in a man whose entire presidency has come to focus on preventing weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of rogue states.																					It is more comprehensible once we know the quid pro quo. The single event that would have the greatest positive impact on Bushs re-election chances this November is the capture of bin Laden by American forces. Not that bin Laden is an active threat any more  if he were in regular communication with his followers, he would have been traced long ago  he represents a symbolic victory in the war on terror that could easily be the margin between victory and defeat for Bush. 																					Uncharted territory																					It is monumental folly. If bin Laden is really there, let the Pakistani forces track him down, but to put thousands of American troops into the Pathan tribal areas of northwest Pakistan is stupid. Pakistanis in general have an acute allergic reaction to the idea of having American troops on their soil, and the area where the troops will be operating is precisely where bin Ladens most avid admirers are to be found. Every male over fourteen in that part of Pakistan goes armed, and clashes between them and US troops are guaranteed. What happens then?																					What could easily happen is the overthrow of Musharraf, and then we really are in unknown territory. This is a nuclear-armed country where all leading civilian politicians have been discredited and where nobody knows who the next general will be. So far the Pakistani army has always intervened in politics corporately, preserving the chain of command, but that is not written in the stars. If Pakistan really spins out of control, foreign intervention is guaranteed. Neither the US nor India will sit by and let those nukes fall into the wrong hands.

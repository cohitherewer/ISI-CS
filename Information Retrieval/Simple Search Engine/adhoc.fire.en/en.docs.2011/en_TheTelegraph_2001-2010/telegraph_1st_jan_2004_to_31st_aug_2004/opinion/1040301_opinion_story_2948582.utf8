		 Monday, March 01, 2004 							 																						CAUGHT NAPPING																														Anarchists succeed when law-keepers slip. The audacious strike by Maoist guerrillas, which killed seven policemen in West Midnapore district last week, once again proved this. Another mine-blast by the extremists in a neighbouring area, barely two months ago, had rung the alarm bells loud enough. But that obviously failed to shake the government into doing enough to rethink its plan of action. Worse still, the fact that the latest strike came within days of a public rally by Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the area underlines the Maoists desperation. The attack was thus nothing short of a daring challenge to the authority of the state. The outlaws could pose such a challenge because they were helped by the lack of unpreparedness on the states part. A bandh call in several states by the Peoples War of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and by the Maoist Communist Centre soon after also goes to show the growing danger of anarchism. It cannot be any comfort if the killers in West Midnapore had sneaked in from neighbouring Jharkhand, as Mr Bhattacharjee later suggested. He must be deceiving himself and the people if he thinks that the Maoist onslaught is a mere spill-over from Jharkhand or Bihar, where these groups are more active. A government that misreads the signals will be caught napping again and again.																														The states handling of the problem seems to have been jettisoned by an avoidable confusion. Both the chief minister and his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have apparently mixed up administrative and political measures to meet the challenge. No one can object to Mr Bhattacharjees argument that a political campaign against the Maoists must go hand in hand with the administrative steps. There is also a case for reaching more development work to the poor tribals, whose poverty the extremists exploit to lure them into their fold. That, however, begs the question as to why, after 27 years in power, the Left Front failed to improve the lot of these tribals. But polemics over such questions should have nothing to do with the administrative steps necessary to stem the rot. It would be suicidal for the state if the administrations hands are tied by any political calculation. But police actions can achieve little if there is no holistic approach to make them meaningful. Mr Bhattacharjee has no option but to make common cause with New Delhi and other states where Maoist rebellions threaten law and order and civil society. West Bengal has gone through the trauma in the late Sixties and the early Seventies. That spectre must not haunt Bengal ever again.

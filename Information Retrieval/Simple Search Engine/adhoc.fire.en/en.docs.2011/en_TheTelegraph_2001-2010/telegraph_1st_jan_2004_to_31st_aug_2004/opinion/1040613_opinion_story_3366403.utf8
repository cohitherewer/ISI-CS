		 Sunday, June 13, 2004 							 																						TONYS TALE																														The prime minister of Great Britain cannot hide his disappointment behind a bush. But Mr Tony Blair must be aware that his partys miserable performance in the local elections is a direct fallout of his decision to be more loyal to Mr George W. Bush than some members of the Republican Party. Mr Blair went along with the president of the United States of America in the conduct of the Iraq war. This included telling the people of Britain that there was definite information about the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq by Mr Saddam Hussein. It has been clear for some time now that whatever Mr Husseins other crimes, he had no such arsenal. From across the pond has come the admission from the highest possible quarter that the intelligence which was used to justify the invasion of Iraq was flawed and may have even been fabricated. All this has left Mr Blair with egg on his face. The smarmy manner of Mr Blair has not been able to prevent a sharp fall in the popularity charts. He has been able to ride the unpopularity because of the absence of an effective Tory opposition but the results of the local elections show that time is running out for the Labour government led by Mr Blair. There may be no strong Tory opposition to Mr Blair but within his own party, there are many who prefer Mr Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, as a more credible Labour leader.																														Lady Bracknell, one of Oscar Wildes unforgettable creations, once memorably remarked that being a Labour Unionist was as good as being a Tory. Much the same thing could be said about Mr Blairs new left. There is hardly anything left in Mr Blairs reinvented Labour Party. In the middle of the 19th century, it used to be said that the prime minister, Robert Peel, had run away with the clothes of the Whigs by adopting the policy of free trade. Mr Blair, in the fin de sicle, wrested away the Tory agenda from the Tories. No other prime minister since Ms Margaret Thatcher has nurtured the special relationship with the US so assiduously. Mr Blair moved decisively away from the hardy perennials of the Labour Party regarding the social sector and the welfare state. The electorate of Britain, by and large, had no objection to all this but it refuses to accept what it sees as dissembling on a crucial foreign policy issue. This is at the heart of Mr Blairs declining popularity. With a massive majority in the House of Commons, Mr Blair thought that he could get away with anything till hubris caught up with him, as it usually does in human affairs.																														In a sphere of activity where, according to another Labour prime minister, a week is a long time, the span of time from now till the next general election is akin to eternity. Mr Blair will no doubt clutch at the straw offered by the unanimous United Nations resolution on Iraq. But this may be too fragile a rescue line in a sea of anti-Blair feelings. There is time enough for the Tories to get their act together and lead a clutch of policies which is rightfully theirs. There is time enough also for Mr Brown to consolidate his position within the Labour Party. It is a short walk from the residence of the chancellor of the exchequer to 10, Downing Street.

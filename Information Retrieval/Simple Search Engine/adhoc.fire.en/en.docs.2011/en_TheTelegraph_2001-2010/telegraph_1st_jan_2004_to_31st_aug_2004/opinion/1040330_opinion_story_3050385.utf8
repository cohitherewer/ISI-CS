CYRIL GHOSHOn March 24, the former czar of counter-terrorism in the Clinton administration, Richard Clarke, testified before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. Also known as the 9/11 commission, this is an independent inquiry investigating whether the Clinton and Bush administrations could have been better prepared for, or even prevented, the attacks on the World Trade Center. In his testimony, Clarke has presented the most damning evidence of the Bush administrations disregard, and indeed indolence, in the face of an imminent al Qaida threat in the months prior to September 11, 2001.Since March 21, when he made public his declarations on the CBS special, 60 Minutes, the articulate Clarke has been ubiquitous: from National Public Radio to Larry King Live. His new book, Against All Enemies, also reveals much the same story. In short, he is manna from heaven for the Democrats and their presidential candidate, John Kerry. They would have to be uniformly unbrilliant if they fail to capitalize on these revelations.Clarke opened his testimony with an apology to the next of kin of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and took responsibility for the administration failing them. His credibility stems from his 30-year experience in Washington. From experienceHe was Ronald Reagans deputy assistant secretary of state for intelligence, and George H.W. Bushs assistant secretary of state overseeing arms control and non-proliferation. Under Bill Clinton, he was the national coordinator for counter-terrorism. Most recently, he was the head of cyber-security in George W. Bushs administration, a position that he claims he asked to be created once he was convinced that his advice on terrorism was not being considered as urgent. This move led to a virtual demotion from his former position on the National Security Council. He retired from the White House in March 2003.According to Clarke, under the Clinton administration, fighting terrorism was an extraordinarily high priority, while in the first eight months of the Bush administration, it was an important issue but not an urgent issue. Before a White House meeting on terrorism on September 4, 2001, Clarke is supposed to have written to the national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, expressing his frustration at the administrations pussyfooting on al Qaida. He publicly condemned the defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, for being obsessed with Iraq, while not comprehending how major a threat Osama bin Laden was.Advantage KerryThe Republicans have retaliated by calling his new book an audition for a job in the Kerry campaign. But this criticism can hardly be taken seriously given that Clarke has declared unambiguously that he is not going to accept a position in the Kerry administration should the latter win the elections in November this year.Kerry has so far been silent about Clarke. The Democrats cannot hope to beat Bush on the basis of either cash or advertisements. Kerrys reputation as a Vietnam veteran is a boon, especially against a war-mongering president who practically ducked the draft. What the Kerry team now has to make sure is that Clarkes revelations are not swamped by the Republican campaign of name-calling and public discrediting.Kerry has done a good job so far, targeting job losses, the stagnating economy, the multi-trillion dollar national debt, tax cuts, the impending social security crisis when the baby-boomers reach retiring age, and so on. The only comparative advantage for Bush has been his stint as a war president. Now, Kerry has a weapon to attack this with.We know from the experience of 2000 that the outcome of the presidential elections will depend on the swing states such as Ohio and Michigan. What Kerry needs to do now is to launch a sustained attack based on Clarkes revelations, fortuitous as they are, to drive the point home in these states. A few days ago he was overheard calling the Republicans crooked liars. He has been granted an opportunity to substantiate his statement. He must not mess up.

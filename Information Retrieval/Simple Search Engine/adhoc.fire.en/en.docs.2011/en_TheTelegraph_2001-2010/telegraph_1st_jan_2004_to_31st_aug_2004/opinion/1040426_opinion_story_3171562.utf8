The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 26, 2004 							 																						SPEECH IN TIME																														Very little can be said when drunken men beat up a young woman inside a station, drag her out of a train compartment to stop her escaping, abuse her for moving around with her boyfriend, and people stand and watch. Yet what happened in Hridaypur may not go unheeded, for the police have caught the gang-leaders after an efficient operation. A few conclusions can be drawn from this sequence of events. Some are the old ones: that women are subject to a range of atrocities in public on a regular basis in West Bengal, that the perpetrators are confident of getting away with it because they often bank on local political connections, that the bystanders are paralysed by unspoken fears  the alleged chief culprit in the incident was carrying a loaded revolver when he was arrested  and that women are being traumatized by such encounters  the victim in this case has resigned her job. 																														The other conclusions are more heartening. The police can catch all such culprits if they want to, and fast. A claimed connection with the youth wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was not an obstacle to the arrest. But this can happen only when the chief minister expresses shock. That Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee commented immediately and sensitively was enough to set in motion the law and order machinery. The heartening observations, therefore, raise some unavoidable questions. It is a sad day for West Bengal when the quick capture of perpetrators of atrocities on a woman should be such an exception. This should have been the rule long ago  only had that been the situation, no one would have dared to touch the woman that day at Hridaypur. More important, it needs the chief minister himself to express shock before action is taken. Is the chief minister, then, to comment daily on every sexual and gender-based crime? Its numbers usually grow as elections approach. This would mean that the woman who was molested in her home in front of her child by young men connected to the same youth branch of the CPI(M) in Barasat will get no justice until the chief minister speaks. As her predecessor in the same area did not: she and her husband had to leave the area after they had objected to the same gangs sexual aggressiveness. The chief minister perhaps will also look into the nature of community justice meted out by partymen in the village of Battala in Farakka. Forbidden to go to the police, a victim of rape was asked to endure the same punishment as the rapist by CPI(M) leaders of the village. The physical punishment was simply stand-ups, but the rapist was also fined. This is surely not the chief ministers job. What he could do is ensure that the police are prompt and impartial in every case, and that terror, instead of afflicting the bystander, is turned on the criminals instead.

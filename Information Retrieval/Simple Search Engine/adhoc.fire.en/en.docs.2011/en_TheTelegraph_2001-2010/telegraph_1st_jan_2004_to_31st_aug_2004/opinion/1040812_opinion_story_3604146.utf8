The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 12, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Right on course				 																																																				Sir  The RSS has no reason to fear the indifference of Generation X (Knickerwallahs go shopping, Aug 8). They may perceive it as old-fashioned, but todays youth also are the true flag-bearers of the rightist outfit. Like the knickerwallahs, the yuppie classes too are animated by a kind of hyper-patriotism of the India is best variety, harking back to the countrys ancient glory in an attempt to link it to its present near-superpower status. Then there is the quest for spiritualism, witness the increased attendance in temples, the proliferation of Art of Living, vaastu and what have you, and a suspicion of the minorities. If the youth go to the discos every once in a while or give in to Western fads like Valentines Day, they are just being recalcitrant, as is their wont. The RSS should just learn to look the other way and concentrate on the similarities. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ranjana Sengupta, Calcutta
				 																Capital decision				 																																																				Sir  The decision to hang Dhananjoy Chatterjee on his birthday is absolutely shocking. While I do not support capital punishment, I can see why it may be used in the larger interests of society  but always with the impersonality that is a part of the legal process, never out of grudge. But in this case, the decision-makers seem to have been driven by a sense of revenge. Worse, they will inflict pain on Dhananjoys mother. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhulekha Sengupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  While the presidents rejection of the mercy plea by Dhananjoy Chatterjee reaffirms the Indian laws respect for the dignity of women, there is also exasperation at the hypocrisy of the Indian judiciary. Dhananjoys crime is horrible, but do all criminals in India face the same consequences as this poor farmers son who came to Calcutta in search of a better life? How does Indian law justify the favourable decision for Salman Khan? Would the law have pardoned an ordinary taxi driver whose momentary mistake killed a VVIP? Would the law have overlooked my crime had I gone poaching in a reserved forest? Or if I had defied TADA? I am one of millions of Indians who are not privileged to have a father, mother, uncle or aunt with contacts in the judiciary or political establishment. Therefore, I understand the indignation of Dhananjoys family. 				 																																																				Here one should look at the condition of the guards and domestic maids in plush apartments, most of whom are denied minimum wages and legal protection. The disparities of our society are the involuntary breeding grounds of criminals. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Dutta, New Haven, US

				 																																																				Sir  I thought the president was the last hope for Dhananjoy Chatterjee, but now I learn that he may approach the apex court challenging the rejection of his clemency petition. Isnt our legal system confusing?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi 

				 																																																				Sir  The reports on the impending execution of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, especially Death row diet chart (Aug 5), were revolting. They depict a morally bankrupt and intellectually underdeveloped peoples glee at the prospect of a mans death, camouflaged as self-righteous anger. That school children and their teachers expressed satisfaction at the presidents decision shows the evil lurking in the seemingly innocent. It is foolish to think that violent crime will decrease because one poor man is to be killed. 				 																																																				Especially, considering that India lacks even the most basic judicial infrastructure. For example, was a DNA test carried out on the body fluids in this case which was initially proven only on circumstantial evidence? Why were not such fluids preserved? Because a state cannot give life, it has no right to take it. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shyamal Bagchee, Edmonton, Canada

 Sir  I am fed-up of seeing Dhananjoys family on TV. Why is the media giving so much publicity to a killers family? And, why are the lawyers of Calcutta wasting their time on saving him from the gallows by proving he is mentally ill? Yours faithfully,																															
Prerna Dutta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It must have been very difficult for A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to decide to reject Dhananjoys mercy petition. He had the judgments of various courts  all of which had found Dhananjoy guilty; the decision of his predecessor, Shankar Dayal Sharma, to reject the latters mercy petition earlier; and the home ministry recommendation. It is, however, unlikely that Kalam was constitutionally bound to go by these. Had it been so, it would not have taken him five weeks to decide. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  Dhananjoy Chatterjee doesnt deserve to be relieved of his guilty conscience in a moment of pain. I believe a lifetime in jail is enough punishment.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Krishanu Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why is Nata Mullick so proud of his father, who sent 600 freedom fighters to their deaths during the British raj? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Soham Gupta, Calcutta

		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 							 																						NO SHELTERING TIE																								Even small steps can make a big difference in breaking the ice between countries. If Dhaka is finally closing its doors on militants from Indias North-east, it signals a welcome change of policy. Bangladeshs prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, seems to have indicated this change to Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee when they met in Islamabad on the sidelines of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation conference. New Delhi too has reasons to be happy with Dhakas promise that these rebels, fleeing from the Bhutanese offensive against them, would not be allowed to take shelter in Bangladesh. Some other events also indicate that Bangladesh now is beginning to see the issue in a different light. This may not be immediately apparent in its diplomatic posturings. Officially, Dhaka still maintains that there are no camps or shelters of Indian rebels on its territory. It is not difficult to see the reason behind such an official line  no country can publicly admit to aiding a neighbours outlaws, even if it actually does so for the sake of dubious strategies. Besides, a section of policy-makers in Bangladesh fallaciously argued that the rebels issue could be exploited to score some diplomatic points with India. The Bhutanese campaign must have come to Dhaka as a clear signal of a hardening of New Delhis resolve to clean up the mess in its backyard. Also, it must have become increasingly difficult for Dhaka to keep up its pretence in the face of hard evidence.																								It is not always seen in Dhaka how the issue has shackled its relations with New Delhi. If Bangladesh had not gained as much from India in trade and other areas as it had expected, it was largely because the difference over the rebels had cast a shadow on the relations. Indias concern over the rebels has another dimension in that some of these groups are known to have been funded by different Pakistani agencies. So the Pakistani shadow also falls on relations between India and Bangladesh over this issue. It is safe to presume that the two countries would do better business once this issue is sorted out. For Bangladesh, though, the most important thing is that its own commercial and diplomatic interests vis--vis India have been held hostage to an issue which does not help it in anyway. There is some justification for Dhakas complaints about Indias refusal to allow many of its goods duty-free access to Indian markets. New Delhi too resents Dhakas denial to allow Indian goods transporters the transit right through Bangladesh. As a result, both countries lose out on business and other earnings which would have benefited their economies. It is time that realism, rather than prejudices, dictated Dhakas policies.

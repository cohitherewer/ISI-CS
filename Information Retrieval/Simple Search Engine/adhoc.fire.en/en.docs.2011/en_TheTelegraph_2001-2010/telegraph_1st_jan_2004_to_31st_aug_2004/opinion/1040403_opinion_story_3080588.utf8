The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 03, 2004  Out and About
				 																																	Book your places and switch off your cellphones  the boys from Vienna are here. After 25 years, the famous Vienna Boys Choir will be in India for a series of concerts that will take them to Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta. The choir, established in 1498, has been moving with the times. Two years ago, it recorded its first CD of pop songs. And at the April 12 programme in Calcutta, the boys  between 10 and 14  will sing among other things, a qawwali and a bhajan. And you thought Vienna was just another word for a waltz?Sakshi Tanvar				 																																	Parvati of Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki died three days ago (yippee!). Long live Sakshi Tanvar. The leading lady is tired of her goody-goody two-shoes image both on and off screen and has now decided to put her foot down. Ive always wanted to crib about the long working hours, she is said to have remarked. Now I am happy I will be able to live as Sakshi without the Parvati image. Mind you, she isnt the only one who is happy to have jumped out of the K-serial bandwagon. Nausheen Ali Sardar of Kkusum and Mouli Ganguly of Kahiin Kissi Roz too have had their fill of the weepy soppy soaps. Looks like its time for Ektaa Kapoor to weep. What do corporate bigwigs do when they are not spending crores on getting their products noticed? Not always do they take up the pen. Some of the hatke ones take to playing the flute. Videocon head honcho Venugopal Dhoot  the guy who got Shah Rukh Khan to endorse Videocon colour TVs  has released a CD of his recitals called VenuNaad. But he says, It is strictly for private circulation! Thank God for small mercies. 				 																																	Sarnath Banerjee, 31, a Delhi-based comic illustrator, has come out with Indias first ever graphic novel. Whatever that means. Called Corridor, the story captures alienation (yawn!) and the fragmented reality of urban living throu-gh an interplay of text and images. Unlikely to find its way outside the corridor.

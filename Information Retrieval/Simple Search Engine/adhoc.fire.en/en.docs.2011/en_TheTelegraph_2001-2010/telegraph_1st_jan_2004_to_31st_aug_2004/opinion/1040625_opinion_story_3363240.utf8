The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 25, 2004 							 																						KEEP THE SPIRIT OF THE GAME Raju Mukherji																					While defending the presence of filmdom at the the Olympic torch ceremony at New Delhi recently, Rahul Dravid said that the Olympic movement is not just about sports. It is indeed sad to learn that Indias vice-captain has lost his sense of perspective. What else is Olympics about? Let us assume that the Olympic games are for people from all walks of life. In that case, why were young people from the other professions like law, medicine, journalism and others not included in the ceremony? Why were only second-rate actors and business people chosen?																					The trouble with our cricketers is that they talk too much, too often and too loudly. Since they are in the spotlight perpetually, they have begun to think that they know a little more about everything than anybody else. Unfortunately, Rahul Dravid has fallen into the same trap. Yet he had seemed more intelligent, knowledgeable and balanced than the rest. 																					The Olympic movement had originally been restricted to people who did not pursue sports as a career. For example, Johnny Weissmuller, the great Olympic swimming champion, became a Hollywood hero as Tarzan. The Olympic silver medalist, Norman Pritchard, too, was a Hollywoodhero in the Twenties. That means Olympic participants were men who pursued different professions and came from diverse backgrounds. But the most essential aspect is that Olympics were for people who were primarily top-class sportspersons. 																					Sold out																					The Olympics brings the world together through sports. The rings signify the five major land masses of the world. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, wanted to highlight that participation and not competition was more important. The games, once restricted to amateurs, have changed, but the original theme of the sports has remained. So what makes Dravid feel that the Olympics are for nubile young women who are better known for their histrionic skills? Or for screen heroes who enjoy making black money? 																					The truth is that the administrators in the Indian Olympic Association have sold themselves to sponsors. Whatever the sponsors dictated were carried out without questions. Which is why the best of our sportspersons were relegated to the background while the film stars were called upon to carry the Olympic torch.																					Most sporting disciplines in our country have not seen big money. That is why cricket has generated so much envy. Cricket is criticized for the prosperity it has generated. Now when the Olympic games have given sports officials an opportunity to make big money, they could hardly afford to give it a miss. Thus they landed up at the feet of sponsors. 																					Chaotic future																					What these officials should have done is ask Jagmohan Dalmiya for guidance. Dalmiya would have taught them the ways by which he has taken cricket to the top of sponsors priorities. His first step was to make sponsors feel that he was doing them a big favour. Sponsors were made to wait for hours for his audience, they were even made to feel that they were being charged much less than they should be. They were made to fight among themselves, even grovel for attention. 																					Unless sports officials in this country learn how to tackle sponsors and big money, they will invariably remain puppets in the hands of these sponsors and do their bidding. They now sell themselves too cheap. And sure enough, the utter chaos that prevailed at the torch-relay in New Delhi will be replicated each time.																					The most unfortunate result of this would be what we just saw  Dravidspeak. There would emerge a breed of former sportsmen who would increasingly parrot lines as silly as Dravids. But these are the words of stooges and sycophants. Why should they come from the mouths of apparently sensible people like Rahul Dravid?

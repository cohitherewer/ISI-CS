				 																																																																														 If there is any one thing that set apart the BJP tenure, then it is the use of Hindi. The saffron leaders seemed to use the language as a badge of their swadeshi. So it was rather surprising to find Uma Bharti persist with English in all her answers to the questions in Hindi put to her by the Congresss Jairam Ramesh. The Madhya Pradesh CM has a reputation  well-deserved, by all accounts  for being as swadeshi as they come. Which is why Ramesh, who was moderating the public debate at which this exchange took place, couldnt resist asking Bharti why she was speaking in English  no doubt hoping to get a raise from her. He succeeded in provoking a switch to Hindi  Mein angrezi is liye bol rahi hoon ki aap log mujhe ganwar na samjhen. A Freudian slip, if ever there was one. So thats what Bharti really thinks, that speaking in Hindi is a sign of illiteracy. Thats an affront to Hindi little expected from someone who professes to love the language.				 																																																																														 The Big B is big, really big. If anyone had doubts on that score, they must have been allayed by the hostage-takers of the three Indian drivers in Iraq soliciting his intervention. As for the few remaining sceptics, heres evidence of how far the Amitabh Bachchan-magic spreads. The producers of Dil jo bhi kahe wanted to shoot at the Royal Palace of Sweden, one of the most magnificent structures in Europe which was built in the 10th century. Apparently, they wanted the palace to be the imaginary college in the film. The Swedes had refused several such offers from film-makers, including some from Hollywood, and so the request seemed to have little chance of being granted. That is until the producers decided to enlist the help of the ageing superstar. And thats how the Deewar was broken.				 																																																																														 Court the media when out of power; when in power, shun it. That seems to be the motto of three Congress ministers  Mani Shankar Aiyar, Shivraj Patil and Kamal Nath. 				 																																													Manis sudden inaccessiblity to the media is rather surprising. For throughout his career in the MEA and as a politician, Mani has enjoyed an easy rapport with reporters. But the recent leaks of crucial information from the petroleum ministry have stemmed some of his enthusiasm for his media friends. But instead of banning the media, wouldnt it be better to simply plug the leaks? 				 																																													Patil, on the other hand, was never a favourite with the media for his tendency to speak a lot without actually saying anything. But now, with non-accredited journalists being denied so much as a pass into the home ministry offices, even friendly officials with the odd juicy bit of news have become off-bounds. As for Nath, he was a friendly sort, open to questions, unless they had anything to do with his personal life. But it seems a recent visit to Brazil has led to a change of heart in the Union commerce minister. Wonder why?				 																																																																														 The housing problem in Lutyenss Delhi is old hat. What gives a special zing to the much-flogged story is the fact that it shows how even the high and mighty of the country are prey to the arbitrariness of the official machinery. The official residence of the chairman of the International Trade Promotion Organization is a well-appointed bungalow in the Pragati Maidan area in the heart of Delhi. But the last occupant of that prized house was Mohammed Younus, at least a decade ago. A few weeks ago, NN Khanna was appointed ITPO boss and one would have thought he would leap at the chance of shifting into the house that came with the post. But no. By a special order, the Union cabinet decreed that Khanna would retain his old accommodation in Rabindra Nagar, facing the Lodhi Gardens. The fact that this means one house less in the housing pool, and some more time spent waiting for several MPs, ministers and bureaucrats didnt seem to have bothered the powers-that-be. They seem equally unbothered about the waste of the crores spent on building the ITPO bungalow.				 																																																																														 Vivek Oberoi is on a high these days. May be it is his career thats going great guns or may be it is the euphoria of having secured the affections of Aishwarya Rai. So when a film-buff pilot on the Agra-Kanpur flight on which both Vivek and his lady love were passengers, asked him to take the controls, our intrepid hero jumped at the chance. But the fair lady was not impressed; perhaps, she valued her life more. Seeing her anxiety, the pilot told her that there was nothing to fear since it was the co-pilot who was in charge, and not Vivek. This time, it was Vivek who was not amused.				 																																																																														 Whats in a name? Plenty, if you ask Om Prakash Chauthala. He wants his late father, Devi Lal, to be included in the holy order  read a list of names which cannot be misused or commercially exploited as per the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950. The schedule attached to the legislation, which is Centrally administered, specifically states the names of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Chhattrapati Shivaji. Sometime ago, the ministry concerned received an unusual request from the government of Haryana, run by Chautala, asking for the addition. The CM apparently fears that the name of his father, who held several ministerial offices, including that of the CM and deputy PM, is as prone to misuse as the listed others. But there might be another gameplan. This is sons way of putting father on the same pedestal as the other greats, and then exploit that status to thrust his political weight with more certainty in the coming assembly polls. Well, thats no less a tribute.

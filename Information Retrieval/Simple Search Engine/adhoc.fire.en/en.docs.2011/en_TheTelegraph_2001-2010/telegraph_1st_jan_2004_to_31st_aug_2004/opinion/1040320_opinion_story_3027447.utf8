The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 20, 2004  Out and About
				 																																	As cricket fever engulfs India this season, South Africans are flying down to make hay while the sun shines. Cricket administrator Dr Ali Bacher, credited with bringing South African cricket out of the wilderness, will visit India to launch his biography worldwide this April. Ali: The Life of Dr Ali Bacher, published by Penguin Books, has a foreword by Nelson Mandela. Former player and commentator Ravi Shastri will release the book on April 10 in Mumbai. Written by Rodney Hartman, the authorised biography will look at Bachers life as a cricketer and administrator. Wonder why India has to be the host to the launch. Whatever happened to the Protean passion for the game?Shakira Shakira				 																																	After her first album Laundry Service surfed to the top of every chart, Shakira the Columbian singer has stopped washing her linen in public. Now, behind closed doors, she holds literary (eh?) discussions with compatriot and Nobel prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Quite a leap, for both, one must say. It all started when Marquez had gone for an hour-long interview with the belly-dancing singer. The interview stretched to five hours. Over what, we have yet to know. But Shakiras autobiographical DVD, expected to be out this month, features Marquez as a friend she cherishes. At least we know now that the author is not destined for years of solitude. Alyque Padamsee				 																																	 Alyque Padamsee wont take it lying down. The ad-man is planning to launch a play titled P Dialogues in response to Eve Enslers Vagina Monologues. Padam-see says he planned to strike back because he thought men were being slapped down in Enslers play. But, unlike the V-play, which has an all-woman cast, the P-play will have three women actors. Ah, men!

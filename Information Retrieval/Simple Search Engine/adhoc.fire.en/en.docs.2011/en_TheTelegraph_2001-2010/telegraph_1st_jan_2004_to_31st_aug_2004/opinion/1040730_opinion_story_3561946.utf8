The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 30, 2004 							 																						COPY WITH CARE				 	 Between those lines																														A royal copyright battle is brewing between Macmillans best-selling author, Shiv Khera, and a retired railway bureaucrat, Amrit Lal, who has alleged that Khera has lifted sentences verbatim from his book, India: Enough is Enough, and used them in his book, Freedom Is Not Free. From what has been reported, there is enough prima facie evidence that Khera has indeed lifted sentences and used them in his book. In fact, he has also belatedly acknowledged doing so, saying that his stories and anecdotes come from many sources whose copyright owners couldnt be traced and giving notice to those whom we knew escaped my notice.																														Cut and paste is a fairly common Indian practice among academics doing doctoral work or down-market publishers of guide books who get by because of inadequate policing or because most publishers dont want to get into the hassles of copyright violations or piracy of books. Under the Copyright Act, 2004 these are registered as criminal acts which means the police gets involved, and publishers have learnt to keep away from them and their demands. Besides, cases drag on for years and in the end, there is very little by way of compensation for the loss of sales, and the time and money spent.																														The copyright law exists to protect creators of original works. It protects the writing unequivocally and recognizes the author as its owner and grants him all the rights, benefits and privileges that come with ownership. With a few exceptions, an author enjoys copyright protection for his lifetime plus fifty years. But titles, ideas and facts cannot be copyrighted or protected. These are public things and can be used by anyone without seeking permission.																														But in the Khera versus Lal case there is a more tricky question. How many words or sentences can be used without the authors or publishers permission? The law isnt very clear on this but the general practice is that permission should be taken and acknowledged for everything that the author has expressed in words and sentences. Aside from minimum courtesy, anything around 500 sentences or words in continuous prose should require permission from the author and the payment of copyright fees. Authors and publishers tend to get around this requirement by breaking up sentences with ellipsis, but this is a sleight of hand to get around legal hassles. 																														Given the pressures of day-to-day work, it is very difficult for editors to spot the stolen sentences. Most publishers trust their authors to submit an original work and indicate, if required, who or where to take permission from. If authors betray this trust, there is always a clause in the contract that says that they will be held responsible for any violation of copyright law.																														There is little doubt that Khera has lifted some sentences or shuffled words around to express the same ideas. This is a pity because the sentences are not elegant and the ideas banal, to say the least. He could have reworked the sentences to express the same ideas. Khera now shows up not as a New Age Guru but as some sort of a hack who has made a very common bureaucrat a little richer through either an out-of-court settlement or a legal battle. Of course it also shows up our public intellectuals who go around telling a gullible public how You Can Win if you ignore the rules of the game.						RAVI VYAS

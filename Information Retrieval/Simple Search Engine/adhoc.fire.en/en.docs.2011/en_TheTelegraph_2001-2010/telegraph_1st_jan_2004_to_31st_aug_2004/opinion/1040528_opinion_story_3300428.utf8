The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						PROMISED SEVEN																														There are no rules as to how hard the bargaining in a coalition should be. The United Progressive Alliance has set a precedent of sorts, if only by displaying openly how the joints creak and grate before the machinery is ready for work. Portfolios were the sticking point even some time after the swearing-in had taken place, and the theatrical little eruptions by the likes of Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mr Ram Vilas Paswan had been taken in stride when the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam decided to take the clock back a little. It had not been given the portfolios that it had been promised. The DMK leader, Mr M. Karunanidhi, reiterated with gentle menace that the secular coalition and the DMKs support to it were not in doubt, but the new DMK ministers would not take office until the promised ministries had been given. Embarrassingly for the Congress, Mr Karunanidhi had a letter by a Congressman to back up his list of promised portfolios. The Congress, trying to learn its first lessons in coalition gymnastics in record time, needed not only to project an image of stability for the UPA but also to convince its partners that it is not its intention to act unilaterally. Shipping, allocated to the Telengana Rashtra Samiti member of parliament, Mr K. Chandrashekhar Rao, should have gone, according to the earlier agreement, to Mr T.R. Baalu, who had been given surface transport and roadways. Mr Rao stepped down before the DMK was satisfied. And it is clear from Mr Raos renunciation rhetoric that he will call in his debt  formation of the Telengana state  when the time comes. Of the other two dissatisfactions, one has been palliated and Mr Karunanidhi has magnanimously declared himself satisfied for the moment.																														The questions raised by this mess are hard ones, and will have to be addressed systematically if India is to grow used to coalition rule. The DMK might feel that budging from its position, even though it had seven ministries, would give the wrong signals about power equations within the coalition. Cooperation is not a desired value in politics. But nothing is uglier than the spectacle of one party pushing another to a corner, with whatever smooth sophistication of manner. Each party in a coalition wants substantial ministries, and must speak reassuringly to its constituencies at the same time. First, though, it has to be asked at what point agreements about sharing the cake are to be made, by whom and in what manner. It is strange that the DMK should have a letter to show. Since so much of coalition formation depends on bargaining, perhaps a few rules of the game would be helpful.

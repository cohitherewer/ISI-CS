		 Sunday, June 06, 2004 							 																						WITH RESPECT TO THE ELDERSThere is a good case to do away with the Rajya Sabha in its present form and think of a 
different kind of upper house to fulfil a different purposeThe number of times the Supreme Court has had to defend the core values of the Constitution and Indian democracy are too innumerable to be listed. The primary function of the apex court is to sit on judgment on cases in which a breach of the law is involved. Yet, it has had to expand its role and intervene in areas where the executive and legislature have failed to fulfil the functions that are rightfully theirs. The most recent example of this is the sharp question the Supreme Court put before the Rajya Sabha, which has a number of members who have been elected from states to which they do not belong. The court stayed elections to the upper house because of this unconstitutional practice. The courts judgment cannot be faulted, as the violation of the domicile clause as embodied in the 2003 amendment to the Representation of the People Act is nothing more than a piece of political chicanery to which the high and mighty of India, including the present prime minister, are accomplices. The courts verdict provides an occasion to look into the anomalous position of the Rajya Sabha  and these anomalies are embedded in the very idea of a house of elders.																														The Rajya Sabha is the outcome of a bizarre compromise. It is derived as an idea from the House of Lords in Westminster. The upper house in Great Britain exists because of the supreme paradox of a democracy whose head of state is a hereditary monarch. The House of Lords represents the interests of the Crown. It was impossible to completely replicate this in India since independent India was born as a republic. The founding fathers thus married to the Westminster model a feature of the constitution of the United States of America. Like the Senate in the US, the Rajya Sabha is supposed to articulate the interests of the states. But while the Senate consists of two members from each state, the Rajya Sabha is formed through a complicated system of proportional representation of the numbers in the Bidhan Sabhas. Moreover, the Rajya Sabha enjoys no substantial powers while the US Senate does. The Rajya Sabha cannot even veto anything that has been passed by the Lok Sabha. It is difficult to establish a strong raison d tre for the Rajya Sabhas existence.																														Whatever justification the Rajya Sabha had for its existence has been eroded by the 2003 amendment which removed the requirement of domicile for candidates seeking election to the Rajya Sabha. It is doubtful if a person resident in Delhi can express the interests of, say, Assam or Gujarat or any other state. The Rajya Sabha now provides a space for loyalists to be rewarded when they cannot themselves be elected to the Lok Sabha. It is a vehicle for doling out patronage. In other words, it no longer serves its original purpose. Without the domicile clause the Rajya Sabha is a misnomer. Given the present abuse and inherent anomalies in the very idea of a house of elders, there is a good case to do away with the Rajya Sabha and to think of a different kind of upper house formed on different premises and to fulfil different purposes.

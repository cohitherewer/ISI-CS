The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 12, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Living as an unknown womanThe first promise (Orient Longman, Rs 395) by Ashapurna Debi is Indira Chowdhurys translation of the Bengali classic, Pratham Pratisruti (1964), the first of an intergenerational trilogy documenting Bengals complex entry into the modern world. First Promise is set in late 18th and early 19th century rural Bengal and Calcutta, and begins with the child-bride, Satyabati, although we are given a glimpse at the very beginning of the novel of her daughters and grand-daughter  a female bloodline that will run through the trilogy and its depiction of history. The authors preface calls this history restless, clamorous, but chooses to see it being lived out, and made, in a mute, domestic space...from which flows forth the changing colours of a community, an age, and peoples mentalities. Ashapurna describes her heroine as an unknown woman who was among those who carved out the etchings of a promise from within those ignored interior spaces of Bengal. This is a careful translation with a substantial scholarly introduction and glossary.Inner voices: stories (Penguin, Rs 200) by Kishori Charan Das is Phyllis Granoffs excellent translation of a set of remarkably sharp and modern stories by this Sahitya-Akademi-winning contemporary Oriya fiction-writer. The English retains the crisp, colloquial flavour of everyday middle-class parole, and this slim volume  minimally, but elegantly introduced  offers a series of trenchant glimpses into the treacheries of the human heart. But what she had always noticed was the left eye that kept twitching, as if it wanted both to announce to the world the childs miserable state and lay the blame for it on all and sundry. Tell me, why did you bring me into this world? If you dont tell me, I wont drink my milk. This is very good prose, and not translationese. Secret empire: eisenhower, the cia, and the hidden story of americas space espionage (Simon amp; Schuster, $ 10.65) by Philip Taubman is the story of Eisenhowers scientists, engineers, businessmen and government officials, who invented the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes and the first reconnaissance satellites that revolutionized American spying during the Cold War. They also made possible the space-based mapping, communications and targeting systems used in the Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The writer is a New York Times reporter and uses a number of governmental and oral history archives to reconstruct a crucial period in American history, when the world seemed to be racing toward catastrophe.

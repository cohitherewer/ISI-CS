The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 01, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 For the Congress, Manmohan Singh is in the prime ministers office and Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath, and alls right with the world. Or at least that is the impression the party would like to present to the world. But since in politics, reality is often very different from what it seems, the fractures in the we are very happy with two power centres front are, at times, only too apparent. It was staring visitors to the Rajya Sabha in the face the other day when the opposition members started shouting Soren, Manmohan hai hai and the Congress MPs remained seated, quiet smirks on their faces. Disappointed at not being able to evoke a response from the treasury benches, the protesters changed tack. Soren, Sonia hai hai, was their new slogan. There was an immediate reaction, all the Congressmen  to a man  were on their feet and advancing menacingly towards the slogan-shouters. For those who havent got the message  actions speak far louder than words.				 																																																																														 This is a tale of two Kashmiri Congressmen  one the Union urban development minister and the other, a die-hard Nehru-Gandhi loyalist now out of favour with the family. To wit, Ghulam Nabi Azad and ML Fotedar. Needless to say, there is no love lost between the two. Even so, it did come as a surprise when, almost immediately after Azad took over the ministry that decides on house allotment matters in Lutyens Delhi, notice was sent to Fotedar, asking him to move out of the house on 5, Balwant Rai Mehta Lane. This had been Fotedars address since 1996 and though it had twice been allotted to others when he lost his seat in parliament, he continued to occupy the sprawling bungalow  even through the Vajpayee years. So one would have thought Fotedar would turn to his powerful connections, do something, anything, to hang on to the house. But no sooner did he get the eviction orders than he moved out and into his own house in Gurgaon. But not before he called at 10 Janpath to hand over some important Nehru-Gandhi family documents that had been with him for a long time to Sonia Gandhi, who had poured cold water on his dreams of returning to the upper house. He even called on Azad, and rumour has it that he told him Dosti ka haq ada karne ke liye shukriya. Someone should tell Fotedar that the martyr act will get him nowhere.				 																																																																														 Being thrown out of power is not a nice feeling, but top leaders of the BJP seem to have reconciled themselves to the situation quite fast and rather well. Most of them have reverted to their original careers. Atal Bihari Vajpayee is back to writing poetry (he may not get the same fawning audience though). Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad have donned their black gowns again, and are reportedly, raking in the moolah. Those like LK Advani, Pramod Mahajan, Murli Manohar Joshi and M Venkaiah Naidu, who have never done anything but politics, are doing more of the same wheeling and dealing. Its only left to a few like Shahnawaz Hussain to rue the lack of visitors to their residence and to call up TV channels asking if they would care to carry his sound bytes.				 																																																																														 Manmohan Singh made an important statement with the directive that his photographs should not be put up on the walls in government offices. But what to do with the photographs of his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, that are already up there? Tens of thousands of rupees were spent on acquiring scores of framed largish pictures of the ex-PM and it would be a shame if they were simply taken off and junked in a dusty attic. A senior bureaucrat suggested that they may be gifted to the man himself or his party. But, all things considered, will the BJP be interested in these relics of happy times in these not-so-happy times?				 																																																																														 The (half-a-dozen) ministers from Tamil Nadu are faced with a peculiar problem. Its been two months since they assumed office, but they are yet to have a private secretary. Not for want of trying. CVs have been invited and names shortlisted, but they havent got anywhere because they cant, or wont, approach J Jayalalithaa, to release officers in the state cadre. The officers themselves wont do anything, fearing ammas ire at this show of loyalty to the DMK. The ministers could fall back on officers of the Tamil cadre already serving in the capital, but even they are not very keen  what if the UPA falls? 				 																																																																														 Controversy may have its downsides, but it has some advantages as well  so Amarinder Singh is discovering. By general consensus, he should have lost his job following the SYL imbroglio. But the Punjab chief minister has no such fears because he knows that none of his detractors would like to step into his shoes if that meant reversing the controversial assembly resolution on water-sharing. Which is why Amarinder can tell 10 Janpath where to get off. 				 																																																																														 The BJP went all out to draft actors and others from showbiz into the party, especially before the last elections. The gambit worked and many of the glamour brigade even went on to win. But the saffron party does not seem to have reckoned with the stars legendary vanity. The BJP bigwigs will be horrified to know that Dharmendra, who won the Bikaner seat on a party ticket, has been telling people that politics and saffron ideology be damned, the only thing he listens to is his dil ki awaaz. It was an RJD MP coming up to the veteran actor in parliament and telling him what a great fan he was and how as a young man he had seen all his films that brought on this realization. You have a reputation of fighting injustice, so why have you joined the BJP? Your fans in Bihar are very upset, the legislator apparently told him. Stumped, the actor, who is also called Garam Dharam, did not say anything right then. But he hunted out his admirer the next day and answered him with this ringing declamation that would not be out of place in one of his films, Aage bhi apni dil ki awaaz hi sunoonga.

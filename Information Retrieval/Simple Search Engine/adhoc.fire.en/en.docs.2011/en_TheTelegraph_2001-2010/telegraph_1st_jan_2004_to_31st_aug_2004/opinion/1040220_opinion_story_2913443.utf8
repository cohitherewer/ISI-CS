		 Friday, February 20, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Let your inner child out to playReading lolita in tehran: a memoir in books (Fourth Estate, 4.99) by Azar Nafisi intertwines literary reflections, autobiography and history to depict the lives of a number of women in the Iran of the late Nineties. This is when Nafisi and seven young women  her former students  gathered at her house every Thursday to discuss forbidden works of Western literature. Here she selects Lolita, The Great Gatsby, Jamess Daisy Miller and Washington Square and the Jane Austen classics. She also goes back to the early days of the revolution when she started teaching at the university of Tehran, from where she had been expelled for refusing to wear the veil. Reaching for a pastry, Mitra says that something has been bothering her for some time. Why is it that stories like Lolita and Madame Bovary  stories that are so sad, so tragic  make us happy? Is it not sinful to feel pleasure when reading about something so terrible? Would we feel this way if we were to read about it in the newspapers or if it happened to us? If we were to write about our lives here in the Islamic Republic of Iran, should we make our readers happy? The well-being journal: drawing upon your inner power to heal yourself by Lucia Capacchione and be the parent your child deserves by Rae Turnbull (Penguin, Rs 250 and Rs 325) prove how Indian readers look towards the trans-Atlantic Arts of Life, and are willing to pay considerable sums of money for a slim little book that would teach them how to inculcate the right values in their children or to achieve psychic well-being. Capacchione teaches you how to listen to your body, nurture yourself, let your Inner Child out to play, discover the healing power of dreams, and so on. Even if it didnt work for Bridget Jones, it might just work for you. Turnbull  veteran educator, parent and master teacher  is of a sterner stuff: We have forgotten our primary parental responsibility: It is to teach. (her italics) She takes the reader through a ten-stage journey, where the stages have names like Take the Time, Be the Guide, Show the Way and Find the Good. There is a section called How can you tame televisions power? Unquiet worlds: dalit voices and visions (Heinrich Bll Foundation, price not mentioned) edited by Mukul Sharma is a collection of articles presented at a workshop of the Heinrich Bll Foundation at Berlin in 2003. It brings to the fore Dalit issues and struggles, addressing questions of Dalit exclusion and identity. It also explores their ambiguous and contradictory relationship with globalization and Hindu communalism. Present tense: living on the edge (Roli, Rs 195) is the fruit of a writers retreat in Mussoorie and Landour, organized by Namita Gokhale and the publishers. It brings together politicians, a film-director, a general, a war-reporter, a painter and a sociologist, among others, and several media persons. They write about ethnic identity, riots, alienation, anger and fears.  A variety of absences: the collected memoirs of dom moraes (Penguin, Rs 599) brings together Gone Away: An Indian Journal, My Sons Father and Never at Home by this poet and journalist. They tell of early fame, addictions, strange exiles and difficult loves. Gone Away was praised by E.M. Forster, and My Sons Father called a minor classic by Stephen Spender. I was very pleased, in spite of the qualifying adjective: after all, we couldnt all be Homer and Shakespeare. I sowed my wild oats/ Before I was twenty/ Drunkards and turncoats/ I knew in plenty/ Most friends, betrayed me/ Each new affair/ Further delayed me./ I did not care.

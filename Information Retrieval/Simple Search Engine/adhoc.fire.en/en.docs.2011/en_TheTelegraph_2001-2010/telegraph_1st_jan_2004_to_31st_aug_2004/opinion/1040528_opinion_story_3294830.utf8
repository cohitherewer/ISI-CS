		 Friday, May 28, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																King Lear was old and tiredTaking charge of our bodies: A health handbook for women (Penguin, Rs 500) by Veena Shatrugna, Gita Ramasw- amy and Srividya Natarajan is an excellent resource for Indian women who can read English and afford this book. It grew out of the collective health activism, based in Hyderabad, of a group of women, and the enthusiastic local response to their Telugu translation of the Boston Womens Health Book Collective, Our Bodies Ourselves (1971). This book, although solidly based on information, is driven by a feminist critique of mainstream medicine, summed up in this question raised in the preface: What would the healthcare system look like if it were able to understand the complexity of a womans life and respond accordingly? There are sections on nutrition and exercise, sexuality, birth control, pregnancy, menopause, cancer, common gynaecological problems and intervention, that encourage women to understand and talk about their bodies without embarrassment, prejudice, fear and other kinds of negative conditioning. There are excellent sections on masturbation, lesbianism and mental health (particularly, depression), that are lucid, non-judgmental and adapted to Indian realities and constraints (even while suggesting ways of challenging these constraints). This book should be translated into the Indian languages and cost less.Lazy bones (TimeWarner, 3.25) by Mark Billingham is a grisly British thriller by a TV writer and stand-up comedian, in which Detective Inspector Thorne has to investigate a series of murders of sexual offenders just released from jail. Grubby hotels, smoky pubs, garish brothels and sleazy sex clubs provide the settings for this violent and unevenly written novel. Billinghams other books are called Sleepyhead and Scaredy Cat.The matchbox: selected stories of Ashapurna Debi (Rupa, Rs 195) translated by Monabi Mitra collects wonderful depictions of urban middle-class everyday life, primarily from the points of view of a series of interesting women. The translation is a trifle heavy-handed, but carried out with a sincere engagement with the tone of the writers compassionate realism. There is a longish introduction with the unfortunate sentence, Ashapurna Debi described her mother as being a voracious reader with an unquenchable thirst for reading. This is a good example of the infelicities of Mitras translationese.Kashmir: The untold story (Penguin, Rs 250) by Humra Quraishi is a free-lance journalists attempt to document what the Kashmiri people have stopped talking about  the extent to which everyday life in their valley has become a struggle, at times an impossible one: the changing nature of family and faith and intercommunity relationships in the Valley, and the growing civic problems. It ends with Chomskys vision of how the Kashmir problem is to be solved: Two principles are to be involved  the voice of the people has to be heard and also the UNs call for a referendum.Beautiful stories from Shakespeare (Rupa, Rs 95) retold by E. Nesbit is a charming set of retellings, first published in 1907, by this socialist, Fabian and writer, whose Railway Children and Treasure Seekers are classics of childrens literature. Nesbit breezes through even the most problematic of the problem plays (Hamlet, Measure for Measure, Timon), and Max Bihns charming sketches evoke the world of turn-of-the-century private theatricals and childrens costume-parties. Heres Othello, chained and cross-hatched: His love was a terrible selfishness. To love a woman meant with him to possess her as absolutely as he possessed something that did not live and think.

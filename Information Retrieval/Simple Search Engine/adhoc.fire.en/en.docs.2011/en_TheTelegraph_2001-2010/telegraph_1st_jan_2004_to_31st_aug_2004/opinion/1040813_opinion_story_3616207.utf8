		 Friday, August 13, 2004 							 																						LIVING WITH WARThe Sarai Reader 04: Crisis/Media Sarai Media Lab, Rs 295																					A recent exhibition by the celebrated French photographer, Luc Delahaye (picture), at the Huis Marseille in Amsterdam framed war. On display were pictures taken in Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine. What made the exhibited works so arresting, however, was not the sheer destruction captured on film, but the monumental size of the prints and the genius of the compositions. Delahaye communicated a profound stillness through his photographs, despite their subject matter, which is the havoc caused by political, ethnic and religious conflict. Evidently he sought to take the worst crises of our times beyond their transience as mere media events, into the realm of History.																					Two photos stood out particularly. One, of Slobodan Milosevic on trial, where the author of countless war crimes sits, suit-clad, in perhaps the most media-rich space in the legal world, every word of his unspeakable testimony being recorded, digitized, translated and transmitted. The lives lost to genocide went undocumented, but the rationalizations of the Butcher of the Balkans are made available in real-time and archived down to the goriest detail. Delahayes unforgettable courtroom reveals all this in a flash. 																					The other striking image was of Jenin, the Arab refugee camp levelled in 2002 by Israeli forces. The chaotic demolition site in Delahayes photograph lies between distressed figures in the foreground, and a calm horizon of green fields and blue sky in the far distance undisturbed by the suffering of people. Every scale of History is captured in a single panorama: the immediacy of war and the permanence of society, the evanescence of things human and the perennial presence of nature. In Delahayes vision, Jenin is what the Italian philosopher, Giorgio Agamben, calls irreparable: it is what it is, embodying the givenness of life and death, both held before us in a clear, even light.																					The 2004 Reader produced by Sarai, a New Media initiative based at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, is devoted to the dual themes of crisis reporting in the media, and the crisis within the media when it comes to reportage of violence. Like Delahaye, Sarais editorial collective, based in New Delhi and Amsterdam, is concerned to preserve the everydayness, the continuity, the unsurprising quality of war, which makes the experience of crisis not a singular event to be projected in a hyperbolic vein and then forgotten, but the stuff of daily life for millions of human beings. The difference is that Delahayes vista is vast, his photographic images resembling monumentalist paintings, while Sarais editors are after the untold story, the minute unreported realities of living in the midst of conflict. 																					Contributors to the Reader write from surprising places  cinemas, libraries, law courts, dam sites, art galleries, prison  where people confront fear and gain a modicum of mastery over it. The result is a volume dense with ideas and insights, passionately conceived, if unevenly conveyed, by the 65 contributors.																					As a unique experiment in Indias over-institutionalized academic and activist landscape, Crisis/Media deserves to be widely circulated and, following Sarais laudable agenda of perpetual dissent, thoroughly criticized. A full-scale public discussion of crisis reporting within the media and the crisis of the media is the only way to combat the speedy descent of the Indian print and broadcast media into the pit of poor writing, bad reporting, weak analysis, gimmickry, corruption and outright misrepresentation.

		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 							 																						GETTING THE ESTIMATES RIGHT						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the assessment at the 27th session of the Committee on World Food Security, 2001				 	 More is better																														The relationship between the benchmark indicator and international cereal prices has not always been consistent. During the 1979-80 and 1988-89 periods when the ratio was substantially above the 17-18 per cent minimum range, international cereal prices rose and remained high. This was despite the availability of adequate physical supplies																														Moreover, a substantial revision was made recently to the historical cereal balances for China. The revision resulted in a significant increase in the estimates for cereal stocks in China and hence the world estimate of cereal stocks. This development further undermined the relevance of the benchmark ratio as an indicator of the status of global food security. While the continued use of a benchmark ratio would be possible by re-calculating a new minimum safe range using the revised Chinese cereal stocks and the original methodology, this may not be appropriate...In light of the changes in the international cereals market reflecting increasing transparency in policies and market signals, improved communications and more efficient movement of commodities in international trade, the Secretariat recognizes the need to develop more market sensitive indicators to assess the changes in the factors that affect global food security...																														Selection and monitoring of core indicators: For purposes of cross-country comparison and to provide a manageable dataset for monitoring progress towards the goals established during the World Food Summit at the global level, the CFS at its 26th session, reviewed a core indicator list representing a pool of variables that are currently assumed to be most closely related to food security, nutrition and vulnerability...																														The different conceptual backgrounds of the indicator lists are reflected by varying priorities given to the information modules. Nevertheless, some indicators are suggested by both United Nations-system lists and at least one of the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping Systems-related lists, which show a high degree of inter-agency agreement. It may be noted that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-list does not currently include any indicators that refer explicitly to the World Food Summit, although several of those included for monitoring other global developmental goals, particularly those of the Social Summit, are very relevant...The UN Millennium Summit of September 2000 already also has as its principal goal: to halve by the year 2015, the proportion of the worlds population whose income is less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger.																														An important factor constraining the selection of indicators to be monitored regularly by CFS is the non-availability of...relevant data... CONCLUDED

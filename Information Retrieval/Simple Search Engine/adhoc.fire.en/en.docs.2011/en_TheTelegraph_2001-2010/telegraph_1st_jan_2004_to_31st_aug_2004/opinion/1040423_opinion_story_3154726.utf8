		 Friday, April 23, 2004 							 																						HERE LIES CHAIRMAN MAO Neha Sahay																					Commerce may be the driving force behind the Mao bazaar set up outside the Mao Mausoleum in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, but pure feeling drives those who throng it. The sight of an old woman dressed in a traditional jacket and loose trousers, buying a heart-shaped locket with a picture of the Great Helmsman inside, more than made up for the instinctive repulsion at the first sight of the bazaar. Maos face adorns not just badges, medallions and little wall-hangings, but also clocks, watches, temperature recorders, and even tea boxes, cigarette packs, and bourgeois accessories like cuff-links and tie-pins. Hardly any of the hundreds streaming out of the Mausoleum walk away without buying something, with prices ranging from 10 yuan to 198 yuan  the last for the commemorative pictorial volume brought out on Maos 110th birth anniversary.																					For a song																					The knick-knacks are a hit; his writings, some of which are even printed on T-shirts, have few takers. Perhaps the ultimate insult to the chairman is his Red Book (with an English translation), being peddled on the streets. A persistent vendor quotes a price of 100 yuan and within a minute, brings it down on her own to 30. Soon its 20 and its only because the buyer feels it demeaning to Maos memory to bargain or pay less than that for his famous Quotations, that the price doesnt scale down to 10 yuan.																					Maos giant portrait still dominates Tiananmen Square, but this is not a case of Big Brother watching, as Westerners would have us believe. The first sight of the long line of Chinese waiting to go inside the Mausoleum where Maos body (or a wax mummy?) has been kept on display since his death in 1976, gives you some idea of the respect he still commands among the ordinary Chinese. Once you join that line, you know it for sure. 																					The urban Chinese no longer has the patience to wait in queues; in buses, planes or at immigration counters at exit points from the mainland into special territories Macao and Hong Kong, you find yourself trailing behind people who dont think twice before overtaking you. But outside Maos Mausoleum, the queue is orderly. Hundreds of Chinese stand four abreast for at least an hour to go inside in small batches. No cameras, foodstuffs, or handbags are allowed in, but theres no place to deposit these either. You either leave them with one of your group who stays outside, or go back the next day unencumbered, or simply hide everything under a bulky jacket.																					Pilgrims progress																					Perhaps one reason for the orderly queue outside the Mausoleum is the presence of securitymen as well as tour guides. Perhaps its the voice over the mike continuously welcoming and instructing you on the dos and donts; perhaps the kind of people who queue up have been used to doing so. Many of them have lived through the Mao era, when queues for rations were common; most are obviously from the interior, where everything isnt quite as abundantly available as in the big cities.																					The mood in the long queue outside (the Mausoleum is only open from 8.30 to 11.30 am) is gay, like that among Indian villagers for whom Rajghat is a must when they make their once-in-a-lifetime trip to the capital. 																					In the compound of the Mausoleum, theres a rush for bouquets of fake flowers selling at 1 yuan each. Another yuan is kept ready for the Mausoleum brochure as you climb up the steps. Its only as you step into the corridor outside the main room that the atmosphere changes. Written instructions to take off your hat and keep silent set the mood, and even the sight of the lovingly bought flowers being roughly pressed down into a coffin-shaped container doesnt provoke complaints. Crying babies are hushed as you finally file into the room, but though you can clearly see Maos face (the rest of the body is covered with the Red flag) , theres no time to linger, the queue must keep moving. Before you know it, the long-awaited pilgrimage is over. As you exit, still trying to come to terms with the thought that you actually saw Mao, you find yourself in the midst of the Mao bazaar. From the sublime to the ridiculous.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 							 																						CAUGHT IN THE DEBT TRAP Gyan Pathak																					The Andhra Pradesh governments hasty announcement of the relief package for farmers may prove an extra burden not only for the government, which is facing a financial crunch, but also for the farmers themselves. The 13-crore strong farming community of this country has been undergoing hardships not only owing to the vagaries of nature, but also because of the injustices inherent in the system. Their sufferings can be gauged from the high incidence of suicides among farmers all over India. In the past three years, around 3,000 farmers have committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh alone. The suicides continue even after the new governments promises. The situation is worse among agricultural labourers.																					Most of the farmers who commit suicide are heavily indebted. The common minimum programme, armed with this knowledge, read: The UPA government will ensure that the flow of rural credit is doubled in the next three years and that the coverage of small and marginal farmers by institutional lending is expanded substantially. The delivery system for rural credit will be reviewed. Immediate steps will be taken to ease the burden of debt and high interest of rates on farm loans. 																					But while announcing the relief package, the government ignored the promise for steps to ease the burden of debt and high interest rates on farm loans, which are a major cause of woe. 																					High rates																					For farmers, the problem is not the lack of loans, but the exorbitant interest rates on the loans they receive. Farm loans do not come at less than an interest rate of 10 to 11 per cent charged by banks despite the fact that the National Democratic Alliance government at the fag end of its tenure assured farmers less than 9 per cent interest rate through the NABARD (amendment) bill. Lowering of interest rates, even to this level, was a great relief. But until the latter half of 2003, banks were charging between 14 and 18 per cent interest from farmers. This was even higher than the prime lending rates for many industries.																					The whole package for farmers may be seen as a debt-swapping mechanism which will be profitable for big farmers. Despite the injustice in the interest rates, they may be able to pay back the banks at rates ranging from 11 to 18 per cent. The question is why should banks be allowed to charge such inequitable rates to farmers who have taken loans before the end of 2003?																					Limited appeal																					It is strange that this package should be viewed as a populist measure. The government has been blamed for interfering with the present market-driven interest rates. In fact, P. Chidambaram had to deny that the measures taken implied a return to the earlier government-directed lending policy. There are forces trying to create the impression that farmers are getting much more than workers in other sectors of the economy. The reality is otherwise.																					When relief in interest rates was announced last time in August 2003, those who have vested interests were quick to criticize the government for the fear of losing cheap loan money. It was alleged that the government intended to revert back to the controlled interest rate regime. The then finance minister, Jaswant Singh, had to insist that there is no question of reintroducing administered interest rates either through the backdoor, front door or side entrance. Singh admitted that 46.15 per cent of agricultural loans were being given at 12 to 15 per cent interest, and 31.7 per cent loans at the 15 to 18 per cent rate. While 2.54 per cent of the loans were in the range of 18 to 20 per cent interest, 0.82 per cent fell in the above 20 per cent range.																					In this scenario, the United Progressive Alliances decision to recast the debt structure and enhance the credit flow will be profitable only to the government and the big farmers. The scheme cannot benefit small and marginal farmers along with farm workers. This may enhance credit flow to meet the given target by only giving loans to big farmers, whose lands may be a guarantee for safe return of the loan amounts, but the rest will not get their due share.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 05, 2004 							 																						TIME TO PULL THE PLUG Gwynne Dyer																					Mark Kimmit, deputy director of operations for the American occupation forces in Iraq, described the events as a slight uptick in localized engagements. Meanwhile, analysts back in the United States of America compared the pictures from Falluja to footage of dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by cheering crowds in 1993  footage that led directly to the withdrawal of US troops from Somalia. But the Americans were shielded from the real ugliness of the killings in Falluja by their television networks; Arab viewers saw it all.																					True, the murder and mutilation of four American civilian contractors in Falluja really was just a slight uptick in the violence in Iraq. In the previous 48 hours, there were two Britons hurt in violence in Basra, an Iraqi shot at a US checkpoint, an attack on an Iraqi paramilitary recruiting station in Baghdad, a soldier killed near Ramadi, a suicide bomb targeting the home of the police chief in Hilleh, a US Marine killed near Fallujah, several American soldiers wounded in Mosul, 5 more Marines killed by a roadside bomb, and 15 Iraqis wounded by a car bomb in Baquba.																					In other words, the four unfortunate American contractors in Falluja were just another drop in the bucket. It was the manner of their deaths  set on fire, beaten with pipes and mutilated by a cheering crowd who then dragged their charred bodies through the streets and hung them upside down, handless, footless and in one case headless, just above the roadway on the old railway bridge across the Euphrates  that made it so different. That, and the fact that the whole thing was filmed.																					Negative impact																					If American viewers had seen what Arab viewers saw  the obscene enthusiasm of the crowd, the blithe disregard with which local people were driving under the burned American corpses half-an-hour later  then George W. Bush might be having his Mogadishu moment right now. They never will see it, of course, but the question wont go away: at what point will the American public decide that the price is too high and pull the plug on this foreign adventure? They did it on the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Lebanon intervention in the Eighties and the Somalia intervention in the Nineties. They will almost certainly do it on Iraq, too, in the end, but when?																					The unique impact of the Mogadishu footage came not from the indignities inflicted on the American dead, but from the obvious pleasure that the Somali onlookers took in it. There was a whole background story that Americans didnt know  almost a thousand Somalis had been killed by US firepower that day  but the viewers at home took one look and decided that no more Americans should die to help the Somalis. The impact of this videotape from Falluja and of the others that will doubtless follow  for these events will set a new standard for Iraqi resistance fighters to aspire to  could be the same.																					United in hate																					Statistics dont actually mean much to people; pictures mean a lot. Bush has succeeded in persuading a (dwindling) majority of Americans that his Iraq adventure had something to do with fighting terrorism, which is why the public has been so patient with him as the weapons of mass destruction failed to turn up and the Iraqi armed resistance grew. But surely not all of the people in those jeering crowds in Falluja can be terrorists? Is it possible that they really dont want us there? Then why are our kids being sent there to die?																					Its more complicated than that, of course. Falluja has been the supreme stronghold of the resistance from the start of the occupation because of an early massacre of Arab civilians by panicky US troops; most other towns are nowhere near as unanimous in their hatred of the US presence. But distrust of American intentions and resentment at American behaviour run strongly throughout Iraqi society, as indeed they run strongly through the whole Arab world. There will be more videos  and if American voters figure that out before November, then Bush is in serious trouble.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 							 																						PAID FULL TERM																														There is now a new dimension to mothers-in-waiting. The gestational or surrogate mother nurtures the embryo, produced by the biological parents, who will get the child upon delivery. Surrogate motherhood is not entirely new, but it has caught on very recently in India. Over the last two years, there has been a 150 per cent rise in the application of this method, and this has been smoothed by the surrogacy guidelines provided by the Indian Council of Medical Research. The surrogate mother has to be married with children, so that she feels no urge to keep the baby she has nurtured in her womb. A detailed contract has to be signed by the genetic parents on the one side and the surrogate mother and her husband on the other, and the surrogate mothers payment fixed. This can often be anything between one to three lakh rupees.																														The code is temptingly neat, the realities may be slightly more untidy. Any sign of openness towards the wonders of science is good, and the popularity of this unusual intervention in the sphere of something as personal as childbirth should be welcomed. At the same time, a few realities should also be acknowledged. So far, this option is open only to those that can afford it. The medical procedure in specialized clinics and the payment to the surrogate mother add up to a hefty sum. It is a new option for those who have been unable to bring up a child because they do not wish to adopt someone of unknown parentage. Relatives or married women who offer themselves as surrogates do so for money. But it would be silly to deny that the intimately felt physical bond during gestation can be broken without psychological costs. These costs remain invisible. The guidelines ensure the security of the genetic parents by insisting that the surrogate mother be married and, by implication, with her husband living and present. A divorcee or widow, perhaps more in need of money, would not qualify. She might clutch. There is an assumption here of the happy reasonableness of the ideal heterosexual family-set-up. The only way to make an unconventional move socially acceptable is to surround it with conventional family values, even when they are being changed at the very root.

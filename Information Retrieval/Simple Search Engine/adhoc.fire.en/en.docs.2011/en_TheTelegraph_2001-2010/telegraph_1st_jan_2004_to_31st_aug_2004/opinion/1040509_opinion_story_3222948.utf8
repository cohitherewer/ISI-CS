The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 09, 2004 							 																						WHOSE VOTE IS IT ANYWAY?The election results on Thursday will determine more than the composition of the 14th Lok SabhaBy the end of the week that begins today, two sets of people in India would have had their trial by fire. One set is, obviously, composed of the politicians who are contesting elections and will, by Thursday evening, know their fate. The other set consists of the pollsters and psephologists who have, over the last few weeks, been conducting opinion and exit polls, and making all sorts of statistical projections about the composition of the 14th Lok Sabha. The presence of the pollsters has been a little more prominent than in previous elections. One reason for this is an increase in the number of players. Every major television channel has a panel of experts and almost all of them have entered the game of making surveys and making predictions based on the surveys. Someone with faith in exit polls could easily conclude that the results of the general elections are already known even though the last day of the polls is to-morrow. On the other hand, those who retain their scepticism about exit polls and all that jazz will wait until Thursday evening to pronounce their verdict on the science of psephology and the ability of the pollsters. So a little more than the composition of the 14th Lok Sabha will be established by the end of the week.																														But all this should not deflect attention from the real actors in any election: the people who exercise their franchise and make political choices. The results of some elections  1977 and 1984 come readily to mind  leave no doubts about the preferences of the people. But from the Nineties onwards, this has not been the case. The verdict of the people has not provided any one overwhelming message in favour of one party or cause. Increasingly, the verdict has been more and more fractured. This is reflected, most importantly, in the failure of any one party to get beyond the 272 mark in the Lok Sabha. The result has been a series of coalition governments. The results of the ongoing election process do not promise to be any different and this conclusion does not need the support of any pollster or psephologist. It was a foregone conclusion even before the elections began. The question was which coalition. The results will provide the answer.																														One very important factor in the fractured verdict has been the deepening of democracy and the expansion of political society. More and more sections of society, who have been almost passive participants in the democratic experiment, have now become active agents with a genuine sense of empowerment. Their aims and aspirations have found articulation and representation through political parties which are separate from the two major political parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The numbers thrown up by these elections will indicate the future of the smaller political parties. Indian politics from the Fifties to the Nineties had been dominated by the Congress, which was a coalition of various interests and aspirations, a coalition from within. From the late Nineties, the focus has shifted to a different kind of coalition, a coalition from without, known as the National Democratic Alliance. The elections will also determine the fate of these two different forms of coalition.

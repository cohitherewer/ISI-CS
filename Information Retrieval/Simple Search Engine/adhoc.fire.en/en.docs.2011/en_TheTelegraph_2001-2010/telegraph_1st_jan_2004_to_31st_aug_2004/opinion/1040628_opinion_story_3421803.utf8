		 Monday, June 28, 2004 							 																						MAKING THEIR PRESENCE FELT						DOCUMENT From Compromising Our Children: a WWF-UK Chemicals and Health Campaign Briefing, June 2004				 	 Cause for concern																														Hidden dangers: Hazardous man-made chemicals that can interfere with hormone systems and which may affect the intelligence and behaviour of our children occur in many, sometimes, surprisingly familiar places.																														Incinerators, coal and oil power stations, industrial combustion sources, chlorinated chemical factories, metal processing factories, and open burning and accidental fires are all sources of highly toxic chemicals called dioxins and furans. These are only accidentally produced, and arise when chlorinated compounds are incompletely burned. Our intake of dioxins is mainly through food. Particularly elevated levels may occur in food from areas where there are local emission sources, or when contamination of animal feed has occurred.																														Until the Seventies, the electricity and mining industries made extensive use of chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls. Their ability to withstand heat meant that they were widely used as heat transfer fluids in capacitors, transformers and electrical switching gear. They also had some use in fridges, as lubricants, in paints and varnishes, as flame-retardants, in sealing materials in construction, in carbon-less copying paper, and as capacitors in strip lights and motorway lights...																														PCBs are also formed accidentally, and may be released along with dioxins during combustion processes where chlorine is involved. For example, unintentional sources of PCBs and/or dioxins include incinerators, power stations, thermal processes in the metallurgical industry, open waste burning, some chlorinated chemical factories, waste oil refineries, and vehicles burning leaded petrol. Food that may be particularly contaminated with PCBs and dioxins includes fish and fish oils, meat and animal fats, and milk and dairy produce...																														Computers, televisions, furniture, cars, videos, textiles and the like can all contain brominated flame retardant chemicals used to prevent fire starting or rapidly spreading. Preventing deaths from fire is undoubtedly necessary, but alternative methods and approaches are available. Making articles out of less flammable materials in the first place is one option; others are using better thermal barriers in electrical equipment or finding safer chemicals to slow the onset and spread of fire, as well as making better use of smoke alarms, fire escapes and sprinkler systems...																														Some brominated compounds have very similar properties to PCBs. There is a real concern that these chemicals might act together with PCBs to produce additive or synergistic adverse effects...																														Alarmingly, the amount of certain brominated flame retardant chemicals in our bodies has increased dramatically over recent decades...Despite the fact that these chemicals are now found to contaminate both people and wildlife, they are still being produced and released into the environment...																														Apart from dietary intake, airborne dust particles contaminated with brominated flame retardants are probably a significant source of human exposure...																														Many tin can linings, clear plastic re-usable water containers, baby feeding bottles and white dental fillings contain another hazardous chemical called bisphenol A. BPA is produced in high volumes and is the chemical used to make polycarbonate plastic. Low levels have been found in liquids stored in polycarbonate containers. Of particular concern is the leaching from baby feeding bottles that can lead to direct exposure of very young infants. BPA also leaches into food contained in tins lined with an epoxy-resin coating. Exposure to BPA and related substances can also arise from dental fillings and sealants... TO BE CONCLUDED

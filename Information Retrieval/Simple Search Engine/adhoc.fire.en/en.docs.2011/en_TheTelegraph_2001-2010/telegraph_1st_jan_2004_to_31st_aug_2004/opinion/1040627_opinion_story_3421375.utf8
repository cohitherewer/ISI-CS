		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 							 																						COURTING CONFUSIONOnce a sentence has been passed according to an existing law of the land, extra-judicial clemency could undermine the authority of the justice systemAn extreme situation always brings out underlying contradictions. In law, such a situation is provided by the imposition of the death penalty in the countries where it still exists. Each such case revives the debate over death as penalty for an extreme crime, exposing the unresolved philosophical, moral, and ethical questions underlying any legal system. These are necessarily obscured in the day to day working of the judicial process. The discomfort over the death penalty has its source in the fundamental contradictions generated by the very act of creating the law book, for law is societys attempt to impose rationality on the irrational. The arid contortions of legal language enshrine the effort to paint in black and white the universe of desire and action that is really a bewildering grey. Reason and unreason are inextricably intertwined in the human mind. Where does revengefulness stop, for example, and justice begin? 																														But societys aspiration to order requires law to be decisive: it must appear to be impartial, it must know what is right and what is wrong, and exactly what is to be done once a wrong has been proved. The fact that the justice system is arranged in tiers, with the scope for appeal and reconsideration, further reconfirms the sense of fairness that society needs to reassure itself with. The meticulously constructed edifice of justice feeds societys sense of security.																														The passion generated by the case of Dhananjoy Chatterjee has its root in the sudden uncovering of basic issues underlying institutionalized retribution and the functioning of the law. On the one hand is anger and revulsion at the crime, the lack of doubt about the criminals identity, and on the other, the deep discomfort generated by the idea of the states arrogation of the right to kill as punishment. It is precisely the possible equation between public anger and the justice process that makes any such debate even more uncomfortable. But what is notable in this case is that it is not public anger that had decided Chatterjees fate, but the due process of law.																														This needs to be emphasized. The case of the rape and murder of Hetal Parekh went through every single tier of the justice system in India. Courts up to the highest level upheld the death sentence and appeals were rejected. The sudden possibility of clemency from the president at almost the last minute has now stalled what was already an agonizingly long-drawn-out process. This opens up another set of questions, about mercy and justice. But when there is a law of the land, and a sentence has been passed and all conditions of legality fulfilled without any loophole of doubt, then a sudden withdrawal of the sentence by an extra-judicial authority is most likely to undermine the authority of the existent law. In such a situation, mercy could do a disservice to societys perception of the laws authority, and its ability to offer security. Whether or not the death penalty should exist is a different question altogether. It is better to deal with that debate and come up with a firm consensual answer than to dither over the execution of the sentence every time someone steps up to the end of death row. That is the greater cruelty.

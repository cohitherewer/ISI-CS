The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 20, 2004 							 																						SPECIAL CADRE 																														The idea of specialization holds an irresistible attraction in a high-tech age. The Indian government is no longer satisfied with merely toning up the existing bureaucratic set-up, but wishes to have a shiny new generation of bureaucrats glistening with specialized training from the day they leave school. The policy-makers have looked to France for inspiration, and have evidently been encouraged by the prestigious reputation of the schools of administrative training there. The plan now is to introduce an all-India entrance examination for civil services after Class XII for a five-year course in a national academy. The proposal is but newly-hatched; it awaits responses and debate. The actual procedure, if at all it is finalized and implemented, is likely to be less interesting than the attitude revealed. Governance is being seen as a profession and a vocation, like a doctors or a lawyers, and as a matter of intense and focussed education, such as that given in the Indian institutes of technology.																														There is much that is positive in the idea. Professionalization in any sphere leads to efficiency and accountability. But it needs to be asked what kind of professionalism is needed for which kind of work and how early such professional training should begin. There is much to be said for broad-based general education up to the early twenties, especially since there are numerous young people who do not always know their own minds or cannot assess their aptitudes until they have matured into graduation stage. Administration especially requires a large fund of general understanding. To have a specialized entrance test would also devalue the school-leaving examination: instead of ensuring that it comes up to scratch, this merely introduces a new set of papers to sit for. Should the new system be introduced, it would exclude all doctors and lawyers, and all aspirants who have been studying for the present civil services examination. It is up to the policy-makers to see how these disadvantages can be turned into gain. Also, in its present form, the proposal is short on security: for those not successful after three years, the course will merely become a three-year degree in administration with which to face the harsh world of job shortages. Much more thought has to be expended on the proposal if it is to become the first step towards the effective administrative system the government is dreaming of.

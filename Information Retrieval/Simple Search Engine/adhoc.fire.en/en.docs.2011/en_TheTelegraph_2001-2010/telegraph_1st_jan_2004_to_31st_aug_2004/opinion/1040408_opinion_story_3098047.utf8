		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 							 																						HALTING PEACE																														The verdict of the recent election in Sri Lanka is along expected lines. There is, however, reason to be unsure about the future of the peace process and about political stability in the island-state. As had been predicted by pollsters, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance led by the president, Ms Chandrika Kumaratunga, has emerged as the single largest force in parliament, with 105 seats in the 225-member parliament. The new prime minister, Mr Mahinda Rajapakse, is a close lieutenant and a trusted aide of the president. There are, however, genuine reasons to be sceptical about the future of the government. The UPFA is eight seats short of a majority and will have to depend on minor Tamil and Muslim parties, which have their own narrow agenda for survival. Moreover, the UPFA is an alliance between Ms Kumaratungas Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the hardline Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which hardly inspires confidence. In any case, the United National Party, led by the former prime minister, Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, which was voted out of power, still won 82 seats, and will continue to wield influence and to put pressure on the government. In a wider sense, the peace process in Sri Lanka, already under strain, may also be derailed because of the verdict, especially if the stand taken by the various political parties during the campaign continues even after the elections. 																														Clearly, Sinhala disapproval of apparent concessions made to the Tamils has contributed to the defeat of the UNP. The new government cannot be seen as continuing with the policies of the past. Although the new prime minister has sought greater Indian involvement in the islands peace process, this is unlikely to happen. The bitter memory of Indian involvement in Sri Lanka is still fresh, which would prevent any activism on the part of South Block. In any case, the JVP has continuously maintained a hardline stance, and is unlikely to support a soft attitude towards the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Simultaneously, the LTTE has also spilt and divisions within its ranks may not augur well for the cause of peace in the island-state. Be that as it may, it is clear that the co-habitation experience of the past had not worked. The differences between Ms Kumaratunga and Mr Wickremesinghe had almost brought the government to a halt. Having a prime minister and a president from the same party, therefore, may help the cause of good governance. It may also help in giving a measure of economic stability to the island-state. Whether this translates into long-term political stability, however, remains to be seen.

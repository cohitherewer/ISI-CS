The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Information comes at a price				 																																																				Sir  As the party in power that faces an election in a few months time, a publicity blitz from the Bharatiya Janata Party is not unexpected (Feel-good show with Rs 250 cr, Jan 19). This is the information age after all, and it pays to inform. But the utter brazenness of the exercise and the partys profligacy are shocking, as is the Election Commissions mystifying silence. Also, it makes one wonder at the BJPs confidence. Does the party think the voter is so naive that he will get taken in with advertisements  full-page and colour? Does it think that Indians are like the Americans  who will believe anything George W. Bush tells them; that they will agree everything is hunky-dory merely because the BJP tells them that there is a feel-good wind blowing? Does it think that the hype will make them forget to ask how Rs 250 crore can be more profitably used to provide basic facilities for the many deprived citizens, than in projecting a partys trump cards just before the elections?

				 																Capital idea				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guha argues in favour of a market economy (In high disdain, Dec 27). Intellectuals, academicians and those of their ilk have a habit of changing tune to keep up with changing political orthodoxies. The present market order is a reincarnation of the laissez faire that many Western countries abandoned after the great depression of the Thirties. The collapse of the Soviet Union further facilitated the transition to the market economy. 				 																																																				But a market economy has its pitfalls. Once the two most developed nations in the world, the United States of America and Japan are now in the grip of a recession. Modern macro-economics of the West is based on the Keynesian theory, which is centred around full employment, the only benchmark of prosperity. Full employment and a good growth rate may seem synonymous, but Indias recent experience exposes that as a myth. The 10th plan data reveals just how alarming the unemployment situation in India is becoming. In the circumstances, it is doubtful whether the 8 per cent growth target for this plan period can be achieved. 				 																																																				Globalization has also increased inequality, both between countries and within countries. It has led to the concentration of income in the hands of a few multinationals. Most of the worlds largest economic entities today are MNCs, not nations. Unfortunately, all such contentious issues are being ignored by our politicians. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  A market economy may not be the best option, but it is better than the others available to fulfil peoples aspirations and produce results. Seventy years of communism later, the gross domestic product of the former Soviet Union was not even one-fifth that of the US. And the GDP of socialist North Korea is one-third that of capitalist South Korea. The figures speak for themselves, dont they?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guha does well to remind us of the follies of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehrus misguided fear of business resulted in the rather myopic policies being followed in our country since the Fifties. The public sector, which he gave so much importance to, has become a millstone round the neck of the Indian economy. So has the policy of import substitution that was preferred over export promotion. Manmohan Singh did a good job of putting the economy back on track with his liberalization policies. There should no longer be any doubt in the minds of economists and politicians about the need for a free market. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Nightmare stretch				 																																																				Sir  The stretch of pavement from Birla Mandir to Gurusaday Road is a very serious safety hazard for pedestrians. Construction agencies have dug up the footpath and there are mounds of stone and mud, leaving no room for pedestrians. Concrete slabs lie on the pavement, beside 4 -5 feet deep open craters, with iron reinforcement bars jutting out. Pedestrians have to walk over them or on the road, which is just wide enough for one bus. A slip would be fatal, especially for schoolchildren and the old.				 																																																				This area is busy, with a number of schools and offices in the vicinity. The companies carrying out the construction work should show more concern for the lives of citizens and go about their work in a more organized and sensible manner. I twisted my foot today while going to office at Sunny Towers; a lady fell down and was rendered unconscious this afternoon. I was witness to these two incidents but I am sure there are many more happening.				 																																																				People can bear with inconvenience, but the safety of the people cannot be put at risk for a better tomorrow or any other reason. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, popularly known as VIP Road, is deteriorating day by day. The stretch after Kestopur is especially bad. Garbage is dumped on both sides of the road, which soon starts to emit a foul smell. Traffic jams are a regular affair, slowing down vehicular traffic considerably. Being the citys only connecting link to the airport, VIP Road is what visitors who fly into Calcutta see first. It is surprising that the chief minister, who wants outsiders to invest in the state, has not looked into this issue.

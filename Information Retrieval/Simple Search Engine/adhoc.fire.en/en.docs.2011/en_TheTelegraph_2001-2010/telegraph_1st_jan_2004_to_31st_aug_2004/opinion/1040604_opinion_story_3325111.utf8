The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 04, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Serial killers and screwdriversVodka (HarperCollins, 12) by Boris Starling is a very fat and large thriller set in Moscow after the fall of the Soviet Union: the great city hanging suspended in all its contradictions: halfway between day and night, past and future, east and west, sanity and madness, picturesque and squalid, good and evil. In this mafia-infested chaos, a series of bodies of dead children are found in the city. This could be part of a revenge against Lev, the ruthless and charismatic director of Russias most famous vodka distillery, Red October. His adversary  or ally?  is Alice Liddell, an American banker who has been sent to Moscow to oversee its privatization. Starling was a reporter for the Sun and Daily Telegraph, and has also worked for a company which specializes in kidnap negotiation, clandestine investigations and political risk analysis. His Mastermind semi-finals subject was the fiction of Dick Francis.Purple hibiscus (Fourth Estate, 12.99) by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is an accomplished first novel, set in a Nigeria falling apart under a military coup. Things started to fall apart at home, it starts, when my brother, Jaja, did not go to communion and Papa flung his heavy missal across the room and broke the figurines on the tagre. The narrator is 15-year-old Kambili, whose world is circumscribed by the high walls of her family compound and the frangipani trees she can see from her bedroom. Her wealthy Catholic father, although generous and well-respected in the community, is repressive and fanatically religious at home. She lives in fear of her violence. Mysteriously involved in the political crisis, her father sends Kambili and her brother away to their aunts, where she discovers a life, dangerous and heathen, beyond the confines of her fathers authority. The visit will lift the silence from her world and, in time, reveal a terrible, damaging secret at the heart of her family life.Fury (Pan, 6.99) by G.M. Ford is a thriller, based in Seattle (this dreary and comfortless region of its epigraph), with a serial killer in it. The other main players are Leanne Samples, a mendacious witness to the trial of a man sentenced to the chair; Natalie van der Hoven, editor of the Seattle Sun, and the investigative journalist, Frank Corso. This is the first in what promises to be a Corso series.																												Black moon (Penguin, 3.50) by Carsten Stroud has been described on the cover as a nerve-jangling thrill ride. If its not a serial killer, then it must be murder, espionage and international intrigue. Here we find Rick Broca, a policeman-turned-boatminder, contending against the combined might of the CIA, the FBI and the US military. This, after rescuing a mysterious impostor from a crashed plane in the ocean, followed by being intercepted by a fishing boat packed with enough artillery to sink a battleship. Carsten Stroud lives in a place called Thunder Beach.Fire from heaven (Arrow, 4.55) by Mary Renault is a reprint of the first of this celebrated historical novelists trilogy on Alexander the Great, originally published in 1970. A war-nurse after graduating from Oxford, Renault fleshes out Plutarchs account of Alexander, keeping some of her research for a work of non-fiction called The Nature of Alexander. Her protagonist is a complex and passionate man, whose boyhood is the focus of this book. He takes on uncertain paternity, a Dionysiac mother, an intensely committed friendship with a beautiful young soldier and the taming of a 12-year-old horse called Bouke- phalas  the last being the grown mans favourite after-dinner story. Gore Vidal describes Renaults Alexandriad as one of the 20th centurys most unexpectedly original works of art.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 27, 2004 							 																						THE FUTURE LIES HERE				 	 India calling																														With increasing use of standardized computer setting and much faster data transmission, outsourced work to Indian publishers, printers from Britain, America and English language European publishers in science and technology will grow in the future. This is based on four hard facts: costs, quality (call it brains, if you like), better professional management of delivery schedules, and above all fluency in English, especially with scientific and technical jargon. What is the nature of work that will flow in and why will these four factors work in our favour as against Hong Kong and Singapore that have traditionally had a larger share of print jobs from the West?																														Outsourced jobs to India will be in two specific areas. First, in composing typescripts according to specifications provided on to magnetic tapes that will be couriered back to the original publishers for printing. Second, these composition jobs will be largely in technical areas like science, technology and allied fields.																														The basic reason is comparative costs. In the West, composition costs are the highest in an itemized breakdown of the total cost of production, unlike here, where paper is the highest cost constituent. For a page, say, 5.5 inches into 8 inches, the cost of composing straightforward running matter like in a novel here would be Rs 75, whereas the same would cost at least 5 or the equivalent of Rs 270 in Britain! And when it comes to technical subjects, we could provide the page for Rs 200 as against 10-15 or Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500. Thus, the savings on the comparative costs for a manuscript of 300 pages or for technical books that have over 800-1,000 pages, would be enormous.																														Also, the quality of the final output would be exactly the same because of the standardized computer setting. In fact, it might be better because our compositors are graduates in scientific and technical fields where higher mathematics is a necessary qualification. They are better equipped to handle highly technical manuscripts than those in the West. There have been several instances with a press in Bangalore where compositors have pointed out mathematical mistakes in manuscripts submitted to them by Western publishers.																														Also, India is more competitive than Hong Kong or Singapore in composing costs.With stronger language skills, and a larger pool of technical manpower, we can beat them. However, better professional management, especially relating to delivery schedules, needs to be improved. 																														The lacuna is being plugged with better trained print technologists, and an emphasis on both management and finance. 																														All we need is better communication with leading Western publishers. Indian printers have the expertise to emulate the success of our call centres.						RAVI VYAS

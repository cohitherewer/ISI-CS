The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 05, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Unclean movesSir  A clean-up in any city in India always has a human element to it. Such operations usually involve the eviction of some people from public places which they have known as their home or workplace for generations. It could be Rashbehari Avenue in Calcutta, or it could be Juhu beach in Mumbai, the stories are much the same (No bhaji on swept-clean Juhu beach, June 30). Cutting out the sentimental argument of the filth and the vendors being integral to the ambience of these areas, the clean-up drives could not but be welcomed. But as we have seen in the case of Calcutta, political reasons and minority-appeasement can often put a spanner in the good work. There is every chance that some politician will seize the opportunity to make it to the headlines and play politics on Juhu beach. And if a class-religion card can be played, things will doubtless become even more interesting. No clean-up initiative ever was clean in this part of the world. Yours faithfully,
Sudha Mishra, BhopalNew turn				 																																																				Sir  Manmohan Singh may have scored over his political opponents on the tainted ministers issue for the time being (Manmohan turns taint tables, June 30). But in the process he has admitted that he has tainted ministers in his cabinet, and that it is not unusual since his predecessors had them too. But this is no excuse. Two wrongs never made a right. And the prime minister must take precautions so that he does not have to use the words, compulsions of coalition politics, during his tenure.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Arta Mishra, Cuttack
				 																																																				Sir  Manmohan Singhs constraints are understandable. Tainted individuals like Laloo Yadav can be a nuisance if kept out of the cabinet. Most Indian leaders have been chargesheeted at some point in their political lives for breaking laws. A chargesheet alone does not make a person a criminal. But there is a difference between violation of law and moral turpitude. The latter is what the tainted ministers are guilty of, and it is no less a crime than a direct violation of the law.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

				 																																																				Sir  During his earlier tenure as finance minister, Manmohan Singh had dealt a fatal blow to the lucrative business of gold-smuggling. His recent proposal of making funds available directly to the panchayats is another great move, because it will cut out the intermediaries, middlemen and officials, who, according to some estimates, have been responsible for siphoning off a considerable chunk of the funds allocated to the panchayats. Singh has proved that where there is a vision, there could always be a way out.				 																																																				Rural India has hardly had a taste of the fruits of development. So areas such as income generation, education, sanitation and modernization will need to be given priority even now. Agriculture and related industries must become profitable without subsidies. Direct sale of agriculture produce must be encouraged. Procurement prices should ensure profitability. 				 																																																				It is a shame that several villages in the country are yet to have access to safe drinking water, electricity, communication systems and primary health services. These are some of the areas on which the thrust cannot be diminished no matter which party comes to power.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

				 																Terror trail				 																																																				Sir  Bhaskar Ghoses Terrorism, lies and the US (June 23) is a well-documented article, but the author would have done well to dwell a little more on a point that he merely touches upon  the failure of democracy in the United States of America, a country that constantly preaches democratic norms and human rights. Ghose is right in condemning the role of the opposition Democrats  this lot simply acquiesced in the plan of invading Iraq. Another disturbing thought is that the American public, supposedly aware and highly articulate on matters civic, still believes that what is good for the US is good for the rest of the world. Their knowledge of, and interest in, the world that resides beyond the American borders are abysmally low. It is no use blaming the hawks who goaded George W. Bush into attacking Iraq. The fault lies with the USs sham democracy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In his article Bhaskar Ghose points out the USs bunglings over Iraq and al Qaida. But the mother of all questions is : who has the capacity to tackle the jihadi groups head-on? The train carnage in Madrid, the attack in Bali and bomb blasts in other parts of the world unmistakably signal that jihadi operatives have not only extended their network but have also become more deadly in their methods. The recent killings of the American expatriate, Paul Johnson, the Korean national, Kim Sun-il, and Sudhir Pundhir have only made matters worse by giving an indication of the grim days that lie ahead. 				 																																																				Although the American moves betray the countrys imperialist designs, I feel that under the present circumstances there is little merit in intensifying the vilification campaign against America. Where are the advocates of transparency and detractors of the US when dictators and militants are butchering innocent people? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

				 																																																				Sir  Bhaskar Ghoses example of Arthur Millers play, The Crucible, is very apt in the context of the Iraq war. Americans have never been comfortable with criticism, and their faculty of self-assessment seems to have all but disappeared now.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Kasturi Ghosh, Calcutta

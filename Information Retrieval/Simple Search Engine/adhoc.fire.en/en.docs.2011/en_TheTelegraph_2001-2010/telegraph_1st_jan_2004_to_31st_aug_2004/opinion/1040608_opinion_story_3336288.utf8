The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Unlearn the lesson				 																																																				Sir  If anyone thought that schooling was all about imparting the right values, think again. The practice of segregating students on the basis of marks by some elite educational institutions in Maharashtra shows one of the many drawbacks of our education system (Scanner on marks apartheid, June 5). Dividing students, whether on the basis of their performance or any other criterion, puts into place a process of systemic discrimination. While the performers get the best  best teachers, study material and other advantages  those who cannot make this grade have to do without them. This is likely to lead the under-achievers, already suffering from tremendous parental pressure, into deeper despair. Schooling is not about assisting meritorious students. It is about paying equal, if not more, attention to weaker students. However, for all their claims of furthering the career of bright students, the real reason for this Darwinian approach among the schools is to promote their own commercial ambitions. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sneha Ganguly, Calcutta
				 																Tracked down				 																																																				Sir  The United Progressive Alliance has been scorned for the appointment of the tainted Laloo Prasad Yadav as railways minister. For rail travellers journeying through Bihar, however, this is a blessing in disguise (Unsafe in any coach in Bihar, June 4). For the past 8 years, except for the short Mamata Banerjee tenure, the rail portfolio has been continuously held by rivals of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, who have blamed the state for the breakdown of law and order. The state government has, in turn, blamed the lack of security on the trains. Neither side cared for the plight of passengers. Politicians travelling with their henchmen without reservation in the expensive air-conditioned coaches, regularly harassed passengers with valid tickets in Bihar. Travellers in the sleeper classes who had reservation found themselves unseated by students and locals while passing various stations in the state. No politician from Bihar had ever taken action against the nuisance for fear of antagonizing their vote bank. 				 																																																				With Laloo Yadav at the helm of affairs both in Bihar and in the railways, it will no longer be possible for the state and the ministry to play the blame game. Both sides will be forced to tackle the menace. The murder of a Border Security Force inspector by robbers recently saw Yadav rushing to Patna and ordering the arrest of the criminals immediately. It is likely that the police, who have their finger in the pie, will advise criminals to keep low during Yadavs tenure. Thus railway passengers should welcome Yadavs appointment as it is likely to reduce, if not eliminate, robberies and make rail journeys through Bihar safer than before.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tamal Basu, Hooghly

				 																																																				Sir  The recent spate of robberies on the Farakka Express, the Doon Express and on a local train in Sealdah seems to have had no impact on the railways minister. Trains in Bihar continue to be stopped, in the name of the minister, to press for the demand of more halts. Bihars lawlessness has already attracted the attention of the courts. It is unfortunate that the man responsible for most of this has been anointed the railways minister for the sake of coalition politics. What is more ridiculous is Laloo Prasad Yadavs antics, especially his suggestion to move around incognito to understand passengers problems, as if more evidence were required to prove that they exist.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  On assuming office, Laloo Prasad Yadav had announced that ensuring the safety of passengers would be given top priority. However, the Doon Express robbery, among the first batch of robberies that occurred soon after the new government took office, has taken place in the railways ministers own backyard. Hopefully, the UPA will do something to ensure that someone other than god himself can protect railway passengers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Sayan Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Doon Express robbery was inevitable. It happened in the home turf of the new railways minister, possibly committed by the men his own party had nurtured for political reasons, and who now felt sufficiently empowered now that Laloo Prasad Yadav was at the Centre. Hereafter, we must desist from blaming the criminals as we ourselves have decided to elect corrupt leaders like Yadav.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The Bihari babu has set his foot in the cabinet with the dream of becoming prime minister some day. Despite being a crowd-puller, his critics have often dubbed him the sarpanch of Bihar. It is to undo this image, to gain acceptance outside his state, that Laloo Prasad Yadav has declared himself to be the railways minister of India and not just Bihar. It is pleasant to hear him talking about equal preference for all regions. The people of Assam  whom he had personally visited and tried to pacify when they were protesting against Nitish Kumars decision not to employ local youth in vacant grade IV posts across the state  thus hope that he will keep the promises he had made, and keep to his policy of impartiality.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Abdul Barique, Dhaligaon, Assam

				 																																																				Sir  Not many have taken kindly to Laloo Prasad Yadavs green measures. But has anyone thought about the good effect earthen pots and sal-leaf food packets will have? These will reduce the plastic litter on both sides of the railway tracks and save our environment and help thousands.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B. L. Chandak, Howrah

				 																Helping hand				 																																																				Sir  In Cancer Management II (Hard Talk, May 17), on being asked whether there were any dependable organizations that can guide patients, eminent oncologist Subir Ganguly had replied, Some voluntary organizations like Indian Cancer Society, Oncolink and Fight Cancer had been formed earlier to provide such a platform. But most of these have ceased to exist. I would like to point out that Hitaishini (the only breast cancer support group in eastern India) had been holding a clinic every Thursday for more than a year at the radiology department of the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. It still does so at the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute Hospital (Hazra Crossing), Bengal Oncology Centre (Motilal Nehru Road), Subodh Mitra Cancer Hospital (Salt Lake) and Cancer Centre Welfare Home and Research Institute (Thakurpukur). The clinic at the Calcutta Medical College was discontinued but the other clinics continue to operate. Cancer patients are given psychological support and medical relief in tune with Hitaishinis limited financial ability, and rehabilitated. Hitaishini has not gone out of existence.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Vijaya Mukherjee, founder president, Hitaishini, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 							 																						HIGH FLYING																														Mr Rajiv Pratap Rudy has more to answer for than passing off private bills as public ones. The Naresh Chandra committees recommendations on revamping civil aviation are unassailable. Implemented in their entirety, they will reform civil aviation, and also airports, subsidies, air traffic control, security and regulatory structures. Unfortunately, governments have a penchant for implementing recommendations partially. Hence, the essential air service fund, financed through a cess and used to subsidize unviable airports or routes, remains unimplemented, but in an election-eve measure designed to please the urban middle classes, indirect taxes on aviation turbine fuel are reduced, and foreign and inland air travel taxes scrapped. No decision is taken on the privatization of Air India and Indian Airlines or modernization of fleets, but these public sector airlines are expected to compete with private airlines, now allowed to fly overseas. The policy on bilateral flying rights remains unclear, but flying rights are granted to south-east Asian and Sri Lankan airlines on non-reciprocal basis. The recent spat between Mr Arun Shourie and Mr L.K. Advani in the cabinet on allowing Jet Airways to fly abroad is more than Mr Shourie getting back at Mr Advani because of the latters opposition to telecom liberalization or security clearances to Jet. It is more about arbitrariness and non-transparency in government decision-making, inevitable if recommendations are implemented partially.																														In a haste to establish his reformist credentials, Mr Rudy sought to push through a proposal that is indefensible. Civil aviation has not been opened up and 49 per cent foreign equity is still not allowed. Hence, the shakeout in the domestic sector is yet to happen, apart from newer domestic airlines like Deccan or East-West threatening Jet and Sahara market shares. There are already norms before an airline is allowed to operate domestically. Should there be additional prerequisites before it is allowed to fly abroad? If there are, and these are based on domestic performance, they will perforce be biased in favour of existing players like Jet or Sahara and discriminate against future players. Should shares in bilateral flying rights be based on existing domestic performance? There is no denying that the formula proposed for such allocation benefits Jet. Mr Rudy may protest that this was done in good faith. However, in a transitory period of reforms, discretion in government decision-making is not reduced and as the telecom experience demonstrated, impressions of transparency are just as important as the transparency itself. As in the matter of unpaid bills, a charitable view is that the minister exhibited bad judgment. An uncharitable view is that there was actual wrong-doing. The proposal before the cabinet has rightly been shot down.

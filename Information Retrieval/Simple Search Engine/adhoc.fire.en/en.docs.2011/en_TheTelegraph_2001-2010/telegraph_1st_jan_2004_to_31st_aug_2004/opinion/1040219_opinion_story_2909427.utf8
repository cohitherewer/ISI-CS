The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 							 																						THE DYNASTY																														Whatever might be the outcome of the forthcoming general elections, the Gandhi family will remain undefeated. The entry of Ms Maneka Gandhi and her son, Varun, into the folds of the Bharatiya Janata Party has ensured this bizarre result. The BJPs decision to bring in the widow and the son of the late Sanjay Gandhi only confirms the impression that among the political classes of India, the surname Gandhi is the most important one. The BJP may not like to accept this, or they may go into logical contortions to justify the entry of the two Gandhis into the party, but their own actions have brought home this reality. The BJP has shown that it also believes in the dynasty even though this particular dynasty was perpetuated by Indira Gandhi on whom the BJP piles curse upon abuse. The BJP will now find it embarrassing to attack Ms Sonia Gandhi as someone whose access to power lies through the dynastic principle. There is no evidence that the junior Ms Gandhi and her son are believers in what the BJP stands for in ideological terms. Yet they are considered as assets to the party. The reason for this is the surname that they bear, and the surname is an asset because of the dynastic resonance that it carries.																														The BJPs decision is suggestive of another imperceptible change that is taking place. It could be said with only a slight hint of exaggeration that by admitting Indias first surname, the BJP has actually begun the process of becoming a mirror image of the Congress. There are still a few distortions in the mirror but the emerging image on the looking glass is already visible and recognizable. The BJPs efforts to appropriate the political middle ground under the leadership of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee has brought it closer to the Congress than either party would like to admit. Both parties are liable to be a trifle embarrassed by this development, but it is in the nature of the Indian political system to push major political parties towards the middle ground. This ground was originally the Congresss hallowed turf. The BJP is thus becoming more like its arch-rival. It has happened to other political parties, most notably to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). By becoming like the Congress, the BJP has perhaps finally earned respectability for itself. The dynasty has raised its standard and one name is blazoned on the flag. That name is ironically a source of controversy as well as an instrument to leverage respectability and acceptability. A democracy that approves of dynasty is the supreme paradox of the Indian polity.

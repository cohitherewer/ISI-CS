The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 							 																						PROTECT THE GIVEN SPACE Shobita PunjaWhen architects of yesteryear built temples, mosques, forts, palaces and residential homes and shops, they always thought of a set- back position  placing the building at a distance from the road or point of entry. The set-back from the road had many purposes.																					The long drive or walk towards the edifice prepared the pilgrims as they approached the temple, charging their mood, hastening their tempo and spiritual eagerness for what they were about to experience. As they walked towards the temple, there were shops to buy offerings for the gods. There was the tank in which to wash away the dust of everyday life, and in doing so, they were to purify their spirit. 																					Often the temple was by the waterfront, where the view from the river was spectacular, as its reflection played on the waters. The temple was often placed on a hill, requiring the pilgrim to make the long trek up, thus providing ample time for contemplation and reflection. The trials of the journey up to the temple were also part of the psychological journey and the symbolic journey of life that tires and exhilarates us all. The Jama Masjid in Delhi, built by Shah Jahan, is also raised on a huge platform elevating it above the heaving smells and crowded sights of everyday life.																					Fort William in Calcutta and other historic forts of India had moats that provided a set back, a distance from any other structure. The water-filled moat also protected the fort from enemies who had to find a way of crossing it before entering the bastions of power. Distance here was used as a way to raise the status of the building and also to create a sense of awe as well as fear.																					The long drive to the church provided space for carriages to enter and those walking to the church were given a grand view of the imposing religious building; its bell tower and roof that stood dignified above the other buildings around it. The space around the building provided comfortable room for entry, exit and also for a good view of the structure and all its details.																					Safe distance																					A building set back from the road is protected from noise. The joy of moving away from the road and turning into a long driveway begins with leaving behind the noise and the bustle of the road and the endless stream of traffic.																					Distance also protects the building from pollution that reaches the building from the road, as traffic whips up clouds of smoke and polluting chemicals. Tree-lined roads guard the building from noise pollution, dust as well as road pollution. A few trees along a much-used road can act as a screen against dust and constant pollutants and a sound barrier against traffic noise. Placing the building away from the road with a pavement, an entrance driveway and a line of trees were features that the architects considered when they thought of the long life, health and comfort of the building and its users.																					The axe-head of the urban planners pencil unfortunately falls on these very historic areas of the city that provide us with safeguards. Widening of roads, that is essential to ease traffic congestion, rips through the set-backs of historic buildings that were designed to save them from the horror and harm of the roads. The vast driveways and gardens in front of impressive buildings, churches, temples and mosques are being swallowed up by land grabbers and land developers who seem to have no idea how precious this space around a building is for the health of the city.																					Is land in cities so valuable that we no longer care for health, or beauty or even the sensory pleasure of building with space? We must protect these protectors, this precious space within and around us, so we have at least the psychological space to live. Empty spaces are our heritage and we need to save them too.

		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 							 																						DARKNESS DESCENDING The delaying tactics and deliberate manipulation of the legal process must end if the Srikrishna commission report is to be implemented, writes Jyoti Punwani		 Faith beliedWhat happens next in the Best Bakery case? All eyes are on the Supreme Court. In the past few months, the apex court has countered, measure for measure, the Gujarat administrations systematic attempts to deny justice to the victims of last years violence. 																														Meanwhile, Mumbaiites have been left wondering when their citys victims will get the same protection. After an initial boost which went beyond their expectations, matters have been at a standstill in the Supreme Court for well over a year now. Indeed, matters have come to such a pass that last week, the court asked the petitioners and the respondents, that is, those seeking implementation of the Srikrishna commission report and the Maharashtra and Central governments respectively, to file affidavits stating they were ready to go on with the final hearing of the matter. In the homes of those at the heart of the matter  families whose children/fathers were killed, and whose properties, built from scratch, were burnt down  a sense of defeat has begun to settle in. 																														That this should happen even after a detailed official report on the wrongs inflicted on these victims was prepared by a sitting high court judge and tabled in the assembly, is doubly frustrating. 																														In Gujarat, the closest the victims have got to an official report has been that of the National Human Rights Commission. Yet, the NHRC has been able to get the Supreme Court to counter every mala fide response of the Gujarat government to the victims attempts to get legal redressal. But such vitally important judicial activism has somehow eluded the petitions wanting implementation of the report of a judge who sifted the testimony of 502 witnesses and 2,126 affidavits, to fix responsibility for the deaths of 900 persons.																														The apparent reason for this has been the short tenures of chief justices since A.S. Anand retired in October 2001. The petition seeking the implementation of the Srikrishna commission report was filed in October 98, soon after its tabling in the state assembly. By now, it has acquired nightmarish proportions. Indeed, at a hearing a year ago, the bench had requested counsel to help it get through the mountain of papers which now make up the petition. 																														Some of the petitioners have been only too glad to accede to this request, and have, on their own, attempted to do so for every new chief justice before whom the matter has come up since Chief Justice Anand retired. The petitioners say they know how difficult it is to understand what exactly needs to be done to set right wrongs committed 10 years ago. The trouble is, the Maharashtra government also knows this. If the petitioners wrack their brains to simplify the case before the court, the Maharashtra government does its bureaucratic best to confound it. 																														First, it uses the time-tested tactic of delay. Never has the government been given less than four weeks to file its replies. Yet, invariably, it files replies on the very last days of the deadline, thus necessitating a request by petitioners for time to go through those replies. In the last 15 months, the grant of such an adjournment very often meant a new chief justice taking up the matter. 																														This delaying tactic is combined with another: filing replies which run into volumes, full of details no one, not even the petitioners, leave alone hard-pressed judges, would like to read, for instance, details of every case filed since the riots; or, filing short but meaningless replies, conveying nothing but numbers in a vacuum, with no names, no references: so many policemen punished, so many exonerated, so many cases re-opened, so many closed again 																														The government knows precisely what information needs to be given: whether the commissions three main recommendations  punishment to 31 policemen, re-opening of closed riot cases and compensation to missing persons  have been implemented. Yet each time the law and judiciary department choose to waste the time of the court by confusing these simple issues, knowing this will delay implementation of the report. 																														What exactly is at stake for the Maharashtra government? In Gujarat, ruling party members need to be shielded from the law. So the Gujarat government uses the police to block victims access to the legal system. But in 1992-93, the Mumbai police on their own did all that the Gujarat police have been accused of doing. They protected, in a hundred different ways, those who turned on their fellow citizens only because they happened to be Muslims. 																														The Mumbai police did not indulge in this criminal act on official instructions. But the then Congress governments of Sudhakar Naik and Sharad Pawar allowed them to do this. The succeeding Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party government backed them to the hilt, since the police had protected their people. Now, the present secular Democratic Front government, headed by persons hand-picked by Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, is busy protecting these anti-Muslim policemen from the strictures of the Srikrishna commission. How better to do so than by allowing members of the same police force to decide what action can be taken against their colleagues; and in doing so, overrule the findings of a sitting judge? 																														The special task force set up to act on the commissions report has filed murder charges against policemen and then allowed them to get anticipatory bail; conducted inquiries without recording statements of key witnesses; recorded statements but chosen to disbelieve them...																														Notwithstanding the governments tactics, this game could easily have been exposed before the Supreme Court were it not for an ace the government has up its sleeve: the chief petitioner is a state minister. The rest of the parties are merely intervenors. Naseem Arif Khans petition, filed when he was an ordinary Congressman, has worked like a magic wand both for him and the Maharashtra government. If its the sole reason he was made minister, its also the only reason he has been retained as one. Not surprisingly, in the barrage of lawyers who appear before the Supreme Court every time the Srikrishna commission case is called out, the one asking the loudest for adjournments and shouting the others down, is the lawyer appearing for the chief petitioner. 																														Despite this, Chief Justice Anand had given the Maharashtra government a tough time, forcing it to act. The case of murder filed against former police commissioner, R.D. Tyagi, had made national news. So did his discharge in April 2003. The Maharashtra government has yet to appeal against it.																														Meanwhile, those innocent persons against whom Tyagi and his co-accused policemen had, according to the charge against them, cooked up a bogus case, continue to make the rounds of courts. The government has not thought it fit to drop the case against them. Indeed, large numbers of Muslims are facing trials in cases described by Srikrishna as fabricated by communal policemen. If the Supreme Court sees to it that the Srikrishna commission report is implemented, these innocents, and indeed, all of Mumbai, can believe that justice delayed is not justice denied.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 							 																						TOUCH OF TAR																														Most people are prone to believe that in India, politicians are above the law. This commonly-held notion is supported by certain recent developments. One of the most important precepts of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, the bedrock of the Indian judicial system, is that a man is innocent till he is proven guilty. Yet it is assumed that a politician is guilty as soon as a charge is brought against him or her. Mr Shibu Soren of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha had to step down as coal minister in the Union cabinet because of a warrant which pertained to an incident that had taken place nearly three decades ago. The chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Ms Uma Bharti, resigned because of a warrant in Karnataka against something she had done ten years ago. Charges against both persons are yet to be proved and conviction, if there is one, is far away. Yet it is being presumed that they are guilty and therefore should not hold public office. The new buzzword is tainted. Nobody is quite sure what makes a taint. The very ambiguity of the word is opening up a space in which jurisprudence can be mocked at and the judicial system ridiculed. The popular cynicism about politicians and their lack of integrity is only aiding and abetting the process.																														It will surprise nobody that Ms Bharti is trying to capitalize on her arrest. Political dividends are not susceptible to taints. She and her party have proclaimed her action of raising the flag in the Idgah Maidan in Hubli as an act of liberation comparable to Jallianwala Bagh. Hence, the idea of a flag march from Hubli to Jallianwala Bagh. In this exhibition, what will be glossed over is the role that Ms Bhartis action played in provoking a riot that resulted in the loss of lives. It is that role which should be the focus of the trial. Instead, her arrest, without a proper trial, is providing an occasion for an elaborate piece of political theatre, and exactly the kind of theatre at which Ms Bharti herself and the Bharatiya Janata Party excel.																														By making Ms Bharti resign from the chief ministership of Madhya Pradesh, the BJP is making a clear attempt to recover the moral high ground. It is from this ground that they will target Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, the most tainted minister of them all. The issue of tainted ministers threatens to stonewall issues of governance from being discussed in the Lok Sabha. The BJPs recovery of the moral ground is also something of a charade because it has made no efforts to cleanse itself and the National Democratic Alliance of tainted elements. The fact of the matter is that no political party believes that in public life even Caesars wife should be above suspicion. Politics cannot be sanitized by stray resignations and by the public undermining of one of the basic tenets of jurisprudence. It is something politicians have to do by themselves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Facts undo figures				 																																																				 Sir  Jairam Ramesh, the Congress secretary, epitomizes what the party has come to be  ideologically and politically vacuous. He does have a point in undermining the Bharatiya Janata Partys trump card in the elections  a record gross domestic product growth during its reign  and asking people not to get carried away (Congress devalues growth, April 2). But despite the scepticism about India Shining and the feel-good factor, such things have gone down well with sections of the electorate. Comparison of the GDP growth rates under the Congress and BJP regimes holds little meaning for the common voter. Instead of doing this, Ramesh could have urged his party to emphasize its role as the initiator of reforms. The Congress has presented a vague manifesto. It wants to broaden and deepen reforms, and yet it remains wary of divestment in public sector units. The party has to be more clearsighted about its stand before criticizing its opponent and soliciting voters. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ashish Majumdar, Calcutta
				 																Tale of two nations				 																																																				Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray has omitted elaborating on the prime cause for instability in west Asia (Road map and razor wire, March 27). This cause is the disunity among the Arab nations. The United States of America has made the greatest use of this to advance its own interests in that area.The Cooperative Council of the Arab States of the Gulf has been far too busy with interstate bickering to look at matters of more importance. The efforts of Saudi Arabia, the largest incumbent in this council, to bring this influential Group of Six and other countries to a common platform have met with little success. For instance, when Saddam Hussein decided to attack Kuwait in 1990, the Arab states took no steps to restrain him. This led to the destabilization of west Asia, culminating in the tragedy of Iraq. 				 																																																				Shortly before the Iraq war, the Arab League organized a meeting at Doha in order to reach a consensus on how to prevent the conflict. The meeting quickly broke up in disorder because all that the Iraqi and the Kuwaiti emissaries were interested in was mutual mudslinging. Had there been anything like a unified stance among the ten Arab nations surrounding Israel, the Palestine issue would have been resolved long ago. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The US has to stop asking why 9/11 happened or why the Muslims and Arabs hate America, and reflect on its own complicity with the terrorist state of Israel in committing crimes against the Palestinians in places like Qana, Jenin, Sabra and Chatila. 				 																																																				The crimes started as early as 1948, uprooting a nation and turning its people into refugees in their own land, now imprisoned behind a racist wall. The West continues to ignore the contempt of the Zionist Jews for the Gentiles. The Zionists seem to have forgotten that it was the West which persecuted them, through inquisitions, pogroms and other forms of collective punishment before they could seek sanctuary in other countries. The killing of the blind and crippled Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, and the daily shooting of Palestinians, especially children, are despicable. Ariel Sharon is already known as the butcher of Sabra and Chatila  shooting defenceless people is not an exception but the norm in Israel. 				 																																																				The Western media have a role to play in the unfair reporting of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. They reinforce the image of Muslims as inherently violent with the peaceful West and Israel. The victims are thus represented as aggressors, and vice versa. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Yamin Zakaria, London

				 																																																				Sir  With the murder of the Hamas leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the Zionist fascists have bitten off more than they can chew. If, or when, Israel bleeds at the hands of Sheikh Yassins avengers, it will have lost all claims to sympathy. It will merely be facing the consequences of its own actions. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir  American and Israeli politicians may be doing a good job keeping the world and the media on tenterhooks with rumours of weapons of mass destruction. But it would not be too far-fetched to assume that all the WMDs of west Asia are in Israel, and those of the West are in the US. 				 																																																				There has been evidence of Israel manufacturing nuclear bombs in their Dimona nuclear facility. It has also developed and kept in stock a good amount of biological WMD at the Israel Institute of Biological Research, comparable only with what is in the US. The US has a history of lethal warfare as well. It had sprayed the deadly Agent Orange on Vietnam. 				 																																																				Even as the US army is busy cleaning up its act in post-war Iraq, the US seems unconcerned about Israels possession of destructive weapons. Given how the United Nations was unheeded during the run-up to the Iraq war, the UN cannot be expected to step in authoritatively against these two countries. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Sarkar, Victoria, Canada

				 																																																				Sir  The US has been hesitant to criticize the killing of the Hamas leader. The peace process cannot be expected to succeed if such killings continue, and if there is such a dichotomy in those who claim to want peace in the region.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  There seems to be vested interests in the manner in which Hamas has decided to avenge the death of their leader. The Hamas is aware that the Americans are capable of making far more trouble for it than its known ally, Israel. The fear factor made it give the clean chit to the US.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

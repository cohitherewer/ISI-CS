The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 							 																						RAID ON A DYING CULTUREThe highest expressions of outrage at the Tagore burglary all seem to be pitched at the level of the symbolic and the sentimentalThe Tagore burglary is a truly nasty affair. It would be unspeakably petty if the thieves went simply for the gold. But that does sound like a nave view of things. If the burglars were more discerning about the real value of their haul, then the theft  its canny mix of valuation and disrespect  becomes more deeply shocking. The most sordid reading of the event gestures darkly at internal conspiracies. If this is correct, then there must be something truly rotten at the heart of the Tagorean establishment today. Hence, rising above the post facto outrage over security failure and chaotic infrastructure, there is another level of reaction that is being heard most powerfully among the custodians of Rabindranath Tagores legacy. A former vice-chancellor of Visva-Bharati has likened the burglary to an atomic explosion, while a former director of Rabindra Bhavan thinks that, as national crises go, this is second only to the assassination of the Mahatma. The loss of the Nobel objets have provoked tears and speechlessness. This is like the desecration of a reliquary  as when used condoms were found, a few years ago, in the prayer-hall at Santiniketan.																														The highest expressions of outrage at the burglary all seem to be pitched at the level of the symbolic and the sentimental. The measure of the present crisis, local and national, lies in a failure to protect the sacred relics and tokens. And this encapsulates, perhaps, the tragedy of Tagores afterlife in modern Bengal. The greater the intellectual and bureaucratic incomprehension of Tagores achievement, the more ardent and mindless is his deification. In Tagores case, it is not enough to say that he has been made part of an intellectual impoverishment, reflected in the mediocrity of research and performance. What the burglary brutally exposes is a much larger desecration of Tagores ideals of education, creativity and life as embodied in his original vision for Santiniketan and Sriniketan. At every level  from the pedagogic to the municipal  the modernization of Santiniketan reflects this corruption of intellect and taste. But the problem is not simply aesthetic or intellectual. The absence of even the most rudimentary notions of conservation in the way Santiniketan is being developed is the most obvious physical evidence of this incomprehension  the wild neglect in which priceless pieces of sculpture lie about in the campus, the frenzy of construction in and around the town, and the unthinking destruction of the natural environment and topography. Santiniketan is neither a panchayat nor a municipality, and lacks a drainage, sewerage and garbage disposal system. The Sriniketan Santiniketan Development Authority, created by the government in the late Eighties, is actively clueless about all this. It is interested mostly in commercial complexes and amusement parks, which are entirely at odds with the spirit of the university, its academic, cultural and ecological character. 																														The reaction to the stolen medal and citation, thus confined to the symbolic and the sentimental, perpetuates this tendency to deify an individual without engaging with the relevance and implications of his greatness.

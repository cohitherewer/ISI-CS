The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 12, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The sword cuts both ways				 																																																				 Sir  As gestures go, Vijay Mallyas acquiring the sword of Tipu Sultan is quite a grand one (Mallya unveils sword secret, April 8). The pictures of Mallya holding aloft the unsheathed sword, which were splashed everywhere in the media, helped reinforce the loud and flashy liquor baron image that he actively cultivates. It also helped Mallya pander to the nationalist lobby (so what if Tipu is not as much in fashion as Shivaji?) and that too, quite cheaply (what is Rs 1.57 crore for someone like him?). But if Mallya intended all this to translate into electoral gains  the timing seems to indicate he did  he will be disappointed. The way the many factions of the Janata parivar, Mallyas Janata Party, S.R. Bommais All India Progressive Janata Dal, H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) and even a few elements of the George Fernandess Janata Dal (United), are pulling in different directions, Mallya would have done better to keep his money in his pocket.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, C.S. Hegde, Bangalore
				 																Considered opinion				 																																																				Sir  The Union government has bypassed the consensus reached at the all-party meet by accepting the opinion of the attorney general, Soli Sorabjee, that any ban on opinion or exit polls would be against the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government has a habit of changing its tune according to its convenience. How many times has it taken the advice of the attorney general, even on the occasions on which it has sought it? 				 																																																				It is only seldom that all political parties exhibit such unanimity, at least publicly. Thus, the best remedy would be to ban opinion and exit polls first by an ordinance, and then leave it to an objector to take the matter to the Supreme Court for a final say. Exit and opinion polls, especially in a multi-phased election, distort the final verdict, since there is the chance that voters may be influenced by the trend exhibited in them. This aspect needs to be considered given the high levels of illiteracy in the country. There are the chances of such polls being manipulated by political parties.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  As the editorial, Too early to exit (April 9), rightly avers, if political parties root for advertisements in the media, they must also live with opinion polls. While psephologists claim their business is a science, many believe it is but a form of art. Instances like the same agency giving out two sets of results for two different clients in a poll of a similar nature, which have recently come to light, adds to the fear that opinion polls will mislead by people giving them wrong information (A matter of opinion, April 4). 				 																																																				If the political parties have no qualms about invading the peoples privacy (via SMS messages), they have no right to restrict the peoples right to be informed via opinion polls.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why are political parties so nervous about opinion and exit polls? Indian voters are not influenced by these polls. In the 2003 assembly elections, the pollsters had predicted a 3-1 victory for the Congress but the peoples verdict was 3-1 in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party. A very small percentage of voters  those who read English newspapers or watch satellite television  are aware of these predictions. 				 																																																				Opinion polls have caught the imagination of voters the world over. In the United States of America, Gallup polls are conducted by various agencies and neither the Democrats nor the Republicans object to it, even on occasions when the forecasts are off the mark. In 1992, British pollsters predicted a Labour victory but the Tories, led by John Major, won. 				 																																																				Forecasters admit to an error margin of 2 per cent. In the last few Lok Sabha elections, the predictions have been accurate as far as the end results were concerned, though there may have been variations in state tallies. When the entire democratic world has faith in opinion polls, I fail to understand why is a ban being proposed in India. The Election Commission has banned political advertisements in the electronic and print media but surrogate advertisements and articles are being published. I think the only thing that needs banning is personal attacks and mudslinging. Everything else should be left to the voters. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sankar Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The ascendance of opinion polls is actually an offshoot of the proliferation of the news media  audio, video and print. Opinion and exit polls are a good way to engage the readers, and thereby earn money. If the predictions are proved wrong, they can always apologize.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  It is not easy to predict human behaviour. In every Indian election there are complex issues of caste, religion, ideology, emotions, money or muscle power. The hype built around some parties and candidates may also have a marked influence on voters. Regional issues like onion or sugar prices, local ones like bijli, sadak, pani; as also slogans like India Shining, Garibi Hatao, or the voters turnout and even the weather cannot be wholly factored into election mathematics. One can easily make correct predictions where the results are a foregone conclusion, as in the coming elections. It is best to take these predictions with a pinch of salt, much like astrological forecasts which are read more for being entertaining than for being close to reality.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 							 																						CHILDRENS GAMES																														Sometimes, newspapers come up with bizarre juxtapositions. Last week, the top story in a Bengali daily was about the nearly fatal consequences of four children in Bankura trying to play out Dhananjoy Chatterjees hanging. Diagonally below this story, an advertisement for a health-drink showed a little boy desperately hanging by his hands from his front-door knocker, his feet several inches above the ground. Just hanging wont make you taller, said the copy. Given the cleverness of copywriters, the topicality of this piece of persuasion cannot be unintended. Since then, three children have died playing, or being made to play, the Hanging Game; two have been saved in time. Four out of these five instances have happened in rural Bengal. In Bankura, where one boy has died, the game has spread widely among schoolchildren, who have drawn up lists of convicted friends and frequently stage mock-trials, complete with jail-doctor, hangman, warden, the last meal and the final dropping of the handkerchief. Most of these children have been avidly watching TV, and in villages that have none, they were closely following the details from their elders discussions of radio and newspaper reports.																														Children have a natural ability to cast a cold, but curious, eye on life and death  especially on death in its grislier forms. Their games of role-playing and imitation are often amoral, their flirtings with danger often unthinking and reckless, their sense of fun often cruel. And these propensities have obviously found an irresistible resonance in the contemporary media in two ways. First, the verbal and visual reporting of human suffering and violence (legal as well as criminal) is done with an eye for the graphic that is both lurid and prurient. Second, children are becoming an important presence in the market as readers, viewers and consumers. Advertisers and entertainers have therefore developed an instinct for juvenile pleasures and desires that is often shocking in what it might bring into play, unwittingly or by design. On both counts, there are graver risks today of the values and perceptions of children, their rational thinking and moral imagination, being led away from the capacity for humane discrimination and outrage. And this is as much a question of moral values as of physical safety. 																														If adults can live addictively virtual lives on the internet that frequently confuse lies and truth, fantasy and reality, kindness and cruelty, right and wrong, then it would be dangerous to underestimate the compelling power of curiosity, confusion and imaginative identification in children. Greater vigilance at home and in school is not the only solution. Dhananjoy Chatterjees hanging affords the media a crucial opportunity to reflect on the relationship between their own profit-driven failures of taste and the pitfalls of human inquisitiveness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 							 																						OFF THE RAILS																														With one month gone, the United Progressive Alliance government has little to show as reforms. The railway budget and the Union budget to follow are a test of the UPAs credibility in marrying the pro-poor compulsions of the Common Minimum Programme with the reforms agenda. The finance ministers announcement, ahead of the Union budget, of annual plans to reduce deficits may have enhanced the UPAs reforms credentials, but the railway ministers budget indicates which way the wind is blowing. In 2003-04, freight carried by the railways may have exceeded targets, but that was primarily because of growth recovery. This contributed little to freight revenue, because most of it was for low-value products. The fact remains that cross-subsidization of passenger traffic by freight tariffs has rendered the railways uncompetitive. There may indeed have been some scope for hiking freight rates, unchanged since 2002, especially for products like cement and petroleum. However, it is understandable that with its populist overtones and with elections in Bihar next year, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav stayed away from hiking freight rates, barring concessional rates for newspapers and magazines, and some tinkering with parcel rates. 																														But notwithstanding the disinclination to touch second-class and suburban fares, there was no reason why AC and upper-class fares could not be increased. Not only has this not been done, but there are also additional concessions for various categories, including unemployed youth attending interviews. Given this, the moot point is, how are the books going to be balanced? One must not forget that the merger of 50 per cent dearness allowance with basic pay and the increase in the diesel price happened after the interim budget and have not been factored into calculations. The railway ministers explanation that expenditure control and zero-based budgeting will provide a cushion is not convincing. Indeed, Mr Yadav could have explored the possibilities of dismantling loss-making public sector units under the railways and commercially exploiting railway land, but he has chosen to stay away from these options. 																														Given the pathetic safety record, also commented upon by a comptroller and auditor general report on railway safety, one would have expected considerable attention to safety and maintenance rather than the announcement of new trains. Proposals for modernization, safety and security  including use of information technology and the special railway safety fund, which had swallowed up the entire plan outlay in the interim budget  remain no more than intentions, with doubtful implementation. The budget numbers do not add up, especially on internal generation. But clearly the minister has exercised his clout to increase funding from the general exchequer to Rs 7,020 crore. That apart, there is market borrowing of Rs 3,400 crore through the Indian Railway Finance Corporation. The National Democratic Alliance has not lost much by boycotting this tainted budget.

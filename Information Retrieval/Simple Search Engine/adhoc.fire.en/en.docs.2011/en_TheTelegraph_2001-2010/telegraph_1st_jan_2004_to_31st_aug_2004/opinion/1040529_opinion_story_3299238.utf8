The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 29, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Worth a laugh				 																																																				 Sir  Saasbahu tamashas are not restricted to Indian families, the American first family is not immune to them. How else can one explain Barbara Bush censoring Laura for joking about her son (Laura dig at Bush mom, May 21)? But Barbara is here defending someone who chokes on pretzels, drives cars into garage walls, is famed for his malapropisms and funny grammar. George W. Bush is definitely worth a laugh. His misadventures, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq, have also made him the butt of jokes the world over. It is good that at least the wife can laugh at her husband, even if the mother cannot.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Naveen Sen, Calcutta
				 																Double speak				 																																																				Sir  The inherent hypocrisy of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is exposed once more with Somnath Chatterjee accepting the post of speaker in the new government (CPM learns to speak yes, Somnath in chair, May 26). Constitutionally, the speaker is supposed to be neutral while managing the affairs of the house; but in practice, he inevitably works to further the governments interests. So why did Chatterjee become speaker even though the CPI(M) did not join the United Progressive Alliance government? This shows the partys unscrupulousness  that it wants to have its cake and eat it too. The Congress-led UPA is unlikely to make much headway with friends like these. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

				 																																																				Sir  The noises that senior CPI(M) leaders had been making about not allowing Somnath Chatterjee to stand for speaker had disheartened the people of West Bengal. Chatterjees seniority and experience make him well-qualified for the post. Fortunately, the conservative elements in the CPI(M) politburo overcame their objections unlike on other occasions in the past. But the party will have to make amends for its decision not to join the Central ministry, if it wants to fulfil the demands of the state. Chatterjees nomination bodes well for the Congress-led alliance. But as speaker, Chatterjee should at least try to give every party the opportunity to air its views.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Roy Chowdhury, Murshidabad

				 																																																				Sir  Somnath Chatterjees election to the post of speaker will deprive the CPI(M) of an articulate advocate of the party line. The party could have made up for this loss by joining the government, when it would have been better placed to influence policy-making. Joining the government would also have helped the CPI(M) make inroads into those states where it is not in power. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta 

				 																Rusty antics 				 																																																				Sir I have little doubt about the bright prospects of Indian railways, since from now on it will always be managed by the Yadav clan  Rabri Devi will, no doubt, step into her husbands shoes should Laloo Prasad Yadav get involved in any scams in the future, possibly a kullarh ghotala (Green Laloo goes national, May 25). His proposals, like the replacement of plastic cups with earthen containers, serving food on sal leaves and doing away with the Intelligence Bureau are truly fascinating. And Yadavs modest aspirations of becoming Indias prime minister clearly prove how devoted our leaders are to public welfare.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soumitra Lahiri, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In addition to serving tea in earthen cups and food packed in sal leaves, the railways should provide chatais instead of bedding rolls, neem twigs for brushing teeth, and gamchhas instead of hand-towels.These steps will help to encourage our cottage industries. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Instead of issuing generous passes to freedom fighters, senior citizens and accredited journalists, Laloo Prasad Yadav should ensure that good-quality rabri is served on the Rajdhani. This will enhance his popularity and help him retain his ministry. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rongon Neogi, Calcutta

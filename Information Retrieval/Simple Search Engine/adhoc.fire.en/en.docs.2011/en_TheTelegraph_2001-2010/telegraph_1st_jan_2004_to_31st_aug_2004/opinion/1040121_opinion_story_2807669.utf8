		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 							 																						PREVENTION IS THE ONLY STRATEGY 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 The others																														Certain key legal issues arose in the context of HIV/AIDS, which the human rights framework had to consider. The three issues at the core of any response to HIV  consent to testing, non-disclosure of HIV status and anti-discrimination  required that polices be informed by three fundamental human rights  those of self-autonomy, confidentiality/privacy and equality.																														The issue of consent to testing addressed the question of whether testing should be voluntary or mandatory. Consent, therefore, dealt with the right to self-autonomy, to decide for oneself what can be done to ones own body.																														The issue of non-disclosure (since that might led to stigma and discrimination) would make people distrust healthcare and shy away from it, thereby driving the epidemic underground.																														Anti-discrimination was based on the fundamental right to equality  that HIV positive status should not prevent persons from accessing services...and lead to their being treated unequally from others.																														These issues also exemplified the famous paradoxthat the best way to control HIV/AIDS is to protect those most vulnerable and those affected. Help, support and protection for the infected and their careers has been identified as a key strand of the campaign against HIV/AIDS... 																														There are certain ethical issues that are important considerations in the human rights-based approach to HIV/AIDS. With the realization that the denial of fundamental human rights had to be tackled for HIV/AIDS to be effectively controlled, other key legal issues addressing the fundamental right to life required consideration. It was noticed that those most susceptible to HIV/AIDS were persons who were legally and socially disempowered and whose basic rights were denied to them. These groups did not have the basic human rights to lead a wholesome life, which could guard them against public health crises, particularly HIV/AIDS. These populations included injecting drug users, prisoners, sex workers, women, women experiencing general violence, children, migrant workers and men who have sex with men.																														Therefore, it was understood that enforcing positive rights (the entire range of socio-economic rights), law reform and decriminalizing behaviours would help in controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS within these groups and, thereby, its spread within the general population as well. In order to achieve this, reviewing and amending laws that prejudice, criminalize and marginalize these groups is essential, and this needs to be supported by changes in underlying cultural and social attitudes.																														It is important to demonstrate the link between globally recognized human rights standards and the response to HIV/AIDS...																														HIV/AIDS, Stigma and Discrimination and Human Rights in South Asia: Research shows that discrimination is most frequently associated with diseases that have severe (incurable and progressive) outcomes and modes of transmission that are perceived to be under an individuals personal behavioural control. Unfortunately HIV/AIDS fits the criteria perfectly. HIV/AIDS discrimination has led to the use of such terms of leper to label those that are infected with disease as well as to brand them as others or deviants. Metaphors portraying AIDS as retribution or punishment for a sinful life or moral failure are a powerful indication of the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS. Through stigma, society often blames infected people for being ill and asserts the innocence and health of the stigmatizers. TO BE CONCLUDED

		 Friday, August 13, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Said the rioter to the writerOver under and around: essays in performance and culture (Seagull, Rs 450) by Richard Schechner is a collection of essays on avant garde or experimental theatres centred in Europe and North America but with counterparts throughout the world. Schechner, a theatre director and teacher, also writes on traditional theatres, especially in Asia, Native America and Trinidad. He is also deeply interested in Indian forms like yakshagana, kathakali and jatra. The theoretical core of this book is formed by two seminal essays on behaviour and on spectatorship, in which Schechner elaborates his notion of restored behaviour as living behaviour treated as a film director treats a strip of film. An absorbing, substantial and far-reaching book.Indias captains: from Nayudu to Ganguly (Penguin, Rs 250) by Partab Ramchand is a comprehensive account of the various aspects of cricket captaincy in India from 1932 to the present. It discusses the individual roles played by each captain, and the unique strategies employed by them, even as it takes the reader behind the scenes for a glimpse at the wheeling and dealing often involved in the selection of the captain.Husband of a fanatic (Penguin, Rs 295) by Amitava Kumar is a personal exploration of the relationship between India and Pakistan, and between Hinduism and Islam as multiply lived-out religions. Kumars account is triggered off by his marriage  in 1999, the year of the Kargil War  to a Pakistani Muslim. Kumar is a literary critic who was born in Bihar and teaches in Pennsylvania. His book ranges through Wagah, Patna, Bhagalpur, Karachi, Kashmir and even Johannesburg, unfolding a story of incomprehension, prejudice and violence that traverses the private and the global.Bombay meri jaan (Rupa, Rs 95) by Fiona Fernandez is a rather crazy, and sometimes crass, quiz-book based on the city of its title. The blurb describes Mumbai as an island city that is filled with millions of dreams, oodles of resilience and a never-say-die spirit. Some chapter headings: Mum Bhai, Lo Commotion and Sadak Chhaap.

		 Sunday, April 11, 2004 							 																						THE END OF MIGHTThe anarchy in Iraq today starkly questions the concept of untrammelled military power its motives as well as its fruits
Terrorism is grand theatre. These are the words of an American lieutenant colonel now keeping peace in Baghdad. He was referring to an explosion in Baghdads International Red Cross compound, sending out dark plumes of smoke into the sky. The journalist he was speaking to describes these plumes as the beacons, the lighthouses of contemporary Baghdad. This theatre seems to have shifted now to Falluja, 30 miles west of Baghdad. From this and neighbouring towns have been issuing, over the last couple of weeks, some of the most horrific images of savaged Americans to have come out of occupied Iraq so far. These images are making dramatically evident the depth and extent of Iraqi hostility to the United States of America and its principal allies in Iraq. The terrible theatricality of these scenes is also deliberately designed to change the worlds opinion regarding the nature of the coalitions presence in Iraq. 																														And this is already beginning to happen. With an international hostage crisis developing simultaneously in Iraq, the less powerful allies are finding it rather more difficult to be as resolute as Japan about not withdrawing their troops. The troops, which were originally meant to be there for peace-keeping and reconstruction, find themselves getting deeper into operations that are at the opposite extreme of either. In this, Spain and Japan (a country hitherto committed to an anti-war constitution) might be seen as taking opposite positions with regard to being tough on terror. And this opposition goes to the heart of the matter. The anarchy in Iraq today questions, starkly and radically, the concept of untrammelled military power itself  its motives as well as its fruits. The coalition troops spectacular inability to contain the burgeoning insurgency in Iraq brings to mind George Bernard Shaws observation that any political arrangement that depends on soldiers is not likely to continue long.																														It would be patently wrong, at this point, to call the violence in Iraq a civil war  as the Americans, understandably, still maintain. On the contrary, fighting against the common enemy seems to have brought Iraqs Shias and Sunnis together. Here too, Falluja, where around 450 Iraqis have died already, has become the symbol of a unity being fervently affirmed by influential clerics, young and old, from both sects. This, then, is not a civil war, but an armed uprising against the occupation forces. Iraqis are now openly using the word, intifada, to describe their action, evoking another, and closely related, saga of cyclical violence, born out of aggression and occupation.																														Mr George W. Bush had hoped to reinstate democracy in Mr Saddam Husseins dictatorship  only after first asserting his own absolute military superiority in that ravaged country. But, less than a couple of months before the official hand-over of sovereignty to the people of Iraq, with over 600 Americans dead and the people of Falluja burying their dead in the football stadium, what exactly do those words mean? And what do they say about the people who still invoke them to reassure the world, and themselves?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The wrong choice				 																																																				Sir  The decision to field Rahul Gandhi instead of his sister, Priyanka, is not surprising given that women are always considered second best in India (Sonia hands dynasty mantle to son, March 22). What surprises though is Sonia Gandhis decision to go by the patriarchal tradition of handing the family mantle to the first child, particularly so if it is male. Perhaps, she has forgotten that this mindset is responsible for the violence against Indian women  dowry deaths, killing of the girl child and distortion of marriage and inheritance laws. Politically, Rahul Gandhis candidature is not a masterstroke either. His sister has had a better grooming in politics  more participation in Congress electoral campaigns and organizational duties in Amethi  while Rahul is still learning the ropes. Madams decision reflects her desperation to prove her Indianness to counter the saffron partys barbs. But there are better ways of proving ones patriotism than preference for the son.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sohini Basu, Calcutta
				 																Mind your tongue				 																																																				Sir  It is unfortunate that despite being a former diplomat, Mani Shankar Aiyar is so careless about his choice of words. In Advanis second yatra (March 9), Aiyar has used the following expressions to describe prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ageing crock, unprincipled opportunist, a rudderless voyager to any available seat of power. He has also cast aspersions on Vajpayees contribution to the freedom movement. The deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, and the founder of the Jan Sangh, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, have also been targets of Aiyars diatribe  the former is compared with Adolf Hitler, and the latter branded communal. Aiyar should remember that had it not been for Mookerjee, the whole of Bengal would have gone to Pakistan, thanks to the Nehru-Jinnah nexus. Perhaps this Congress leader should brush up his history before beginning to doubt the integrity of these highly- respected individuals. By launching such personal attacks, Aiyar has only managed to tarnish his own image. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sankar Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Mani Shankar Aiyars impolite comments about the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders make us wonder about his speech-writing skills. As a columnist of The Telegraph, he is no better than an intellectual goon muttering profanities at Sonia Gandhis opposition. One is tempted to ask whether this is the natural trait of a sycophant.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Amiya K. Chaudhuri, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The blatant opportunism of the BJP leadership has been deftly exposed by Mani Shankar Aiyar. L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday Yatra makes it clear that the BJP leaders are not satisfied with their misinformation campaign. They are committed to create further unrest, and fool the people with their lies about nationhood and communal ties. One hopes that someone repeats Laloo Prasad Yadavs treatment of Advani.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Congress, especially Mani Shankar Aiyar, should thank its stars that it is the shameless power-monger, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and not the sincere Hindutvavadi, L.K. Advani, against whom Sonia Gandhi has to contest for the prime ministers chair. Which is why the Congress is still a political entity, although much reduced. When it is time for Advani to take the driving seat, the Congress, and Aiyar with it, will have ceased to exist. Advani, atop his Bharat Uday bus, is gradually steering saffron politics in that direction.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Agarwal, Calcutta

				 																Star power				 																																																				Sir  Whats wrong with film stars joining politics? The stars, being citizens of the country, have every right to contest elections, just as every other eligible adult in the country. The allegation that the stars received monetary compensation to join or campaign for political parties has not been proved yet. Even if they did charge a fee, there is nothing wrong in it. Remember, they are professionals who charge a fee for the service they render.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ullas Pradhan, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  Kavita Kapoor, who features in the soap, Kitty Party, recently stated that there is nothing wrong with canvassing for money (After rehearsal, stage fright, March 12). Kapoor should be asked whether it is fair on the part of cinestars to participate in politics to line their pockets, and con common people in the process. These celebrities should realize that they are role models to their fans. Under no circumstances should they allow unscrupulous politicians to win the elections by cashing in on their popularity. The next time the stars share the dais with politicians, they should remember that they owe their stardom to their fans who are being duped by their heroes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Syeda Kulsum Khan, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  Film stars entry into politics goes to prove their opportunism. They claim to champion peoples causes in order to curry personal favours and get party tickets to contest elections. The Election Commission should take necessary steps to stop film personalities from campaigning for political parties. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avinash Gupta, Bandel

				 																																																				Sir  It is still uncertain whether Govinda will contest against the Union petroleum minister, Ram Naik, in the north-east Mumbai Lok Sabha seat (Watch out Ram, Govinda is here, March 16). Although Govindas presence is likely to add teeth to the Congress campaign, the choice of contesting against a saffron top gun should be left to the star.Yours faithfully, 
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, via email 				 																																																				Sir  One can empathize with the likes of Vinod Khanna, Shatrughan Sinha and Hema Malini for taking the plunge into politics. With their reel life over, politics was the only other way to make a good living. But the urgency of newcomers like Namrata Shirodhkar, Celina Jaitley and Yukta Mookhey to join the bandwagon can only be explained by their desire to make quick money.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Sharma, Calcutta

		 Sunday, July 04, 2004  Figure it out
 							 - Nine of 16 Marxist suggestions have been carried out in full or partReform. The word has translated into burgeoning hope for Indias millions since Manmohan Singhs first budget in 1991. But now, in the run-up to Thursday, it has come to spell misgivings. Sumit Mitra reports on the constraints binding Budget 2004																														With Budget 2004 four days away, there is a distinct feeling that, somewhere down the line, the priorities of policy planners in the Capital have reached a crossroad. The known world suddenly seems strange and the established values stand upside down. 																														Take, for example, the word reform. Is the reformer a good guy, or not? Since Manmohan Singh got the Indian economy bailed out of disaster in 1991, and initiated structural reforms a year later, the word reform  hitherto unknown in the context of social or spiritual reform  suddenly became the ultimate badge of honour for political leaders. 																														Every finance minister after Manmohan Singh has worn the other hat of being a reformer  be it P. Chidambaram in his earlier avatar, or the BJPs two sound-alikes, Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh. And while economic reform became a fashionable concept, there were a few other shifts in the ethical perspective. 																														In an earlier era, economic success was pooh-poohed and every rich man was considered a thug. But, thanks to the reform buzz that began in the early 1990s, we Indians finally agreed with what Deng Xiaoping said while flagging off the Chinese reform: It is good to be rich. Is it an important thing any longer, in an India that has just shown the door to a government that identified with the Right in popular perception, to give reform a big hand? From now on, will the rich be lauded, or be given dirty looks? 																														The change in the countrys electoral configuration is insignificant, with minor difference in vote share between the victor and the vanquished. Yet the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) is working hard to put an ethical tinge to its victory, as though it was Kurukshetra revisited. 																														The UPA government of Manmohan Singh gave the first indication of being on a left- hand drive on May 27, when it came out with its Common Minimum Programme (CMP), a document of the socialist-era vintage. It said that the people of India had voted for parties wedded to the welfare of farmers, agricultural labour, weavers, workers and weaker sections of society. The new and aspiring middle-class of the past decade or so could rightfully feel alienated. 																														Nor was it an unintended impression. The Prime Minister soon began welcoming his new staff members with a terse one-liner: Itll not be business as usual. What is the business to be avoided? Manmohan Singh never specified, but his staff knew what he perhaps meant. The government under him in 2004 would be ideologically different from the finance ministry under him between 1991 and 1996. 																														Then came his letters to Cabinet colleagues, which said, There are lots of promises made in the Common Minimum Programme and we have to fulfil them. Then came the watchdog committees: the 19-member UPA coordination committee to develop the CMPs political coherence, with Congress president Sonia Gandhi at its helm and the 12-member National Advisory Council for the UPA to interface with the civil society, again with Sonia at its top. 																														It also became known that the CPM, or the Communist Party of India (Marxist), though not a signatory to its anagram, the CMP, had in fact exchanged drafts of the latter seven times with the UPA before its final approval. The Marxists final recommendations were made as late as May 26, a day before the CMP was announced, with 16 suggestions to further strengthen and modify the document, nine of which have been carried out in full or partially. 																														So, is it quick march, to the left? And, more importantly, to what extent will ideology hinder economic growth? However addressed to the gallery, the CMP too trusts and respects growth. It says that one of the basic principles of governance of the UPA Government supported by the Left parties will be: to ensure that the economy grows at least 7-8 per cent per year in a sustained manner over a decade and more. 																														The task is easier said than done. In the 53 years since 1951-52, its only in 12 years that the economy grew more than 7 per cent, with the earlier tenure of Manmohan Singh as finance minister accounting for a quarter of this. The UPA, though hopeful, has kept an escape hatch open. The Prime Minister says he wants reform with a human face. Sanjaya Baru, his newly-appointed media advisor, says the UPA government is not looking at growth as an end in itself but as a means to create jobs, eradicate poverty and ensure a better quality of life in general. Jairam Ramesh, the high profile Congress MP and member of the National Advisory Council, says that the UPA would rather settle for a lower growth rate than destroy the nations social fabric the way the NDA regime did. 																														But the facts are stark enough. Unless the economy grows in general, and not merely in the agriculture sector, there may be a hefty price to pay in the upcoming Assembly election in the industrially most advanced state of Maharashtra. A single electoral defeat can turn the UPA coalition wobbly. Can the government deliver growth regardless? The doubts being expressed on this count are as follows: 																					INFLATION																														With the annual rise in the wholesale price index hovering around 6 per cent, and at least 1.5 per cent more to come when the full effect of the rise in global crude price is passed on to consumers, a hardening of interest rates seems not too far ahead. And thats touch-and-go for a host of bubbles to burst  real estate, automobile loans, capital market, etc. 																					WASTED WELFARE																														The government spends over Rs 17,000 crore a year in rural development schemes and is willing to raise it substantially this year. But much of the fund hardly reaches the panchayats as it is squirrelled away by the state governments to pay employees salaries or to meet debt obligations. The Prime Minister called a meeting of the chief ministers last week to obtain their nod for dispatching the fund directly to the most poverty-stricken districts. The meeting was an unmitigated disaster, with some of the heavyweights like West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya and the Congress CMs of Delhi, Kerala and Uttaranchal staying away.																														The CPM response was hardly unexpected as its May 26 note on the CMP spelt out that it would not support any allocation of funds directly to the panchayat bodies bypassing the state governments.																														The view had a surprising resonance in not only the Congress but in the BJP too.																					LABOUR																														As economies grow, more and more of the workforce will shift from the unorganised sector to the organised, where growth potentials are the highest. 																														But India has only 8.5 per cent of the workforce in the organised sector as its stringent labour laws, notably the Industrial Disputes Act, dont permit downsizing of the labour force. The CMP says that the Industrial Disputes Act will remain intact, it will not even be re-examined. That ruins the hope of new and large industrial units with high volumes of production and the consequent economies of scale.																					SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY																														Indias low-technology industries offer most of the employment, and bring exports, but they are bound by ceilings of size, which is itself an offshoot of the Gandhian concept of promoting village industry. While its small size does not permit it to achieve cost reduction, the reservation of categories for the small-scale sector has made SSI a beehive of rent-seekers  by evading excise or obtaining interest concessions. 																														Manmohan Singh, as the reformer finance minister in the 1990s, was quick to understand the problem and initiate de-reservation of 842 items. The number is now stuck at 675, though expert committees have called for total abolition of the reservation system.																														Present indications are to the contrary. The draft note on the Small Enterprises Development Bill 2004 addresses issues related to registration, credit, marketing and trade protection, but not reservation.																					TARIFF																														Both the PM and the finance minister are committed to leave the tariff structure unchanged in 2004-05, which leaves the Indian collection rates (customs and CVD) among the highest in Asia. It is protecting inefficiencies. The early signals are no doubt disconcerting. But so far the UPA government has given no indication that it would take measures that might create doubts about India liberalising its economy. 																														It may review a few of the reformist laws but will at best tinker with them and leave. It is committed to the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which will bring the revenue deficit (gap between revenue receipt and revenue expenditure) to zero by 2009. That means blocking the road back to a bloated government and the patronage Raj. 																														But, fresh from an electoral victory, the UPA Government is gripped with self-doubt. Why did the Vajpayee government lose? If it lost because it failed to relate to the poor, then could the poor do the same thing to them in the next election round the corner, in Maharashtra, if they failed to prove their difference from the BJP? So Manmohan must talk left and walk right, much like what his Marxist allies are doing in their citadel in Bengal. On Thursday, it will surely be the turn of Chidambaram to present the budget. But it is the Prime Ministers skill at reconciling the conflicting demands of economics and politics which is being put to test. LaloonomicsIn Bihar, where votes are caste, the stalwart of its caste politics, Laloo Prasad Yadav, will be the first to move the UPA governments policy document in the Lok Sabha, as he presents the Railway Budget on Tuesday. But, ahead of that, he has begun efforts to turn the 63,028-kilometre Indian Railways, employing 1.6 million of the 3.6 million central government employees, into a gravy train of patronage. Railway reforms will be pursued, declares the CMP. But Yadav has other ideas. Consider this: the crucial issue of safety on the railways hinges on the efficiency of the Railway Protection Force personnel. Till 1998, the appointment of RPF sub-inspectors and constables, forming over 90 per cent of the force, was either through bribe or ministerial patronage. After 1998, the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) was revamped, with its chairman ceasing to be a political appointee, and all RPF appointments were made through the board. Now Yadav has announced that constables would be appointed through a Railway Officers Committee, thus putting it beyond the RRBs reach and making it discretionary once again. It comes at a time when the number of vacancies of RPF constables has reached 8,000. Passenger fares and freight rates have been substantially harmonised in the past five years, with 59 classes of goods attracting different rates brought down to 30, and a standard formula guiding different passenger fares from ordinary class to AC first class. But Yadav is now working on newer concessions to coal, perhaps with Bihar in mind, and steeper AC fares. As a result, more coal will be trucked and more passengers will travel by road, or fly, leaving the over-stretched railway economy, working on a staggeringly high operating ratio of 92 per cent, without any internal funds for track renewal and modernisation, the twin goals CMP promises.

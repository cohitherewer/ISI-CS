Penguin, Rs 250
Nine out of the ten stories in this collection first appeared in magazines. Thus Manjula Padmanabhan had to keep within the tight word-count of a magazines pages and conform to specific themes. The constraints of space give to these stories a feeling of slightness. Kleptomania is not high literature  the stories in the collection may, at best, enliven a long train journey or provide engrossing reading for a Sunday afternoon  to be put out of mind soon after. Love and the sexual morality of the rich and fine-living class are the primary concerns in most of the stories, quite in keeping with the interests of the readers of the magazines where they were published Outlook, Mans World, Book Review, and a glamorous womens magazine, for some reason left unnamed by the author. 																					But Padmanabhans versatility, the scope of her imagination and the acuity of her observation are on full display in these stories. Over and above the here-and-now pieces, the collection includes a murder mystery as well as three stories from the genre of science fiction. 																					It is these three that are by far the most interesting  and not just because of the way every detail of Padmanabhans future logically comes together to present a picture of a world that is complete in itself. What is remarkable is the humour with which she manages to infuse even the grimmest of scenarios. 																					Sharing air is built on the unremarkable premise that late in the 21st century, the air will be so polluted that men will have to wear face-masks and the air they breathe will be directly pumped into their nostrils by breathing tubes. But the idea becomes a farce with the members of the ToxiClub, a kind of underground group which is nostalgic about the past (our present, in this instance) when people had the freedom to breathe in air that had noxious chemicals, construction dust, soot and at its meetings, projects 3-D images of 20th-century garbage dumps. The puritanical narrator of the story is disgusted with these antics; she speculates that perhaps the very process of sharing air, like, say, sharing a reefer, is intoxicating and addles the brain.																					Gandhi toxin, the second of these, is plain hilarious. The world of this story is a bio-technology nightmare full of battalions of cloned troops who are germinated in a petri-dish and gestate in artificial wombs; and artificial organs and whole-body replacements for those who can afford them. This world of unbridled aggression is thrown into a tizzy when a genetic experiment results in a hybrid molecule, called the Gandhi toxin, which induces weapons-grade compassion. 																					This ability to stretch an idea so far that it becomes funny is evident in the story, Kleptomania, the only story not to be published earlier. The central idea here is that writers are kleptomaniacs, who compulsively and wilfully steal from their family, friends and everyone they come into contact with. As a hypothesis to explain the interplay of the real and the imaginative, it is not very original. But what is riveting is the way the idea is developed in a dinner-table conversation, punctuated by attending waiters, food being passed around, the sound of chicken legs being chomped, the small niceties of social interaction. But the unnecessary sensationalism of the storys ending is disappointing.																					Padmanabhan is best as the ironic commentator on the foibles of the new yuppie culture, and on how it seeks to reconcile outmoded morals with a new permissiveness  a pregnant unmarried girl reconciles her abortion with respect for life, a young privileged girl from a broken family tries to break down the barriers between rich and poor, but fails completely. It is these that make these stories morality tales for our times.						GARGI GUPTA

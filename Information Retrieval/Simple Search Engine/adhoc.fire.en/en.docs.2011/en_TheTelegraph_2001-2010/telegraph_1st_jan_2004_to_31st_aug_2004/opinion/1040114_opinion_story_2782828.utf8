																								The gong has been sounded for the most important carnival of modern India. The prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has announced that the days of the current Lok Sabha are numbered. The exact date of the dissolution is still a matter of speculation but there is no manner of doubt that it will be sooner rather than later. After that the ball will be in the court of the Election Commission which will decide on poll dates and modalities. Mr Vajpayee has taken nobody by surprise with his decision to have early polls. All the signs were pointing in that direction. The popularity of the National Democratic Alliance and the standing of the prime minister himself have never been as high as they are currently. To borrow and alter an expression that did the rounds in Britain in the late Fifties, the Bharatiya Janata Party has never had it so good. The objective circumstances  the economy, the demoralization of the Congress and so on  are now in favour of the BJP and its allies. The country is now basking in what has been dubbed the feel good factor and the BJP, as the party that leads the incumbent government, sees the feel good factor as the best insurance against incumbency, the bugbear of most outgoing governments during elections. The NDA government has also driven the feel good factor by a clutch of announcements which can be only be described as a pre-poll largesse.																								Elections are a massive experiment in democracy, the like of which, in terms of sheer size, is seldom seen elsewhere in the world. But a new chemical agent has been added to the experiment over the last two elections: alliances. In a sense, alliances have always been present but they were never as critical as they are now for the formation of a government at the Centre. Coalitions alone can provide a viable and stable government. The days of a single-party government are over. Matchmaking has thus become an essential prerequisite of electoral politics. In this, the BJP has stolen a march over its chief rival, the Congress. The latter was slow to realize and accept that a tectonic shift had taken place in Indian politics. The altered circumstances have also signalled the death of ideology. Alliances are being made not on the basis of shared ideology but on the realities of power and its sharing. The lid is finally off the real nature of Indian politics. But beyond the alliances, there is a choice of a leader. The forthcoming general elections, in a very fundamental sense, will be a test of the countrys confidence in Mr Vajpayee as prime minister. By extension, it will also mean a similar test for Ms Sonia Gandhi, the prime minister in waiting.

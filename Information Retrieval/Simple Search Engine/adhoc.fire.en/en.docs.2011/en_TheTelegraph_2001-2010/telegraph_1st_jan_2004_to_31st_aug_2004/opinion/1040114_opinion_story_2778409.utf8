The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Explorer on the moon				 																																																				 Sir  With very little left to conquer on earth, George W. Bush is aiming for the moon, literally (Moon first, Mars next: US finds new playground, Jan 10). The American presidents obsession with the earths satellite is an extension of his imperial designs on terra firma. Such expeditions do not add to our existing scientific knowledge. On the contrary, they reflect the United States of Americas desire to have a larger share of the  space pie than its Asian and European competitors like Japan, China and Russia. But playing oneupmanship games in space can have tragic consequences, as was seen by the disintegration of the Columbia shuttle and Ronald Reagans ill-fated Star Wars programme. If only he cared to look around him, Bush would find that there were far more deserving recipients of any surplus cash the Americans can spare  the poor, the hungry and the millions afflicted by AIDS. It is the least Bush can do to atone for his numerous sins in Iraq. Unless, of course, he were looking for Osama bin Laden on the moon.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Palash Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																Future perfect				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayees move to normalize relations with Pakistan is a giant step forward for the people of south Asia (The twain meet, and that is enough, Jan 6). Citizens of both countries want peace and their numbers are significant enough for them to influence government policy. Friendly relations between the neighbours will help the governments to channelize funds used now for military purposes into social welfare. Future generations must not suffer for crimes they never committed. The leaders of both countries should be applauded for their courage, which triumphed over selfishness and hypocrisy. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Biswajit Chanda, Guwahati

				 																																																				Sir  Notwithstanding the present bonhomie between India and Pakistan, it is too much to expect years of mistrust, hate and suspicion to be replaced by warmth and camaraderie so fast. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soumen Majumdar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Against the backdrop of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit which concluded in Islamabad recently, the media highlighted many interesting sidelights about Pakistan. There are many aspects to Pakistan that Indians would do well to emulate. The capital city, Islamabad, is newly constructed and well maintained; encroachments are not allowed here. Taking a cue from this, we too should clear our roads and footpaths to facilitate the smooth flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 				 																																																				Thanks to the double-standards of our politicians, India has not been able to institute 33 per cent reservation for women in legislatures. But the Pakistani constitution permits 17 per cent reservation for women in legislatures, which is more than India has. In the general elections to be held this year, the government should compel all political parties to reserve 33 per cent tickets for women. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  The failure of LoC Kargil at the box office should make every thinking person happy. One, it proves that jingoism does not yet rule over the hearts and minds of film-buffs in India. Two, it shows that a film still succeeds for its content, and not because of hype and publicity. And three, had the film succeeded, we would have been deluged with similar hate-Pakistan movies at a time the two countries are trying to make peace. Can we now hope for a few genuine war films from Bollywood, of the order of Tora! Tora! Tora! and Enemy at the gates, instead of the jingoistic rubbish that has been masquerading as that genre till now?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

				 																																																				Sir The recent SAARC summit can only be called successful if SAARC gains a position equivalent to the North American Free Trade Area or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Sadly, as an effective regional economic group, SAARC is nowhere near the European Union, NAFTA and ASEAN. There is very little trade among member nations. 				 																																																				For example, Indias trade with SAARC nations is a little more than 2 per cent of its global trade. There are also many visa restrictions for business travel in the region. SAARC also lacks the unity of the other groups; it is yet to create a free trade zone in the region. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Snail mail blues				 																																																				Sir Long queues of small investors in front of post offices are a common sight. Most of these people are old, retired and suffer from health problems related to old age. With no one to depend on, they have to stand in queue personally to collect the interest amount. Postal authorities should consider introducing post-dated interest warrants to replace the present system in order to give some relief to senior citizens.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Partha Sarkar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Centre gives state governments a share in the postal monthly interest scheme. This alleviates the pressure from state governments on the Centre for funds and also helps the states. The ceiling for such schemes, at present is Rs 3 lakh for individuals and Rs 6 lakh for joint investments. The ceiling should be increased to Rs 5 and Rs 8 lakh, respectively, and the money used to finance development activities.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P.K. Sen, Calcutta

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  Thousands of paper flags will be used to make festoons on the occasion of Republic day. These flags will drop down on the streets the next day and will be trampled upon by unsuspecting and uncaring pedestrians. This is a gross disrespect of the tricolour. The government and the judiciary should stop mass manufacture and sale of paper flags, which are likely to be thus misused.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R.S. Shankar, Calcutta

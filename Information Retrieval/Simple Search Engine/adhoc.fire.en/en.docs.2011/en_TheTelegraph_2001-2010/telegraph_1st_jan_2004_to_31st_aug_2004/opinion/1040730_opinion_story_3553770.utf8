The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 30, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																That opaque and harsh countryThe veiled kingdom (Virago, 7.75) by Carmen Bin Ladin is a grimly readable account, written by the Swiss-Persian wife of Yeslam Bin Ladin, one of Osamas brothers. Prompted by the upheaval created by 9/11 in her own life and in the lives of her three daughters, Carmen takes it upon herself to make her own position clear with respect to her husband, to his clan, and to that opaque and harsh country, Saudi Arabia. This is principally a deeply personal account of how freedom could be compromised in various spheres of public and private life for women like Carmen and her daughters. I have lived in the Bin Laden clan and experienced the workings of Saudi society, and I fear for the future of the free world.The world unseen (Review, 7.99) by Shamim Sarif is a novel set in the apartheid South Africa of the Fifties. Two women meet in this world, which divides white from black, black from Asian, and women from men, and struggle to make their bond survive. When she breathed the hot dry air, she could smell a burnt dust smell that she knew would form a part of everything she inhaled from this time onwards; she could already sense the scent of it lying lightly on her skin.																												The eternal child: How evolution has made children of us all (Ebury, 4.55) by Clive Bromhall is written by a zoologist and compels the reader to think of human evolution in terms of a single idea  we are apes that simply fail to grow up; over the past 6 million years, we have increasingly come to resemble hugely overgrown babies. Bromhalls theory rests rather heavily on a view of the male homosexual as the extreme child that anti-essentialists will find rather objectionable.Jennifer government (Abacus, 2.99) by Max Barry is a futurist novel set in a world run by giant American corporations. Everybody will be so happy, tax-free and rich that they will change their name to that of their company. Hack Nike, however, is a lowly Merchandising Officer with negative career equity. In the future this is not a good thing. So when John Nike and John Nike offer Hack Nike a job marketing a new line of really expensive trainers, Hack is understandably thrilled. He is less thrilled, though, when he discovers that his duties include shooting teenagers. The woman flicked the pages of Johns CV back and forward, back and forward. He forced himself to wait. He was not going to lose his cool with this interviewer, no matter how much of a condescending, tight-haired, natty-glasses-wearing bitch she was.

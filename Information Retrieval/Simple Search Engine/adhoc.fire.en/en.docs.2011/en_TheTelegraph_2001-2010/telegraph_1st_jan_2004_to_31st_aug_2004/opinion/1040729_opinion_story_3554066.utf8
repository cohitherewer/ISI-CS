		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 							 																						AVOID TAKING THE CRASH COURSE						DOCUMENT From the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention by the WHO, Geneva, 2004				 	 With a little care																														Analysis of available crash data and other road traffic research shows that while the main road-safety problems experienced in various parts of the world often differ in quality and quantity, they have many characteristics in common. The dominant, common characteristics of the risks associated with road traffic are as follows: 																														Unnecessary travel, the choice of less safe travel modes and routes, and unsafe mixes of traffic all lead to increased risk.																														The design of roads and road networks is an important factor. Exposure to risk is increased by road networks failing to route heavy traffic around populated areas or to separate pedestrians from motorized traffic.																														Excess and inappropriate speed is widespread and may contribute to around 30 per cent of road traffic crashes and deaths. In collisions at 80 kilometre/hour, car occupants run a 20 times higher risk of being killed than at 30 km/h. Pedestrians have a 90 per cent chance of surviving car crashes at 30 km/h or below, but less than a 50 per cent chance of surviving impacts at 45 km/h or above.																														Impairment by alcohol continues to contribute to crash injury and increases the risk. All non-zero blood alcohol concentration levels carry more risk than zero-BAC, and crash-risk starts to rise sharply at levels of 0.04 g/dl. Legal BAC limits set at 0.10 g/dl allow three times more risk than limits set at 0.05 g/dl; at 0.08 g/dl, the risk is twice as much as that at 0.05 g/dl. 																														Young novice drivers are at increased risk of crash injury; the risk among teenage drivers is higher than among any other comparable age group. Excess or inappropriate speed is a common contributory factor in crashes involving young drivers.																														Pedestrians, cyclists and motorized two-wheeler users bear a disproportionate share of the global road injury burden and are all at high risk of crash injury.																														For all road users, the risk of crash injury is increased by failing to see and failing to be seen. If daytime running lights were used, almost a third of all motorized two-wheeler crashes involving lack of visibility could be avoided; in the case of cars, more than 10 per cent of such crashes could be avoided.																														The non-use of seat-belts and child restraints more than doubles the risk of serious and fatal injury, as does the non-use of bicycle helmets. Similarly, the non-use of crash helmets by motorized two-wheeler users almost doubles their risk of serious or fatal head injury.																														Crash analysis shows that the majority of pedestrian fatalities involve impact with unprotective car fronts. If all cars were designed to provide protection equivalent to that of the best car in the same class, an estimated half of all fatal and disabling injuries to car occupants would be avoided. Roadside design and the positioning of objects play key roles in determining crash injury, and influence the behaviour of road users.																														Inadequate post-crash care is a major problem in many places. The availability and quality of such care has a substantial effect on whether a road injury leads to subsequent death or disability.																														The availability in low-income countries of data on road traffic crashes is often basic. For a proper understanding of the risk factors predominating in local settings, more investment for systematic, independent and high-quality research is needed, particularly from high-income countries. Such worldwide research into the causes of crashes and crash injury is essential for achieving safer traffic systems. CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 							 																						LEFT LIABILITY																														There is an embarrassment called Mr Biman Bose. For the Left Front, the embarrassment is aggravated by the fact that Mr Bose is its chairman. Most people, even politicians, grow up and learn to be responsible. Those who are fortunate enough to hold high office also learn to honour the dignity of the chair they occupy. All this has passed by Mr Bose. He believes that he can still act the way he did when, in the distant past, he was a firebrand student leader. He thinks, as chairman of the Left Front he can get by saying things which are best uttered in an adda session in the Coffee House in College Street. Thus he declaimed the other day that poll observers who were overstepping their brief would be manhandled by the political cadre and taken to the police station. To express ones disapproval at the conduct of the poll observers is one thing but to actually threaten them with physical violence is quite a different kettle of fish. Mr Bose has perhaps created a record of sorts because the Election Commission has decided to file a first information report against Mr Bose. It is a matter of great shame that a senior political leader of West Bengal should behave so irresponsibly and bring ignominy upon himself.																														There are two distinct ways of handling the disgrace that Mr Bose has brought upon himself and on the Left Front. He could be made to apologize to the EC and then to step down as chairman. This would be the most honourable and the most straightforward way of doing things. The other way of handling the matter is to indulge in some dissembling. This would involve saying nothing publicly and to gradually minimize Mr Boses public appearances and then to put him to grass. Given the nature of Indian politics  no Indian politician, in recent memory, had ever admitted mistakes and said sorry  the second alternative will be the one that will be followed after Mr Boses outrageous gaffe. Mr Boses statement, taken to its logical conclusion, is tantamount to obstructing the process of holding free and fair elections. Mr Bose obviously believes that anything that is ostensibly against the interests of the left in West Bengal is unfair and undemocratic. This cannot be the attitude of a mature person. It is also a failure to accept difference and hence it is anti-democratic as well. This is not the first time that Mr Bose has acted in this manner. He, in fact, wears his irresponsibility like a habit. He is in the process of making a quick transition from being an embarrassment to becoming a political liability. The left would inflict no damage on itself if Mr Bose is left behind.

		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 							 																						DICTATES OF THE CONSCIENCE						DOCUMENT From the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949				 	 Measure for measure																														Article 129: The high contracting parties undertake to enact any legislation necessary to provide effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be committed, any of the grave breaches of the present Convention defined in the following article. Each high contracting party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts. It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another high contracting party concerned, provided such high contracting party has made out a prima facie case.																														Each high contracting party shall take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present Convention other than the grave breaches defined in the following article. In all circumstances, the accused persons shall benefit by safeguards of proper trial and defence, which shall not be less favourable than those provided by article 105 and those following of the present Convention.																														Article 130: Grave breaches to which the preceding article relates shall be those involving any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, compelling a prisoner of war to serve in the forces of the hostile power, or wilfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in this Convention.																														Article 131: No high contracting party shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other high contracting party of any liability incurred by itself or by another high contracting party in respect of breaches referred to in the preceding article.																														Article 132: At the request of a party to the conflict, an inquiry shall be instituted, in a manner to be decided between the interested parties, concerning any alleged violation of the Convention.																														If agreement has not been reached concerning the procedure for the enquiry, the parties should agree on the choice of an umpire who will decide upon the procedure to be followed.																														Once the violation has been established, the parties to the conflict shall put an end to it and shall repress it with the least possible delay																														Article 142: Each of the high contracting party shall be at liberty to denounce the present Convention. The denunciation shall be notified in writing to the Swiss Federal Council, which shall transmit it to the governments of all high contracting parties.																														The denunciation shall take effect one year after the notification thereof has been made to the Swiss Federal Council. However, a denunciation of which notification has been made at a time when the denouncing power is involved in a conflict shall not take effect until peace has been concluded, and until after operations connected with release and repatriation of the persons protected by the present Convention have been terminated.																														The denunciation shall have effect only in respect of the denouncing power. It shall in no way impair the obligations which the parties to the conflict shall remain bound to fulfil by virtue of the principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience.

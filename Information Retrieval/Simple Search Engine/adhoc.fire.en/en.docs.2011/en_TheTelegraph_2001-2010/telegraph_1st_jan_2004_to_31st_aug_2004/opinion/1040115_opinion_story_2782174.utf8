		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 							 																						BIG FISH ALWAYS PREY ON THE SMALL Parimal Bhattacharya																								The recent plagiarism suit by the French author, Franck le Calvez, against Disney Corporation, the producers of the movie, Finding Nemo, has caught international attention because of the wider cultural resonances of the controversy. Nemo, the white-striped fish with large bulging eyes, bears an uncanny physical likeness with Le Calvezs Pierrot Le Poisson Clown. Le Calvez also alleges that the film follows a parallel trajectory to his story  both Nemo and Pierrot begin their lives in anemones and lose their parents to deadly predators. 																								A French court will debate in February whether such similarities amount to plagiarism. But a whole range of issues is involved here. For one, here is a young self-published author accusing a giant American movie company of stealing his idea and causing him financial losses. After the films release in France, bookstores were unwilling to take Le Calvezs book. For the proponents of global laws on intellectual property, this case illustrates the need for agreements on the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, as conventional copyright laws cannot deal with a dispute of such transnational nature. Local deaths																								Globalization has killed regional cultures and languages. As a counterpoint, multinational entertainment industries have begun to snap up indigenous cultural and artistic forms. From Madonna evoking African black magic in her music video to Nusrat Fateh Alis ghazal on the soundtrack of Dead Man Walking, the appropriations have ranged from the kitsch to the solemn. The other side of the story is harsh and bleak, since Disney Corporation can easily devour Le Calvezs small fries. The question is: should laws relating to intellectual property seek to protect the big fish or the small one?																								The only pan-Indian genre of popular art that has relentlessly engaged with the diverse local cultural forms is the commercial Hindi cinema. From North-eastern tribal dances to Rajasthani folk tunes, Konkani music to nautanki, there have been brazen appropriations, distortions and dislocations. Today, many of these indigenous art forms are dying. Whenever an art form attached to a community or region is picked up by a formidable entertainment industry, it loses its innocence. The Apna Utsavs in the Eighties failed to engage the interest of urban audiences, fed on adulterated versions of folk forms through Hindi cinema. Can any law on intellectual property rights, national or international, protect the interest of an indigenous art form and its practitioners? Can a community take a movie maker to court for unauthorized use of a tune or a dance form?  French connection																								Such questions are redundant, because in the global marketplace of art and culture, the emphasis is on individual creativity and mercenary interests. An idea or a figment of imagination is a commodity and demands to be treated as such. Significantly, the production of Finding Nemo was completed by the time Le Calvezs book came out. But the French author had taken his idea to many film production companies before committing it to book form. That was when, his lawyer argues, the idea was stolen. Disney Corp has denied this and claimed that their Nemo is 100 per cent original. 																								From the point of view of artistic principles, such assertions are completely off the mark. No work of art can be absolutely original. Also, ideas travel and cross-pollinate in different fields of art and culture. Some of the classic Disney productions are rooted in the rich European folk lore and fairy stories. In fact, according to some cultural historians, story as an art form was not Europes own and only reached there from the Indian subcontinent. Given that the Statute of Anne  the mother of the modern copyright act  was enacted in England in 1710, putting ones signature on an idea or a piece of imagination is a fairly recent invention. In a country like India with overlapping cultures, such an idea is yet to take shape.

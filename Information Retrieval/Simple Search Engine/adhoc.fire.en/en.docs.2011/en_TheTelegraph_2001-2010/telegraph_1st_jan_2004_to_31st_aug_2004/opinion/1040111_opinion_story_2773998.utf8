 							 - Secret understanding between BJP and SP has begun The battle for the polls has begun.  Bloody hatchets are being hastily buried and cosy futures  chalked out. Bishakha De Sarkar reports on the jumbled  game of numbers In the spotlight
 Mayavati: Is working on  a courtship with the Congress  Mulayam Singh: Is holding  secret talks with the BJP  Jayalalithaa: Would  like  to do a Chandrababu Naidu  Sharad Pawar: Is keeping  his post-poll options open Amazon.com  that useful Internet site on most matters literary  gives an interesting insight into the reading habits of those who have been making delicate inquiries about Dale Carnegies confidence-building book, How To Make Friends And Influence People. Most people who acquired the best-seller from the website, it states, also bought a book called How to Stop Worrying.																								The link is not all that tenuous, for, clearly, many of those who wish to make friends also hope to erase those fret lines over their foreheads. And in the Indian political arena, where the election bugle  though officially still to be sounded  has kicked off a chaotic sprint for friends and allies, success is in direct proportion to the number of friendly players in the game.																								There was a time, not so long ago, when the first signs of an election were private confabulations and early public meetings. Now, an election comes with a To Let sign. Its been eight years since a single party ruled at the Centre as a minority government. Now, whoever rules in New Delhi will do so on a myriad platform. Till 1998, when a Third Front coalition collapsed after barely two years of governance, it seemed that a rag-tag outfit had little chance of surviving a full term. But six years and two National Democratic Alliance (NDA) governments later, its clear that coalitions are here to stay. 																								Political equations are changing overnight. Bloody hatchets are being hastily buried and cosy futures chalked out. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is lunching with deputy prime minister .K. Advani. DMK leader M. Karunanidhi is looking benignly at his old enemy, the Congress. Samajwadi Party leader and UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is holding secret talks with his one-time baiter, Bharatiya Janata Party. And Ram Vilas Paswan, out in the boondocks for some time, is talking to everybody.																								The battle for the polls has begun, and the outcome will depend on the equations forged. The stage is set, says the BJPs chief ally-maker, Pramod Mahajan. Now all that we need is the micro-play. 																								Its one of those fast-moving plays where protagonists and sets change by the minute. The BJP had scripted its play and lined up its cast well before the curtains went up. It had good reasons to act early, for it knew the perils of being friendless at the Centre. In 1996, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was first sworn in as Prime Minister, his government fell in 13 days because it had only two allies  the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal. 																								Badly rebuffed, the BJP sat down to build bridges. Advani, who has considerable links with political leaders, pushed the mostly non-controversial Vajpayee as a prime ministerial candidate, while keeping the partys doors open to political outfits that were once hostile to the BJP. It was Advanis masterstroke  and it worked, says BJP leader Sunil Shastri.																								But the Congress has not been idly sitting back either. Senior Congressman Pranab Mukherjee points out that the need for coalitions was first voiced at a party conclave in Panchmarhi, elaborated in Bangalore and emphasised at its Shimla Sankalp in July. We are clear that a pre-poll alliance will help us, Mukherjee says.																								It was because the electoral battleground was being readied that the Congress  interested in keeping its channels with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Mayavati open  did not join the Mulayam government in UP. It was with an alliance in mind that Sonia Gandhi was among the first to call on a hospitalised Kanshi Ram, the reason why the party vocally condemned CBIs probes into Mayavatis assets. There has been an aggressive, mutual courting, says an AICCI member.																								In the BJP, informal talks with possible allies have been on for a while. Insiders stress that a secret understanding between the BJP and SP has been building up over the last few months. Union minister Arun Jaitley has been in touch with Mulayam Singhs lieutenant, Amar Singh. The two are believed to have together worked out the seats that SP candidates contested from in the last assembly polls. 																								When Yadav became chief minister in Uttar Pradesh after the BJP helped install it by toppling the Mayavati government, it was hinted that Yadav would reply in kind after the Parliamentary elections. Till then, Amar Singh is keeping the white flag flying high. He has also built up a rapport with Vajpayees foster son-in-law, Ranjan Bhattacharya. SP observers recall that he visited Vajpayee on his birthday on December 25, and reverentially touched his feet when the Prime Minister went to Lucknow and was received at the airport by Yadav and Singh. 																								Insiders hold that in the private discussions that are on between the SP and the BJP, minute details such as possible Central portfolios for Amar Singh have also been discussed. But these are talks at an informal level, says a BJP leader. Someone says: Okay we will give you commerce and so on. But all this will have to be thrashed out later, he says.																								These are also developments that can change overnight. For instance, the BJP had been wooing Sharad Pawar for a while, and Pawar himself had reasons for wanting to break with the Congress, its coalition partner in Maharashtra. The NCP and the Congress have been fighting every inch in Maharashtra, says a senior Congress leader from the state. Pawar, not one to be content out of power for long, believes that the NCP-Congress coalition is unlikely to return to power in the state. So, a fortnight ago, he met Advani for lunch at the DPMs residence, and expressed his willingness to join the NDA.																								Bal Thackeray  one of Pawars bitter opponents  did not welcome the idea of the NCP joining the BJP-Shiv Sena combine in Maharashtra, even though the ice had been broken between the two Marathas when they were convalescing together in the same Mumbai hospital recently. But Thackeray had a meeting with Advani in Mumbai, and reluctantly gave his assent.																								The thaw, however, was short-lived. The Shiv Sena has refused to give up even a part of its share of the 48 seats in the state to the NCP. Sources say that Pawar was offered 11 seats by the BJP, which falls short of the 24-odd seats that Pawar hopes to wangle out of the Congress if the old coalition stays. Despite the fact that many in the Congress believe that Pawar may join with the NDA in a post-poll arrangement even if it fights the elections in Maharashtra with the Congress, efforts are on to keep him back. And though chief minister Sushil Shinde has been actively confabulating with Pawar, a quiet visit by Manmohan Singh to Mumbai over the weekend is believed to have struck the deal. We have retained the NCP  its almost final, says a senior Congress leader.																								Like Manmohan Singh, there are a few top negotiators in both the Congress and the BJP camps who are being sent out to gather friends. Singh was in Tamil Nadu last week for a meeting with Karunanidhi, before leaving for Mumbai. Sonia Gandhi is talking to old foes as well  including Ramvilas Paswan and Mulayam Singh Yadav. Pranab Mukherjee and Natwar Singh are among Congress leaders who have been on the forefront of the campaign, and Gandhi is deciding on the constitution of a committee for coalitions. 																								The Congress is also using the services of the Left. CPI leader A.B. Bardhan had a meeting with Pawar in New Delhi last week, and both Bardhan and CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet have been talking to Paswan, who is weighing both the NDA and Congress offers. An amorphous coalition of parties opposed to the Telugu Desam and led by the Congress is being worked out for Andhra Pradesh.																								Our primary objective is to dislodge the BJP from power, says CPI National Council secretary D.Raja. Everything is aimed at that, he says. 																								In the BJP, apart from the two top leaders  Vajpayee and Advani  talks are mostly being carried out by the two leading organisational backroom boys, Jaitley and Mahajan. I do the job that is given to me, says Mahajan. But by nature I am friendly with everybody and anybody, he says.																								Still, not many are willing to predict who will finally align with whom before the polls, or even after. The developments in Tamil Nadu seem to underline the fact that things are still in a state of flux, even though the Congress is on a surer wicket with the DMK. Among those who helped the DMK-Congress come together was Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna, who forged a relationship with the Tamil Nadu leader when the police forces of the two states were together working for the release of actor Raj Kumar, kidnapped by sandalwood smuggler Veerappan.																								But the joker in the Tamil Nadu pack is chief minister J.Jayalalithaa, who pulled out of the first NDA government in 1999, leading to an early election. While the BJP has been hoping to strike a pre-poll arrangement with her, Jayalalithaa herself is not so sure of that. I made a big mistake when I supported the NDA, she told a visiting Rajya Sabha member recently. I couldnt be Chandrababu Naidu. This time I wont make that mistake, she said. As of now, Jayalalithaa wants to fight the elections on her own, and then get the maximum possible out of a would-be NDA government by supporting it from the outside, a la Naidu. 																								Uttar Pradesh is not much better. A BSP leader says that a coalition with the Congress seems more or less on the cards. Our people want that. We need a bigger platform, he says. The Congress, however, is not closing its doors on other allies. For the first time, we are in a position to choose our partners, says a Congress leader.																								Former chief minister Kalyan Singh has been making the right kind of noises with both the BJP and the Congress. The BJP central leadership is keen to have an arrangement with its former CM, but BJPs UP leader Rajnath Singh  an old Kalyan Singh foe  hopes to scuttle that. Singh has been pointing out to the central leadership that at Kalyan Singhs birthday bash in Lucknow last week, a state minister and Kalyan Singh associate, Kusum Rai, performed a raunchy dance to a Hindi film song, while Kalyan Singhs son  another minister  chucked currency notes at her. Is this what we want in the BJP? Rajnath Singh is believed to have asked his seniors.																								But few believe that either the BJP or the Congress will be looking at ethics when it comes to making allies. Its a game of numbers, and the focus, right now, is just on that. 																								Carnegies book of 1937 is illustrated with examples from history and anecdotes from the corporate world. A new edition could consider a chapter on Indian politics.

		 Monday, June 14, 2004 							 																						BLOOD IN PARADISE																														Few incidents of blood-letting in Assam have been as tragic as the one in a cinema hall there last week. That such an act of mindless violence should happen in a place of public entertainment and spill innocent blood adds a touch of dark symbolism to the tragedy. Also, it is impossible to miss the grim irony in the fact that the scene of the tragedy is named Paradise Cinema. But it is the dark message from the violence that is so terrifying. For one thing, it suggests the atmosphere of terror in which even the innocent must live in Assam. Not even a place of popular entertainment is safe from the perpetrators of such violence. And, there is an element of the grotesque in the fact that the rebels of the United Liberation Front of Asom struck at the hall to punish the people for defying its ban on screening or watching Hindi films. The grenade attack inside the hall in Tinsukia was the second such incident in the state since the ULFA issued its ban on Hindi films last year. 																														Obviously, the use of violent means is a sign of the outfits failure to win the people with the argument. The ULFA is not the only rebel group in the North-east to try this bizarre cultural policing. For many years, outlawed groups in Manipur have tried to impose similar bans on Hindi cinema in that state. These bans are symptomatic of the desperation which afflicts these groups. Unable to win public support for their secessionist cause, they try desperately to impose their diktat with blood and terror. If they cannot get the people to accept their subversive political agenda, they would try to force cultural bans on them. It is a process of degeneration in which these groups get inescapably caught. The attack on innocent people inside a cinema hall is thus a parody, albeit tragic, of these groups battle against the police and the paramilitary forces. The Assam government has to see the tragedy at Tinsukia in this perspective. It must do all that is necessary to ensure the safety of cinema halls and filmgoers. It must hunt down the perpetrators of the violence and bring them to book. But it must not show any sign of cowering before the ULFAs threats  on Hindi films or anything else. If the owners of the cinema halls as well as the filmgoers have so far ignored the ULFAs ban, there is a message, loud and clear, in that. And the message is one of brave public defiance of the agents of violence and fear. Any government worth its salt should salute this public spirit and do everything in its power to stand by the people. That is the best way to defeat the forces of terror.

		 Friday, January 16, 2004  CAUGHT BETWEEN HOME AND THE WORLD 																								LURED BY HOPE: A BIOGRAPHY OF MICHAEL MADHUSUDAN DUTT By Ghulam Murshid, Oxford, Rs 495 In his youth, he sighed for Albions  distant shore and wanted to write poetry in the grand style  of Milton. He became the greatest poet in Bengali before  the emergence of Tagore. He transformed the nature of Bengali  poetry and language. But his personal and inner life was  always in torment. His father disowned him when he converted  to Christianity; he earned a fortune as a lawyer but at  the end of his life he was a destitute and an alcoholic.  But nobody could deny the genius of Michael Madhusudan Dutt.  This book is the first comprehensive biography of the outstanding  literary figure. It was first published in Bengali, and  Oxford University Press has done well to have it tranlsated.  Ghulam Murshid brings out the many facets of Michaels personality  and creativity. The poets life was full of disillusionment,  but he was honest enough to admit that he had been lured  in his youth by false hopes. Michaels life had the touch  of tragedy which this book captures. The translation is  by Gopa Majumdar, who does a reasonably competent job. LISTEN TO THE RACONTEUR 																								THE BUSINESS OF LIFE: GROWING UP WITH APEEJAY By Jit Paul, New Age, Rs 275 The recollections of Jit Paul  hold out the promise of being interesting. For one thing,  Jit Paul has the reputation of being a raconteur, and for  another he is one of the driving forces behind the Apeejay  group which has a big and distinguished presence in Calcutta  and elsewhere, especially in the hotel business. What is  today the Apeejay group began in a very small way with Lala  Amin Chand. It was carried forward by Jits father Lala  Pyare Lal. The name Apeejay is actually an acronym of the  names of these two pioneers and Jullundur, where the firm  came into being. Jit Paul lives upto his reputation as a  raconteur, and one of his stories is worth recalling. He  bought Park Mansions for a song from B.N. Elias. One day,  Elias told him, My father thinks I am not a clever businessman.  He feels I sold the property to you too cheaply. Jit Paul  replied, It has taken him 40 years to realize the truth  about you. The Appejay group now owns many of Park Streets  most prized properties. Among them is Flurys, a name practically  synonymous with cakes in Calcutta at one time. This is an  eulogy of the Paul family in which everybody is good and  efficient. This is laudable, but Jit Paul could have told  his readers about a Calcutta that has vanished as have the  businesses which once flourished here. LADY EXTRAORDINAIRE																								A MARATHI SAGA: THE STORY OF SIR MOROPANT AND LADY YASHODABAI JOSHI By Yashodabai Joshi, Roli, Rs 295																								Yashodabai Lady Joshi (the book wrongly calls her Lady Yashodabai. She got the title because her husband, Moropant Joshi, was a knight.) was a remarkable woman in her own time. She knew English, by itself an amazing achievement in the 19th century. She was born in 1868 and was married off at the age of six, her husband was 13. Yashodabai narrated the story of her life to her daughter before her death in 1948. The memoirs were originally meant for private circulation and were published in Marathi only in 1965. Her husband was an enlightened man. He educated her and guided her to work for the uplift of women. Yashodabai wrote a year before her death, Lifes journey is like climbing the Himalayas; there are many obstacles to cross. But now the summit is near and my legs are heavy with fatigue. This is a remarkable document of social history.

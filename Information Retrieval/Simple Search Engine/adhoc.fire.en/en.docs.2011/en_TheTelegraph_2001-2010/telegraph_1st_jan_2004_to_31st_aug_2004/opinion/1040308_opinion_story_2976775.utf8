The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 08, 2004 							 																						WAIT AND WATCH																														History has always been an uncertain combination of repetition and progress. The announcement of Mr Lal Krishna Advanis Bharat Uday yatra has provoked the entire range of reactions from apprehensive dj vu to positive expectations and enthusiasm. The Bharatiya Janata Party feels busily upbeat about it, the sangh parivar extremists are wondering about what it will project, the Congress and the Left parties have voiced their usual fears. The Election Commission has clearly stated that there is nothing illegal about the yatra in itself, although the chief election commissioner was curiously brusque about clarifying how the yatra could possibly violate the law  as if he had run up against something unmentionable. 																														Given the legacy of the Nineties in the character of Indias democracy, the symbolic meaning of an event of such geographic dimensions cannot be taken for granted naively. Its full significance will have to be regarded within three contexts. The ups and downs of Mr Advanis personal profile make up the first, particularly against the backdrop of the consolidation of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayees leadership. The yatra may be regarded as the deputys way of regaining the political limelight. Second, the yatra will have to be seen as a BJP event, drawing on the shifts in the partys internal organization, especially on the position of Mr Pramod Mahajan in it. Third, it would have to be seen in the light of the National Democratic Alliances current self-image, being carefully constructed through the run-up to the elections. In this, it is a show organized by the government in power. Therefore the NDAs, and particularly the prime ministers, allegiances to the agenda and energies of the BJP and its parivar are at stake here. It cannot be denied that the yatras character has been finalized at the prime ministers residence, and the occasion was a party meeting. Hence, the party, the government and the individuals are not such distinct entities. So, although the yatra is Mr Advanis do, it has the endorsement of the prime minister. And this is where the flaunted shift in the yatras visible definition  from Hindutva to development  needs to be watched closely. What sort of sense does Bharat Uday make, if at all? How genuinely does it translate into development and harmony, when the second phase of Mr Advanis progress will be flagged off by none other than Mr Narendra Modi?Will Mr Modi change his spots as easily as Mr Advani changes his chariot for a bus? Not just the EC, but all Indians with a functioning memory will have to look out for what the BJPs, and the governments, new words and symbols actually mean.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 27, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Calcutta at the best of times has very little to cheer about. This is especially true in the realm of education in which, thanks to the policies of the state government, most of the educational institutions have gone down the tube. It is thus heartening to learn that a Calcutta college, and a girls college at that, has earned laurels for itself. Last month, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council visited Calcutta and two other districts of West Bengal. It specially singled out Basanti Devi College for high praise. It awarded the college 80 points and recommended the strict discipline that it had seen in the college. There are other aspects of the college which are noteworthy: the quiet dedication of the teachers, the commitment of the non-teaching staff and the fact that political parties are absent from the campus. With no fanfare at all, the principal of the college, Bijoylakshmi Mukherjee, and her colleagues maintain a close and interactive relationship with students. When talking about education in West Bengal, the tendency is to look at Presidency College and to bemoan its decline. But the performance of Basanti Devi perhaps shows that the focus of higher education has shifted from College Street, and the future of womens education is not too bleak.				 																																																																														 Our jawans will insist (and a majority of our parliamentarians will now reluctantly agree) that George Fernandes as defence minister has left a record very few of his successors will be able to match. Since it is still too early to imagine Pranab-babu in a MiG, a journo recently asked the defence minister if he would visit Siachen at least. Amar ki matha kharap? Emni emni keno jaabo(Do you think Im mad. Why should I visit Siachen without any reason)? quipped Pranabda. When he was told that even Mulayam Singh had paid the high-altitude jawans a visit, that too in a dhoti, Mukherjee is supposed to have asked for a picture of Singh as proof. The snap has been shown to him. Now it is upto Mukherjee to find a good enough reason for a Siachen drop.				 																																																																														 Apart from the whispers on Modi and AB Vajpayees senility, there was another subject that held free reign at the Mumbai session of the BJP  Sonia Gandhi. A lot of caution was taken while discussing Sonia though, who was dubbed the super prime minister. But the fact that Sonia-bashing was a welcome sport was evident from the partys deliberate allotment of rooms to Sushma Swaraj and Maneka Gandhi on a twin-sharing basis. The two apparently discussed madam over breakfast, lunch and dinner, and possibly after-dinner, late into the night. 				 																																																																														 Ambika Soni wished to know why she gets so much negative publicity, and her acolytes have told her that it is because she heads the AICCs media department. They have advised her to give up the post  a suggestion not very well-liked by Ambika. The matter is being given a thought, though. Several Congressmen are already eyeing the post. If Soni has her way, she would have suave Salman Khurshid take her seat. But Subbirami Reddy is already staking a claim as a fellow Reddy after S Jaipal Reddys departure. There is also the current spokesman, Anand Sharma, who thinks a promotion is due, and former journo Rajiv Shukla. But that is only if Soni decides to hang up her boots.				 																																																																														 It is the same old story for the Chautalas in Haryana, except for a slight difference. Overwhelmed by the Congress success in the state (both his sons lost out to Congress candidates), Om Prakash Chautala is now trying to project his elder son, Ajay, as his likely successor. Years back, Devi Lal had done similarly by allowing Om Prakash to steal a march over younger son, Ranjeet, who went on to join the Congress. This time, however, there is a slight twist in the tale. Om Prakashs younger son, Abhey, is said to have revolted against his father and brother, and added, Mujhe Ranjeet mat samajhna (Dont take me to be Ranjeet). That could mean he wont join the Congress. But will he win the battle against his family?				 																																																																														 The Union human resource development minister, Arjun Singh, is making waves. Not a day passes without his shunting out at least one Murli-Manohar-Joshi appointee in the cultural or educational wing of the new government to the doghouse. The AICC chief is supposed to be mightily pleased with Singhs efforts to detoxify his ministry. Meanwhile, the inactivity of the information and broadcasting minister, S Jaipal Reddy, is giving her a headache. When a feeler was sent to Reddy about what is expected of him, the minister allegedly said that his job was to act as a referee, not to interfere with professional outfits like the Prasar Bharati. The message was received, interpreted and conveyed to Sonia  Jaipal has no problems with LK Advani appointees.				 																																																																														 Bipasha Basu has already gone to the most unexpected of places  the 92nd slot of the Channel 4s 100 greatest sexy moments on screen for her steamy scenes in Jism  and now to Bhind of all places. The sultry actress has apparently acquired a goddess-like stature in this region that borders both Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. In Bhind, which is supposedly infested with dacoits, isolated police stations invariably have a Bipasha Basu poster. Each time cops leave for a clean-up operation against armed robbers, they are said to light lamps in front of her picture and make offerings to Devi Bipasha, praying for their safety and success. Senior police officials still cannot fathom why somebody as hot as Bips has been accorded such a status. Some put it down to her eyes. The men in khaki seem to be convinced that if they take a good, hard look at those brown eyes, they will ward off all evil for them. Trust the men to be stuck with the eyes only. But the next time Kareena Kapoor badmouths Bips she better beware, she might be hurting religious sentiments.

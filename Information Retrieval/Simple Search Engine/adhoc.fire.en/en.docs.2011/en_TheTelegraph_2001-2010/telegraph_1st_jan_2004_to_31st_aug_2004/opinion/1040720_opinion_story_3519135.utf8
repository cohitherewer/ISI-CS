The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Lessons to learn				 																																																				Sir  Tamil Nadu seems to be particularly cursed when it comes to horrifying fire massacres. And the incident at Kumbakonam this time is unthinkable (School of burning, July 17). Even if the loss is indescribably painful, we can no longer afford to lose sight of the lesson. Leave aside the government and its routine reaction, and the media digging up the gross anomalies in the system. The focus now has to gradually shift from hauling up the schoolteachers for their callousness to how the latter can play crucial roles in similar situations in the future. Although most of the small schools function in poor set-ups, it has to be ensured that provisions for basic fire-fighting equipment and fire safety are made. For starters, school authorities around the country need to familiarize their students with what to do in similar crises. Sadly, such things are not accorded much importance in most schools here even when common sense dictates that simple discipline and mental preparation can bring down the number of casualties considerably.

				 																A doctors dilemma				 																																																				Sir  It is incredible that for 29 years Pabitra Sarkar had never inquired about the status of his doctoral diploma, nor tried to acquire it from the University of Chicago (CM stands by pundit Sarkar, skirts PhD, July 9). American universities routinely send diplomas by mail to graduating students, whether they are BA, MA or PhD degree holders. And attendance at the convocation is not mandatory. 				 																																																				If Sarkar had met all the requirements for his PhD, but could not attend the convocation  as he claims  because he was in a rush to return to India in search of an academic position, there was an easier way out. He simply had to write to the university to mail him his diploma. The very fact that Sarkar never found the time to do so, busy as he says he was with his academic pursuits, raises serious doubts about his credibility and professional integrity as an academic. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debobir Dasgupta, New Jersey, US

				 																																																				Sir  As an academic in the humanities, specializing in the study of literature and language, I find the entire debate about Pabitra Sarkars doctorate confusing. Although I have never studied in the US, I do hold a North American (Canadian) PhD and supervise and examine theses of PhD graduates. While a successful oral defence of the dissertation is the singlemost important step in acquiring a doctorate here, it is certainly not the last step in the process. No matter how brilliant the content and how satisfactory the defence, most theses in the humanities need some minor but important post-defence editing. Only after this is completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor is the thesis ready to be deposited for the award of the degree. Whether one picks up the degree parchment in person or not is hardly an issue, because it is usually mailed to the graduate after the convocation that follows the completion of degree requirements. 				 																																																				Also, most institutions require students to apply for their degrees after covering all required academic and administrative stages. This too, does not require students to be on location. The argument that Sarkar had to return to India before he could apply for his PhD makes little sense. The main document attesting a students performance at university is his or her official transcript. An original transcript is required at virtually all stages in ones professional career. Because these show in chronological detail a students performance, and because they are issued even when a degree has not been successfully completed, should this not be the one piece of paper Sarkar should secure to prove his qualification? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  A.C. Chaudhuri, on the subject of American universities, wrote to my knowledge, there is no scope for issuing a provisional certificate (A question of degree, July 16). This is surprising; all academic institutions give provisional certificates until the convocations are held. This should be true of the US too. My PhD thesis (University of Wisconsin) had been approved in 1970, but by the time I submitted the finished copies of my thesis to the department, the January convocation was over and the next convocation was due only in June. The registrars office, however, gave me, as it would to any other person, a provisional certificate immediately. I collected the actual degree after the June convocation.				 																																																				It was rare in those days for colleges and universities to ask a professor to show his original degree certificates. In case there was any doubt, it would take only a telephone call to the concerned registrars office to resolve it. As regards the doctoral degree, there is an additional way of inquiring. All theses were deemed to be published after submission: a photocopy or microfilm of the thesis was available from the university library concerned or from Microfilms Inc, Michigan. The latter regularly published, and possibly still do, the abstracts of all US doctoral theses, with an order number below them, in a quarterly publication called Dissertation Abstracts. All researchers know this. This practice is as good a practical authentication as there can be.				 																																																				Also, American universities have provisions to send notarized copies of certificates if any one of their alumni loses the original and seeks the universitys help. The University of Chicago did the same for me. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I must point out that it is not possible to get the information whether Sarkar actually got his PhD from the University of Chicago. This information is protected under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. This act basically says that academic information of the student cannot be released without the explicit written consent of the student. More details can be obtained from the website of the United States department of education, http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/ fpco/ferpa/index.html.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Siddhartha Chakrabarty, Chicago

				 																																																				Sir  The very fact that it did not ever occur to Sarkar to collect his PhD certificate is bizarre. After all, he was a good student and spent time, money and energy in a US university towards his PhD. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amal K.Chattopadhyay, New Jersey

				 																																																				Sir  It is surprising that the Jadavpur University authorities did not verify Sarkars claim of being a PhD before appointing him professor of Bengali. Why does the university have to be pressured into verifying the documents when accusations of a false doctorate degree have been levelled against him? Is it because he is close to the left? 				 																																																				According to Sarkar, the formalities for obtaining the PhD degree have been completed recently and he is expecting his doctorate degree in September. Did a person who occupied important academic and administrative posts not know that one cannot claim to have a degree before it has been formally awarded? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pradip K. Datta, Calcutta

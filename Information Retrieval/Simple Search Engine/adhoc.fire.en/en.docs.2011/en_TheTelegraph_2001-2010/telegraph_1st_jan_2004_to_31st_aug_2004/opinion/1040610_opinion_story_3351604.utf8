		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 							 																						DO AWAY WITH THOSE CHEMICALS						DOCUMENT From the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants which came into force on May 17, 2004				 	 Crucial steps																														This part provides general guidance to parties on preventing or reducing releases of the chemicals listed in part I.																														A...Priority should be given to the consideration of approaches to prevent the formation and release of the chemicals. Useful measures could include: (a) The use of low-waste technology; (b) The use of less hazardous substances; (c) The promotion of the recovery and recycling of waste...; (d) Replacement of feed materials which are persistent organic pollutants or where there is a direct link between the materials and releases of persistent organic pollutants from the source; (e) Good housekeeping and preventive maintenance programmes; (f) Improvements in waste management with the aim of the cessation of open and other uncontrolled burning of wastes, including the burning of landfill sites. 																														When considering proposals to construct new waste disposal facilities, consideration should be given to alternatives such as activities to minimize the generation of municipal and medical waste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation and promoting products that generate less waste...(g) Minimization of these chemicals as contaminants in products; (h) Avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for bleaching.																														B. The concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific technique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions...In determining best available techniques, special consideration should be given, generally or in specific cases, to the following factors, bearing in mind the likely costs and benefits of a measure and consideration of precaution and prevention: 																														(a) General considerations: (i) The nature, effects and mass of the releases concerned; (ii) The commissioning dates for new or existing installations; (iii) The time needed to introduce the technique; (iv) The consumption and nature of raw materials used in the process and its energy efficiency; (v) The need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the releases to the environment...; (vi) The need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the environment; (vii) The need to ensure occupational health and safety at work (viii) Comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been tried with success on an industrial scale; (ix) Technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding.																														(b) General release reduction measures: When considering proposals to construct new facilities or significantly modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals, priority consideration should be given to alternative processes, techniques or practices that have similar usefulness but which avoid the formation and release of such chemicals...In addition to the prevention measures outlined in section A...the following reduction measures could also be considered in determining best available techniques: 																														(i) Use of improved methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic oxidation, dust precipitation, or adsorption; (ii) Treatment of residuals, wastewater, wastes and sewage sludge by...thermal treatment or...chemical processes that detoxify them; (iii) Process changes that lead to the reduction or elimination of releases (iv) Modification of process designs to improve combustion and prevent formation of the chemicals...through the control of parameters such as incineration temperature or residence time.																														C. The Conference of the Parties may develop guidance with regard to best environmental practices. CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, March 14, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 We dont know if the big words during the Womens Day helped in any way or the fact that it is spring time, but the sultry Congress MP, Renuka Chowdhury, believes that she can duplicate the electoral success of Vasundhara Raje Scindia, Sheila Dixit and Uma Bharti in her own home state  Andhra Pradesh. A photographer was called in pronto for a special session which resulted in 12 pictures of the firebrand leader in various attires . From a Hyderabadi pearl adorned Renuka, to ones in tribal dress, temple art sari, Lucknowi chikan work  you have it all. The pictures have been set in a calender which is now ready for distribution in the state with the unputdownable caption  Know your leader. The strategy, however, is not new. A similar photo-session is believed to have contributed sizeably to the success of the Scindia princess in Rajasthan. There is a slight problem though. The many Renukas have not gone down too well with the Congress in Andhra. Renukas contenders for N. Chandrababu Naidus chair like YS Rajsekhar Reddy and D Srinivas have accused the lady of cheap glamour. Others, however, are of a different opinion. Take Subbirami Reddy, who has congratulated Renuka for her bold move with, I didnt know you look so good. You can beat any south Indian actress hollow. Ahem! We wouldnt take matters that far, or would we?				 																																																																														 Talking of Subbirami Reddy, this Congress pointsman for Bollywood, has been under much pressure lately to rope in film stars. It is not that Reddy came entirely empty-handed where Bollywood bounty was concerned. He did manage to field Moushumi Chatterjee, who deftly answered newsmen at a press meet recently. Encouraged by his success, Reddy went for another hit, this time the Rangeela girl. The Congman picked up the phone and talked to Urmila, addressing her constantly as Mudgaokar. The actress was so cut up that she promptly disconnected. That however hasnt stopped Reddy from trying. Look at the latest crop. One of the latest entrants is the film baddie, Shakti Kapoor. During the assembly polls last year, there were two other well-known villains  Prem Chopra and McMohan. Arun Jaitley is supposed to have then commented that he had full sympathies with Sonias party since between them, Chopra and McMohan had committed the maximum number of rapes and murders. With Kapoor in the Congress, the record would be unbeatable.				 																																																																														 The BJP president, M Venkaiah Naidu chose to drive down to Vidisha, some 40 km from Bhopal. The road was as usual bumpy and rough, all of which gave Naidu a terrible backache. Exasperated, Naidu declared that he had lost count of the potholes on the road. The chief is supposed to have thrown several questions at his men, among them  why after two months of Umas reign, nothing has been done to improve the roads, and why the roads are so neglected in a district once represented by AB Vajpayee? The same questions as ours. 				 																																																																														 In this age of fickle loyalties, a teenybopper television reporter asked the Congress party spokesman, Satyavrat Chaturvedi, if he were joining the BJP. Pat came the reply, Yes, I am. And Arun Jaitley and Pramod Mahajan are joining the Congress.				 																																																																														 MP witnessed a holi milan that made a mockery of law. Some social organization threw a party, promising on the house madhu bhoja, in other words, cocktails. Uma Bhartis ministerial colleagues were there to rub shoulders with bureaucrats and scribes. Everyone had a good time while the rest of the state observed a dry day. A senior police officer laughed off the incident, saying prohibition meant ban on sale, not on its consumption. Any takers?				 																																																																														 Once confronted by one of those brusque teenagers of the private news channels, Indrajit Gupta answered in the most polite manner he could. He was asked immediately after, By the way, what is your name? It was a somewhat similar experience for the former Indian ambassador to Sweden, BM Oza, who joined the BJP recently and was confused with DP Ojha, former DGP, Bihar. Oza was asked, What do you have to say about Bihar? 				 																																																																														 There are many takes on the Arjun-Ajay Singh episode. One has it that Ajay Singh only tagged along with a common friend of the BJP chief, M Venkaiah Naidu, to the latters Prithviraj Road bungalow, where he was spotted and the rumour of his joining the BJP soon spread. Another has it that Arjun had really taken a step forward to induct his son in the saffron parivar, when Sonias threats of expulsion forced him to backtrack. Still another has it that the whole drama was orchestrated by the Singhs themselves, who leaked the news of Ajays joining the BJP bandwagon. The gesture, besides proving the fathers secularism, would also score a brownie point over Digvijay Singh, who did nothing to prevent brother Laxman from joining the saffronites. Several others believe that it was a complete hoax since the father-son duo were far from picture perfect and hardly ever spent a night under the same roof. So the question of one calling or recalling the other did not arise. Now you know where the saas-bahu serials get their junk from!

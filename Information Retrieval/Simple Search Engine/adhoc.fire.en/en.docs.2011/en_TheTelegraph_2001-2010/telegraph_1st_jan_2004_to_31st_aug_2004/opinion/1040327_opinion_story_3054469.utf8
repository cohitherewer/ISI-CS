The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 27, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Man of the masses				 																																																				Sir  Politics is all about pandering to the lowest common denominator (Basanti shows Veeru the way, March 25). For the discerning will never vote for the actor, Dharmendra. The man is a bigamist; he has antediluvian ideas about how it is unbecoming of a man to be inspired by his wife; and his political rhetoric is confined to silly cricketing metaphors. As for his films, the only one posterity will remember him for is Sholay. The Bharatiya Janata Party has acted wisely by confining the actor to the Jat belts of backward Rajasthan. In the cities, he would have been booed off the podium.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sumana Ghosh, Calcutta
				 																Fair exchange				 																																																				Sir  In the article, Flying on the Asian magic carpet, (March 15), S. Venkitaramanan seems to imply that by exporting heavily to the United States of America, Asian nations are doing it a favour without getting anything in return. But surely China and other Asian countries need the US markets just as much as US consumers need the cheap products of Asian manufacturers? If the US economy and the dollar were to decline, many Asian nations whose exports to the US form a large part of their national economy, would be as badly hurt as the US consumer, if not more. 				 																																																				This is because most heavy purchases by American consumers are discretionary in character. Any reduction in such purchases will not affect the American consumer significantly, but in the poorer producer nations, workmen and their families will not be able to buy necessities. Thus, the situation is not as illogical as Venkitaramanan makes it out to be. Although how long this instability can last and how it will untangle itself when the crunch comes  as it unavoidably must  are uncertain.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  S. Venkitaramanan rightly identifies a significant part of our foreign exchange reserves not as assets per se, but a liability  investments in India which can leave at any time (Get the whole picture March 8). Fund managers care for nothing but attracting the most profits for their investments. India has been able to hold their interests till now, but any slight change in perception and they will withdraw their funds. When they do so, the first to be affected would be the stock markets which have been buoyed up by foreign institutional investors. The dangers of too much dependence on foreigners are also evident from the current outcry over outsourcing in the West, which has had an adverse effect on our software exports. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Rajeev Bagra, Baidyabati

				 																Correct assessment				 																																																				Sir  Zaheer Khan may have been correct in his assessment of Bal Thackeray (Zaheer bowls over Tiger, March 17). If one follows Thackerays statements carefully, what becomes clear is his concern for Indian-ness. Nowhere does Thackeray say that he or his outfit is anti-Muslim; he is merely against the anti-Indians who may live in India but favour Pakistan. 				 																																																				Khan comes from a lower middle-class Muslim family and may have first-hand knowledge of the Senas attitude. Perhaps, Khan was merely speaking his mind, even though he knew he would be reproached by his brethren. Religion before nation has been behind all the subversive activities by the minorities. Khan may have something to teach to those of his community who think like that. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, The real Indian (March 20), may prevent liberal and moderate Muslims from voicing their views frankly and publicly. This will surely be a great service to the jihadi elements. 				 																																																				The editorial is also an example of how the media use their might to try and gag voices of individuals who look at things differently. Ironically, it is the media which profess to stand by freedom of speech.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Robin Kumar, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 06, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																May your life be full of silly adventuresAbol Tabol:The nonsense world  of Sukumar Ray (Puffin, Rs 199) translated  by Sampurna Chattarji is proof of the enduring challenge  of translating classic vernacular nonsense into English.  After Satyajit Ray and Sukanta Chaudhuris apparently unmatchable  renderings, Chattarji makes a courageous go at a wide range  of this Bengali masters work. Apart from Abol Tabol  (1923), there are selections from Khai-Khai,  Chhobi- o-golpo, Pagla Dashu and Bohurupee.  There is the entire Ha-Ja-Ba-Ra-La, together with  many original illustrations. Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne: The  magical world of upendra- kishore roychoudhury (Puffin,  Rs 199) translated by Swagata Deb brings together  tales of men, grandmothers, birds, foxes and a cat by this  brilliant writer, illustrator, printer, musician and amateur  astronomer. Apart from the eponymous classic (This is the  story of a man who could sing only one song), there is  Tuntuni, the Ukuney Buri and the cat who gave himself the  grand new name of Majantali Sarkar. The tales are illustrated  by Dipankar Bhattacharya in an impressive range of styles. The waste land: Making of grass-roots  leaders (National Foundation for India and Seva Mandir,  price not mentioned) by Nandita Roy is an absorbing  and educative collection of profiles of the leadership styles,  lives and impact on local communities of remarkable grass-roots  leaders engaged in community development work in Rajasthans  Udaipur district. It is part of a more comprehensive effort  to document the experiences of an NGO (Seva Mandir) in the  area of rehabilitating degraded lands. Roys profiles are  extremely readable field-notes of her travels in the Rajasthani  villages, talking to not only these community leaders, but  also their family members, neighbours and colleagues. The  consequences of their endeavours go well beyond the immediate  issue of improved land productivity. Indeed, they go to  the very heart of the need to create a society where poor  people, professionals, and public servants can participate  on an equal footing in shaping the future of our society. The Unhurried City: Writings  on Chennai (Penguin, Rs 395) edited by C.S.  Lakshmi celebrates the amalgam that is Madras/Chennai  through an entertaining assortment of stories, articles,  poems and pictures. Ashokamitran, Manohar Devadoss, Ramachandra  Guha and Vijay Nambisan are among the contributors. Twist in the folktale (Seagull,  Rs 200) brings together a southern fertility drama  from Karnataka, an eastern tale from Manipur about a bird  family fighting a cat, and a northern story rendered into  Chattisgarhi about a truthful thief, as Ananda Lal puts  it in his introduction. These are Chandrasekhar Kambars  Jokumaraswami, H. Kanhailals Pebet and Habib  Tanvirs Charandas Chor. Each playwright takes a  folktale and turns it into a contemporary experimental play,  reshaping traditional conventions from an urban perspective. The Eddie Dickens trilogy (Puffin  and Faber,  2.99) by Philip Ardagh collects  three books  Awful End, Dreadful Acts and  Terrible Times  in a profusely illustrated and triumphantly  silly omnibus edition. Ardagh wrote his stories as episodes,  which he sent to his nephew in an English boarding school,  where they were read out loud by the nephews house-master  and house-mistress. May their lives, he writes in his  dedication, and yours, be full of silly adventures.

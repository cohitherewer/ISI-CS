		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 							 																						MERCHANT																													OF																													REFORMS To some he is a punters talisman. To others a voodoo economist. Whatever the case, this time round P. Chidambaram is a far more cautious and mellowed man  FM CHANNEL OOPS: 
	MORARJI DESAI: Used North Block as parallel centre
MADHU DANDAVATE: Blind to bankruptcy round the corner.WOW: 
	MANMOHON SINGH: Good doctor, nursed economy back to life
YASHWANT SINHA: Kept up reforms pace despite droughts. In India, it is the paradox of reform that reformers are hailed only by those who live in the cities, own mobile phones and have access to ATM. The reformer seldom attracts notice beyond this constituency, and is the usual suspect in the eye of the populist heroes. 																														Let me go to Delhi, and Ill reform the reformers, Laloo Prasad Yadav, the man of the masses on the railways, once commented, with an impassioned and explosive ph in the word reform. Which is why the potential Prime Ministers, or those whose inner voice causes their appointment, hide his or her reformers identity till the last moment. Like Congress president Sonia Gandhi waited a whole day to declare Dr Manmohan Singh, the reformer par excellence, her nominee for the Prime Ministers chair. And Dr Singh, in his turn, kept up the suspense for another day before announcing star reformer Palaniappan Chidambaram as Indias 26th finance minister.																														Being a Sunday it was bad luck for those who wanted to make a quick killing on the stock market. But Chidambaram is a punters talisman. When he presented his dream budget in 1997, as finance minister in the United Front government, the BSE Sensitive Index shot up 396 points on that day and 517 points more in the following three days. For the Prime Minister, keeping Chidambaram up there in the North Block is like carrying the safe passage guarantee of the well-heeled urban class in his wallet.																														But how has the man acquired this halo? A member of the extremely wealthy Chettiar community, a barrister and MBA from Harvard, Chidambaram was nevertheless a back-bench boy of Tamil Nadus fast-dwindling Congress party till the 1980s. Rajiv Gandhi made him a minister but hardly gave him any responsibility until his coterie of the two Aruns, Nehru and Singh, left him and he was in dire need of a polished speaker who could defend him in an increasingly hostile Parliament, in style and with force. Chidambaram had both. It surely brought him close to the Gandhis, including Sonia, but in the process he got himself painted in a corner in a party famous for its crabs instinct of pulling down the one that crawls up. Post Rajiv, he faced criticism within the Congress for many real or imaginary failures. One of these was bungling in the drafting of the Special Protection Group Act that made room for Rajivs SPG cover to be withdrawn after he lost the PMs office in 1989. 																														But P.V. Narasimha Rao, on being Prime Minister, was guided by instinct, and maybe a nod from Sonia, to bring Chidambaram in as his commerce minister.																														And with that opened the reformist chapter in his life. As Manmohan Singh began dismantling the licence-permit raj, Chidambaram made the the trade regime transparent and outward-oriented. More importantly, he kick-started the downward spiral of maximum tariff, from over 400 per cent in the year before him to 90 per cent. 																														However, his ascent was cut short by a misjudgment. He had put some family investment in Fairgrowth, a company associated with scamster Harshad Mehta, and had to leave as the scandal broke out in 1993. But it didnt ruin his record as the amount was small, and there was no proof that he was anything more than a passive investor. But the reformist bug had entered his head. 																														By then hed left the Congress for its wooing AIADMK, whose chief Jayalalithaa nurtures a biological contempt for the well-connected Delhis man who dares speak to her in English. His moment came when the United Front government came to power in 1996. 																														He is not an academic economist like Manmohan, but he turned that into strength when he presented the dream budget. All he did was to pick up a tax model devised by Arthur Laffer, an American economist of the Reagan years, which argued that, beyond an optimum point, lower taxes lead to lower prices, higher output and therefore higher government revenues. Chidambaram cut the top personal income tax rate overnight from 40 to 30 per cent, and the indirect taxes too. The market cheered him and so did the common man. It was a heros ovation that no finance minister ever had, not even Manmohan. Simultaneously, he kept up the post-1991 tempo of the battle against inflation, and hoped itd bring results. 																														The pity is, it didnt. While income tax collection rose by 1.7 per cent, against a projected 15.6 per cent, the indirect tax realisation even dropped. Laffer, who used to draw his curve before his friends in the Wall Street Journal on paper napkins in a nearby restaurant, later became known as the voodoo economist. The sobriquet came back on Chidambaram. To make matters worse, populist members of the UF cabinet like communist Indrajit Gupta and Dalit strongman Ram Vilas Paswan forced him to accept the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission, making expenditure soar with fiscal deficit piercing the ceiling. When the government fell, Chidambaram was probably relieved.																														Hes back as finance minister thanks to the respect for his courage and the originality of his approach which Manmohan and Sonia obviously share. But past experience has made Chidambaram cautious. In public interviews , he now talks of the millions in India who are left out of production processes because theyve no jobs, no capital, no skills, no property. A man famous for his arrogance  his ministerial aides never forgot to write the minutes of appointment time in slips issued to visiting captains of industry  Chidambaram is now mellowed. Hed even offer to the visitor a block or two from his favourite munch, a bar of Mars. Does he retain his spirit? Who knows? In a centre-left coalition he may after all prove to be reforms chocolate cream soldier. Punters, put your decisions on hold!

		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 							 																						WHO NEEDS AN HONEST BROKER?TWENTY-TWENTY / BHARAT BHUSHAN				 	 Role call																														An able Indian civil servant, Wajahat Habibullah, has come under attack for arguing that the United States of America could play the role of a facilitator to help resolve the vexed Kashmir problem. He is being targeted by people who think that he is close to the Gandhi family, is violating civil service conduct rules by arguing against government policy and is, therefore, an easy target.																														It is not within Habibullahs or any other civil servants ken to give the US a role that India does not want. The ineffectiveness of those arguing for accepting the US as an honest broker is evident. One need not doubt their nationalism or paint them black before discussing the vacuousness of their prescription.																														Arguing for a US role in Kashmir is critically out-of-phase with the situation today. Once talks have started between India and Pakistan, a mediator has no role. As long as the two neighbours were not talking and there was a possibility of the Kashmir conflict escalating, the US could have had a role to push them towards the negotiating table. However, once Islamabad and New Delhi are at the negotiating table, what more can the US do?																														The votaries of facilitation have to ask themselves the following question: what is it that Pakistan and India may be willing to agree to about Jammu and Kashmir with the mediation of the US which they cannot agree to bilaterally? More specifically, if India wants the line of control as the border, can the US ensure that Pakistan agrees to this proposal? Or conversely, if General Pervez Musharraf wants a solution that is LoC Plus, can US facilitation persuade India to give such a concession? The answer is negative in both cases.																														Why then is there talk of US facilitation? In India, some feel that today the US is closer to us on issues such as terrorism than to Pakistan. When the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, it deluded itself into thinking that it was forging a strategic alliance with the US, that we were partners in the global scene, that our relationship had been de-hyphenated and India was no longer equated with Pakistan by the US when it viewed south Asia.																														The calculation was that since Indo-US relations had reached a certain level, when the critical moment came, America would push Pakistan towards the LoC solution. Subsequent events have, however, shown that when it comes to Pakistans misdemeanours  whether relating to selling nuclear technology from a corner store being run by its national icon, A.Q. Khan, or buying missile technology illegally or promoting Islamic fundamentalism  the US has tended to sweep them under the carpet.																														If Indo-US relations had indeed reached a new plane, then New Delhi would have been able to persuade Washington to facilitate the end of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India. Having failed in ensuring such facilitation, what sense does it make to hand over the most knotty problem in India-Pakistan relations to the US now?																														Pakistan has always pushed for facilitation because of its fond hope that what it could not get on the battlefield, the US might help it get at the negotiating table. A mediatory role in Kashmir also suits US interests as Washington would like to manage India-Pakistan hostilities and confrontation because of its own need for Pakistan to fight its war against terrorism.																														The US desire to play a more active role in Kashmir is also not something new. It has been expressed by the US for long. In recent times, the first salvo in this direction was fired in 1993 by none other than the research institute which has sponsored Wajahat Habibullahs latest report  the US Institute of Peace, not an independent think-tank but one funded by the US Congress.																														At that time, the Clinton administrations thrust was that India and Pakistan could not solve the Kashmir issue by themselves and that it was critical to involve the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Since the former princely state lay divided between India and Pakistan, the US perception was that a divided people could not be effective and, therefore, a group needed to be created which could speak for both sides of the divided state. The assumption also was that the option for an Independent Kashmir was still open.																														From this perception followed a series of studies  including those by the Kashmir Study Group, set up by an expatriate Kashmiri businessman in the US, Farooq Katwari, the Asia Society, the Council on Foreign Relations and so on. Their reports pursued this idea further. It is not a coincidence, therefore, that the US Institute of Peace, which initiated the original idea, bestowed a fellowship on Wajahat Habibullah once it found that his orientation and inclination paralleled those of the US state department. 																														Their efforts paid off. Habibullah is personable and an eminent member of the Indian establishment with excellent credentials on Kashmir, and he was saying what the USIP always hoped for  to argue for US mediation but cloaking it in a more acceptable term as facilitation.																														However, the obvious question should be: where has US mediation or facilitation succeeded for India to desire such a role? There are several disturbing aspects of the mediatory role of the US. It tends to be sustained and personalized and often makes matters worse. President Clinton got personally involved in west Asia and things went from bad to worse. President Bush got personally involved in Iraq and landed the Iraqi people in a mess.																														The US way of handling mediation  whether it is in Bosnia or in Iraq  is that when Washington feels that the process of negotiation is not working to its plan, it intervenes militarily. Its mediation would be persuasive if Washington showed an ability to negotiate a compromise. Instead, the US tries to get what it wants and not what the parties in conflict want through the process of negotiations. If it does not get what it wants, it uses military force.																														Ironically, while US mediation hardly ever succeeds, a situation is created where both sides become dependent on it and the rest of the world cannot come in because the US is already involved. The most negative consequence of US mediation is that the negotiating parties lose their independence to act.																														The members of the US establishment as a whole think of themselves as great experts in conflict resolution. When the US comes into facilitation, instead of working as a post-office, it comes with a baggage of methodology of conflict resolution. It takes over the process and tries to walk the parties in conflict through its pre-conceived methodology. The net result is that the negotiating parties neither control the modalities of the negotiations nor their final outcome.																														Lastly, an important reason why US mediation does not recommend itself is that it makes no sense to allow a party stronger than those in conflict to become a facilitator. The bigger and looming presence of such a facilitator can vitiate its neutral role. The US is a huge military, economic, political and diplomatic power with interests in this region of the world. Why should it give up its national interest in south Asia to please India or Pakistan?

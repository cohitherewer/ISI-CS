				 																																																																														 The saffronites seem to have got a measure of their opponent  always a good idea when a battle is at hand. The BJP top brass and in PMO circles, they refer to Congress president Sonia Gandhi by the code name, SITA, for Sonia Is The Alternative. Thats on the lines of TINA for there is no alternative. The viewpoint gaining ground with the Hindutvawallahs is that Sonia alone can bring an Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government to power at the Centre again. As long as she continues to be the alternative candidate for PM, there will be no real threat to Vajpayee. So much for all the alliances Sonia is trying to forge.				 																																																																														 The mood of euphoria at the Centre has not touched the West Bengal BJP, however, which is the usual picture of messy infighting. This time, it is the mysterious death (presumably suicide) of a party functionary  Amal Roy  that has set off a fresh bout of mudslinging. The CBI has begun investigating Roys death, much to the elation of the Tapan Sikdar lobby and the discomfiture of Rahul Sinha, the state party GSec, who was known to be the dead mans godfather. The Central agency has already uncovered that it was Sinha who took Roy along to meet Arun Shourie at a city hotel some time ago. Photographs were taken of this meeting, which, unknown to the minister, were used to cheat unemployed youth of Rs 1.5 crore. Roy had apparently promised to make them collectors of bills from BSNL telephone subscribers, forcing them to shell out anywhere between Rs 35,000-60,000. Roy is dead, and now Sinha is busy trying to disown he knew the man at all, let alone the swindle. Besides, of course, blaming Sikdar for everything. None of which will help Sinha at all.				 																																																																														 It is the classic courtship conundrum afflicting the BJP and J Jayalalithaa  who will make the first move? An alliance is on the cards, now that the BJPs marriages with the DMK and MDMK have ended in divorce. And the lady is not unwilling  but she wants to be wooed formally, while the BJP wants her to come of her own. Actually, the two have not been able to get over the memory of the bitterness that led to their break-up before the 1999 Lok Sabha polls. Incidentally guess who is playing match-maker? Not the earlier go-betweens, George Fernandes, or Jaswant Singh, but the rustic Ashok Singhal, the VHPs gen-sec. Heres wishing him luck with the lady of Chennai.				 																																																																														 If Jayalalithaa is acting pricey, the BJP can take consolation from the fact that the informal understanding with Mulayam Singh Yadav is working just fine. And even bringing results  the UP CM and the RSS-VHP are working over a formula on the Ayodhya Ram temple, the modalities of which are to be announced soon. As Amar Singh, who has a way with words, told Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh, when he ran into them in the Parliament lobby, Ab tak to hamara aapke saath unholy alliance tha, ab woh holy alliance ban jayega. A marriage of true minds, huh?				 																																																																														 Amarinder Singh is a smart one. He has ordered a judicial probe into the alleged hawala transactions of his son, Raninder, hoping to shut up his opponents. But the probe will not achieve anything  the offence comes under the purview of the Foreign Exchange Management Act and the Centres department of revenue intelligence has already begun investigating the $ 1 million deposited into a secret bank account maintained by Raninder. Incidentally, even the letter Amarinder produced from Leonard Freeke, the Dutch national who heads the company which paid the money in consideration of a huge contract that was to come its way, which clears his son, is suspect. Freeke is a close friend of the Singhs, and any testimony from him is of doubtful value. Amarinder should realize that smartness can only take you so far...				 																																																																														 Diplomatic circles in the capital are unhappy at the drastic cut in the foreign missions liquor import entitlement. Singly and severally, they have remonstrated with officials in the ministry of external affairs. The ministry was forced to take the step after it was detected that some diplomats were selling the duty-free bottles at a huge premium in the open market. The happy hours are over, it seems.				 																																																																														 If you are a senior Congress leader like Arjun Singh, fielding strange requests are part of the days job. But even he was flummoxed by the one from the party MP from Meerut, Avatar Singh Bhadana. A Gujjar, he wanted a ticket from the East Delhi constituency because his caste-mates formed a large section there and wanted him as their candidate; he was sure to win. Singh could only resort to sarcasm and ask  Tamil Nadu too has a lot of Gujjars, havent you received an invitation from that state yet?				 																																																																														 Ajit Jogi, the man, might no longer amount to much, politically, in Chattisgarh. But what to do with his image smiling out of some 40 lakh schoolbags in the state? The schoolbags had seemed an ingenious gambit to imprint Jogis face on the minds of the young generation. Not only did things not turn out quite as Jogi had intended, but the schoolbags have also become an Albatross round the new Raman Singh governments neck. Should the image be replaced with that of some suitably apolitical national figure like Vivekananda, or perhaps, the map of India or even of Chattisgarh? But then, who will foot the considerable costs of this replacement exercise? Not the companies who were responsible for the Jogi imprint  they are yet to receive full payment for the original job. Perhaps the new dispensation should pay for getting rid of the eyesore? But with state finances being the way they are, spending so much on something that is after all a frivolous idea is not a very good idea. Looks like the schoolbags are one permanent legacy Jogi has managed to bequeath.

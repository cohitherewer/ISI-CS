		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						SHARE THE EXPERIENCEKutch Triumph of the Spirit By Randhir Khare, Rupa, Rs 495
The author says in the introduction, the book is not about the earthquake that wrecked the region of Kutch in 2001Kutchi history is fraught with unimaginable disastersearthquakes, draughts, famines, invasion by rats, locusts, giant black ants, floods, the plague, invasion by warlords and oppression under successive rulers. The introduction to the book is important while critiquing the book and its craft because the author does what he promises, that is, gives the reader a sweeping stretch of Kutchi history, legends and myths.																														What is more interesting is that this is done from a sensitive subaltern point of view, where the man from below has a voice. A boatman critiques book-mercantilism on getting to know the identity of the writer. He says, But tell me who will read about us? We are not unusual people. Even without reading the great masters of literature, he knows of high tragedy where only the noble men can qualify. All through the narrative the reader is made aware of dialogues in two types of English  pidgin and the relatively straightforward variety. The narrators style of speaking is strikingly different from that of the boatman. He constantly makes Biblical references and indulges in a kind of literary jargon. This seems to answer the boatmans initial query. The narrators speech is so different  is the subaltern a fashion, a repository of the elite? 																														The photographs in the book are varied, including the traditional and the contemporary, the exotic and the mundane. There are some breathtaking long shots of rivers, shores and the great Rann, and good close shots of daily affairs. The ethnic sketches at the beginning of each chapter are also interesting.																														Readers reservations aside, the book embodies a wide range of experiences and a cultural memory that unites the Kutchis. There are striking statements like only two thingscan make strangers into friendscommon enemies and eating together. A boy, when asked how much he knows about the region, says that the mango tree knows much more because it is old. These remain etched in the readers mind. 																														The book grows upon the reader slowly. It is an interesting read with stories of Hajipirpii Baba who got killed by dacoits, or the drunkards not being able to distinguish between the sadhu and the monkey, the dead searching for food, or the story of Vasu Dada who was hacked to pieces trying to save cows. Political situations are also commented upon. The narrative moves back and forth in time  from the present to the historical to the mythical. 																														The book is a great experience minus the snobbery and jargon of the narrators interrupting voice. The author asks the book to be shared, not stored. The reader will surely keep the request for it is an experience worth sharing.						JHELUM BISWAS

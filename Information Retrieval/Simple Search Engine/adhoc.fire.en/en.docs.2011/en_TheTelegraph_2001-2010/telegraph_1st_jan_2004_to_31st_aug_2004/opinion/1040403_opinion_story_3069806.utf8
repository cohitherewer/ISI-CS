The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 							 																						A DYING TONGUEThis above all / Khushwant Singh				 	 To add more valueThe spoken language of the common people of northern India is neither Persianized Urdu nor Sanskritized Hindi; it was, and is, Hindustani. Linguistic bigots ignore this fact and have made written Urdu and Hindi beyond our comprehension. It is time we revived our lingua franca by merging the two streams of Hindi and Urdu into one, and re-created a river of Gangetic grandeur. To do this, we have to take two steps: one is to write Urdu in Devnagri script. Urdu-bigots must be made to understand that Devnagri can in fact reproduce almost every sound known in Urdu, and that the Urdu script is fast dwindling to one used by Muslims in some regions like Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. The second, and more important, step to take is to pressurize the ministry of education to include Urdu poetry and prose written in Devnagri in school and college textbooks. Hindi-bigots will stoutly resist this; their resistance must be overcome.Fortunately, a great deal of Urdu poetry, both classical and modern, is now available in Devnagri, with meanings of the more difficult words given in footnotes. There are many compilations of quotable Urdu couplets which compilers have put together, printed in Devnagri and Roman Urdu, using the English alphabet with their translations in English. 																					A valuable addition to the increasing number of books of Urdu poetry in Devnagri is Gaagar mein Saagar: A Collection of most quotable Urdu couplets, compiled and translated by Rajesh Sharma. Meerut-born Sharma served in the Indian navy for 30 years, before retiring two years ago. During his years in service, he wrote down couplets which he found most quotable and translated them into English. He has not bothered to arrange them in the chronological order and has only given a subject-wise division in the index. Nor has he given the dates of the poets he has selected. The selection is thus is heavily biased in favour of the later poets over the old masters. Although he has rightly given meanings of difficult words in simple Hindi and his English renderings are accurate, they fail to convey the resonance of the words in the original. This is a limitation common to almost all translators of Urdu poetry with the exception of Victor Kiermans rendering of Faiz. As a result, people who cannot understand Urdu are left wondering, and ask themselves, what is so great about this! I will give just one example from Sharmas compilation. This is one of Bahadur Shah Zafars memorable couplets:Zafar aadmi usko na jaaneya ga Ho voh kaisa bhee sahib-e-fahm-o-Zakaa Jisey Aish mein yaad-e-Khuda na raheeJisey taish mein kaauf-e-Khuda-na-rahaaSharma translates the lines as follows:O Zafar, dont consider him a human being,However intelligent and sagacious he may be,The one who doesnt remember god amongst luxuriesWhen in rage, doesnt fear the wrath of god.																					If he had worked more on his translation and tried to rhyme his lines, he would have done more justice to Zafar. Something like this:																					Zafar, know him not as man																					However, wise, sage or benign																					Who in his pleasures forgets his god																					And in his anger, wrath divine.																					Of love and other demons																					Jaishree is about the prettiest Malayali girl I have set my eyes on. That is saying a lot as Malayali Nair women are among the most attractive in India. Dicky Misra is about the handsomest young Indian from western Uttar Pradesh. That is also saying a lot because western Uttar Pradesh produces many tall, strapping young men. Consequently, the two make a very handsome couple. Their coming together is the stuff of classic fairy tale romances. They happened to be in schools adjoining each other: she in a girls convent, he in a boys school. They exchanged glances and smiles while boarding school buses to return to their respective homes, while hawk-eyed nuns watched them. However, they managed to see more of each other after school hours, till she was spotted by her fathers friend, riding on a pillion of a motor-cycle. Her father, an air-force marshal, gave her a sound thrashing, packed her off to Kerala and had her married off to a prosperous Malayali businessman. The marriage was a disaster. She bore her husband a daughter, then decided to look for a job in Delhi. Meanwhile, Dicky, who had settled in London, happened to be visiting his parents. By sheer coincidence, the two met again. This time to consummate their relationship and live happily ever after in England, where her daughter joined them. 																					Jaishree Misra turned her story into a novel, Ancient Promises. It was an instant success. A second one, Accidents like Love and Marriage, was a variation of the same theme. And now we have a third  Afterwards  with the same characters within the same framework going over the same terrain. And yet it reads different and is equally rivetting. This time, Rahul Tewari comes from London to Kerala to learn how to play the mridangam. He rents a small house next to a large bungalow in which lives the beautiful Maya, her rich husband and their daughter Anjali. They exchange pleasantries over a hedge dividing their gardens while Mayas husband is away on business. Long before the mridangam lessons are over, Rahul, Maya and her daughter elope to set up a household in London. Meanwhile, Mayas parents, shamed and stunned by her behaviour, have her death rites performed. She is informed: Padi Addach pindan vekkal  death rites are done and the doors are closed forever.																					The rest of the story is a little different from the earlier ones. After two-and- a-half years of living in blissful happiness, Maya is killed in a car accident. Rahul Tewari has to hand over Anjali to her biological father. A few days later, he flies to Kerala carrying Mayas ashes to be immersed in a river close to where her widowed mother is living. They offer their prayers jointly while Rahul stands midstream and pours out the contents of the casket he brought with him from London, to be carried by the river and lost in the ocean. It is a real tear-jerker. I am sure Jaishree Misra had tears in her eyes while typing it out; I had them in mine while I was reading it. It is a powerful post-script to what she had written earlier.																					A naughty knotPolitical philosophy is a knotty knotIf you go deeper its a naughty plot																					And thats what pays																					Thats why BJP says:We are with RSS and yet were not.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Childs play				 																																																				Sir  For the American politico, family seems to be the last word in politics (Daughters turn Pet Terminator around, June 28). If Californias governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, changed his mind on killing animals in the state animal shelter, it was not due to the overwhelming public opinion against it, but that of his daughters. Yet it should have been the other way round. Putting down helpless animals (while the governor doesnt shirk from shelving out $ 147,187 to airlift an ailing Democrat from Brazil) would be an unsuccessful public relations exercise anytime it is undertaken, even if the government were down to its last penny. But Schwarzenegger went ahead with it, till, apparently, his daughters and three dogs drove some sense into him. Did it have to wait until that? American politicians have always advertised their family values brazenly. Schwarzeneggers is the most shameful. It proves what one always suspected  even a child has more common sense than the brawny governor.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S. Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																																																				Carrying the bat				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guha suggests five remedies for Indian cricket without being a cricketer himself (Just three good men, June 26). Yet, while criticizing the procedure for selecting zonal members to the selection committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Guha argues against the existing practice on the grounds that the selected members are not former cricketers. He must know that to be a selector, one does not have to be a good player but a judge of good playing. The principle behind the appointment of zonal members is that they are in a position to know which players in a particular zone are doing well and need to be pushed further. This is not nepotism, but a way to get inside information. If three of our superstar ex-cricketers were chosen, it would mean that  given their involvement in print and electronic journalism and other activities  they would find very little time to watch the new generation of cricketers and give them the necessary encouragement to represent the country. Guha may have a high opinion of Bishen Singh Bedi, but the way Bedi has often unjustly criticized many of our current players means that if he were to be a selector, his biases would be more harmful than the so-called incompetence of the zonal selectors. 				 																																																				Guha wants the national players to participate more in the Ranji Trophy matches. He must know that it is only because star cricketers do not play in the majority of the Ranji matches that the up-and-coming cricketers get a chance to prove their mettle. Guhas last suggestion to Jagmohan Dalmiya is even more outrageous. Today, corporate sponsorship is essential for the survival of sports and players. It is the absence of such sponsorship that has led to such poor standards in hockey and football vis-a-vis cricket. Why does Guha want to kill the golden goose?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In his open letter to Jagmohan Dalmiya, Ramachandra Guha has pointed to some vital questions which should worry all genuine cricket-lovers. There is no doubt that Indian cricket would benefit if members of the national team played more frequently in the Ranji and Duleep Trophy matches, as this would enable new players in the domestic circuit to test themselves and develop their techniques. Even better, the national cricketers could play against each other in the Duleep Trophy. This would bring more people to watch these matches. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Ramachandra Guhas suggestion of having three brilliant former cricketers instead of one selector from each of the five zones may not eradicate regionalism in the BCCI. A selector may still carry the bat for his particular region. If a certain zone is not represented in the committee, players of the region may not get the due attention. Sambaran Banerjee, as representative of the east, had to fight tooth and nail to induct Sourav Ganguly in the England-bound Indian squad in 1996. The rest is history. But had the east been unrepresented, would the north, south or the west have cared to include Ganguly? 				 																																																				Guha is in favour of John Wright because as a foreigner he is free of regional chauvinism that plagues Indian cricket. Guha implies that it is difficult for Indians to be completely free of this vice. In which case, his argument for an alternative criterion for choosing national selectors falls flat.

				 																Proper care				 																																																				Sir  Contrary to Bappa Majumdars Quack quack goes Bengal (June 6), ayurvedic doctors are neither quacks nor barefoot doctors in the Chinese style. In accordance with the syllabus proposed by the Central Council of Indian Medicines, ayurvedic doctors undergo four-and-a-half years rigorous coaching, followed by a one-year internship, and then they earn a graduate degree from the university. They can go for a three-year post-graduate course and earn an MD degree. There is also scope for research. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Chaudhuri, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  By describing ayurvedic practitioners as barefoot doctors, Bappa Majumdar has brought dishonour to classical Indian medical science. Students of ayurveda today read modern anatomy, physiology, gynaecology, pathology, pharmacology, surgery and so on. The Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery is a degree conferred on students throughout India by different universities. The neurosurgeon Ajay Agarwal is quoted by Majumdar as saying that the healthcare system of Bengal would collapse if ayurvedic doctors manned health centres. This is ridiculous. People in Indias villages have received careful treatment from ayurvedic doctors for the last few decades and will continue to do so.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sahidul Islam, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Primary healthcare centres have for long been running without MBBS degree-holders. Homoeopathic and ayurvedic doctors have single-mindedly helped villagers get basic healthcare. The recent government decision gives them the recognition that is their due.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Ashok K. Saha, Hooghly

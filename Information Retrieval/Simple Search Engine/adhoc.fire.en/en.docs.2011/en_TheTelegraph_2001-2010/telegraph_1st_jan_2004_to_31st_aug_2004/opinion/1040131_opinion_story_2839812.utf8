The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 							 																						WHATS IN A NAME? This Above All / Khushwant  Singh				 	 Gallery of stars																					The first thing anyone would like to know about any place is the origin of its name. Why has the city, known as Madras for three centuries (and before that Fort St George), become Chennai? I did not find the precise answer in the recently-published The Unhurried City: Writings on Chennai, edited by C.S. Lakshmi. I looked up my copy of Hobson-Jobson. It gives several explanations. After Fort St George was established as a British cantonment, the town that grew up around it came to be known as Madrasapatnam, after some Muslim madrassahs (school). The patnam was dropped and it became Madras. For good measure, Hobson-Jobson also mentions that the name may be a derivation of Mandhra-desha (land of the stupid)  no doubt coined by someone soured by his experience of the city, because, in reality, it has produced some of the best minds of our country. 																					In his article, A Town called George, S. Muthiah says Chennai is derived from Chennapatnam (Black town) because while the Whites lived in Fort St George, the dark natives lived in the localities that grew around it. The description is inappropriate and unfair in as much as though the Tamils are generally darker-skinned than the people of northern India, there are Tamils as fair, if not fairer than any to be found in the North, for example Hema Malini, Vyjayanthimala Bali, Jayalalithaa Jayaram, Nanditha Krishna and many others.																					No other city in India (not even Mumbai) is as film-struck as Chennai. They worship their screen idols as they worship their deities. They used to worship M.G. Ramachandran and Sivaji Ganesan; they worship Jayalalitha and even Karunanidhi, who is no beauty. Whichever way you turn in Chennai, you see huge cut-outs of their living gods doing namaskaram to you. All along Marina Beach is a row of statues of men they once worshipped. 																					Chennai is also a city of temples, Kanjeevaram saris, incense and the fragrant jasmine with which the women-folk adorn their heavily-oiled hair. It is the city of The Hindu, the most readable and reliable journal of the country and the only paper to have its own India-made crossword puzzle; other papers take them from England or America. 																					It has produced our best Bharatnatyam dancers : Rukmini Devi, Yamini Krishnamurthy, Malavika Sarukkai and singers like Subbalakshmi. Also some of our best tennis players, the Krishnans and the Amritraj brothers. And according to Ramachandra Guha, a few of our best cricketers as well.																					The Unhurried City, though it makes light reading and has some good sketches, does not do justice to this city of great achievers. The articles, short-stories and poems do not present the best of what has come out of the metropolis.																					Goodbye, Nissim																					I first met Nissim Ezekiel in London where, for a month or two, he worked as a clerk in India House. I got to know him better during my nine-year stint in Bombay and had him select poems for The Illustrated Weekly of India. The last time I met him in Glasgow, at a literary seminar. He was a thin, frail man who looked every inch the professor that he was. He kept very much to himself but showed a little warmth towards me as I wrote in favour of Jews (he was a Bene-Israel Maharashtrian Jew) and admired his poetry. Almost ten years ago he began to lose his memory; he was stricken with Alzheimers. He died at the age of 79. I read whatever Nissim wrote. Two of his poems are my favourites. The first is Night of The Scorpion. I quote parts of it:																					I remember the night my mother																					Was stung by a scorpion. Ten hours																					Of steady rain had driven him																					To crawl beneath a sack of rice.																					Parting with his poison  flash																					Of diabolic tail in the dark room 																					He risked the rain again.																					The peasants came like swarms of flies And buzzed the name of God a hundred  times																					To paralyze the Evil one.																					With candles and with lanterns																					Throwing giant scorpion shadows																					On the sun-baked walls They searched for him: he was  not found.																					The poem ends with a sensitive allusion to the differing attitudes of parents to a near tragedy:																					My father, sceptic, rationalist,																					Trying every curse and blessing,																					Powder, mixture, herb and hybrid.																					He even poured a little paraffin Upon the bitten toe and put a  match to it. I watched the flame feeding on  my mother. I watched the holy man perform  his rites																					To tame the poison with an incantation.																					After twenty hours																					Is lost its sting.																					My mother only said																					Thank God the scorpion picked on me																					And spared my children.																					My great favourite is Goodbye Party For Miss Pushpa T.S. Though he taught English and American literature in college, Nissim could speak read and write in Marathi, Gujarati and Hindustani. I produce his poem in full as it is the best example I know of Gujarati English:																					Friends,																					Our dear sister																					Is departing for foreign																					In two three days,																					And																					We are meeting today																					To wish her bon voyage.																					You are all knowing, friends,																					What sweetness is in Miss Pushpa																					I dont mean only external sweetness																					But internal sweetness.																					Miss Pushpa is smiling and smiling																					Even for no reason																					But simply because she is feeling.																					Miss Pushpa is coming																					From very high family.																					Her father was renowned advocate																					In Bulsar or Surat, I am not remembering now which  place.																					Coming back to Miss Pushpa																					She is most popular lady 																					With men also and ladies also.																					Whenever I asked her to do anything,																					She was saying, Just now only																					I will do it. That is showing																					Good spirit. I am always																					Appreciating the good spirit.																					Pushpa Miss is never saying no																					Whatever I or anybody is asking																					She is always saying yes,																					And today she is going																					To improve her prospects																					And we are wishing her bon voyage.																					Now I ask other speakers to speak																					And afterwards Miss Pushpa																					Will do the summing up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 05, 2004 							 																						LESSONS TO LEARNGwynne Dyer																					The last thing Iyad Allawi needed right now was a photo-op of president George W. Bush congratulating him on becoming prime minister of the sovereign (but US-appointed) government of Iraq. What he must do in order to survive is to put as much space as possible between himself and the United States of America. So its just as well that security concerns forced Bushs handlers to cancel his secretly planned trip to Baghdad to do the hand-over of power in person. Allawi doesnt mind at all.																					Every Iraqi knows what happened to Nuri Said, fourteen times prime minister and Londons main instrument for controlling the British-appointed kings who ruled Iraq until 1958. When Iraqi nationalists rebelled and overthrew the puppet monarchy, they machine-gunned the young king, who was just playing the role he had been born into. But when a mob caught Said two days later, trying to escape Baghdad dressed as a woman, they tore him apart with their bare hands and left his remains in the road to be flattened by the traffic like road-kill. Iraqis do not like collaborators. 																					Dark forebodings																					The risk of ending up the same way must haunt Allawi, for his position is quite similar. According to the latest opinion poll conducted by the Coalition Provisional Authority itself, 92 per cent of Arab Iraqis now see Americans as occupiers, and only 2 per cent as liberators. Allawi owes his position entirely to the US, depends on US-controlled money for the day-to-day operations of his government, and must rely on American troops to protect him and fight the resistance. He is actually more compromised than Said was, and he knows it.																					It was the dire security situation in Iraq that prompted the CPA to stage the hand-over two days early, to forestall the attacks that were probably scheduled for the announced date of June 30. Security is even worse than it was during the uprisings in April, because the rebels in Falluja and the rebel Shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, both effectively won their confrontations with American forces. Falluja is now a no-go area for US forces, and it serves as interim capital for the Sunni insurgents who have done most of the fighting against the occupation so far.																					The young extremist, al-Sadr, was neither killed nor arrested by US forces, as the CPA spokesman kept promising. Instead, his influence among the majority Shias has grown at the expense of his more moderate elders, and Najaf and Karbala have also effectively become no-go areas for US forces. Half of the newly recruited Iraqi police and army troops refused to fight fellow Iraqis on behalf of foreigners during the April revolts, and 10 per cent actually switched sides and fought for the rebels.																					Tread with care																					The attacks of June 25, when insurgents stormed police stations and government buildings in five cities, killing 85 and injuring 320, show how powerful the Iraqi resistance has now become. To talk of these insurgents as terrorists is just name-calling; terrorists do not stand and fight. Nor are they necessarily anti-Iraqi forces, as US propaganda always insists; they include Iraqis who believe that the Bush administrations plans for Iraq do not include real democracy or genuine independence.																					These are the people that Allawi must convince or marginalize if he is to survive. That is why, last weekend, he emphasized the difference between foreign terrorist fundamentalists...whose sole objective is to kill and maim innocent people  the Islamist holy warriors responsible for most of the indiscriminate suicide bombings  and honest Iraqi patriots simply fighting to drive the Americans out. He didnt put it that way, since the US pays his bills, but that was the logic behind his offer of amnesty to those Iraqis who have acted against the occupation out of a sense of desperation.																					Allawi is trying to show that hes not a puppet of the US forces, but its hard to do when the truth is that hed be dead without US protection. His press conferences are held in the heart of the headquarters of the US civil administration in Iraq, and you have to pass through four checkpoints manned by American soldiers to get to them. There is not a single Iraqi soldier in sight.

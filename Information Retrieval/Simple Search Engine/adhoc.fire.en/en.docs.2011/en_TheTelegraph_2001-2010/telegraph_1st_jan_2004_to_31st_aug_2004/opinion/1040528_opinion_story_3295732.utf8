		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						ONE BIG MELTING POTRegional Reflections: Comparing Politics Across Indias States Edited by Rob Jenkins, 
Oxford, Rs 595The decline of one-party dominance of the Congress from the Seventies created a political vacuum in India. Politics began to be overshadowed by friction around religious, caste and regional identities as the ideology of nationalism started eroding. By the mid-Nineties, India witnessed the rise of Hindutva as well as regionalization of politics. A coalition government at the Centre seems to be the order of the day. The book edited by Rob Jenkins studies inter-state politics on the basis of comparative analysis using both quantitative and qualitative data. The comparison mainly hovers around four thematic areas: economic policy-making, subaltern politicization, civic management and political leadership.																														Kennedys comparative study of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu focuses on economic policy-making. He documents the differing responses of these two states to the Central governments liberalization programme unleashed during the Nineties. While successive governments in Tamil Nadu have pursued a relatively understated approach to attract investment, not considering economic liberalization as a part of their electoral campaign strategy, the Telugu Desam Party, which has ruled Andhra Pradesh since mid-Nineties, has been one of the earliest advocates of economic reforms. This is explained by asserting that the existence of high levels of party fragmentation and subaltern political assertiveness in Tamil Nadu have restrained different governments from promoting the role of open market and liberalization in the states political destiny.																														Sinhas essay on West Bengal and Gujarat is constructed against the grain of the stability thesis  political stability attracts more investment. Bengal has been more politically stable than Gujarat yet, Bengal has not attracted much investment. Sinha explains the divergence in terms of the differing institutional and political capacities possessed by the two states. 																														The rise of socially marginalized groups in party and electoral arenas have transformed the landscape of Indian politics. This has been included in Kumars chapter on Bihar and Orissa. Banerjees chapter on West Bengal and Tamil Nadu interestingly revolves around the charismatic J. Jayalalithaa and Mamata Banerjee  both figures of national repute by virtue of the increasing importance of small regional parties in forming coalition governments at the centre. Mamatas grassroots image represent one narrative about womens place in politics; while Jayalalithaas glamorous past as a film heroine impelled her towards a different persona altogether.																														This book will not only stimulate debate among scholars of politics, economics and sociology; but also among policy-makers and journalists.						SUHRITA SAHA

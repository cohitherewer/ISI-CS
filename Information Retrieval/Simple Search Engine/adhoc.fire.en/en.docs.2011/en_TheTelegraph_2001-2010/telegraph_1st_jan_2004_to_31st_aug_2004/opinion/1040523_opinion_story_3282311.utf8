		 Sunday, May 23, 2004  A GENTLEMAN AND A POLITICIAN 
 							 - Spirit of accommodation entails no hard decisions on foreign policyHe refused a gift of Rajiv Gandhis portrait. He got along with the likes of Sitaram Kesri. Prime Minister Manmohan SIngh can adapt himself to men and manners. Bishakha De Sarkar reports PRIME TIME: Manmohan SinghSonia Gandhi																														Political humour tends to reinvent itself with changing times. An old joke, which did the usual rounds those days when Manmohan Singh was merely a finance minister, has found its way back into the circuit. Singh, goes the gag, was once touring rural India when he came across a shepherd with his flock. I bet I can say how many sheep you have there without counting them. If Im right, will you give me the best of your flock? Singh asked.																														The man agreed, and was amazed when Singh told him the exact number in his flock. He was an honourable man, and asked Singh to choose the sheep. The good doctor picked up a particularly hairy and healthy-looking specimen and was about to walk away when the shepherd stopped him. 																														I bet you are an economist. And if I am right, can I have my animal back? he said to Singh. How did you know that? asked the puzzled Adam Smith prize-winner. First let go of my dog, and then I will tell you, the shepherd replied.																														Political jokes come with an unsaid Aesopian tag-line. The moral of the shepherd joke is simple: Manmohan Singh knows his numbers, but does he know a sheep when he sees one?																														Its a question that is still being asked as Indias first technocrat-Prime Minister takes his oath of office. For long years  ever since the former bureaucrat became P.V. Nara-simha Raos finance minister in 1991  most people viewed Manmohan Singh as an apolitical being. He was a gentleman, they argued, and therefore not a politician. But now it emerges that Singh, despite the obvious contradiction in terms, is a gentleman and a politician.																														He may not be a political player, but he is certainly a politician, says a senior member of Manmohan Singhs Congress party. He is a master political-economist, adds Singhs Cabinet colleague, S. Jaipal Reddy.																														Singhs economic credentials, of course, are now being carefully aired. Ever since Congress president Sonia Gandhi decided to hand over the Prime Ministers crown to her trusted aide, his hitherto not-so-well-known story has been iterated and reiterated. 																														Everybody with even a passing interest in the media knows that the boy from village Gah  now in Pakistan  was a class monitor when he was in the fifth standard, studied economics in Amritsar, topped both in his BA and MA examinations and went to Cambridge University on a grant to study economics at St Johns College, before doing his DPhil from Oxford. 																														He taught at the Panjab University, joined the United Nations which he left for a teaching assignment in the Delhi School of Economics  only to be handpicked by Indira Gandhis pointsmen for a plum post in the government. That was when Singh made his first politically significant move  he became the economic adviser to the ministry of foreign trade.																														Since then, Singhs professional journey has taken an upward swing that would be the envy of many a blue-chip company. In the last three decades or so, he has been adviser to the finance minister, was appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of India and the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. In the summer of 1991, P.V. Narasimha Rao called Singh, then heading the University Grants Commission, and asked him to be his finance minister. The bell was sounded, and Manmohan Singh took his first political bow.																														There are some in the Congress who believe that Singhs impressive list of assignments underlines the political core of the new PM. There are hundreds of brilliant bureaucrats at any given time, says a minister in Singhs Cabinet. But why is it that successive political leaders  from Indira and Rajiv Gandhi to P.V. Narasimha Rao  chose him out of so many others? Surely that in itself would indicate his link with politics, the fact that he got along well with politicians, he says.																														Singh, a section in the Congress maintains, knows not just his sheep  but his onions as well. Observers refer to Raos first address to the nation from the Red Fort, barely two months after he took over as PM. It was a populist address, supported by the finance ministrys tall promises of subsidies to the people. 																														And among the first things that Singh did on becoming the finance minister in the Rao government was to arrange for the repatriation of gold pawned by the Chandra Shekhar government. As a financial move, it was a weak measure that was hardly a government priority. As a political move, however, it did wonders. It cashed in on the emotions of the average Indian who believed that pawning or selling of gold was the last-ditch effort of a family in financial trouble.																														A few years down the line, Singh made his electoral debut as a candidate for the South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. A group of academics and other intellectuals rallied behind him, but Singh lost to the Bharatiya Janata Partys V.K. Malhotra. He may not be a politician of the kind that wins Lok Sabha seats and has a crowd doing zindabad-murdabad behind him, says a colleague. But by no means can we say that he is not political.																														Since then, Singh  who now represents Assam in the Rajya Sabha  has been nurturing Kamrup like his own constituency. Hes used a record 94 per cent of his local area development fund on the region. But party insiders point out that to get a seat from Rajya Sabha, the late Assam chief minister, Hiteswar Saikia, helped him obtain a backdated ration card in his name to show him as a domicile of the state.																														Still, honesty is Singhs middle name. Anybody who has worked with Singh would vouch for his integrity. And simplicity, his colleagues stress, is his calling card. When he was the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, his eldest daughter, a lecturer in history at Delhis St Stephens College, was once asked what her father did. He signs currency notes, she had replied. You mean he sits and signs many millions of notes every morning? was the incredulous reaction to that.																														There are a great many stories about Singhs simplicity. Like fellow economist Amartya Sen, he often moves around on a bicycle. When he gets off a plane, he doesnt have an entourage of sycophants or staff waiting for him. Singh is usually picked up by a relative and quietly walks out of the airport with his bags. He is a frugal eater, wife Gursharan Kaur told reporters, and gets upset if there are more than two kinds of vegetable dishes on the dinner table.																														Its this squeaky-clean image of Singh that is going to be his bane as well as work to his advantage. Its not going to be easy for the Mr 10 percenters  as money-making political henchmen are referred to  to function with Singh at the helm of affairs. Yet, at the same time, running a government calls for hobnobbing with the disreputable. You have to be a man of letters to deal with him, says a political observer. He wont know how to handle someone like Shibu Soren, he says.																														Yet, Singh was comfortable working with Sitaram Kesri, the crafty, all-powerful ex-treasurer and president of the Congress. It was Kesri who put Singh in charge of a cell that looked into the partys economic and political policy. Kesri had also hoped to make Singh a party treasurer and there was a time when Singh was being viewed as the possible leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party. Singhs services had earlier been used in Kashmir and in Punjab, where he is said to have fairly pleasant relations with the Akalis.																														In fact, back in those days when Sonia Gandhi was still indoors and there was little to indicate that she would one day step out into the political limelight, Singh went to attend a function in Dehra Dun. He was presented with a portrait of Rajiv Gandhi painted by a young city girl. But Singh refused to even touch the portrait, says a member of the audience. He left it behind in Dehra Dun, putting the district magistrate in a quandary because he didnt know what to do with the portrait.																														But, then, its not easy to imagine Singh travelling by the Shatabdi from Dehra Dun to Delhi, carrying a large portrait of the late Prime Minister. For if there is one thing that Singh has steadfastly steered clear of, its the cult of sycophancy and coteries. Some in the party believe that he will have to be mindful of a Punjab coterie that would like to surround him, though most insist that coteries will have a minimal role to play. One of the best things about him is that he is greatly accommodating, says a minister. Adds Reddy: Anyone driven by an ideology is a politician. Manmohan Singh adapts himself  and thats his ideology.																														It is, quite possibly, this spirit that is going to chalk out the direction that the government is going to take in the next few months  especially in view of the Congresss lack of numbers in government. Singhs lieutenant, Jairam Ramesh, believes that the new government will direct its attention towards the much-neglected east. The government will concentrate on agriculture, he says. But it will move from a subsidy-based to an investment-oriented focus, says Ramesh. The spirit of accommodation would also entail that no hard decisions would be taken on foreign policy  at least not to begin with. Government insiders believe that not much will change on the Israel front, though the new regime would also voice its support to the Palestinian cause. And as far as the Americans are concerned, our policy will be thus: no unnecessary pangas (confrontations), but we are not going to be a poodle either, says a party ideologue.																														Singhs sense of fair play is a reason why coalition partners  despite some of the allies reservations about his role in the no-holds-barred launch of economic reforms  believe that the government may leave a mark. A coalition government is all about conciliation, says new minister Mani Shankar Aiyar. The process of conciliation is the key to its survival, he says.																														The problem  if one does arise  will be when Singh seeks to strike out on his own. Take the case of Narasimha Rao, who started out as a consensus candidate but ended up as his own man, ripping his party apart. Once PM, he outwitted all his rivals, says political scientist Imtiaz Ahmed.																														But Manmohan Singh is an honourable man  quite like the shepherd in the old joke. But there is a difference since the joke first made its appearance in the aftermath of an aggressive economic climate. Finance minister Singh, his critics then said, knew only his numbers. Prime Minister Singh, however, would need to know the shepherd.

		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 REPEAT ACTION
																								Those who wield the gun respect no laws  at home or abroad. After Bhutan, it was Myanmars turn to realize that rebels from India threatened its own peace. New Delhi has reasons to be happy that Yangon has finally followed Thimphus example and launched an offensive against the Naga rebels using its territory. The Myanmarese action seems to make two basic points. First, it shows that more countries in the region are waking up to the need for making common cause against outlaws and mercenaries. Second, it signals a better understanding between India and its neighbours on the issue. There were times when Yangons military juntas followed a policy of aiding and sheltering Naga rebels with a view to putting diplomatic pressure on New Delhi. India too was deeply suspicious of the growing Chinese influence in Myanmar and did not help bilateral relations by openly supporting the democracy movement in that country in the late Eighties. The Myanmar armys action against the Naga camps has a message for Dhaka which it could have earlier read in Thimphus offensive against Assamese, Bodo and Kamtapuri rebels. Bangladesh can only hurt its own  and the regions  security interests by delaying action against the north-eastern rebels operating from its territory.																								It is difficult, however, to see how Yangons action could derail the peace process between New Delhi and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah. Although the Myanmarese offensive was against the other NSCN faction, led by Mr S.S. Khaplang, the aim must have been to clear the country of all rebel hideouts. It cannot be in New Delhis interest to be part of any Myanmarese action that would destroy the peace initiative or the ceasefire in Nagaland. Those who see Yangons action as a threat to the peace process are obviously misjudging the situation. It would actually help the overall peace initiative if Myanmars action prompted the NSCN(K) also to join the peace-talks with New Delhi. Factional fights have cost the Naga rebels almost as dearly as their decades-old fight with Indian authorities. They can serve Nagalands cause better by uniting for peace.

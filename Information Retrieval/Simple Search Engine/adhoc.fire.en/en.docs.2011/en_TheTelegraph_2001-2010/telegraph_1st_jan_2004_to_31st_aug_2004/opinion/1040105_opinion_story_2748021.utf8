The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 05, 2004 							 																						FREEING TRADE																								The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation has agreed to make the south Asian free trade agreement operational from January 2006. The debate over multilateral liberalization vis--vis regional liberalization is clichd. The fact remains that despite the Uruguay Round and despite the World Trade Organization, regional trading arrangements have proliferated. With the Doha development agenda temporarily stuck, both the United States of America and the European Union have been pushing for free trade agreements. It is understandable that India should feel marginalized and seek membership in its own FTAs, if nothing else, as a countervailing force. Having said this, Indias attempts seem to lack logical cohesion. If an FTA with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations is being negotiated, what is the point of FTAs with Thailand or Singapore? There was a time when SAFTA had not made much headway and the south Asian preferential trading arrangement was only limited to duty elimination on a few limited products identified in positive lists. Coupled with problems with Pakistan, that was the driving force for sub-regional cooperation, India having signed an FTA with Sri Lanka and begun the process for negotiating one with Bangladesh admitted that FTA negotiations with Bangladesh have been temporarily postponed. But if the SAFTA idea is a serious one, FTAs with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh become pointless. The Islamabad meeting of SAARC foreign ministers has been used for some kite-flying, especially by India. Mr Yashwant Sinha wants an economic union. Even earlier, the Indian prime minister floated the idea of a common south Asian currency.																								A prerequisite to all these objectives is a genuine FTA, followed by a customs union with common external tariffs. A common market with free cross-border movements of labour and capital comes next. It is only then that the question of an economic union or a single currency arises. Given protectionism, it is doubtful that any SAARC member will agree to a genuine FTA. Forget other countries. Is India ready for a common market? Notwithstanding the protocol on terrorism, it is doubtful that India will agree to free cross-border movements of labour. Had that not been the case, Sri Lankan visitors would also have obtained visas on arrival in India. 																								Most traditional FTAs have been restricted to manufactured products, services being a late entrant in such liberalization. Within manufactured products, witness the resistance in India to FTAs with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Negotiations with Bangladesh (and Nepal) are stuck because India wants complicated rules of origin. The one with Sri Lanka was signed in 1998, but not notified for two years, because of similar reasons. Both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will cite any number of non-tariff barriers India has erected. Instead of economic unions and common currencies, India is better advised to stick to old-fashioned FTAs and accept the following. First, relatively larger gains from liberalization accrue to smaller countries. Second, the large country needs to subsidize the process, without insisting on reciprocal concessions, especially because unilateral liberalization brings welfare benefits to India.

		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 							 																						LIFE BEYOND EARTHThe existence of water on Mars should make scientists open to the idea that forms of life which now seem fantastic can one day come to the level of the scientific.Stars and planets have always beckoned since the time man first stared into the sky at night. Advances, first in astronomy, and subsequently in the second half of the 20th century, in space research and space travel, transformed this wonder into a specialized branch of knowledge. One of the driving forces of this field of knowledge is the quest for life in outer space. Research suggested that forms of life could exist on Mars, if it did anywhere outside the earth. The initial findings of the Mars rover, Opportunity, tend to confirm the hypothesis that life existed or exists on Mars. Opportunity has discovered clear evidence of water on Mars at some very early point in the planets history. The existence of water, signs of which are visible on rock surfaces and rock formations, indicates, scientists are claiming, that Mars had a habitable environment. It is important to underline that all this are at the level of hints and guesses. There is no clear proof as yet that life actually existed on Mars. The discovery of water has only established one of the necessary conditions of life. Nothing more. Yet this is a major advance.																														The quest for life on Mars is slanted in one particular direction. In very broad terms, scientists are looking for life as it existed or exists on earth. The research is seeking the replication of conditions that prevailed on earth many millions of years ago. The research has a strange earth- and anthropo-centric slant. That there could have been or can be forms of life beyond the present imagination and conception of scientists is something that is not brought into scientific reckoning. Such considerations are relegated to the level of science fiction. Scientists gloss over the fact that what was science fiction in the first half of the 20th century became reality in the second half. When Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, people could only be in awe of the fabulist imagination of H.G. Wells. Similarly, one must be open to the idea that forms of life now at the level of the fantastic can one day come to the level of the scientific.																														It is significant that scientists are no longer talking in terms of if people do go to Mars. On the contrary, they are now saying when people do go to Mars. The shift from if to when is an index of the advance that has taken place in space research, and of the advances registered in the realm of space travel. A new age of discovery is now emerging for human beings. This will be a journey into the great unknown since, at the current level of knowledge, human beings only know a minuscule amount about a minuscule portion of space. The conquest of space, while fortifying mans scientific prowess and enterprise, will only make him feel small and humble. The infinity of space and time, and the never-ending darkness of outer space can only make man conscious of his own precariousness. He becomes more conscious that he is no more than a blip in the chain of creation. The possibility of life on Mars only opens up vistas of infinite possibilities. Man triumphs only by knowing how little he knows.

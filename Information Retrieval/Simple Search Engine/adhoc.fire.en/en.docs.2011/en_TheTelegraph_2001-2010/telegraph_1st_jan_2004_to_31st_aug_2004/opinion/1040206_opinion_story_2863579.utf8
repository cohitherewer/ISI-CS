The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 06, 2004 							 																						SHOPPING FOR SOPS																														With elections due, a populist interim budget was expected and the finance minister has been somewhat restrained. While the fiscal deficit to gross domestic product ratio of 4.8 per cent in 2003-04 (as against the budget estimate of 5.8 per cent) is a good sign, this is partly fortuitous. Declining interest rates and food stocks have led to reduced food subsidies, expenditure (especially defence) has been deferred, higher growth resulted in improved tax revenue, disinvestment receipts exceeded expectations and most important, the GDP figure is higher thanks to a low base in 2002-03 and good monsoons. The finance minister is right that inflation at 4 to 4.5 per cent and GDP growth at 7.5 to 8 per cent in 2003-04 are good signs. But from this to deduce that macro fundamentals are the best in fifty years is stretching things. For a start, the fiscal deficit/GDP ratio of 4.4 per cent in 2004-05 is linked to a projected nominal GDP growth of 12.7 per cent, suggesting real growth of 8 per cent and there is no evidence to suggest that India has moved to this higher growth trajectory. Nor has the problem of high revenue deficits and reduced capital expenditure been addressed. Downsizing government expenditure has disappeared from the agenda and in a clearly populist move, the government has decided to merge 50 per cent of dearness allowance with basic pay. That this is limited to 3.5 million Central government employees and the quantitative importance is not much is a non-acceptable argument, since it will be impossible for state governments not to follow. The fifth pay commission may have recommended this, but its recommendations on downsizing have been conveniently ignored. Altering direct taxes would have been contrary to the spirit of an interim budget. But the finance minister has hinted at hikes in standard deduction and exemption limits later. With indirect tax changes introduced in December, the interim budget has not much to add, except further sops to specific sectors and procedural simplification. 																														While on sops, it must be remembered that promised funds often do not materialize, especially when budgetary proceeds are not earmarked for them. Nor will injunctions to banks to charge lower than the prime lending rate for agriculture solve the rural credit problem, apart from interfering with bank autonomy. However, Mr Jaswant Singh has managed to convey an impression that something has been done for the second Green Revolution. And for below-poverty-line families through subsidized food, it being a separate matter that most states have not yet identified BPL families. Hike in free baggage allowance, long-term capital gains exemption and slashing of Central stamp duty should please the urban middle class. Creating this impression of sops without denting the fiscal balance is quite an achievement.

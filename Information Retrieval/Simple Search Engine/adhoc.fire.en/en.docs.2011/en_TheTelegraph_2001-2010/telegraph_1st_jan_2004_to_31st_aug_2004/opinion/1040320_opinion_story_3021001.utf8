		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 							 																						ITS A BUFFALOS LIFEThis Above All / Khushwant Singh				 	 The writer and his subject																					One thing which continues to baffle me is that while all devout Hindus accord maternal status to a cow (gau mata) because they drink its milk after they have been weaned, they do not show similar deference to the buffaloes, which in fact provide more milk than cows. Cows have found their patron-saint in Uma Bharti, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh. She has given top priority to making gaushalas (cow shelters) in every cluster of village, but has overlooked the rights of buffaloes to their bhains-shalas (buffalo shelters). While slaughter of cows has been banned and made into a criminal offence, to the best of my knowledge, no such ban has been imposed on the slaughter of baffaloes. On the contrary, severing buffalos head with one stroke of the kukri (gurkha knife) on Dussehra is a common religious ritual in Nepal, Garhwal and certain Indian states.																					Uma Bharti has re-affirmed the existence of miraculous powers in cowdung and urine. So powerful are the qualities of cowdung that walls insulated with it resist nuclear attack and radiation, reads an extract from the vision statement issued at the behest of the chief minister. As a matter of fact, buffalo dung is more frequently used in building mud walls and as gobar gohas (misnamed cowdung-cakes) for fuel. Buffaloes also contribute more to producing gobar gas than cows for the simple reason they outnumber cows by more than three to one. Umaji also lauds the benefits of drinking cows urine: It is medicinal, it is anti-septic, it is organic, it is pure, it is free, she proclaims. No one has bothered to find out the medicinal properties of buffalo urine, which possibly is also anti-septic, organic, pure and free but is treated as buffalo-piss.																					Uma Bharti loves cow and wants the world to know she loves them dearly. So she has photographed herself feeding them and cuddling their calves. She has never had herself photographed feeding buffaloes or embracing their calves. She also loves dogs and has four in her home. She does not mind being photographed with them. They may be trained to bring her morning newspapers from the door, but they cannot be trained to get her votes. Cows cannot be trained to do anything; nevertheless they are great vote-catchers.																					I come back to the question: Why this unfair discrimination against buffaloes? I stumbled on a possible answer in a thesis written by an eminent Dalit scholar. He traces the pro-cow, anti-buffalo apartheid to the coming of Aryans to India. they were fair-skinned: the Brahmins of today are racially pure descendants of the Aryans and are chiefly responsible for the discrimination: Indian cows are white, buffaloes are black.																					Discovering a good-looking kin																					I dont have many good-looking relations in my extended family. This one turned out to be an exception: the niece of a distant cousin. She breezed in one afternoon on the pretext of discussing the possibility of making a film based on one of my short stories. The pretext was soon put aside and I tried to find out more about her. She looked as pretty as any film-star and was evidently into modelling, acting or directing. She also knew some of my other weaknesses. You know I was born in Kasauli. My father was teaching in Sanawar school. Kasauli has for many decades been my summer home and I have a soft spot for anyone who has anything to do with it. When I was twelve, my father was appointed principal of the International School in Afghanistan. So we spent some years in Kabul. First came the Russians. That was all right for us. Then came the taliban mujahedin gunning for all foreigners, particularly non-Muslims. 																					So we fled from Kabul and came to Delhi. I joined Hindu college. I did well; was topper in my class. I started writing for journals, and acting. I had shed my baby fat and got into modelling as well. I had no desire to get into the film business. Despite my reluctance to make films my career (I was then taken up with Buddhism), I got sucked in by Bollywood. I acted in Binodini, Mahatma versus Gandhi, Salesman Ramlal, Inshallah. I also picked up a handsome Air India pilot as a husband and became Tisca Chopra. I have signed up for another three: Hyderabad Blues 2, Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan (I play JPs wife) with Prakash Jha, and Cape Karma. The Bombay film world is changing fast; from naach gaana, it has become intelligent, articulate, sensitive.																					She looked pleased with life. I was happy I could drop the name of another celebrity who is related to me.																					Mad about the movies																					I do not bother with books on the Indian cinema because I do not have the slightest interest in the subject. I havent been inside a theatre for over twenty years (except, understandably, to see my own Train to Pakistan) and find sitting for three hours in a chair a real pain in the arse. I can count the number of Indian films I enjoyed seeing on my fingers; most I left half-seen at the intermission. I find Hindi films to be untrue to life, contrived make-believe, and to me, unacceptable. I also have little respect for Indian film-stars, most of who do not know how to act naturally and indulge in over-acting, perhaps at the instigation of their directors. The few exceptions I can think of are Dilip Kumar, Naseeruddin Shah, Saeed Jaffrey, Shabana Azmi, Anupam Kher, Dipti Naval and above all, Amitabh Bachchan. There must be a few others I am not aware of, as I admit I have no time for films or film-stars. I am not a snob.																					I was surprised that an intellectual egghead of the calibre of Lord Meghnad Desai, Emeritus Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics should write a book like Nehrus Hero Dilip Kumar on the Life of India. Apparently, in his younger days in Baroda, where he was born, and Bombay where he went to college, Desai was a film-addict and saw some films as many as fourteen times. Being of a scholastic bent of mind, besides enjoying himself, he considered the impact films had on the common people. 																					He is right in concluding that the single most important factor in influencing Indian opinion are Indian films. The real heroes of the masses are not politicians but film-stars. Understandably, politicians go licking their boots so that they help them win elections. It has to be conceded that films have also played a positive role in nurturing patriotism, exposing the immorality of caste and religious discriminations and rousing peoples conscience against the grinding poverty in which many of our fellow countrymen live.Consequently, despite my indifference towards the Indian cinema and knowing nothing about the scores of films mentioned in the book, I read it with profit to myself. Perhaps I would not have done so if Meghnad Desai had not presented an autographed copy to me. He is an extremely suave, soft-spoken, sophisticated person with no airs, no phoon phaan about being a member of the House of Lords. I could well understand why the lovely, vivacious Kishwar Ahluwalia fell for him.

		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 							 																						WAIT AND WATCH THE ICE THAW The Nehruvian legacy and a few old mindsets have always come in the way of a solution to the border dispute with China, writes N.J. Nanporia				 	 More than a barbed wire																														Now that the first steps are being taken to rationalize relations with Pakistan, New Delhi has very appropriately begun to focus on the border dispute with China. Nothing could more happily and profitably complement an Indo-Pakistan accord than a parallel success with Beijing. The second round of political talks between Brajesh Mishra and the Chinese vice foreign minister, Dai Bingguo, has ended as part of an ongoing series of meetings conducted in an atmosphere that is friendly and constructive. A cautionary note at this point. Political issues including disputes have a way of surfacing, of being talked about, of even being negotiated though without immediate success, of petering out, and finally of being left, as it were, hanging in the air. That regrettably is what has overtaken the Sikkim issue.																														When the external affairs minister jubilantly and prematurely announced that We have achieved the objectives we set out to meet, he not only struck the wrong note but invited and got a courteous rebuttal from the Chinese. The arrangement under which the Nathu La pass in Sikkim has been accepted as a border fell short of a change in the earlier Chinese position on Sikkim. Yet, in a climate of self-congratulation, Yashwant Sinha described it as a win-win situation in which Beijing had recognized the pass as being on the border. He advised his critics to read the language and added, I do not know why there should be any doubt about anything.																														The term breakthrough fell from many enthusiastic lips in the external affairs ministry and it was widely assumed, thanks in part to an uncritical media coverage, that the Sikkim problem had been resolved. Of course it hadnt. Deflation set in soon after the celebratory noises when Beijing disclosed that, in its view, a solution would be found gradually and determined against a background of historical facts. The memorandum on border trade and the apparent removal of Sikkim from the official Chinese website had a message that signalled a de facto change in the status of Nathu La, with the political implications for Sikkim left unsaid, but also signalled a refusal, as of now, to embody this change in a formal agreement.																														In taking the implications for granted and pushing them to a conclusion far ahead of what Beijing intended, the foreign ministry famously jumped the gun as it too often tends to do in coping with Chinese affairs. What should have been received in silence and with discretion was made the occasion for diplomatic triumphalism. No surprise that this has not gone down too well in Beijing. The moral surely is that the future of the border issue will be determined not solely by the substantive points each side has to make but also by an attitude which accepts bilateralism as mutual accommodation, recognizes the virtues of diplomatic restraint, and avoids the excesses of inflationary claims. Note, in passing, the misplaced exuberance in the reception given by New Delhi to the Indo-US agreement on the next steps in the strategic partnership with India. So much so that the state department has had to caution that the joint statement marks only the beginning of a process.																														Have we here evidence of a psychological flaw in the mindset of the mandarins in the external affairs ministry? Note again the alacrity with which it has denied that there was a US role in the Indo-Pakistan accord, something on which no comment was needed, and where a denial has little credibility and is therefore counter-productive. No group of officials in New Delhi has fallen victim to the Nehruvian legacy more enduringly than those in the foreign ministry. When Beijing speaks of the problems left over from history, the reference is to all the unequal treaties and border demarcations imposed on the Wests colonial possessions. Why, the implicit question runs, should two independent neighbouring Asian countries be obliged to regard as sacrosanct a border negotiated nearly a century ago between Sir Henry McMahon and Tibets Lonchen Shatra?																														Yet this particular bit of colonial detritus was kept alive when Nehru insisted, The McMahon line is our boundary map or no map. How the line should be redrawn, to the advantage or disadvantage of either party is something, Beijing insists, that can be better achieved if the colonial history is ignored and inherited problems are looked at afresh. 																														The preoccupation with maps, for example, a peculiar obsession of the Indian negotiators to which the Chinese have necessarily responded with maps of their own is yet another obeisance to colonial history and a denial of the flexibility independence implies. Map exchanging by the two negotiating teams to justify or to refute conflicting perceptions of where the line runs has been a recipe for rigidities much favoured by babus on both sides but more particularly in New Delhi. Maps are a reference to the past that ended or should have ended with the achievement of independence. The phrase mutual understanding, much used by the Chinese, is an appeal for a new approach to problems, completely delinked from the complexes associated with the colonial period and unfortunately almost un-knowingly inherited by those the have stepped into the shoes of their former colonial masters. Maps will certainly come into play when the stage of nitty-gritty ground level delineation is reached. That however is a long way off pending a psychological sea change which is perhaps slowly taking shape in a context that has encouraged a look at Indo-Pakistani relations.																														Happily there are today some positive indicators. We have in Brajesh Mishra a hard-headed negotiator entirely free of the Nehruvian incubus, with the added advantage of the authority he derives from his position in the prime ministers office. The talks moreover are being held in camera, in contrast to the hype and circumstance that attend every exchange between New Delhi and Islamabad. Both Mishra and Dai Bingguo have been given the designation of special representative, a status which reflects a shared understanding between them that the border talks must be taken out of the control of their respective bureaucracies. 																														This approach, as Beijing seems to see it, presupposes an agreement on a framework of principles, within which the substantive border issues are later taken on board. The emphasis here is on a mutual perception of each other as changing India and changing China. However, on the Indian side, A.B. Vajpayee is saddled on the one hand with Parliaments 1962 resolution and the commitment to regain lost territory, and on the other, some mind-sets that are still rooted in 1962 and find expression in a form of competitive diplomacy.																														Off-setting this is a largely unspoken yet very real growing appreciation of how much, in terms of energy and resources, both countries are losing by a failure to get the border problem out of the way. Beijing is reaching out to Asia in a complex of interactions designed to soften and eventually remove its earlier image of dominance and regional bully. Border problems with twelve of Chinas fourteen land neighbours have been solved. Time and patience and a basic re-think will together help to launch what promises to be a new and advanced stage in Indo-Chinese relations. As of now, the signals are clear that Sikkim is on the way to a resolution provided the foreign ministry learns to keep its self-regarding cheers to itself; and as for the border affair the former mindsets are now being gradually unsettled. If this process is sustained much wanted solutions could be round the next corner or the next after that.

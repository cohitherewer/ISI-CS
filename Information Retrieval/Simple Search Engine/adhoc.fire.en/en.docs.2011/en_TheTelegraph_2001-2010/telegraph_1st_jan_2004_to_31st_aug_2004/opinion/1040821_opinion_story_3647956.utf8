The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, August 21, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Death row drama				 																																																				Sir  Decency and privacy were the two things that fell by the wayside as the media merrily exploited the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee on August 14. From all the hoopla at the Alipore Central Jail, I will not be surprised if, the next time the authorities decide to send someone to the gallows, there is a rush of sponsors selling the last items that a man on death row may require  toiletry, beverages, snacks (perhaps some postor bada), clothes, the hood, a measuring tape and finally, the martaman bananas. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Khagen Sengupta, Calcutta
				 																Fit cure 				 																																																				Sir  The report, Epilepsy doctor in net (Aug 14), has shaken my faith in doctors. In May 2002, I had taken my nephew, who had been having fits since October 2001, to R.K. Guptas Neeraj Clinic in Rishikesh. Gupta examined him and gave him medicines for two months. The entire course was to last three years, after which Gupta said the epileptic fits would stop. Since then, my nephew has not had a single attack. In contrast, the medicines prescribed by doctors in Calcutta to whom I had taken him before, would work for a few months, after which the fits would start again. This June, Gupta called up for a review, and finding the results satisfactory, advised my nephew to continue with the pills for a year. Medicines were supplied by post, on payment, and they constituted herbal powders and some loose tablets. 				 																																																				Guptas arrest has sent me into despair. Has my nephew consumed narcotics? What will be the long-term effect of the medicines? Should he continue to take the medicines now? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.R. Dwivedi, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  As one of the newspapers in which advertisements of Neeraj Clinic appeared regularly, it is good that The Telegraph has also published the news of his arrest and the fact that his medicines contained harmful ingredients. Incidentally, I too am a victim of R.K. Gupta since I went to Rishikesh with my son who is an epilepsy patient. I paid Rs 3,000 for the medicines, for which no receipt was given.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prasanta Chatterjee, Madhyamgram 

				 																																																				Sir  On seeing ads of Neeraj Clinic, I went to Rishikesh in February this year and registered (no. 87298), after paying Rs 500. I was sent to a doctor, who asked me a few questions, and gave me a pink tablet. I was then sent to another doctor who gave me two bottles with 60 pink and black tablets in each, to be taken over two months. I paid Rs 2,000 for these. Ayurvedic medicines are rarely this expensive and it is not surprising that the medicines contained narcotics and other banned drugs. In retrospect, the instances of epilepsy patients being cured that were featured in the ads for Neeraj Clinic also seem patently fictitious. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Majumdar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  R.K. Guptas practice was so large that he was once the highest income taxpayer in India. Most of his large clientele had come to know of the Neeraj Clinic from media advertisements. Celebrities, especially prominent TV and film actors, often endorse medicinal products without judging their authenticity. There should be a law which holds the celebrity responsible if the product he endorses contains harmful substances. Also, it should be compulsory for practitioners of alternative medical systems to mention the ingredients of drugs in their prescriptions, even if the medicines are given by their own dispensaries.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  R.K.Gupta has been toying with the emotions of people who came to him hoping for recovery. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sheela Das, Silchar

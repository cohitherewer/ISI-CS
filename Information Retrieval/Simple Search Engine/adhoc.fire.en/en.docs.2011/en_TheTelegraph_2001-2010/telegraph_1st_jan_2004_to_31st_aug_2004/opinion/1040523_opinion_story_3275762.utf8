The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 23, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Less of more, please				 																																																				Sir  The photograph of Premium Ethyl, the four-pound hamburger, on May 21 captures the irony of global food supply. If citizens of poor nations are afflicted by the scarcity of food, the surfeit of it in rich nations is as much of a problem. Recent medical research has linked the tendency to overeat among Westerners, especially Americans, to obesity, diabetes, heart problems, cancer, and so on. But even otherwise, there is something obscene about the greed-driven, live-to-eat rather than eat-to-live ethos that lights up Jim Standlees face as he digs into the great mound of food in front of him.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Rupa Saha, Calcutta
				 																Over the top				 																																																				Sir  Why was the entire front page of the May 19 edition taken up by a picture of Sonia Gandhi, and a supplementary dedicated to her decision not to be prime minister, entitled, Abdication? Is The Telegraph trying to convince readers that Gandhis decision to decline makes her comparable to the Mahatma? Looking beyond the hoopla, one can see that the abdication was actually a family decision taken for security reasons. The Telegraph had better focus on other issues. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Alekhya Chakrabarty, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Inner voice (May 19), is perfectly justified in comparing Sonia Gandhis sacrifice with that of Mahatma Gandhis. Had she been hungry for power, Sonia Gandhi could have become prime minister in 1991, when the Congress had a comfortable majority in the house. But she declined the offer, despite much pleading. Thirteen years later, she has managed to retain her unselfish nature, despite being in the dirty world of politics. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

				 																																																				Sir  The front page of the May 19 edition was very dramatic. Sonia Gandhis letter to Congressmen, a huge picture of the lady, the colour combination  all were very pleasing. The only blot was the nearly asleep securityman behind her. Is this what VVIP security is all about? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Chandan Ray, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayees being thrown out of power is very sad. The Bharatiya Janata Party may be criticized for its hard-line agenda, but it cannot be denied that the country progressed under Vajpayee. The peace initiative with Pakistan, the decision not to send troops to Iraq  he will be remembered for all these achievements. Vajpayee had experience and guts, vision and sincerity. Never mind his gait, his slow pace or even his habit of catnapping, it was his handling of tricky situations that made Vajpayee one of the best leaders we have had. One can only hope that what has happened is for the best. But it is clear that Manmohan Singh has a long way to go before he can enjoy the respect and trust Vajpayee did. After all, a mahatma is born once in a lifetime.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Isha Shah, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhi has attained such a stature that the likes of Sushma Swaraj look pitifully small in comparison. Gandhi will go down in history not just as the politician who refused the top-most job on moral grounds despite having the support of her party and the people of India, she will also be remembered as the true Indian who set a benchmark for her countrymen. The lady has absolutely no greed for power; her sole motive is to serve the country. I havent seen Mahatma Gandhi, I havent seen Bhagat Singh, but I think Sonia Gandhi is in their league. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Saket Yadav, Durg

				 																																																				Sir  The 2004 election verdict was not a mandate for Sonia Gandhi to be made prime minister. It was wrong of Congressmen to resort to all kinds of brinkmanship to force her to accept the post at the Congress parliamentary party meet, aired live on Doordarshan at a huge cost to the exchequer. Comparing her action to Mahatma Gandhis renunciation at the time of independence is an affront to the father of the nation. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
D.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why not suggest sainthood for Sonia Gandhi for this great renunciation?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S.N. Behera, Sambalpur

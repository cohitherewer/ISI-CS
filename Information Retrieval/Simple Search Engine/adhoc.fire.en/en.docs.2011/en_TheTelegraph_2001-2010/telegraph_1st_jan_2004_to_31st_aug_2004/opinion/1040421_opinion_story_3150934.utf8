The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 							 																						KEEP SITTING																														Patriotism often takes the form of puerile touchiness in India. Some of it is comic, but most of it is an unfunny waste of public time, money and energy. Mr Shyam Narayan Chouksey, a retired engineer in Bhopal, went to see Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham early in 2002. Like a good Indian schoolboy, he promptly stood up as a mark of respect when a sequence in the film used bits of the national anthem. But Mr Chouksey was shocked to see that he was the only person standing up. So he went around urging others in the audience to follow his example, obstructing their view and generally getting on everybodys nerves. He was finally shouted down, but this strengthened his personal satyagraha. He moved from one district to another, protesting in front of cinema halls. He eventually met the district police superintendent and found a soulmate in him. The police issued orders that people would have to stand up during the anthem sequence, or action would be taken. To Madhya Pradeshs credit, this went unheeded. So Mr Chouksey filed a public interest litigation at the Jabalpur high court. He had been doubly offended. First, the national anthem had been desecrated by commercial use in a film. Second, people should be made to stand up even when the anthem was played or sung in a film or documentary or whatever. By then, the fever had caught on. The high court banned, in a 45-page judgment, the screening of the film until the offensive sequence was deleted. Then the Supreme Court swung into action, and suspended the high courts ban in September 2003. It pointed out that the Union government did not expect Indians to stand up while the anthem was being sung in a film. And day before yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that Indians do not have to stand up when the national anthem came on as part of a film.																														It is deeply, and not very amusingly, ironic that Indians would have to be instructed as if they were little children exactly around the time that they are exercising, or preparing to exercise, their franchise as adult citizens in a democracy. It is even less funny that the Supreme Court  which has, among various other matters of import, nothing less than genocide to worry about  has to expend time on the nitty-gritty of patriotic conduct. Every now and then, the Indian courts have to pronounce on such things as whether the national flag may be worn as a cocktail dress, or some such triviality. This is the problem with PILs. Every crazy whim of the public could take up the time of the courts. Only an immature democracy needs to be so righteous and earnest on matters of patriotic reverence and irreverence that would be deemed non-issues by most sensible and healthily frivolous adults.

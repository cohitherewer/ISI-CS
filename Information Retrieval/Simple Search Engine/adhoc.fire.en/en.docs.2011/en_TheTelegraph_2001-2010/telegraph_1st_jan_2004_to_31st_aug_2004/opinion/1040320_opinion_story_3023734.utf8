The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 							 																						THE REAL INDIANThe little exchange of praise between Zaheer Khan and Mr Thackeray reveals the alaise of crudeness that has attacked Indias political lifeThere should be a paean to crudeness, perhaps. The advantages of crudeness are too numerous to list, but there are some striking ones. It is not enough to say that it dispenses with brains. It dispenses totally with the need to keep up appearances. The cricketer, Zaheer Khan, and the chief of the Shiv Sena, Mr Balasaheb Thackeray, have both shown an exemplary command of crudeness in their effusive praise of each other. For Khan to tell the media in Pakistan that Mr Thackeray was not against Muslims but only against those who engaged in subversive activities argues either a prelapsarian navet or a touchingly frank desire to be counted as the Shiv Senas own, whether now or in the future. Either way it does not matter. However unworldly the cricketer is, he could not have not known what a plum he was handing to the Shiv Sena. That organization is as anxious as the Bharatiya Janata Party to cover its exposed flanks as the elections approach. Some leaders of the Shiv Sena, including Mr Thackerays son, are campaigning fervently among the minority community, and Khans endorsement will now be used extensively in the run-up to the vote. The partys organ has already made a spectacular display of it.																														There was drama on this side too. Mr Thackeray was in his element, moved almost beyond words in full public view, but not before he had called the cricketer a real Indian, a real Hindustani Muslim. Khan himself supplied the key to this fascinating collocation of words, he had said that patriotic Muslims have no problems with Mr Thackeray. For the neutral observer, this would be a difficult comment to swallow, since Mr Thackeray has been twice charged with making inflammatory speeches intended to incite communal tension and had also been arrested once on this count. Although a technical hitch prevented a hearing of this latter case, Mr Thackeray was barred from contesting the elections at that time. It is unlikely that Mr Thackeray had made exceptions for patriotic minority community members, his vituperations were directed against the community as a whole. 																														This little exchange, with Zaheer Khans spontaneous embassy across the border on behalf of the golden-hearted Shiv Sena tiger, is a revealing symptom of the malaise of crudeness that has attacked Indias political life. Using the counters of majoritarianism and minorityism has certainly corrupted principles of governance, administration and justice, it has also altered public rhetoric and skewed attitudes towards what is acceptable and what is not. It is not considered shocking to find terms of praise that associate real Indian with a phrase like real Hindustani Muslim when the secular republic is 57 years of age. The Shiv Sena is a party confined to Maharashtra. Yet such comments achieve national importance since its leader has managed to remain in the limelight by his offensive comments against the minority community and has then been defended by a member of the national cricket team in Pakistan. It is the general descent into crudeness that is most lamentable of all. A crude ethos breeds crude heroes. India will invariably get the stars it deserves.

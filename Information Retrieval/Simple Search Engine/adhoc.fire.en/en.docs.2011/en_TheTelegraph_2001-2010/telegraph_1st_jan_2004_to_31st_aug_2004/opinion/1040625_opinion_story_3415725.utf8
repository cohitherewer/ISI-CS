The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 25, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																Philosophy in a teacupWalking a tight- rope: New writing from Asian Britain (Picador, Rs 225) edited by Rehana Ahmed describes itself as lively and eclectic, and collects short fiction by writers of south Asian descent living in Britain. The titles tightrope is the one between cultures, which all these writers walk variedly. This variety is emphasized by the editor: Asian Britain is not a single, definable category. But she goes on to say, almost in the same breath, that all the writers trace their personal stories back to histories of colonization and journeys from south Asia to Britain. But isnt this also a kind of stereotyping? Especially when we discover that the multi-facetedness of multi-culty Britain is a matter of tyrannical fathers, warring gangs and mum-beating dads. Identity-based genres, combined with market expectations, create their own strait-jackets, and this more-or-less readable anthology doesnt quite escape them. There are stories by Debjani Chatterjee, Farrukh Dhondy, Romesh Gunesekera and Adam Zameenzad.The philosophy gym: 25 short adventures in thinking (Review, 7.99) by Stephen Law is an excellent little book, which takes the mind through a series of short and numbered adventures in philosophical reasoning, without trivializing either philosophy or the human mind. Each chapter provides a brief and accessible introduction, a philosophical puzzle or mystery, taking us through the key arguments, ideas and suggestions for further reading. Where did the universe come from? Whats wrong with gay sex? Does god exist? But is it art? Is morality like a pair of spectacles? Stop every now and then, advises Law, to make a cup of tea or stare out the window while you think about what you read. Curry and rice: The ingredients of social life at our station in India (Rupa amp; Dakshin, Rs 150) by George F. Atkinson is a hilarious peep into life in a fictional mofussil of the Bengal province in the 19th century. It is impossible to be more specific about the date, because it figures nowhere in this reprint. This is an unfortunate omission. A motley bunch of firangees is caricatured  judges and magistrates, colonels, missionaries, doctors and their colourful spouses and families. There are also the teas, theatricals, balls, hunts and bands, and the natives  nawabs, merchants, gardeners, orderlies and cooks. Our Station rejoices in the euphonious appellation of Kabob. It is situated in the plains of Dekchy, in the province of Bobarchy.

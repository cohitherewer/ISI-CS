		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 							 																						NOT A PENNY MORE Help from Asian countries may prevent the dollar from crashing. But one cannot be sure that this grand bargain will last long, argues Alok Ray				 	 Vanishing act																														The mighty American dollar is going down. Compared to October 2000, the euro has gained nearly 50 per cent against the dollar. On April 8, 2004, the dollar closed at Rs 43.64 to a rupee. Its value was Rs 48.96 two years back. 																														Does this signal the beginning of the end of the dollars dominance? To answer this question, one first has to understand how the dollar rose to its supremacy.																														The world was on gold standard till the end of World War II. Countries were willing to buy and sell gold at fixed official prices. If the official price of an ounce of gold was $40 in the United States of America and 20 in the United Kingdom, then the official exchange rate would remain fixed at $2 to a pound. If, at this official parity, the UK had a balance of payments deficit, then that would be settled by a shipment of gold from the UK to the US. So, gold was the international means of payment and the form in which international reserves were held.																														One major problem was that the official price of gold was kept fixed but the prices of other goods went on rising. So, gold mining became less and less profitable. As a result, the world was experiencing a shortage of international money. Dollar came to fill this void.																														After World War II, the US emerged as the number one economic, political and military power in the world. Most countries then fixed the exchange rates of their currencies in terms of the dollar rather than gold. Countries were also willing to accept dollars in international payments and to hold international reserves in dollars. This was because the US government was committed to exchange dollar balances held by foreign governments into gold at a fixed official rate. Further, unlike gold, one could earn interest by investing dollars in US government securities. Thus, the dollar was not only convertible into gold, it was better than gold. The US government began to run huge balance of payments deficits, which provided the rest of the world with the required dollars.																														This system had an inherent contradiction. If the US went on running BoP deficits, dollars in the rest of the world would go on accumulating. At some point, countries would lose faith in the US promise to convert these dollars into gold. On the other hand, if the US decided to reduce its BoP deficit, then there would be a shortage of international money. Besides, the system was highly inequitable. The US was consuming more goods than it was producing by printing dollars which the rest of the world accepted as international money. No other country had this exorbitant privilege, as Charles de Gaulle put it.																														The uneasy arrangement continued till August 1971, when the US finally announced that the dollar was no longer convertible into gold. The US also devalued the dollar (by raising the official price of gold) against other currencies. This immediately reduced the value of dollar reserves of foreign central banks. In 1976, under the so-called Jamaican Agreement, most of the countries of the world switched to a floating or market-determined exchange rate system. But, it was a managed float rather than a free float. Varying degrees of government intervention (by official buying or selling of foreign exchange in the market) are exercised by different countries to influence the exchange rates.																														Today countries continue to hold their foreign currency reserves in dollars along with a few other major currencies like the euro, yen and pound. The dollar is still the dominant currency in which international payments are made and the price of oil is fixed. But there is no reason why this must be the case. Historically, so many things have been used as money (like stones, cows, cigarettes, gold, silver, paper currency and so on). It all depends upon the circumstances prevailing at that point of time and the general acceptability of a thing as money. Which is why with the use of euro over a large part of Europe (and Euroland is expanding), the euro is becomingly increasingly attractive as an international currency and reserve asset. Rumour has it that Saddam Hussein was planning to fix the price of Iraqi oil in euro. 																														If the dollar continues to depreciate against the euro and other major currencies, a time may come when a significant number of members of the Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries may want to fix the price of oil in euro or a basket of currencies in a bid to protect the purchasing power of their oil revenue. Surely, the US would try to stop the move, with help from regimes dependant on the US for their survival. But for how long the US will succeed depends not just on its military power and its economy, but also on the political developments taking place in those countries.																														With a current account deficit running at 5 per cent of the gross domestic product and a huge fiscal deficit, the US is maintaining its standard of living by massive foreign borrowing. In a sense, Asian central banks are lending cheap money (by buying US government bonds at around 2 per cent interest rate) so that Americans can buy more goods from them. Some refer to it as the grand bargain. The major lenders are Japan, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea and increasingly, India. Asias total foreign exchange reserves are more than $1.8 trillion. If the central banks of these countries believe that the value of the dollar would go on falling, they would not want to hold their reserves in dollars. The more they switch towards other currencies, the further would the dollar fall. As new high growth economies emerge in countries like China, Russia, Brazil and India, and an increasing proportion of world trade is conducted among non-US countries, the advantages of pricing goods and holding reserves in dollar would diminish. Unlike the immediate post-World War II period, there are alternative strong currencies and strong economies in which to hold international assets. 																														Of course, the fall in the price of the dollar, relative to other currencies, would tend to increase US exports, reduce imports, and lessen the pressure on the dollar. But for that kind of self-correcting mechanism to take care of a massive $550 billion current account deficit would need a very significant fall in the price of the dollar This would however erode the US standard of living, a subject politically unpalatable in the US. 																														Some help may eventually come from countries like Japan and China. Japan has reportedly stopped buying dollars and started letting the yen rise. China, already under US pressure, may follow. India too is allowing the rupee to appreciate fast. Euro has already done its bit. If the required adjustment in currency values is shared by most countries, then the dollars fall may be moderate and slow. It would be a soft landing, not a crash. At this moment, it does not seem likely that any country would want to cause a nosedive of the dollar. After all, Americas overspending is fuelling growth and jobs in other countries. If so, then the dominance of the dollar would continue for some more time, but perhaps in a less diminished manner.																														But how long can this grand bargain be sustained? The US needs more than $1.5 billion a day from foreigners to keep the dollar at its present level. The resentment against the richest country living on others savings continues unabated. Even the US had to back down on its commitment to convert dollars into gold as events overtook it in 1971. The same is likely to happen to this grand bargain in the years to come.

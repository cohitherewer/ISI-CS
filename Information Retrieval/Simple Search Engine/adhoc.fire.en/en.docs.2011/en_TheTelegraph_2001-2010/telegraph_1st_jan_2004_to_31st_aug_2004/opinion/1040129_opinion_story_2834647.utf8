The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 							 																						WRONG ADDRESS 																														It is silly for a governor to criticize his own government. The governor of Bihar, Mr Rama Jois, did this very silly thing in his Republic Day address, lamenting the condition of law and order in the state, and commenting that no one wants to come to Bihar because of the atmosphere of terror and insecurity. The governors role has often been the subject of much debate, but the Constitution lays down certain very clear limits to his powers. He is head of the government only nominally, the administration lies entirely with the executive. In effect, he is a signature and a ceremonial presence, not an independent agent free to express his views, political or otherwise, on formal occasions. He comes into his own only when the ruling government loses majority in the assembly. The only other time he can constitutionally use his own judgment is when the internal security of the state is so threatened that he needs to ask for presidents rule. The practice of this right, too, has become controversial, but the Constitution empowers him with this right.																														Mr Joiss silliness is multi-layered. He has done himself a serious disservice by acting unconstitutionally, because a governor, like the president, is supposed to uphold the Constitution. The Congress and the left parties have come down heavily on Mr Jois for using the Republic Day address to criticize the lack of governance in the state. Unfortunately, what he has said is undeniably true. But by misusing his office, he has allowed the Rashtriya Janata Dal leader, Mr Laloo Prasad Yadav, an opportunity to defend the indefensible. The political leadership has much to do with the terrible condition of law and order in Bihar. To provide that same leadership space to demolish criticism on constitutional grounds is also to allow it to fudge the issue. Mr Jois could have done one of two things: resigned, or called for presidents rule. He would have been within his constitutional rights to do both. Worse, he has confirmed the suspicions that his placing as Bihars governor had more to do with his closeness to the Bharatiya Janata Party than anything else. As the Congress has said, the governor has played the role of opposition leader. Maybe it is not all silliness, but the signal of something rather more dangerous. That the BJP president has vocally complimented Mr Jois for speaking the truth is an indication of this. Law and order have certainly broken down in Bihar, but constitutional propriety, which governs order in the whole democracy, is endangered too. A situation in which the ruling party in Delhi applauds a governor for misusing his office cannot augur well for the people.

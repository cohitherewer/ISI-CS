The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 23, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																A cupboard full of mangled toys The path of the parivar: articles  on gujarat and hindutva (Three Essays, Rs 140)  by Mukul Dube collects a number of newspaper articles  and letters to sundry editors, all of which are highly polemical  critiques of the Hindu right during and after the Gujarat  pogrom. The articles must have had a necessary and powerful  impact when they came out. But gathered together, and prefaced  by a laudatory introduction by A.M. Khusro, their unmodulated  expression of rage and outrage begins to pall on the reader. Walking in goa (Eminence  Designs, price not mentioned) by Heta Pandit is  full of beautiful photographs of Goa, most of them bathed  in a golden afternoon light. Mapusa, Don Valdo, Savlem Pilerne,  Reis Magos, Portais, Altinho, Dona Paula, Chinchinim, Velim:  Pandit knows Goa intimately and describes 16 walking routes,  taking a particular delight in architecture. Pandit is actively  involved in the Goa conservation movement. The mahabharata (MapinLit,  Rs 95) retold by Mrinalini Sarabhai is a pointless  little book  dedicated to Mallika, whose path has been  more difficult than the heroine Draupadi  offering a very  brief and unremarkable retelling of the epic, together with  forgettable illustrations by A. Pandari Nathan Nayagar.  Screams in the night (Puffin,  Rs 99) by SMI is a childrens thriller about  Gothic goings-on in New Delhi. The five find-outers are  Sheena, Aman, Akbar, Anthony and Akbars pet cockatoo, Sindbad.  Amans mother screams, and there is a cupboard full of mangled  toys soaked in blood. SMI is a film-maker who lives in  a little island off the coast of a vast continent. Contemporary india: a sociological  view (Penguin, Rs 250) by Satish Deshpande  intends to revive the general readers interest in the  discipline of sociology: This book tries to show what  is at stake in doing sociology. It presents one vision  of what the discipline could become. The italics  are the authors, and he tends to use too many of them throughout  his text, giving the book a tone of erratic insistence.  Deshpande looks at the content of everyday life in modern  India, to explore the ambivalence of that modernity. The  key themes are HIndutva and development, the middle  class on independent India, caste inequality and globalization. The wada trilogy (Seagull,  Rs 350) by Mahesh Elkunchwar is Shanta Gokhales  English translation of this veteran Maratha playwrights  plays about a single family, the Deshpandes of Dharangaon.  The three plays are The Old Stone Mansion, The  Pond and Apocalypse, and were written in the  mid-Eighties and Nineties. They are introduced here by Samik  Bandyopadhyay, who also conducts a long conversation with  Elkunchwar, which is transcribed here: Ive always been  attracted to the idea of renunciation. I dont know why,  but I think there is great beauty in renunciation. The path of the buddha: writings  on contemporary buddhism (Penguin, Rs 250) edited  by Renuka Singh is an interesting and varied collection  of essays by the dalai lama, Buddhist scholars, clerics,  nuns and practitioners from all over the world. In our  modern, technologically sophisticated, violence- and pollution-ridden  globalized world, what role is Buddhism playing? What does  it signify in the lives of people? Is it faith, philosophy  or practice? In todays world, how do individuals or masses  come in contact with Buddhism and its subsequent change  of heart? Each chapter in this book deals with these questions,  and each is self-sufficient.

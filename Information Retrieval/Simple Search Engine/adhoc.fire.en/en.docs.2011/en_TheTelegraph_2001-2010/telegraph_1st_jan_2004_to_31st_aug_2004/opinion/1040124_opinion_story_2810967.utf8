				 																Whats love got to do with it?
				 																																																				Sir  Love, or the lack of it, comes with a heavy price tag in Hollywood. The film industrys costliest divorce is likely to leave Harrison Ford with a broken heart, but worse still, an empty wallet (Ford divorce costs  50 million, Jan 20). But then, marriages are glorified business contracts in Hollywood the violation of which guarantees one of the parties  usually the wife  handsome returns. Hence, stars are as much, if not more, interested in breaking pre-nuptial agreements as in making them. A little more fidelity would not only have saved Fords pockets, but also ensured that his money was put to better use.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
 Teesta Sen, Calcutta 

				 																King in his jungle
				 																																																				Sir  Years of misrule by Laloo Prasad Yadav has reduced Bihar to a lawless jungle (Madhepura musings on Laloo mind, Jan 21). Looting, rape and murder have become commonplace, and kidnapping the most profitable business under the patronage of politicians. After pulling off one of the biggest scams of India and then making a mockery of democracy by installing his wife on the chief ministers chair, Laloo Yadav carries on his mission of sending the state to the dogs. The law-abiding populace are helpless victims of illiteracy, poverty, disease and institutionalized crime. Under the circumstances, it is the duty of the Union government and the judiciary to rescue of the people of the state from this morass.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
S. K. Moitra, Kharagpur

				 																																																				Sir  Despite Laloo Prasad Yadavs refusal to accept the doctoral degree from the Patna University, I think the universitys gesture was deeply symbolic. Bihar was once synonymous with the figures of Buddha, Mahavira, Jayaprakash Narayan and Rajendra Prasad. But no one has put the state in national focus as Laloo Yadav has. He has accomplished this through his various deeds, including the fodder scam. He has given the people of Bihar means of self-employment by endorsing extortion, kidnappings and robbery. Only a great thinker like the former chief minister of Bihar could have thought of such easy and sure solutions to the problems of hunger, poverty and unemployment. Patna University should not waver from its mission of honouring great experimenters like Yadav.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully

				 																Rising son
				 																																																				Sir  The selection of Rohan Gavaskar to the Indian one-day squad betrays the weight that the name Gavaskar still carries in Indian cricket circles (Pathan set to make ODI debut at MCG, Jan 8). When India needed a middle-order batsman with some experience  someone like Dinesh Mongia  to replace Mohammad Kaif, the junior Gavaskar got the call. Rohans performance in the Kenstar Asian championship, after which the Indian one-day squad was selected, was nothing to write home about. There is more to it than merit. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
K.S. Dang, via email

				 																																																				Sir  Rohan Gavaskar is not the right substitute for either Mohammed Kaif or Gautam Gambhir. He is a complete greenhorn and did not have an impressive first-class career. He just happens to have a famous father. 
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Susanta Das, Baripada 

				 																																																				Sir  Rohan Gavaskar has forced his critics to eat their own words after putting up an impressive performance both with the ball and the bat in his first couple of matches. The armchair critics should learn to accept the fact that on the cricket field, what matters is ones performance and not ones surname.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Abhijit Ganguly, Calcutta

				 																Divine menace
				 																																																				Sir  In the December 31 issue of Careergraph, there are a few errors in my account of Memorable Moments of 2003, on my experience of working with the Parsee community in Calcutta. The address of the Parsi Anjuman is 52, Chowringhee and not 48 Chowringhee. Also, the name of Noshir Gherda has been misspelt as Noushir Gherdia.
				 																																																				Yours faithfully,
																															
Aditi Jha, Calcutta

		 Friday, January 16, 2004 							 																						WHEN THE DRAGON FEELS THREATENED Kaushik Roy																								CHINAS USE OF MILITARY FORCE: BEYOND THE GREAT WALL AND THE LONG MARCH By Andrew Scobell, Cambridge, Rs 995																								The new mantra of the successive post-Cold War American governments is to portray China as a rising superpower. The Taiwan Strait crisis of 1996 is cited by the military analysts as an instance of the dragons military aggressiveness. Andrew Scobell tries to provide a historical analysis of Chinas sabre-rattling. 																								Scobell shows that there is a historical tradition of Chinese governments using the military for quelling domestic violence. Chinese Marxists incorporated this in their theory and use it whenever there is evidence of a groundswell against the Communist Party of China. The use of the Peoples Liberation Army against the people in Beijing in 1989 is an instance of this.																								In 1989, the PLA was not eager to clear the Tiananmen square. Initially, many soldiers sympathized with the workers and students who had come out in the street to protest against the leadership of the CPC and its policy of economic liberalization. The communist leadership was itself divided on the decision to deploy the army. In the end, the elders under Deng Xiaoping won and orders were issued for using force against the rebels in the street. The decree issued by Deng did not have the required number of signatures of politburo members. Then why did the PLA open fire on the people?																								Initially, the dissenting public hoped that the soldiers would desert the party and join them. But Scobell claims that military professionalism kept the PLA loyal to the state. 																								In the aftermath of Tianamen Square, PLA lost favour with the people. The army was eager to retrieve their image by participating in a nationalist cause, besides fearing that in a liberalized economy, the military budget might be slashed. To prevent the latter, it decided to focus on the external threat scenario, which also held the possibility of lending Dengs successors a kind of legitimacy. Hence Chinas overreaction against Taiwan during 1995-96. 																								Scobells stimulating analysis shows that while China is not bent on aggression, its occasional aggressive behaviour can be explained by its internal insecurity. Any adverse scenario within the Middle Kingdom is enough to activate the dragons enemy at the gates syndrome.						KAUSHIK ROY

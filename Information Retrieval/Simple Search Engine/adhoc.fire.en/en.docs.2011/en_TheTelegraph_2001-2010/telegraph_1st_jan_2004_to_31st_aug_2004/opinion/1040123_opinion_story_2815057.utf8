		 Friday, January 23, 2004 							 																						STATE OF THE BUSH																														The job of the president of the United States of America is never done. There is nothing surprising, therefore, in Mr George W. Bushs declaration that he wants to finish his work. The problem lies in what he sees as his work. If he sees the task ahead of him as a revenge against the force that perpetrated 9/11  global terrorism  then it can be argued with some justification that Mr Bushs presidency has to extend beyond the constitutionally permitted two terms. If on the other hand, Mr Bushs work is defined in terms of installing a viable democratic regime in Iraq, then the goal is attainable if Mr Bush is fortunate enough to be re-elected. Mr Bushs presidency has perhaps been the most turbulent since that of Mr F.D. Roosevelt who took the decision to join the war against the Axis powers after the bombing of Pearl Harbour. Mr Bush has generated controversy not because he moved against the taliban regime in Afghanistan which was sheltering Mr Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the attack on the World Trade Center, but because of the war he unleashed on Iraq. None of the reasons that were given by the Bush administration for the invasion turned out to be valid. No weapons of mass destruction have been found. The capture of Mr Saddam Hussein is the only noteworthy success the US forces have had since the fall of Baghdad. It has been clear to most observers that the Bush administration invaded Iraq to play the great game. Behind Mr Bushs defiance, evident in the state of the union speech, is a hidden and deeper agenda. By not making public his intentions, Mr Bush is somewhat betraying the trust the American people have reposed in him.																														There is no denying that the state of the union is strong and confident. Much of this is derived from the remarkable economic record of the previous presidency. Events have forced Mr Bush to look outwards rather than at domestic issues. For one thing, there was the perceived direct threat to the US after 9/11 and for another, there was the pride in being the worlds only superpower. Mr Bush, more than Mr Bill Clinton, his predecessor, has taken the job of being the global sheriff very seriously. Mr Bush has part-created and part-ridden the tide of jingoism. But even he cannot claim that he has the support of, and his policies have the approval of, all Americans. A recent poll gave Mr Bush a 49 per cent approval rating. The approval rating also shows a declining tendency. No country loves to go to war. The people of the US have got a president who clearly does. On the state of the union and on Mr Bushs re-election falls the weight of the body bags.

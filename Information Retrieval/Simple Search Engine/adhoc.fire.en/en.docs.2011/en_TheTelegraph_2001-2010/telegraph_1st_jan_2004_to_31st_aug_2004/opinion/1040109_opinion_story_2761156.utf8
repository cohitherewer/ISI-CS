		 Friday, January 09, 2004 							 																						AN ARCHITECT WITH A DIFFERENCE Jhelum Biswas																								Nehru: The Invention of India By Shashi Tharoor, Viking, Rs 295																								A reader may say that Shashi Tharoors work has no new facts about Jawaharlal Nehrus life. True, because the author cannot create facts, facts remain, authors simply select and present them and thereby make history. This is what Tharoor does in his book. He recreates the story of the man, whose legacy, in Tharoors words, is ours, whether we agree with everything he stood for or not. What we are today, both for good or for ill, we owe in great measure to one man. Thus what we have in this book is not merely the biography of a man but also an important chunk of our nations history because it was but designed by him. 																								The book presents the public life of one of the finest statesmen of the 20th century by an author in the 21st century. The reader gets a glimpse of Indias tryst with Destiny through the eyes of the man who led the nation through this long journey. Inthe process of reviewing Nehrus political career, however, Tharoor subtly throws some light on Nehrus personal life. However, through the process of reviewing his political career, in subtle ways, Tharoor does throw some insight into Nehrus personal life. He establishes through his novel that whether one believes the apocryphal story associated with his birth or not, Nehru was surely a destinys child  a chosen one. 																								The book explores Jawaharlal Nehrus life from his birth through his lavish and cocooned childhood. His days in Harrow and Cambridge, his initiation into politics, his contributions as a nationalist, then as the first prime minister of India and finally he is currently viewed in India. What comes through is the metamorphosis of a man who, in his own words, was a bit of a prig with little to commend me to the architect of the nation.																								Nehru thought little before spending his fathers money. He was undoubtedly an obedient son, but he was insensitive at times. The narrative reveals that despite being an able leader, Nehru was a negligent family man, giving little attention to his wife and daughter. To an extent, this was also responsible for the rift in his daughters marriage. But the neglect that his family suffered was perhaps to the benefit of the nation. Nehru had dreamed of a free, secular, educated India. Much of his dream is yet to be realized and perhaps will never take shape the way in which he wanted. Tharoor observes, Nehrus impact on India rested on four major pillars  democratic institution building, staunch pan-Indian secularism, socialist economics at home and a foreign policy of non-alignment. All four remain as official tenets of Indian governance, but all have been challenged, and strained to a breaking point, by development of recent years.																								Of Tharoors writing capability little needs to be said. The book is brilliantly written and history is retold with wit and anecdotes. It is a must read to understand the fact that with the passage of Nehrus time the countrys intellect has narrowed tremendously. The last chapter of the book in a way tries to answer the unspoken question After Nehru, what?. And what the reader realizes is that much of Nehrus ideals have been fossilized and preserved in museums, little of it has been inherited and put to action. 						JHELUM BISWAS

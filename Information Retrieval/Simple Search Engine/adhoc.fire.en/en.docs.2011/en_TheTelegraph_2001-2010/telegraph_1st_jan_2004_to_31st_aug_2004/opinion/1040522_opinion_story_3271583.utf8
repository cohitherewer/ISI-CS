The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 							 																						WAR																													OF 																													WORDS Sitaram Yechury can talk, sometimes long enough to send the Sensex plunging. And it is this gift of the gab that makes him the CPMs poster boy HEAR THEM OUTThe more articulate CPM members: 
	Prakash Karat: Virtually number two in the politburo after Harkishen Singh Surjeet in terms of the influence he wields 
Nilotpal Basu: Risen in prominence in the last few years in and outside Rajya Sabha
Brinda Karat: The partys most vocal woman member
Mohammad Salim: A rising star. Sitaram Yechury has a fondness for words. To the youngest politburo member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM)  the partys most visible face on television  silence means nothing. When the 51-year-old Marxist ideologue shoots off his mouth, at times he leaves even his comrades squirming.																														The Sensex nosedived soon after he went on television last week to demand that the disinvestment ministry be disbanded. As the aftershocks reverberated through the stock market, an alarmed Manmohan Singh  then not even Prime Minister-designate  had to come forward and calm the fears of the investors. But if you think that silenced Yechury, youve got another thought coming. In a TV interview the very next day, he repeated the demand. Its a ministry which is totally ineffectual. I think we can do well without such ministries, he said, to the horror of Dalal Street.																														But then, thats quintessential Yechury  articulate, brazen and irrepressible. He says what he thinks, unmindful of consequences. And this was not the first time the opinion he voiced had stirred up controversy. The CPM leadership turned red in the face when Yechury publicly slammed former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda for taking along his family on official trips abroad in 1996. On another occasion, he happily declared that his party would go for a cut motion to defeat P. Chidambarams budget proposals. And he said all this when Chidambaram and Deve Gowda were propped up by the Left.																														Clearly, Yechury doesnt believe in mincing his words. He continued to describe the budget as pro-rich, when party stalwarts like Somnath Chatterjee were singing paeans to it. But then Yechury doesnt quite worry about a face-off with the old guard. Though Yechury was among those this year to argue, futilely, for the Lefts participation at the Centre, in 1996 he was among those who helped sketch what former West Bengal CM Jyoti Basu famously described as a historical blunder. To this day, Yechury maintains that the decision not to join the government with Basu as its head was right.																														But the tele-Marxists ability to weave words is his fort. To all television anchors delight, he can hold forth on any issue  from gender disparity and caste atrocity to political corruption and, his pet subject, the economy. And thats not surprising, considering that he was a higher secondary topper from New Delhi. Yechury  Sita to friends  majored in economics from St Stephens College before going to the Delhi School of Economics. That was when he came in contact with Amartya Sen  a relationship that was to develop later. I got to know him not so much when I was a student, but as a politician, he says. 																														Yechury, who finished his MA in economics with a first class from Jawaharlal Nehru University, joined the CPMs Students Federation of India in 1974 before becoming its president. In 1975, he formally joined the CPM and was arrested during the Emergency.																														His ascent in the party was meteoric. Close to Harkishen Singh Surjeet, the CPM general secretary, he was elected to the partys central secretariat in 1988. Four years later, he joined the politburo. Today, he not only edits Peoples Democracy, the partys mouthpiece in English, but helps draft the partys economic policies. It was Yechury, in fact, who produced a series of damning documents against the BJP before the elections, pinning down the party on its economic claims.																														In the CPM, opinions on Sitaram  and his politburo colleague Prakash Karat  are mixed. Many, in fact, accuse them of being cut off from the masses but admit that they have a major say in party policy. And nobody can deny that in intellectual calibre, they outshine their counterparts in other parties.																														Yechury is occasionally deplored for speaking out of turn. This time, however, many within and outside the party have risen to his defence, to stress that he was wrongly blamed for the stock market crash last week. They made a scapegoat of him, says Nilotpal Basu, party colleague and Rajya Sabha MP, who believes that the crash was expected since the market was not prepared for this electoral verdict. Even Congress Priya Ranjan Das Munshi  who does not agree with most of what Yechury says  feels it was wrong to blame the CPM leader. The market cannot crash simply because a political leader says something. Theres more to it, he says.																														Das Munshi even echoes Yechurys demand for a full-fledged investigation into the market crash. We must find out who were behind it, the Congress MP says.																														Yechurys importance lies in the fact that he is not only articulate, but is one of the few in the party with, as one of his colleagues puts it, a clear and in-depth understanding of economic issues because of his background.																														Yechury is all too aware of the power of his words, which he uses unsparingly. For in the word, Yechury will tell you, lies real power.

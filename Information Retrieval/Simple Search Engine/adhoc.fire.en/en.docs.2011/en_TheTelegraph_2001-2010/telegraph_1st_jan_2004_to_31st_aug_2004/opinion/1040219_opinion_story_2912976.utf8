		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 							 																						BETWEEN THE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN 															- Document Excerpts from Abortion in India: overview and synthesis of emerging issues from the qualitative studies by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Unenviable choice																														The needs of unmarried couples have unfortunately been caught in the debate on the ethical and moral issues of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Given the volatile nature of this issue, especially in a world where ethnic, religious and community identities are gaining greater legitimacy in politics; concerned individuals have shied away from initiating a public debate on abortion...																														The government of Indias decision in the post-Cairo period to remove method specific contraceptive targets in 1996, and to introduce a more comprehensive reproductive and child health programme in place of vertical safe motherhood, child survival and family planning programmes in 1997 gave womens health advocates an opportunity to re-establish the importance of a holistic approach. Donors supporting the governments efforts (World Bank, European Community, Swedish International Development Co-operation Agency ...and department for international development) highlighted the importance of looking at abortion-related mortality and morbidity as a part of the RCH package. This created a favourable climate in the country and provided an impetus to various stakeholders to examine the issue from different dimensions and work towards making abortion safe...																														While the climate seems to be favourable to initiate debate on safe abortion among key stakeholders, lack of reliable information, wide regional and rural-urban differences and a thin research base, make it difficult for policy makers, administrators and womens health advocates to develop strategic interventions.

During post-partum amenorrhoea and while breastfeeding the child, some women may become pregnant and do not realize it...																														The links between contraception and abortion: Non-use of contraception rather than contraceptive failure was reported to be the chief reason why the unwanted pregnancy situations...tended to occur. Actual contraceptive failure was reported only in one study (Prakasamma) in Andhra Pradesh where for one respondent, tubectomy failure led to conception and subsequent abortion.																														Gap between knowledge and use of contraception: lack of knowledge about contraception was not an issue at all among the women in the region where the studies were carried out. All respondents across studies reported knowledge of sterilization as a method of limiting family size and a majority of the women knew about the reversible methods of contraception such as condoms, oral pills and IUD for spacing births. But for a host of reasons this knowledge did not translate into actual practice.  TO BE CONCLUDED

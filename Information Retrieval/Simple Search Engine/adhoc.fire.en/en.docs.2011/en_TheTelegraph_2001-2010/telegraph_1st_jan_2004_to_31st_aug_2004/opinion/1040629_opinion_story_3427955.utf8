		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 							 																						 TWO DAYS GRACE																														Drama does not always distract. By handing over sovereignty to the interim government in Iraq two days in advance of the scheduled date, the United States of America has acted out its good intentions on the international stage. The immediate reason is the desire to foil further violence that may have been planned by insurgents of various colours for the June 30 deadline. In spite of appearances, this looks at one level like a neat cut-and-run operation. It is not just that the US cannot manage the escalating death and destruction its presence has created in Iraq, by aggravating and sharpening the conflicts already present in that unhappy country. Among numerous other things, it is also the official revelation that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, and the uncovering of the hideous treatment of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib. At the same time, it is also a gesture that Mr George W. Bush needed to make in the election year, to appear to give to the Iraqis what, according to democratic rhetoric, they should rightfully have, an Iraqi government. It so happens that this government will have to deal with the blood-soaked mess the US is leaving behind, without the support of the countrys military, which was disbanded by the US after Iraqs defeat last year. But while the new government struggles for its credibility in the eyes of the Iraqi people by trying to restore security and normal life, the prime minister, Mr Iyad Allawi, has no control over the more than 160,000 foreign troops who remain in the country, nor can he take long-term policy decisions. Instead, he has to request NATO to train the new Iraqi military. The US knows such a request would sound better to sceptical international ears coming from Mr Allawi rather than from the US.																														Mr Allawi has perhaps been handed one of the most difficult jobs in the world. His foiled rebellion against Mr Saddam Hussein and his closeness to Western powers have won him a mixed set of enemies. He was also a member of the US nominated governing council in Iraq. His first job is to assure a battle-weary people that he is not a puppet. He has therefore made a distinction between insurgents fighting a genuine battle against US occupation on the one hand, and foreign terrorists and enemies of peace who kill civilians and children, on the other. He also has to have separate messages each for the restive Sunni minority, which has lost its importance after Mr Husseins fall, the Shia majority, eager to seize power, and the Kurds, holding on to their autonomy in the north. Building up a country afflicted with a past like Iraqs is going to need tremendous skill. And Mr Allawis limited powers cannot help.

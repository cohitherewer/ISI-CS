		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 							 																						THE UGLIEST GAMEThe lack of legislation against the sexual abuse and exploitation of children is being most keenly felt as the Martys case developsFor once a state and its police had acted with alacrity. The arrest of the Swiss couple, Wilheim and Loshiar Marty, for the sexual exploitation of street children had been big news in December 2000, and the Mumbai session courts sentence of seven years rigorous imprisonment for them had also seemed encouraging. It was an important judgment for a country in which there are no laws against paedophilia. It was moreover clear from the evidence that the Martys were using the children they seduced with food and toys as subjects for pornographic pictures, possibly to be posted on the internet. Wilheim Marty felt desperate enough to try and chew up a data chip when the police burst into the couples studio bedroom on the basis of information from child rights activists. Child pornography, an immensely lucrative crime, is most difficult to pin down because it is mostly invisible. Much of it now inhabits cyberspace, its existence known only to the secretive millions addicted to it. The International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children launched a global campaign against child pornography this month. The idea is to train police officers all over the world in technology in order to detect and fight the crime.																														In this context, the fact that Mumbai high court was willing to let the Martys go after they had served half their original sentence can be seen as a measure of Indias indifference to, and ignorance of, the ramifications of the sexual exploitation of children. The Martys were willing to pay one lakh rupees in place of Rs 50,000 per child as had been originally decided. This seemed to be enough. The state of Maharashtra responded quickly to the alarm of activists and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court put a stay on the high court order. The Martys are out on bail, but the court has ordered the retention of their passports until a final decision is reached. 																														For all those aware of the implications of the sexual abuse of children for pornography, especially in a developing country, and of the indifference to childrens rights in general within that country, will fail to be reassured. The fear that India might look like an easy hunting-ground for vulnerable children is real. The lack of legislation was never so keenly felt. Although a non-governmental organization has formulated a law and placed it with the law commission, and Goa, where the sexual trade in children is dangerously common, has promulgated a state act, action on these new developments has not been very noticeable. Indian society has consistently blinded itself to the widespread abuse of children in the home and outside it. Child labour is one of its forms. The other comes in the form of rape, molestation, voyeurism and incest. A hypocritically bestowed sanctity protects adults in charge of children from scrutiny. In Sri Lanka, it has been recently discovered that in almost half the cases of sexual abuse of minor girls in the home, the father is the criminal. That Sri Lanka has been able to come to this discovery is because its eyes are open. Indian societys eyes can be forced open only when people from other countries are discovered looking for likely victims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Crying rape				 																																																				Sir  It is women like the South African delegate to the World Social Forum, in the news recently for accusing Sirajuddin Desai, a fellow countryman, of raping her, who do victims of this crime against humanity the most disservice (Judge rape charge withdrawn, Jan 23). A rape charge is a serious affair, its gravity in direct proportion to the heinousness of the crime. By reducing it to a media circus, she has brought in an element of levity and prurience into the discussion, that will reflect badly on other cases, other victims. Not only that, if it turns out that she only cried rape to extort favours from the judge or as a confused reaction born of guilt, then her crime is more serious. She may have withdrawn the charges subsequently, but she did make them thereby causing Desai the trauma of being labelled a criminal and arrested in a foreign country, and his private life exposed to public ridicule. In the circumstances, she has been allowed to get away rather too easily. She should at least have been made to pay some damages.

				 																																																				Natives only				 																																																				Sir  It is surprising that the United States of America, the global champion of free trade, is now trying to ban the subcontracting of government jobs outside the country (Software czars shaken after US stab, Jan 25). The US has always advocated unrestricted movement of goods and services across borders in search of better quality, low prices and availability of qualified manpower. On the last two counts at least, US companies benefit immensely by outsourcing jobs to India. If the US goes ahead with the ban on outsourcing, India should take the lead in resisting the move in all international trade forums.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Rising unemployment, a weakening dollar and the mess in Iraq are all the results of George W. Bushs wrong-headed policies. The Americans are not worried about the hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers money going waste in Iraq but when it comes to outsourcing, all hell breaks loose. 				 																																																				Protectionism harms the country that perpetuates it much more than its intended victims. Cost-cutting is the mantra if a company wants to survive in todays cut-throat competition. Thus any American company not allowed to outsource will be the loser. For example Levis had to close down all its manufacturing units in the US because they were running at a loss. Levis is now outsourcing its needs from other countries. Is this not causing unemployment? Then why single out the information technology industry? To my mind, it is being done to force India to fall in line, since India is the biggest beneficiary of IT subcontracting. India should now defy the Americans just like the Brazilians did recently. The US was also forced to take back the 30 per cent duty on steel imports when the European Union complained vehemently against it. India must stand up to the US in order to get it to back off.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Indias leading information technology companies  Wipro, Satyam and Infosys  have reported increased profits in December as a result of the international outsourcing business. It is these companies which have established India as a technology hub. Undoubtedly, the USs move to ban outsourcing  made with an eye on the coming presidential elections in the country  will affect the Indian economy. Indian IT companies now earn about $ 3 billion annually from outsourcing. How will they earn that kind of money after the ban? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The vibrant business process outsourcing industry in India must learn to be resilient since there might be more such shocks in the future. Also, Americans should realize that since federal government projects are financed with public money  that is, money they have paid as taxes  it is better to outsource so that the work can be done more cheaply.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  For a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, S. Venkitaramanans views on the US economy in For whom the warning bells toll (Jan 12) are rather strange. The US is the engine of the world economy. With less than 5 per cent of the worlds population, the US consumes over 25 per cent of its produce. It is this extravagance that drives the Asian economy. As the US economy is very resilient, a $ 500 billion budget deficit will not send the dollar crashing. Venkitaramanans view that the US is surviving on Asian countries betrays his ignorance. The US is the largest provider of aid to the world; it is this investment that has helped the Asian economies grow.

				 																Messy parting 				 																																																				Sir  In politics there are no permanent friends or foes. That explains why the Nationalist Congress Party, formed by Sharad Pawar and P.A. Sangma as a secular alternative to the Congress headed by a foreigner, split. Pawars allying with the same Congress headed by the same foreigner who caused his exit from the party, shows his desperation. Sangma too has compromised his secular credentials but he may be forgiven considering the National Democratic Alliance has kept to the common minimum programme, abandoning the Bharatiya Janata Partys communal agenda. Pawar being Pawar, has the support of a majority of NCP workers. Sadly Sangma, who tried to stand up for the ideals upon which his party is based, will be sidelined. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramesh Pradhan, Dibrugarh

				 																																																				Sir  P.A. Sangmas joining the NDA shows that he wants to be Lok Sabha speaker again. It exposes all his talk of ideology and principles earlier as hollow rhetoric. The other politician in the same league is Mulayam Singh Yadav. Once the self-proclaimed messiah of secular forces in the country, Yadav is now inching towards the BJP. The resolve of the likes of Sangma and Yadav to fight communalism is nothing but fraudulent gimmickry.

				 																Save a life				 																																																				Sir  Leukeran is prescribed by doctors for Leukaemia. But Leukeran 5mg was unavailable in Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi for the past few months. Thus Leukeran 2mg, a substitute, had to be bought from the black market. I obtained a phial of 25 tablets from Mumbai for Rs 1,800 without a cash memo. In a reputed shop in Calcutta, a phial of 100 tablets could be got for Rs 2,950, plus sales tax  but again no cash memo. Buying medicine without a cash memo can be dangerous. The authorities must arrange supplies of life-saving medicines to spare leukaemia patients from black-marketeers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

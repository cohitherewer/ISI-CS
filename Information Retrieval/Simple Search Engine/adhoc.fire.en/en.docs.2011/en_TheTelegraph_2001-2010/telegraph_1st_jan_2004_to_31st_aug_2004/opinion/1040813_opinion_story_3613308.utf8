The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 13, 2004 							 																						PICTURE IMPERFECTCinema: Images and Issues By Bhawana Somaaya, Rupa, Rs 595 Bhawana Somaaya, the editor of the weekly film journal, Screen, has been analyzing Bollywood films for over 20 years now. This book, by her own admission, is a celebration of her undying passion for the fascinating medium. As the title suggests, it explores the images and issues that have been thrown up by the film industry in the last quarter of a century.																														Somaaya calls the 96 articles compiled in the book fragmented frames of cinema. Most of them are sketchy and their strength lies not in the depth of analysis but in the boldness with which contentious issues are touched upon and unpleasant truths are articulated. Some articles grapple with censorship while others make a strong argument against the use of offensive lyrics. What is so impressive about Somaaya is that she is as unstinting in her approbation as she is unsparing in her criticism.																														The articles are wide-ranging, and betray varying attitudes and approaches. The images the book records are of two kinds. One, the purely visual. These are cinematic images which are remembered solely for their compulsiveness. 																														The other kind of image relates to the authors impressions, mostly instant and subjective, formed upon viewing certain films. The essays, Lagaan  Picture Perfect, Psychophancy, Autumn Romance, belong to this category. Often these images mingle and change with time, something that gives to their interplay a kaleidoscopic quality.																														In most of Somaayas write-ups, images are adroitly interwoven with issues. Gender concerns predominate, but the author also refers to the problems of joint families and housing. In Cheating on Intentions, Somaaya deals with the issue of breach of trust in connection with the film, Ek Chotisi Love Story. 																														Somaaya may not always analyze the issues meticulously or examine them from all possible angles, but she does thresh them out forcefully and convincingly.																														Apart from the images and issues discussed, the book also contains articles which are attempts at sociological analysis. Two examples of this are Changing Perspectives and The Heroine and Hindi cinema. In sum, Somaayas book may be called a montage of images in cinematic parlance. 																														In film studies, instant impressions and reactions like those of Somaaya often provide important material for the critics to work on.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

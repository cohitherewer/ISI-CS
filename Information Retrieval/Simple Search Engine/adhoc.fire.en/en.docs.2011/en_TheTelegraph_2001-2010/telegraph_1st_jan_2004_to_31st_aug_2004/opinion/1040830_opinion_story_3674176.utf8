The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 30, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Extreme caution				 																																																				Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray has picked the perfect example to warn us about the dangers of appeasing Islamic fundamentalism (Clinging to identity, Aug 28). The same is true of India. Few political parties (with the obvious exception of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena) have any qualms about giving in to the demands of Muslim fanatics to gather minority votes. That is why Laloo Prasad Yadav bans bhajans in Mumbai trains but encourages flourishing madrasahs in his home state. And Mulayam Singh Yadav announces that schools of his state would close at noon every Friday. Our own communists do this with particular lan. The Muslim population in West Bengal is growing, thanks to the encouragement given by the communist rulers to illegal immigration from Bangladesh. As in Britain, we needs to be wary of religious extremists in our country too.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Ramesh Dewan, Chennai
				 																Politics of revenge				 																																																				Sir  The resignation of the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Uma Bharti, after the Karnataka government revived a criminal case against her, charging her with inciting communal passions in Hubli in 1994, has raised a very important question. Will the Uttar Pradesh government and Central government (through the Central Bureau of Investigation) now try to secure the arrest of L.K. Advani, who also raised communal passions through his speeches and actions such as embarking on a rath yatra, culminating in the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Against the four casualties in Hubli, the riots following Babri Masjid left thousands dead and injured all around the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hem Raj Jain, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The case against Uma Bharti stands on very shaky ground. For how can anyone be restricted from hoisting the national flag on independence day? Besides, if all the casualties were from police firing, how can the blame be put on Uma Bharti? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  The BJP and its sangh siblings have been paid in their own coin by the arrest of the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Uma Bharti. Unable to digest its election defeat, the BJP has behaved disgracefully, by disrupting the budget session of the parliament and with the tainted ministers campaign. All Indian political parties are housed in metaphorical glass buildings. None of them ought to throw stones at the others.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur

				 																																																				Sir  Is it not time for the United Progressive Alliance government to concede the main demand of the opposition, and ask the tainted cabinet ministers to resign, following the example set by Uma Bharti? Only this, it seems, can ensure a smooth running of the parliament and put a check on the misuse of taxpayers money.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  After Dhananjoy Chatterjee, its Uma Bhartis turn to keep us glued to the front page of the newspapers. Each step of hers, like that of the hanged man, is reported. But does she deserve so much attention? Hers was hardly an epic journey, for a great cause, she was merely going to attend a call from the judiciary. 				 																																																				How is it that politicians like her are always surrounded by so many followers? Few among the current crop of politicians have any contribution towards the country to write home about. If the media left Bharti and her ilk alone, it would bring them down from the pedestal that thousands of Indians have placed them on.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chaitali Tarafdar, Singapore

				 																																																				Sir  After the goonda raj and the jungle raj, what we are watching now in Indian politics is vendetta raj. From Shibu Soren to Uma Bharti, from Murli Manohar Joshis education policy to that of Arjun Singh, vengeance is the prime weapon in the political turf wars. How long are we going to let development suffer at the hands of this revenge politics?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bibhabari Rath, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  Uma Bharti is not under arrest for raising or honouring the national tricolour. No Indian would grudge her that right. The former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh is under arrest for violating prohibitory orders. She led a riotous mob to the Idgah, which had restraining/ prohibitory orders around it at that time. By leading the mob, she violated a court order and hence the law of the land. She has to face the consequences of this. Let us not create a martyr of a legal offender. The merit of the prohibitory orders imposed around the Idgah is a different issue altogether, which should not be brought in to divert attention.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aroop Philip, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  Indian politics hasnt been cured of its affinity for drama. The mass hysteria whipped up by Uma Bharti over her train ride to Hubli would make any Bollywood film-maker go green with envy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,R. Sekar, Angul

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 							 																						BLAME 																													IT ON																													BBC He was cutting the crap and making it happen at the worlds premier broadcasting organisation. But now that director general Greg Dyke has resigned, a tamer outfit is probably on the cards																														Within 24 hours of the publication of Lord Huttons report into the circumstances of the suicide of the British weapons inspector, Dr David Kelly, the BBCs director general, Greg Dyke, had resigned and so had its chairman, Gavyn Davies.																														While Davies, a former economist at Goldman Sachs, was the BBCs figurehead, Dyke was its Sourav Ganguly, the driving force behind the radical changes which have taken place at the BBC since he took over from Lord (John) Birt as director general exactly four years ago. Dyke is a rich man but he would have liked the BBCs board of governors not to have accepted his offer to resign from his 464,000 a year socially prestigious job. But the reality is that once Hutton had savaged the BBC in his very one-sided report, there was no way that either Dyke, who was editor-in-chief as well, or Davies could survive. The irony is that they were both Labour Party supporters and Tonys cronies. Dyke even paid 55,000 towards Tony Blairs leadership campaign.																														What does Dykes resignation mean for the BBC, the worlds premier broadcasting organisation with a history stretching back to 1922? What does this mean for Britain where a post-Hutton opinion poll has shown most people still trust the BBC more than the government? And what does it mean for Indians and India? The BBC has ambitious plans for India, where, among many other ventures, it desperately wants to get into FM broadcasting. Under Dyke, the BBC has changed its recruitment policy to take in many more blacks and Asians. Perhaps this is explained by Dykes own modest upbringing. Unlike director generals of the past, he is most definitely not upper class. 																														He was born in west London just a few weeks before Indian Independence on May 20, 1947, the third son of an insurance office manager. He was educated at Hayes Grammar School and later went to York University as a mature student in his mid-20s to read politics. In between, he worked as a trainee manager at Marks amp; Spencer and had a brief spell as a local newspaper reporter. Small in height, he sported the fashionable unshaven look until recently. He found his niche in television after he joined London Weekend Television (LWT) in 1977. Dyke rose through the ranks of television, going from one senior executive post to another. At TV-am, when ratings were falling, he introduced a popular puppet called Roland Rat  said to be the first recorded instance in history of a rat joining a sinking ship.																														Along the way, a takeover of LWT by Granada TV saw his share options realise 7 million. He and his partner, Susan Howes, a teacher, who have two children of their own and two from her previous relationship, have been together since 1983. Dyke and his first wife, Christine, were divorced after seven years of marriage. In January, 2000, he succeeded John Birt who had allegedly crushed the creative spark at the BBC (according to critics such as Mark Tully). To save more money for programme making, Dyke banned croissants at breakfast meetings, ordered journalists to take fewer taxies and told staff he was cutting the crap and making it happen.																														He revealed a certain social chippiness when he declared: I went into TV because I actually know who the audience were. A lot of people who came from English public school, Oxbridge education had no idea. He upset middle England by describing the staff makeup at the BBC, which is funded by viewers licence fees, as hideously white. He wanted blacks and Asians employed in front and behind the cameras to ensure the BBC reflected multi-cultural Britain. Dyke ensured that his ethnic minority target of 4.38 per cent for managers and 10.02 per cent for all staff (admittedly some are cleaners) was reached by the end of last year. 																														On the minus side, there is no doubt that under his watch the BBC has dumbed down through relying on trash to bolster ratings. Dyke complained of elitist ways but in the name of diversity, yobs and rough working class culture have been in the ascendant.																														A tamer BBC is probably on the cards. Wiping away tears, Dyke reminded his staff during his resignation speech of the historic responsibility of the BBC, a national and indeed international institution. It says a lot for him that BBC staff up and down Britain left work, came out on to the streets, clutching banners urging him to stay.

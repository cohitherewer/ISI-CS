The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 15, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The image lies				 																																																				Sir  The confident boss that the image gurus make him out to be and the corporate bosses view him as is best manifested in Sourav Ganguly when he is caught chewing his nails whenever he is (and now most of the times he is) in a fix during a match (Making of the Boss, Aug 8). His demonic gesticulations whenever an opponent batsman gets out speak highly of his boss-like conduct. And nowhere is his confidence (or the lack of it) most pronounced than when he dashes out to the field like a man possessed and jumps on to his teams two not out batsmen when his side wins a game. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,  Mrinmoy Prasad Goswami, Assam
				 																Deer departed				 																																																				Sir  It was distressing to see the picture of a dying deer being hauled away at the Alipore zoo by two employees and dumped in a corner to die (Farewell my friend, Aug 10). The fact that such an inhuman act took place in a zoo funded by taxpayers money and chartered to take care of animals under its care, makes it even more deplorable. In a city that lets innocent children die in hospitals bitten by rats and stray dogs  and no one is taken to task for it  it should come as no surprise that the zoo officials are let off without any explanation for their apathetic and criminal conduct.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subash Majumdar, California

				 																																																				Sir  Amit Duttas photograph of the wounded deer at the Alipur zoo was not only moving but it also showed his empathy for wild life and his eye for a good picture. I know that nothing will be done to improve the living conditions of the animals in the zoo  people will crowd to see them every year, they will disturb the animals in every possible way and the animals will suffer as a result of atmospheric pollution, the legacy of human beings. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhabrata Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why wasnt a vet called in to attend the sick deer? Doesnt the zoo have one, and is it standard practice for ill animals to be simply left to die? If that is the case then it is time the zoo is closed down and the animals let off in the wild.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nilima Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Is it that we cant change the fate of animals or is it that we dont want to? Be it in the jungles or in the zoos, they seem born to be hunted or die as a result of others whims. But shouldnt a little more care be taken to protect the animals that we keep pent up? We dont have a right to savour the beauty of the spotted deer if we treat a wounded one with such callousness  dragging it by the legs and abandoning it to die alone, unattended. We couldnt see the faces of the inmates of Abu Ghraib prison when their friends died in front of their eyes, but there must have been similar expressions in the eyes of the deer who were gathered around their friend. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subrata Chakraborty, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The fact that bird-watching is now being promoted in north Bengal in a bid to attract more tourists is welcome news (Bird camp to boost tourism, Aut 10). This will not only create job opportunities in the area but will also lead to an increased awareness of conservation issues. Forest areas in north Bengal, including Gorumara, already threatened by the proposed East-West corridor, need a boost if they are to survive. The Association for Conservation and Tourism must be congratulated for hitting upon this brilliant ploy to explain to lay persons the importance of our rich flora and fauna. Will those entrepreneurs, who are out to demolish everything that comes in the way of development and profit, draw a lesson?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Suchandra Kundu, Calcutta

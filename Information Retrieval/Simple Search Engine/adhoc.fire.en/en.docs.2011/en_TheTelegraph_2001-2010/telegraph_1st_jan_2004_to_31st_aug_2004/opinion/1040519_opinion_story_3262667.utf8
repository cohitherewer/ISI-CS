The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Some quick calculations				 																																																				Sir  Perhaps the Karnataka governor doesnt know (Governor steps into muddle, May 17). But the muddle in the state may be sorted out as soon as that in the Centre resolves itself. Although the Janata Dal (Secular) counts for little in the government formation at the Centre, H.D. Deve Gowda may as yet cash in on the benevolent mood of the Congress. Which means the veteran leader has his instincts in the right place when he insists that the Congress may as well give in to his demand for a Jammu and Kashmir type of settlement in Karnataka. Besides, his logic is sound. There can be no doubt that as in Andhra Pradesh, the people in Karnataka voted against the incumbent government. If 138 seats for the Bharatiya Janata Party as against 145 for the Congress in the Lok Sabha is regarded as an anti-BJP tide, there is no reason why the Congresss tally of 65 seats in the assembly compared to the BJPs 79 should be considered a pro-Congress vote. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Left with the handle				 																																																				Sir  That the market perceives the Congress and the left to be strange bedfellows was evident in the way the sensitive index responded to the goings-on in New Delhi with the steepest-ever crash since 1992. Since liberalization began, investors have never felt more vulnerable than now. There are valid reasons for this. The only binding factor between the disparate groups that are the Congresss allies is hatred for a common enemy, the Bharatiya Janata Party. That their ideologies are vastly different was known. Now we know that these ideologies have not been forsaken for a common minimum programme. Time will only tell how long this government can function, but it is clear that there can be only two outcomes. One, assuming that the decidedly pro-reforms Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram take over the finance and the commerce ministries, and the Congress-led government comes increasingly in friction with the left, there could be mid-term elections. Or else, there could be a common minimum programme without any major reforms programmes. The government may then last a full term but the reign would be one of glorious inaction.				 																																																				The first seems likelier. For coalitions to last, there must be commonality of social or political ideology. Mere anti-BJP-ism may not be able to hold together the self-appointed flag bearers of secularism if they cannot agree upon a sensible and mutually acceptable economic programme.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Mondays bloodbath at the stock markets has cost the Indian economy dear, that is a fact beyond dispute. It is also clear that this has happened due to the statements of left leaders who have suddenly become indispensable to form the government. If we see the track record of the left in India, we will see that they have a problem for every solution, and no solution for any problem. Even now, they are aiming to hold the whip without any responsibility for the course of the cart. There is one more thing that needs to be pointed out. The losses of the bloody Monday do not affect the red voter base. This was Indias loss, Bharat does not understand what all this means.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The left parties are the most opportunist elements in Indian politics. Today they are cajoling Sonia Gandhi to take up the prime ministers post, but the same left parties once initiated a smear campaign against Rajiv Gandhi. The veteran Marxist, Jyoti Basu, had even said that Rajiv Gandhi was a total misfit in politics and shouldnt be handed over power to rule India. Basu had also said of Sonia that she was a mere housewife and didnt know anything about politics. Given the eagerness of the left, it seems that Sonia has developed tremendous political experience.				 																																																				The leftists had once joined hands with another blatant opportunist of Indian politics, V.P. Singh, to drag Rajiv Gandhi out of power. That was the reason why the BJP took centrestage in Indian politics. I remember Harkishen Singh Surjeet saying something to the effect that we need to get rid of the Congress first and then we can handle the BJP. What the left is now saying is just the reverse. Yours faithfully, 
Tirthankar Bandyopadhyay, Hounslow, UK Sir  The decision of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) not to join the government is unfortunate. It is a betrayal of peoples trust. The CPI(M) should have clearly understood that it is not possible to effectively influence a government from outside. It is also not possible for the left to win a sufficient number of seats in parliament in the foreseeable future to be able to have total control of the government. This was the best chance the left has had to be in a position to exert some influence on the decision-making process at the Centre. Its decision to sit out shows a total lack of understanding of the political reality.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  As a Calcuttan, I am a first-hand witness to development coming to a standstill in West Bengal. The states contribution to the nations gross national product is negligible, regular bandhs have created apprehensions in the corporate sector and throttled the growth of employment. Today when the entire world is aiming at economic growth, the left parties are thinking of giving up disinvestment, they wish to further subsidize petroleum products and power. A reason to celebrate indeed. Power is in the hands of the self-proclaimed thekedaars of secularism. But what has either Laloo Prasad Yadav or the left done to improve the condition of the minorities in their own states? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rishi Bhardwaj, Calcutta

				 																Mismatching figures				 																																																				Sir  The report, Whats in it for us (May 16), mentions that 55.5 per cent of those who voted Congress are from Bengal. The figure seems arbitrary because the Congress has won only six seats from West Bengal. We would appreciate it if you could please check the statistics before printing such misleading facts.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ravi Kumar, Calcutta

		 Friday, June 18, 2004 							 																						LIVE ALL YOU CAN 							 - A great and talkative man 				 	 In front of the Palazzo Borghese, Rome, 1899The Master By Colm T oacute;ib iacute;n, Picador,  pound; 15.99What living occasion can be just to the absent? W.H. Auden had wondered, standing at the grave of Henry James a quarter of a century after the Masters death in 1916. Auden had gone on to write a difficult and beautiful poem about a great and talkative man, a master of nuance and scruple. But his poem is also a prayer for himself and all writers, living or dead, appealing to the Master for intercession: Because there are many whose works/ Are in better taste than their lives, because there is no end/ To the vanity of our calling.																														Colm Tibn  born in Ireland almost 15 years after Auden wrote At the Grave of Henry James  has chosen for the subject of his fifth novel five years in the life of James, 1895-1900, although with many forays backwards in time. In terms of Jamess career, this period begins with the humiliating failure of his play, Guy Domville, in London, sees him through What Maisie Knew, The Turn of the Screw, The Awkward Age and The Sacred Fount, and brings him to the threshold of his last great phase. The Ambassadors, The Wings of the Dove and The Golden Bowl would all be written within the first four years of the new century. This is also the period that sees the domestication of an inveterate cosmopolite. After ranging between the Englands, New and Old, and the Continent for the first fifty years of his life, James, already famous, well-off and socially coveted, begins his middle years by acquiring Lamb House in the English town of Rye in Sussex, and settling down there with an electric connection, a little fleet of servants and a constant stream of house-guests (the bump of luggage has been too frequent on my stair). A pain in the hand also forced him to buy a Remington and employ a stenographer.																														Switching from writing to dictation would have a profound effect on his late style. It would make the endlessly spun-out nuances and precautions of his celebrated talkativeness integral to the sublime difficulty of his late works. So talking, writing and living become inseparable in these middle years  the voice, the style and the life coming together in the quintessentially fin-de-sicle question of what James called the human tone. And this is what makes the great silences in his life so resonant and alluring for the modern novelist, biographer and critic. But each will have to tackle, in his own way, the separate challenges of being just to the absent, of putting in place the vanity of his particular calling, and of making the absent present or the reticent speak without violating the integrity of either. This is a matter of both intelligence and taste, apart from the basic question of craft. And with someone like James  fastidious as/ A delicate nun, in Audens words  the standards are paralysingly high. One admires, therefore, Tibns heroism in taking on none less than the Master. But one also watches, rather helplessly, as he totters on the line between tact and daring, and proves himself more an overreacher than a hero, more Icarus than Hercules.																														Great masters are best illuminated by other great masters, often in brief flashes: Audens poem, or a little essay by Borges, describing James as a resigned and ironic inhabitant of Hell. Sometimes, they are served by excellent biographers, and Tibns novel rests heavily on the work of Leon Edel and Lyndall Gordon, just as anybody imagining into the life of Wilde or Yeats will have to contend with Richard Ellmann. Observant contemporaries and intimates also leave their indispensable accounts: the memoirs of Prousts maid, Max Beerbohms parodies and caricatures, Ford Madox Fords Portraits From Life (his James is entirely at odds with Tibns portrayal). And then, the masters themselves leave self-portraits that pretend to be fictions about other artists, actual or imagined. Jamess own The Figure in the Carpet and The Lesson of the Master, Wildes Dorian Gray, Manns Doctor Faustus and Death in Venice, and Patrick Whites The Vivisector are all anatomies of greatness by the great. Each makes a leap of the imagination into its own, proper dark, a leap so naturally propelled by genius that questions of daring, tact, humility or morality simply do not arise, or are transmuted into the stuff of art in the very process of being engaged with.																														But not so with writers of the order of Tibn. Critical sensitivity, homosexual empathy and an elegant prose-style are just not enough to beat Henry and his Kind at their own games of elusiveness and treachery. All that we are left with is a rather limited range of simplified tones, devoid of ambiguity and amplitude, after genius is refracted through the medium of an essentially mediocre consciousness. Tibns James is a reticent, self-effacing, and strangely autumnal figure, a marginal listener and watcher, whose life  especially erotic life  is a series of evasions, denials or resentments, morbidly shadowed by the complicated demands of women who make themselves inscrutably ill or jump fatally from high Venetian balconies after failing to get from him what he can, or will, never give them. This fills him with guilt, haunts his dreams, and informs his life with a sense of his own apartness, the feeling of being away from the heart of things. To tell the story of Jamess middle years only in these terms, and in this tone of affected restraint, is akin to reducing the fullness of Keatss autumn to only the chill and the stubble-fields, leaving out the wailing gnats, the bleating lambs and the twittering swallows. And this, because James seems to have been celibate, or as his doctor concluded, his amatory coefficient was comparatively low?																														In a 1999 essay about fear and silence in the gay past, Tibn reads Jamess The Beast in the Jungle as a story about a gay man whose sexuality has left him frozen in the world. Queer was one of Jamess favourite words. But when he used the word, or when Nol Coward used the word gay, they could invoke depths of oddness or strangeness, frivolity or flamboyance that went far beyond the question of sexual preference, and would leave modern-day queerists sounding reductively earnest. Denial or repression did not leave James frozen in the world, as his contemporaries and writings would attest. His hatred of Wilde was complex (an unclean beast), but passionate, as was his friendship with the young sculptor, Henrik Andersen, the closest to abjection that James allowed himself to get. Tibn reins all this in, and is entirely unable to capture the panicked resolve to be dazzlingly clear, the bewildering vitality and generosity of his conversation, as recalled by Ford. We get, therefore, a quieter, more diffident Master, bathed in the glow of a curiously stilted serenity. 																														Yet, late in 1900, Jamess awareness of his own loneliness is expressed in an act of impassioned communication to a friend who had enquired about the point of departure of Jamess life: The port from which I set out was, I think, that of the essential loneliness of my life  and it seems to be the port also, in sooth, to which my course again finally directs itself! This loneliness (since I mention it)  what is it still but the deepest thing about one? Deeper, about me, at any rate, than anything else; deeper than my genius, deeper than my discipline, deeper than my pride, deeper, above all, than the deep counterminings of art. Just a couple of years later, in The Ambassadors, a middle-aged American would urge a young man, with the same ardent conviction, on a glorious Sunday afternoon in Paris, to Live all you can; its a mistake not toLive, live! There is no room for this tone in Tibns novel.						AVEEK SEN

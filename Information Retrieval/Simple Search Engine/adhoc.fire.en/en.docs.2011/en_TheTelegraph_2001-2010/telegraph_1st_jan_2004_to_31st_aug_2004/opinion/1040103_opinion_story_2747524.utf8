				 																																	Bollywood over, M.F. Husain has moved on to another national obsession  cricket. The artist has recently been engaged by Mumbais Cricket Club of India to paint murals for their revamped restobar. The bar is to be re-christened Polly Pub (after the legendary Umrhigar). But the multi-faceted artist has decided to paint my interpretations of cricket and not the stars. Will his patrons be able to comprehend his art? You dont expect leg-spin and square-cut specialists to talk in-depth on his use of colour, now, do you? Silence and sensibility She believes in being seen and  not heard. Nandana Sen has decided to go silent. And thinks  it will speak out, if at all, louder than words about her  acting prowess. Sen plays the lead in a silent film by Telugu  director Aditya Om titled Mr Lonely and Mrs Lovely. Says  Sen, This was an interesting opportunity to reveal my feelings  instinctively, through expressions and body language rather  than dialogue. Yes, and also hide any flaws she might have  with diction, not to mention accent. Some of our half-Cypriot,  quarter-Canadian Bollywood starlets could take a cue.  Pop singer Sting spent a quiet  evening on vacation with wife and kid in Jaisalmer, drinking  masala chai, this New Years Eve. No surprises there. After  the deserts brought him fame, its only natural for him  to want to celebrate the cause. So whats his next hit going  to be? Desert Tearose?

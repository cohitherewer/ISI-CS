Nine-eleven marked the coming of age of global terrorism. While the United States of America and Europe have only just realized the gravity of the problem, India has been living with terrorism for at least two decades. This volume has essays by bureaucrats, diplomats, academics and military officers, which highlight the roots of terrorism in south Asia.																														Terrorism arises out of religious intolerance and ethnic bias, says Satish Kumar. Thus combating terrorism in a country like India, which has a pluralistic society and a democratic set-up, requires building public opinion against ethnic prejudice and religious discrimination.																														A majoritarian democracy, if it tries to enforce a unitary state, can also precipitate polarization of political culture. The essay by Paikiasothy Sarvanamuttu shows how the Sri Lankan governments policy of giving primacy to the Sinhalese led to the marginalization and discrimination of the Tamils. Similarly, the explosive situation in Nepal can be imputed to the fact that while the Brahmins, Chhetris and Newars form only 37.5 per cent of the population they hold over 80 per cent of government jobs. Ram S. Mahat argues in his essay that this ethnic disbalance in the state structure must be set right if the Maoists are to be tackled and the newly-established democracy is to function in that country.																														Shafi Sami locates far more basic reasons for the rise of terrorism  poverty and lack of human rights.																														Besides these secular factors, some of the contributors blame the nexus between religion and politics for the emergence of insurgencies. K. Santhanam, director of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, claims that one principal cause of global terrorism is the rise of religiosity the world over. This is also manifest in the greater use of religion by political parties, or in parties with a religious agenda like the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal and the Jamat-e-Islami.																														Imtiaz Ahmed of Dhaka University seems to sense the end of nationstates in the near future, as the notion of sovereignty gives way to a diffused idea of self-governance. This development, he claims, leads to a proliferation of non-state powers. Also, there is greater reliance on other components of civil society like intellectuals, the media, schools, universities, and so on. 																														The steady weakening of state institutions requires the setting up of bodies like the International Criminal Court. Such global bodies are necessary, feels the German sociologist, Claudia Haydt, because in the new millennium there has been an amalgamation of sub-national terror groups with transnational organizations. Take al Qaida.																														This book is partly descriptive and partly prescriptive. Bangladesh and Pakistan are, by common consent, failed states, and one cannot generalize about systemic failure from these two cases. In other words, the nation-state is not yet a spent force. However, Imtiaz Ahmed is right to emphasize on the importance of non-state apparatus to fight terrorism. But the principal thrust of most essays  lack of development and government jobs, owing to discriminatory ethnic politics, leads to terrorism  is simplistic. Insurgencies have also arisen out of economic prosperity  take the Akali terrorism, which was the result of the pampering of the Punjabi peasantry by the Centre.																														Most of the essays are very small and thus there is little space to develop the arguments in a logical manner. Another problem is the lack of proper endnotes. Books on terrorism are a growing industry. This one is a typical example of how they are often put together without much thought or proper editing. 						KAUSHIK ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 							 																						CALL FOR FUNDS																														The abuse of power could often take novel and elusive forms. In West Bengal, ministers have been sending out, using their official letter-head and seal, requests for donations and sponsorships to a number of government and private firms, including hotels and banks. The occasion was the birthday of Subhas Chandra Bose. The sports minister, Mr Subhas Chakraborty, together with the ministers for food, relief and fire services have all sent out such requests, although the food minister claims that his signature was forged. It has also been alleged that some of the ministers have also stipulated the lower limits for the donations. In some cases, nothing less than a lakh would have sufficed. This is arm-twisting of really the worst kind, of the sort that most neighbourhoods in the city have to suffer in the hands of local club rowdies during the various pujas. It certainly speaks for the egalitarianism of the Left Front in Bengal that its ministers replicate, with impunity, some of the habits of the masses, even when these habits tend towards the lower end of the dubious. Given the relative positions of a minister and a private or government company within the grid of power relations in the state, calling such letters requests for donations is carrying a euphemism too far. The fact that most of these companies feel uncertain or anxious about what sort of a stance to take with regard to these letters is also perfectly understandable.																														The sports minister and his fund-raiser comrades have all sounded quite brazen about the whole thing  there is no harm in raising money for a good cause, and such things have been happening from time immemorial and are therefore perfectly all right. In this, too, they see eye to eye with their less exalted fellow citizens. The chief minister has declared that he is not entitled to answering every question. Questions of transparency and accountability, which naturally arise with such behaviour, have been smoothly fielded thus. Extravagant rallies commemorating national heroes are questionable enough. Ministers pressurizing private and government companies to fund these feats of self-advertisement can be part of no proper ethic of governance.

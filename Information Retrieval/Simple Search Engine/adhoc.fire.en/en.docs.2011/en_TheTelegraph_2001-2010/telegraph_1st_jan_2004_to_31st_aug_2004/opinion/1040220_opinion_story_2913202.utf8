The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 20, 2004 							 																						WASTED TRIP																														The trade representative of the United States of America, Mr Robert Zoellick, visited India to drum up support for the resumption of the Doha development agenda talks. The US and the European Union recognize that India, Brazil, South Africa, China and Egypt are the key to breaking the developing country coalition forged in Cancun. If reports are correct, the meeting between Mr Zoellick and Mr Arun Jaitley led nowhere, with both sides restating known positions. Understandably so, because US and EU positions on reducing domestic support or export subsidies in agriculture have not changed. It is agriculture rather than Singapore issues that hold up DDA. The US and India agreed that DDA should not be overloaded by including all four Singapore issues of transparency in government procurement, trade facilitation, investment and competition policy. At Cancun itself, it was obvious that Singapore issues would amount to negotiating trade facilitation and no more. The stumbling block was, and continues to be, agriculture. The developing country coalition rightly argues that liberalizing agricultural imports without removing distortions through domestic support and export subsidies is pointless. On the latter, present developed country offers are not good enough. Attempts to break the developing country coalition have so far been resisted.																														At least the core of the coalition has held. If anything, through preferential trade agreements, India has moved closer to Brazil and South Africa. Indias position on resisting agricultural import liberalization, because of concerns on dairy and edible oils, cannot be overdone. This is a point the US trade representative made. However, Mr Jaitley is right that this is impossible unless developed countries reform other areas of agriculture. Not only has this not happened, the US has increasingly turned protectionist. Beyond steel and garments, this now involves anti-dumping duties on Indian shrimps and legislative ban on outsourcing. There is a difference between law and spirit of liberalization. Mr Zoellick is correct in arguing that since service sector liberalization in the World Trade Organization is incomplete and since India is not a signatory to the plurilateral government procurement code, no WTO laws are violated if outsourcing is prohibited. The consequent price will have to be paid by US consumers and companies. It is certain that backlash against such protectionism will surface within the US. But from the perspective of trade negotiations, the US certainly loses moral authority to preach free trade if it does not practice it. With elections imminent, it will be left to Zoellicks successor to reconcile the two.

		 Friday, January 23, 2004 							 																						HUNGRY FOR A CHANGE Jaydev Jana																					A tragic paradox is that even while democracies are apathetic to mass starvation they downplay and ignore the fact that hundreds of millions of children and adults continue to lead lives of severe undernutrition since it hardly provokes public outcry. Even if a few starvation deaths get reported in the press, the government goes out of its way to first deny them and then take some perfunctory emergency measures. Politicians easily resort to lies to have people believe that such deaths have nothing to do with starvation. In the last century, nearly 150 million people were killed by wars. But in just the last half of that century, nearly three times as many died of malnutrition. 																					Even in India, hunger deaths have been reported from Kashipur in Orissa and Barab in Rajasthan in 2002. Hunger-stricken Sahariyas, who did not even have the means to buy rice and wheat at subsidized prices, took to eating grass as the next best substitute. The resulting malnourishment took its toll and more than 24 starvation-related deaths among the Sahariyas  mostly children  were soon reported. 																					The health consequences of starvation are enormous. Continuing starvation results in malnutrition that takes its toll everyday. The combination of malnutrition and infectious diseases can be pernicious. Protein-energy malnutrition can impair the immune system, leaving malnourished children less able to battle common diseases such as measles, diarrhoea, respiratory infections, tuberculosis and malaria. A recent survey by the West Bengal health department concluded that 16 per cent of deaths in government hospitals were caused by these diseases. 																					Fatal consequences																					Every year, as many as 860 million people suffer from malnutrition and as many as 36 million people die of direct or indirect effects of starvation worldwide, despite the fact that the world produces enough food to feed the entire global population. The cost of hunger is immense. The World Bank has estimated that every year, malnutrition causes the loss of 46 million years of productive life, at a cost of $16 million annually, several times the cost of ending hunger and turning the loss into productive gain. 																					India is home to the largest number of ill and underfed men, women and children. The National Family Health Survey conducted by the Central government reveals that 18 per cent of children under three years here are severely malnourished. Under-nourishment of women and children is largely ignored because this section of the population is relegated to the fringes of society plagued by hunger and poverty. 																					Indian women are conditioned, and often forced, to skip meals so that other members of the family can have enough to eat. As a result, under-nourished mothers give birth to undernourished children. Thus ensues an intergenerational cycle of poverty and malnutrition. 																					Do it now																					The make-believe statistics of poverty reduction paraded by the government often overshadows the reality of starvation. A reduction in poverty ration, which is the proportion of people below a normatively defined poverty line, does not guarantee alleviation of starvation. The latest round of the National Sample Survey revealed that one-fifth of rural households live precariously; nearly 19 per cent of those surveyed get enough to eat only during the months they work. As the lean season approaches, they join the chronically hungry category.																					Today the poor starve not because of a shortage of food, but rather due to its inaccessibility and their failure to grab political attention. In a case involving the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties and some NGOs, the Supreme Court ordered the government on November 28, 2001, to treat nutrition-related programmes as legal entitlements and ensure cooked meals in primary schools. Yet, elimination of chronic hunger does not get priority in planning and budget allocation. So even while much is made of the recent economic growth of India, millions of people routinely go to bed hungry. It is imperative of the government to eradicate starvation. The means and the know-how to do it are there, what is needed is efficient leadership.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Hounded by music				 																																																				Sir  Calcutta, like most Indian cities, is savaged by pollution in every conceivable form. But what is truly menacing and worrisome is the complete lack of civic resistance to forms of pollution which can quickly be curbed. The latest contorted invention of the Indian mind is the raucous sound emitted by cars when they are reversing. I have seen some drivers deliberately reversing to enjoy the music. It is amazing that people pay to affix these contraptions. It bothers no one that this unnecessary menace is imposed on a populace already having to live with numerous pollutants. I am sure there are many helpless citizens like myself who would like the police to curb this. In the past, they have efficiently halted the scourge of electric horns. A driver who is unable to reverse his car without creating a racket obviously has a driving deficiency and should have his licence revoked.

				 																Lost trust				 																																																				Sir  The moratorium on the Global Trust Bank, and its take-over by the Oriental Bank of Commerce, have resulted in widespread panic and anxiety among the middle classes who had put their hard-earned money with the bank (Oriental Bank to take over GTB, July 27). But it has become common for some private-sector banks to declare themselves bankrupt. In most of these cases, the promoters or key functionaries escape by virtue of their links with top political leaders. The government appoints a routine joint parliamentary committee, which in most cases is an eyewash. This has happened in the cases of ICICI, UTI, and several cooperative banks. The end of the story is well known: the probe takes years, the public soon forgets all about it, and the culpable officials join some other lucrative venture and continue duping hapless investors. Things have come to such a pass that being involved in a scam has become a matter of pride for prominent financial institutions. 				 																																																				The government must be pressurized through parliament to take drastic action against these white collar criminals, and to seize their disproportionate income and distribute it among the affected account-holders. What is also surprising is the silence on this issue from the left parties, who do not miss an opportunity to make a hue and cry about foreign investment and privatization. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
V.K. Chakrapani, Vadodara

				 																																																				Sir  GTB was promoted by Ramesh Gelli, a chartered accountant who had got the presidents award for good banking. Suddenly, the bank has lost its trust with the Reserve Bank of India and more important, with its own customers. It was only four years back, when Yashwant Sinha was the finance minister, that the government-backed Unit Trust of India went bust in much the same way. This spelled doom for large numbers of investors, including pensionless senior citizens like myself. Incidents like these show that there are no checks to curb cheating, which has become a lucrative business.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  If the RBI has indeed found discrepancies in the working of the GTB grave enough to invite a moratorium, did it have to make the announcement so sudden? Is the RBI really working in public interest? The biggest disadvantage of the RBI directive is that not more than Rs 10,000 can be withdrawn by an account-holder during this moratorium period of three months. What happens to families who have to draw money for running their houses or for paying their medical bills? 				 																																																				Instead of this drastic step, the RBI could have attached the assets of the bank or confiscated the promoters share. It is in the interests of the investors that the Central government form a committee for assessing the situation and take appropriate measure to bail the investors out of a liquidity crisis.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Read the fine print of the GTB episode. Officials of the OBC have promised to recover 40-45 per cent of the bad loans accumulated by the GTB. The latters shareholders may now demand a share of the pie if these loans are recovered. OBC is paying 40 per cent tax against its profits. This will go down when GTBs losses are adjusted against the profits. Again, GTB shareholders may stake their claim to what the OBC saves in taxes because GTBs losses have impoverished them. The best part is that GTB shares have not been swapped with OBC shares. They still have their own identity though their value is being considered as zero. The government is contemplating action against auditors and promoters for fudging the books of accounts. If the American example is followed and money realized from the auditors and promoters, the shareholders might be benefited. It is true that investment in shares is subject to market risks and that shareholders should be ready to face them even if the value of the shares becomes zero. Nut bank shares are far different from other shares as strict regulatory bodies govern banks. Investors buy shares after going through certified balance sheets. If the management had fudged the books with the connivance of the auditors, shareholders have every right to sue these parties.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Breach of trust (July 30), draws attention to one other case of bank fraud perpetrated by influential promoters with the connivance of politicians and more alarmingly, the top functionaries of the regulator, the RBI. In the light of this, two pertinent questions come to mind: one, what action is sought to be initiated against the top brass of the RBI for its apparent connivance in turning a blind eye to a fraud involving public money of such large proportions? What was the deputy governor heading the department of banking supervision doing while the fraud was being committed under his nose? Two, it is quite apparent that Ramesh Gellis high-flying lifestyle has been at the expense of public money. He is nothing short of a criminal and should be dealt with as such.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S.K. Sen, Calcutta

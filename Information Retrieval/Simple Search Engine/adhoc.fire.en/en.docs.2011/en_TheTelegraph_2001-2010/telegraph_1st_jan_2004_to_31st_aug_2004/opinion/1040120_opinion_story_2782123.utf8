		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004  NOT BY CHARM ALONE 
 Handicapped by an uncaring and unfair  administration, the police cannot hope to win the battle against  Naxal groups in Jharkhand, writes Uttam Sengupta Danger behind every  bush  It is not often that policemen  publicly seek the support of the media. The recent plea  of Ranchis police superintendent was, thus, unusual. Stung  by media criticism that his men were picking up innocent  tribals and accusing them of sheltering extremists, the  SP pleaded for better understanding. Four of his men had  been killed in an ambush, barely 25 kilometres from the  state capital, but even after a week-and-a-half of relentless  combing, he could only lay his hands on some emaciated,  unarmed and innocent-looking villagers. The armed squad  of militants, that had sprayed the jeep his men were travelling  in with bullets from machine guns, had melted away in the  surrounding forests. And the police clearly had no clue  about their whereabouts or movement. The mainstream media in shining  India have chosen to ignore the crisis brewing in Jharkhand.  In Hazaribagh, Palamau, Lohardaga, Chatra, Bokaro, Giridih,  Singbhum and now Ranchi, land-mines have been blowing up  at regular intervals; policemen are being ambushed, police  stations attacked and their firearms snatched. While the  Jharkhand police have tried their best to gloss over the  incidents, Central agencies have more accurately assessed  the scale of the threat and the number of strikes on the  ground. Their reports are perhaps more alarmist as a result,  but also far closer to the reality on the ground.  The police too have claimed several  successes, in terms of the number of commanders killed,  the recovery of a huge amount of cash hidden in the forest,  the rescue of some of those abducted and inroads made into  some extremist strongholds. But on balance, it has been  an unequal battle, with the militants hit-and-run strategy  catching the police by surprise more often than not. Anti-social  elements have predictably taken advantage of the prevailing  anarchy, often invoking the name of extremist groups to  strike terror or gain respectability. Whats new, one might ask. For  the past 20 years, the police in several states have struggled  to put down the idealist and the downtroddens romance with  revolution. With increasing dollops of CHARM (communication,  hospitality, arms, roads and money), the police have sought  to eliminate the rebels and neutralize the converts. But  it has not had much effect. The radical or the idealist  left have increased their spheres of influence and intelligence  agencies have begun speaking of a red corridor extending  from Nepal in the north to Kerala, down south. Security  agencies have so far waged a losing battle, and there is,  of late, a grudging admission that an unfair, partisan and  ruthless administration can never hope to fight dreams successfully.  The failure of Jharkhand to ensure a fair administration  had to culminate in a resistance that is now bleeding both  sides. The Ranchi SP pointed out that  Naxalite groups were not just using children to carry messages  and report on the movement of policemen, but they were also  recruiting the services of retired defence and police personnel.  In several districts, the extremists had issued a fiat that  one able-bodied youth from each family should join their  squads. Sandwiched thus between the young and old, one can  sympathize with the policemen who are never sure from where  the bullets will come next. The inevitable has happened   the police have begun to give vent to their frustration  by detaining villagers on suspicion, interrogating them  or subjecting them to a worse treatment, and accusing them  of providing logistical support to the extremists.  Like the policemen, the villagers  too , appear sandwiched between the extremists and men in  khaki. The extremists, possibly, are the more frequent visitors,  and the villagers can hardly afford to refuse them food  or shelter. Infrequent visits by the police, one suspects,  is one of many reasons why villagers deny even information  to the men in khaki. There is little love lost between the  villagers and police, even at the best of times. In times  of crises, mutual suspicion cripples any working relationship  and trust between the two. The result is invariably tragic.  The arrests are generally indiscriminate and the poor villagers,  mostly tribals, are left to fend for themselves with little  or no legal assistance. Many families are ruined and the  social fabric damaged beyond repair.  Policemen obviously do not have  the patience to appreciate the process of alienation and  change in society. As the SP would point out, their job  involves apprehending people who are waging a war on the  state, and people who support or sustain the guerillas are  equally guilty and cannot escape retribution. But just as  Naxalite violence is counter-productive and invites even  more ruthless retaliation, police repression too leads to  tragic consequences.  The police recently arrested a  man who, they alleged, had presided over two peoples courts  which had sentenced two villagers. The poor tribal did not  deny the fact but pleaded that he had been asked by the  extremists to preside over the session and could scarcely  refuse. But now that he has been arrested and charged with  being a collaborator, he may well have to close down his  little tea shop and face a long bout of litigation that  will reduce him to a pauper and send him to jail for a long  time, if not the rest of his life. His family members then  would have little option but to fall back on the extremist  groups for sustenance. While the rulers are known to  follow the practice of divide and rule, in Jharkhand one  can see the extremists also doing the same. Playing one  group against another or some mainstream politicians and  parties against their rivals, and drafting some of the lumpen  elements to counter others, they have succeeded in confusing  the rulers. In the process, they have also gained valuable  breathing time and a support base for themselves. The administration  keeps repeating the mistake of treating extremists as a  rag-tag group of misguided men. It certainly required far  greater organizational skills, motivation, money and mobilization,  than the government is prepared to accept, to hold the administration  to ransom in 16 or more districts of the state. A section of the police have put  up street plays to highlight the futility of extremism;  they have tried to educate the villagers about the law,  and to reach out to them with medicine, toys, food and textbooks.  They have sought to reply to the ultras propaganda war  by telling their own version of the truth. They have also  tried the somewhat dangerous strategy of arming villagers  to take on the extremists. Communication equipment and firearms  have been given to villagers to report on the movement and  eliminate, if possible, the banned armed squads. A couple  of lynchings of Naxalites in east and west Singbhum, however,  has failed to stop or stem the increasing number of Naxalite  strikes. On the other hand, several vigilante groups set  up by the police have spun out of control and found robbery  to be a relatively easier means of earning more money. The unholy mess in Jharkhand shows  no sign of being resolved soon, at least not until the government  realizes that it cannot fight a just war against its own  people. The devolution of power through panchayats  could have been one way out. But with the clock ticking  for the general elections, the state is once again likely  to get away by putting off the panchayat polls which have  not been held in the last two decades.

		 Friday, February 13, 2004 							 																						DANGER GRAN 							 - Statecraft and knitting needles				 	 Floating and half-bright MADAME SECRETARY: A MEMOIR By  Madeleine Albright, with Bill Woodward, Macmillan,  pound; 20 Madeleine Albright solves a riddle  that has long puzzled Indians. Why was her father, Josef  Korbel, a Czech diplomat, so virulently anti-Indian and  pro-Pakistani when he was chairman of the United Nations  Commission for India and Pakistan?																														The answer is here. First, his appointment was a Cold War sleight of hand by the Americans. Czechoslovakia had a communist government, but Korbel represented the defunct Benes regime. Second, his main interest was to arrange for political asylum in the United States of America, and timing was critical, because he needed asylum before he lost his Czechoslovak diplomatic status and was forced to leave the US. Naturally, he did everything he could as UNCIP chairman to pander to the Truman administrations Cold War strategy in south Asia, so that the pending asylum plea would be quickly granted.																														Naturally, Albright does not make the connection. But the link between cause and effect is plain as a pikestaff. We can also understand her hysterical reaction to Pokhran II which, she claimed, bore out everything she had learnt about Kashmir at her fathers knee. That tainted source explained the daughters prejudice. Clinging to what she had been told 50 years earlier was also typical of the tunnel vision that made her a singularly unimaginative, often also unintelligent, secretary of state.																														In spite of the early exposure she boasted of, there is barely a mention in this book of Pokhran or, indeed, India. Even when she flew to South Asia, [sic] arriving [where?] on November 17, there is nary a word about the host country (by implication, India) or its leaders. All her time is taken up with telephone conversations with the Russian foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov, to set up a date in Geneva. In fact, whenever an American politician writes his or her memoirs, we are reminded of Indias inconsequence to the American Dream. Whether the present strategic partnership will make any difference to individual perceptions remains to be seen.																														With the courage of her bosss convictions, Albright is far more involved in the Balkans, the Middle East, Cuba and North Korea. The message of these priorities is that for all the alarmist tocsins that the Americans regularly sounded, they did not ever really believe that India and Pakistan were about to plunge the world into a nuclear armageddon. Being hard-headed pragmatists, they attended to what they rightly considered the worlds real hot spots.																														That apart, this is mostly a warm and intimate account of life at the top. The author was the first (and is still the only) woman to head the state department. After Henry Kissinger, she was the first to have been born abroad. Some have suggested  though Albright does not mention it  that Clinton chose her precisely because she was a foreign-born female. George W. Bush carried that genuflection to minorityism a stage further with Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice. Happily for Clintons political gamble, Albright also turned out to be Jewish. So was Kissinger, but whereas there was never any mystery about his antecedents, Albrights ancestry was, apparently, a dark secret until early 1997, when the Washington Post disclosed that not only were both her parents Jews, but three of her grandparents had died in Nazi concentration camps.																														Yet, Korbel and his wife had given every appearance of being Catholics, had observed Christian social festivals and brought up their children in the faith. Albright makes loyal excuses for the lie her father and mother lived all their American lives. But those of us who know Korbel only as the man Jawaharlal Nehru accused of treating the thief and the owner of the house as equals over Kashmir will see a pattern and a purpose in the deception. Albright discusses the pain and shock of the disclosure with a frankness that deserves respect. She is at her best when discussing human situations like her Jewish parentage, the break-up of her marriage and the Monica Lewinsky affair.																														Students of history will not learn much from this autobiography about Americas grand global vision or realpolitik in a unipolar world, except for the unwitting confirmation that there is not much to choose between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to foreign affairs. When Bush ranted and raved against Saddam Hussein at the UN, she had to nod in agreement. But then, one does not expect the vision of Thomas Jefferson, the erudition of Dean Acheson or Kissingers strategic gamesmanship. She is closer to the original concept of the secretary of state as (to quote a writer on American diplomacy) keeper of the great seal, expected to be busy stamping and certifying public documents of importance and unimportance.																														Nevertheless, her thumb sketches of world leaders and asides about their idiosyncrasies make interesting reading. Boris Yeltsin called Clinton Beel. Yasser Arafats description of himself as permanent vice-president of the Organization of Islamic Conference stirred curious ambition in the breast of the US vice-president, Al Gore. Her grammar is quirky and she (or Woodward) writes with folksy humour. Her confessions  like the anxious excitement of waiting for Clintons call to take over the state department  are endearing. As I sat for the first time in the secretarys chair, I was floating, she says with unabashed pleasure. Some of the remarks in this book, either self-deprecatory or ingenuous, may have struck colleagues as nave and encouraged them to turn Albright into Half-bright. Washington can be a cruel place and she is not the only butt of envious witticism. Another predecessor, John Foster Dulles, famously invited the dull, duller, Dulles barb.																														Madeleine Albright is not cerebral. Hillary Clinton, who also went to Wellesley College, tells us elsewhere that in Albrights time, women there were concerned above all with finding a husband. Albright did handsomely in that field  marrying old money and political influence, but then she lost her man to a younger and prettier woman. Politics, her daughters and grandchildren filled the gap. What we have here is a gossipy garrulous granny who could switch off statecraft and turn to her knitting needles. Its a cuddly species but her career is a warning that grannies with knitting needles and more passion than perception can also be dangerous.						SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 23, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 The Oxbridge alumni in India are not quite sure whether to be delighted or disappointed at the elevation of a fellow varsity soul to the office of prime minister. The irrepressible Mani Shankar Aiyar (Clare Hall,1964) summed up the sentiments when, amidst a sea of sycophants, he let loose the real reason for wanting Sonia Gandhi to be prime minister: the prospect of seeing Sushma Swaraj bare-headed. Dr Swapan Dasgupta, he of the parivar, could not understandably be so irreverent. Dr Dasgupta sowed his wild oats on the lush quadrangle of Nuffield (1982) much like Dr Manmohan Singh in the Fifties. Ideology, as any true wog would know, comes only after the call of the alma mater. Privately, Dasgupta has been known to admire Manis sense of humour. Mansoor Ali Khan, the former Nawab of Pataudi (Balliol, 1958), had no such qualms. Khan, who led the Eleven at Oxford, Sussex and India, would rather see Swaraj sans plumage. Singh, admits Khan acidly, was a contemporary but the fellow never came down for a pint.				 																																																																														 Having lost his face, mukhota and all, and perpetually out of sync with the more brazen lot in the parivar, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has little alternative but to place his fate in the hands of astrologers now. And they have deemed 8, Krishna Menon Marg most unsuitable for the former PM. Why? Because number 8 leads to fluctuations in fortunes which ABV can scarcely afford at this point of time. They have a solution, which is being worked upon diligently. The house is reportedly being re-numbered 6A, which in Lutyens parlance means number 7  considered lucky for our poor, old Vajpayee, who was born on December 25 (2+5=7), and occupied 7, Race Course Road for close to 7 years. But hasnt the numbers game proved disastrous for him already?				 																																																																														 What does a cyclone have to do with the Lok Sabha speakers post? Plenty, if you go by what PM Sayeed has to say. This affable former speaker of the lower house, ten-times winner and a surprise loser in these elections from the blue islands of Lakshwadeep, had to apparently forsake the high chair in the Lok Sabha for just 71 votes. Sayeed blames it on the cyclone that hit the islands on voting day, leaving friends, relatives and his supporters stranded in sea. Possibly. But how did his opponent manage to defy the cyclone and get across his own supporters? He probably knew which way the wind the blowing. 				 																																																																														 The saffron defeat has been a shot in the arm for the wily Arun Jaitley. While Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti went all out to hang themselves, Pramod Mahajan and M Venkaiah Naidu lost their stature on the counting day itself. Only Jaitley seems to have played his cards deftly. For one, he refused to go the whole hog to slam Sonia Gandhi. Instead, he concentrated on the falling Sensex and emerged the voice of reason among his malicious party members booing the Italian. Given his proximity to LK Advani, the undisputed successor of ABV, and the fact that he has scored handsomely over Mahajan, Swaraj, Rajnath Singh and the entire batch of the second-rung leaders, Jaitleys star will be rising, never mind his decision to go back to law. 				 																																																																														 The Congress has already started to rewrite the norms. Punch-drunk with their victory, Congressman did not deem it necessary to go through the normal procedures when they virtually commandeered Parliament House and arranged for the live telecast of the great political drama for a full three hours. Manohar Joshi, still speaker, was allegedly not consulted, nor his deputy, PM Sayeed. As for Doordarshan, the possibility of crossing swords did not arise. 				 																																																																														 Guess who was the first to call on N Chandrababu Naidu after his defeat at the hustings? The former Congress poster boy, Digvijay Singh, who too was ousted from power in a similar manner not too long ago. Diggy Raja is said to have asked Naidu not to worry as this was only a temporary phase. Diggy apparently also asked him to join the anti-anti-incumbency club which he will soon be floating. Naidu is said to have reacted positively to the overtures.				 																																																																														 The grief at Sonia rejecting the prime ministership was genuinely felt. There was a display of heartfelt emotions outside 10, Janpath. People cried, squatted and shouted slogans without seeking the permission of the party higher-ups. Some also decided to make the most of this drama. Mobile phones were indiscriminately stolen. A middle rung Congress leader lost a latest mobile set while giving a sound byte to a private channel. All for madam, as they put it.				 																																																																														 While Congresswallahs to a man celebrated their victory, one man sat alone and sulked in the foothills of the Himalayas. Narain Dutt Tiwari is supposed to be extremely upset with the shabby treatment meted out to him for the past two years by 10 Janpath. When the entire Congress leadership descended on the capital to strengthen the hands of Sonia, ND was nowhere to be seen. He apparently didnt even call up madam to congratulate her. Tiwari had wanted to contest the elections from Nainital, but was denied a ticket. He is also peeved at the manner the central leadership supported Harish Rawats fight against him in the hills, resulting in the partys defeat in Uttaranchal. But why such grand snubbing of a veteran leader like ND? His sympathizers claim that Sonia considers ND to be a threat because he is the only eligible cowbelt Brahmin who can match AB Vajpayees stature. And had he been elected to Parliament, he could even have laid claim to the second-highest office in the country. Should we call it wishful thinking by an old man whose retirement is just round the corner?

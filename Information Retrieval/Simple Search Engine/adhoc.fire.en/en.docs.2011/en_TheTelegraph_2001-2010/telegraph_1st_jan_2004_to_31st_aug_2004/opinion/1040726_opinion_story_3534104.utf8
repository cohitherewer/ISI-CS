The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 26, 2004 							 																						HEARING IS NOT BELIEVING Gwynne Dyer																					Two headlines this week showed just how racist western Europeans are. One, quoting a Commission for Racial Equality survey, revealed that 90 per cent of white people in Britain have few or no non-white friends. The other was the blunt statement of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, that we see the spread of the wildest anti-Semitism (in France)...If I had to advise our brothers in France, Id tell them one thing: move to Israel as soon as possible. I say that to Jews all around the world, but there (in France) I think its a must, and they have to move immediately. 																					There is no doubt that anti-Semitic incidents are on the rise in France: from 593 reported attacks or threats against Frances 600,000 Jews in 2003 to 510 in only the first six months of this year. Theres not much doubt that racism flourishes in the United Kingdom, either: in last months elections for the European Parliament, British voters sent eleven members of the upstart UK Independence Party, whose rhetoric includes a lot of coded racism, to represent the country in Brussels. And yet...																					Yet this picture seems much too stark and simple to me. I have lived in London for a long time (though I am not British), and while I know that things are different in rural parts of England and in some post-industrial urban slums up north, what I see in my own streets is a society that is pretty much at ease with racial diversity and (especially in the younger age-groups) happy to party together. More like Toronto than Chicago, if that means anything to you.																					The other side																					We spend a lot of time in France, too. Some of it is in Paris, looking after my wifes almost-bag-lady aunt, who lives in the rougher part of town and is now pretty much alone in the world. Shes an unashamed racist  shes in her late seventies, and she lost her husband in the Algerian war  but people of every race in the neighbourhood are very good about looking after her. She tolerates it, and they tolerate her tolerating it. It doesnt feel like a racist hell.																					So how to explain the gulf between these personal observations and those alarmist headlines? Start with this wave of anti-Semitism in France. Even Sharon conceded that this is not a revival of traditional Christian anti-Semitism. In France today, about 10 per cent of the population are Muslims, he explained, and that gets a different kind of anti-Semitism, based on anti-Israeli feelings and propaganda. What has been happening in France is ugly. In the low-cost, high-rise tracts of housing that ring the big French cities, gangs of poor immigrant kids have begun to harass poor Jewish families that live in the vicinity.																					Not so bad																					They are not exclusively Arab gangs. They will usually include Turks, eastern Europeans, west Africans, and Afro-Caribbeans, as well as white French working-class kids whose families have been dumped in the same high-rises. But all these kids have adopted the stone-throwing Palestinian children of the intifada as their model of defiance to the power that marginalizes them. French Jews, redefined as honorary Israelis, then become the targets of their wrath.																					Only one French Jew in a thousand has reported a threat or an actual attack this year, and the notion that they must all flee France immediately is just Sharon trying to drum up some new immigrants for Israel (where total immigration fell to 25,000 last year). President Jacques Chirac has launched a national appeal for racial and religious tolerance in France, and the number of French Jews who will actually leave for Israel this year is estimated to be around 2,500  less than half of one per cent of the French Jewish community.																					And what about those 90 per cent of white British people who had few or no non-whites among their ten to twenty closest friends? Its the old headline trick: pick the worst possible number and highlight it. In fact, the same survey shows that 46 per cent of white people have at least one non-white friend in their inner circle, and that 47 per cent of Asian and black Britons say that most or all of their friends are white.																					The moral? Believe nothing you hear, and only half of what you read. Things are not as bad as they seem.

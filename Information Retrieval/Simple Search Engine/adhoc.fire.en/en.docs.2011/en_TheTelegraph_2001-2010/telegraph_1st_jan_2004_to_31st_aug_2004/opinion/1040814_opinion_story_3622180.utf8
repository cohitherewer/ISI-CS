		 Saturday, August 14, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Pinning down a star				 																																																				Sir  If only King Khan had known (Imran missed chance to be PM, says Pervez, Aug 11). For the Pakistan general who never thinks twice before destroying those who cease to be of any use to him (remember A.Q. Khan?), never fears courting the devil (America?), it must have been a moment of rare compassion when he tried to help Imran without the latters knowledge. Why is the general parting with the knowledge now? Is it to silence Khan by waving the carrot of a still possible prime ministership in case the former cricketer changed his colour? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,S.C. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Run for cover				 																																																				Sir  Brijesh D. Jayals Chinks in the armour (Aug 4) reflects the typical attitude of the Indian air force. Jayals reference to the Indian armys stand on the possession of attack helicopters is a vain attempt to cover up the main culprit  the IAF. For over 20 years, the IAF has stymied the armys efforts to secure its integral air corps and the adverse consequences of lacking such a corps were hugely felt at Kargil. Air support in mountainous regions is best provided by army gunships because an army helicopter pilot is trained to locate and destroy well-camouflaged strongpoints like bunkers, pill boxes, machine gun nests and so on, unlike an IAF pilot. IAF operations provide benefits to the army in warfare on the plains. 				 																																																				Kargil also reiterated the need for a chief of defence staff. But the IAFs alleged insistence on heading the strategic forces command, which control Indias nuclear arsenal, is supposed to have come in the way. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If Naik Chaman Singh ever knew that his widow, Shakuntala Devi, and his two children would have to face the present consequences, he would have thought several times before joining the Indian army and dying for his motherland (Government terror for Kargil Widow, Aug 12). We know that promises are meant to be broken, which is probably why the government could donate 25 bighas of land to Singhs widow so easily. But if the widow of a war hero is treated like this, wont our jawans have second thoughts before sacrificing their lives? Shakuntala Devi had run from pillar to post before trying to set herself on fire. The same fate may be lying in wait for the other war widows.Yours faithfully, 
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 				 																																																				Sir  The report, Second coming for Kargil prisoners (Aug 10), does not explain why Jagsir Singh and Mohammed Arif had been taken as deserters because they had disappeared. Isnt the capture of rival armymen as prisoners of war a common practice?				 																																																				Another thing. It is strange that both Singh and Arif did not notice other Indian prisoners in the Pakistani jails. Are they parroting the Pakistan line?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anand Singh, Calcutta

				 																No stakes				 																																																				Sir  This refers to the report, Maoists target Indian firm (Aug 12), by Pranay Sharma. In this report it is mentioned that the king of Nepal has a substantial interest in Surya Nepal. We wish to clarify that His Majesty King Gyanendra has no interest in Surya Nepal whatsoever. Sixty-one per cent of the shareholding in Surya Nepal is held by foreign shareholders. The balance 39 per cent is held by 22 Nepalese shareholders.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Anil Seth, vice-president (finance)/company secretary, Surya Nepal Private Limited, Kathmandu

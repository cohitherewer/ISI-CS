		 Friday, March 12, 2004 							 																						THIS CLIMATE OF CRISIS				 	 Politics of a surrenderTHE SCANDAL OF THE STATE: WOMEN, LAW, AND CITIZENSHIP IN POSTCOLONIAL INDIA By Rajeswari Sunder Rajan, Permanent Black, Rs 595Rajeswari Sunder Rajan identifies three major developments since the Eighties that have urged a rethinking in the Indian womens movement about its own trajectory, both politically and theoretically. All three  the new economic programme of liberalization and globalization, the debates over the uniform civil code which gained new impetus and relevance since the Shah Bano case, and the proposal for womens reservation  are related to policies of the state. Inevitably then, the state has gained in its particular importance as a locus for feminist thinking, especially since its operations are a sharp reminder of what the womens movement has failed to achieve so far.																					Rajan has chosen a crucial moment to raise her first and basic question: How do women inhabit the nation-state? There are other questions too, no less important, such as, How do the names citizen and woman inflect each other? These questions have to be asked anew, and the terms rethought and laid out afresh, in what she calls this climate of contention, even crisis. 																					It is a paradoxical situation. The state is responding more than ever before in a positive way to womens issues, especially in promulgating laws and sometimes in showing an aspiration towards gender equality in their application. Yet there is no lessening of violence against women, sex ratios and literacy rates are alarming, and the woman is cornered in every sphere, in the home and outside it. 																					Liberalization seems to have had a negative effect on the Indian womans situation. Simultaneously, the heightening of communalism has prompted many women to reassert their religious identities, while the issue of rights has become entangled with questions of caste. Almost every equation is in the process of rearranging itself. In this upheaval, ideological positions have to be carefully rethought and reoriented.																					Defining such a moment is a delicate and demanding task, and Rajan does it with clarity and concision. The six chapters that follow the introduction are paired, each taking up an event or phenomenon that can be categorized under Women in custody, Women in law and Killing women. The introduction studies the key terms in the thesis  state, women, citizenship and law  a thought-provoking analysis, of which the section entitled Women is perhaps the most stimulating. The authors own position is carefully located in the mesh of contemporary feminist debates, which in themselves are enormously important in urging intellectual engagement. 																					Starting with Ameenas case and ending with the politics of Phoolan Devis surrender, the volume examines the contentious issues of hysterectomies of the mentally challenged, the questions of female agency, sexuality and work associated with prostitution, the problems raised by the uniform civil code and the peculiarly troubled issue of female infanticide. Rajan takes on the hardest questions, and her discussion brings out the deeply puzzling contradictions inhering in state institutions, in the family and in film and media representations.																					The Scandal of the State is, in the best sense of the phrase, a stylish book. The reasoned meticulousness of proposal, analysis and argument ultimately makes its indictment of the Indian state more relentless and persuasive than strident rhetoric could have done. The wisdom and balance of the authors own conclusions and her commitment to praxis make this a feminist document crucially relevant to the times. In a genre that excels in earnestness, but is often less than inviting, its readability is a particularly prized attribute.						BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

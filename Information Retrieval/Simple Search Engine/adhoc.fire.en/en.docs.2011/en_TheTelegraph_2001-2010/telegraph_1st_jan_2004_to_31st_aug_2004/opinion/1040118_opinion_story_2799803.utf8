		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 							 																						ELSEWHERE TOO...				 	 Heshu Yones: struck down by her father																								It also happens in London. E.M. Forsters favourite theme, the clash of cultures, has now a violent face in the Queens England: honour killing. According to Scotland Yard, there were 12 such killings in the United Kingdom in 2002. The practice is not restricted to Muslims but also prevalent among Sikh and Christian families.																								In 2003, Shafilea Ahmed, a British Asian teenager, disappeared from her Cheshire home. Ahmed had refused to marry a distant Pakistan relative many years older than her. The police believes she may be a victim of honour killing. A year earlier, London-based Kurdish political refugee Abdullah Yones slit his 16-year-old daughter Heshus throat. He feared she was getting Westernised.																								A United Nations document brought out in 2000 estimates that about 5,000 women are slain every year worldwide for acts believed to have brought disgrace and dishonour to their families or communities. Such cases have been recorded in Bangladesh, Britain, Brazil, Egypt, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Turkey and several other countries.																								In Pakistan, honour killings are rising at an alarming rate. Madadgar, a rights group run by the Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid, says that from January to September, 2003, at least 631 women were victims of such killings. Compared to 461 such deaths in 2002, that is a huge jump. And, these are only reported killings.

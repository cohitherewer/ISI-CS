He was the head of the first non-Congress government that lasted its full term. The earlier non-Congress prime ministers were stopgaps, backed by major parties that kept out of the government (V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar, H.D. Deve Gowda, Inder Gujral). Morarji Desai came in with a sizeable majority but squandered it due to his obduracy and Charan Singhs ambition to be prime minister even for a day. That may be the fate of the new Congress government as well.																														The supporting parties might as well do to this government what the Congress under Indira and Sanjay Gandhi did to Charan Singh, Rajiv Gandhi to Chandra Shekhar and Sitaram Kesri to Deve Gowda, by suddenly withdrawing support. We must accept the intellectual incompatibility between the communists and the Congress, the anarchist approaches of the communists and the Samajwadi Party working from outside the government, the absence of development-orientation in the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Also that except the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, most of these supporting parties oppose the Congress in the states they rule.																														The coalition dharma, as it has developed in the last decade, demands that there be an agreed programme that is adhered to, with a mechanism for coordination, and that there are no remote controls. The supporters of the new government did not have a seat adjustment and a programme agreed on before the elections. The big parties are not even participating in the government. Andhra Pradesh exerted undue influence from outside on the Vajpayee government by not participating. The communists may now do this for West Bengal.																														None of these conditions for a successful coalition exists as yet. The unnatural bedmates of 2004 are united only by their present detestation of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Remember that the Congress was Enemy Number One for all of them when it was the dominant party. Misplaced ideology and personal ambitions could bring down this government before its term is over.																														Vajpayees important contribution to political management was to demonstrate how a disparate coalition could be made to work, up to a point. He came into power with some clearly developed ideas: enhance national security by making India into a strong military power, improve relations with the sole world power, the United States of America, peace with Pakistan, settle border disputes with China and others, put national self-interest above moral principle in international affairs and strengthen the economy with necessary reforms. 																														As a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharak, he must have also wanted to assert the dominance of Hindus in a multi-religious society, but coalition dharma ensured that he did not always push this agenda. When he appeared to support Narendra Modi and the Ram temple agitation, it was electorally desirable to do so.																														The biggest blot on his tenure was of course the killings, loot and rape of Muslims in Gujarat. Vajpayees condemnation was belated and weak and as the head of the Central government he took no action. The minorities, particularly Muslims, were made to feel like inferior citizens during this regime. The Supreme Court articulated the national outrage. We must hope that in opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party will not raise its anti-minority rhetoric.																														Vajpayees contribution was to provide continuity with change. He moved more rapidly to implement many of the policies initiated by earlier regimes.																														The nuclear explosions were possible only because Indira Gandhi initiated the work and P.V. Narasimha Rao pursued it. But Vajpayee had the courage to go ahead and face the condemnation of the world and the ensuing economic sanctions. He was helped by the increasing recognition that India was a rising economic power. There is now recognition of Indias importance in Asia and the world. Sanctions have been replaced by much closer cooperation than ever before. He made national self-interest the driver of foreign policy, not pious moral preaching. He refused to be blackmailed into mindless opposition to Israel by the fear of the reaction of Arab governments. There was not even a whimper of protest from them when he initiated and developed relations with Israel. India now has strong support in sophisticated defence equipment and training in anti-terrorist activities from Israel. 																														Indias new cooperation with Myanmar, despite having to deal with its obnoxious generals, now helps in controlling the insurgency in the North-east. The new coalition has members who could push the government into policies that may have been appropriate during the Cold War but are not relevant today.																														India is now wooed by the Association for Southeast Asian Nations, there is a dialogue on an Asian Economic Community, and local groupings have begun as with India, Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, after years of dormancy, seems to have awakened. Narasimha Rao initiated the opening to the East. Vajpayee accelerated it.																														Vajpayees persistence in pursuing peace with Pakistan despite antagonistic responses has been his unique contribution. Whether a Congress-led government, with its articulated fixation on the Shimla agreement, and the sensitivity of the communists to apparent American involvement can conclude this satisfactorily, is uncertain.																														It was Vajpayee (no doubt after the treachery of Kargil) who substantially strengthened the armed might of India. The increasing blue water capability of the Indian navy ties up with the push to make India the regional power. These moves were in the pipeline in earlier years, but his government moved forward on them.																														He pursued the economic reforms agenda of the Congress and other Front governments with greater vigour. The revival of the economy, the huge foreign exchange reserves, the stronger rupee, are all due to the investor-friendly policies that his government introduced. Rajiv Gandhi opened up telecommunications and initiated our IT revolution. But the Vajpayee government made it possible by establishing the enabling environment.																														Vajpayees focus on infrastructure, particularly roads and power, was a key factor in the economic revival. The National Highway Authority of India existed earlier but his government gave it independent funding, enabling it to boost road upgradation and construction. The Electricity Act 2003 was a major step forward and is transforming the power sector. Dismantling the administered price mechanism in petroleum goes with more autonomous oil companies and makes the sector more efficient. The new shipping policy will stimulate that sector. He moved much faster on disinvestment than any previous government. He continued with tax rate restructuring and procedural reforms.																														Vajpayee as prime minister transformed Indian foreign and security policies. Economic strength built by accelerating earlier policies was the key to success. The economy improved because he created the necessary environment of legislation, regulatory institutions and procedural reforms.																														He did not jettison the policies of earlier governments but improved on them. He had no ideological preconceptions that could hold up growth and security. Like the earlier Congress and Front governments, he neglected correction of the decades-long shortfall in agricultural investment. Thus, by also failing to improve employment growth, he lost his mandate. Hopefully, the new coalition will find ways to ensure macroeconomic stability, maintain industrial and services growth while stimulating the rural economy.																														Vajpayee failed in managing the states. Andhra Pradesh got excessive funds from the Centre. Other states did not. Interstate water disputes continue to simmer. The grandiose river linking project will be a non-starter. The Uttar Pradesh-Bihar belt remains a black hole in Indias polity and economy. The south and west of India are far ahead in development. Regional imbalances are a threat to national stability. Vajpayee may have managed many differences in a coalition government but his failures show up the weaknesses even of a coalition with a programme.																														Vajpayees successes were because of his personality, brevity with words, ambiguity, vision, patience and willingness to build on the past instead of throwing out past policies. These are virtues that the new coalition government will need even more from its leadership. It is a more disparate coalition, more subject to differences and hence to dramatic about-turns in policies.																														Vajpayee has proven that non-Congress coalition governments can govern reasonably effectively at the Centre. Now the first Congress-led coalition government has to show that it can do the same. The country must continue to move forward. We must not lose the pride in being Indians  that is Vajpayees most important contribution.

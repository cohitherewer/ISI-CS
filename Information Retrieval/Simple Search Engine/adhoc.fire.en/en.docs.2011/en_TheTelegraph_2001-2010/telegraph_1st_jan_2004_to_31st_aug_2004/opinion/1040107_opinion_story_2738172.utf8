The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 							 																						INDIAS GRAND OBSESSION India must put Pakistan and the problems it creates, pleads Bhaskar Ghose, in a perspective that also reflects some of our more pressing national concerns The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting				 	 Human interest																								Why has Pakistan become so central to all our thinking and discussions? Open a newspaper and something about that country or its leaders or what they say is bound to be somewhere in it  usually on the front page, and on the few occasions it isnt, its in the inner pages somewhere. A baby from Pakistan comes here for an operation  which is wonderful, since the operation was successful  but why was it so important that the baby was Pakistani? Would a baby coming for treatment from Bangladesh or Nepal have been given that kind of hysterical prominence? Our media are the prime culprits, unfortunately, and of them, the television news channels the worst. A boy from Pakistan is being sent back to Pakistan, and batteries of cameras instantly close in around him, recording his every word, while anchors and television journalists, grinning fatuously, make out that the people in both countries want peace, are great friends, share so much and so on and so forth. A sense of balance is something these channels have yet to find.																								That apart, isnt it time we saw Pakistan in some sort of perspective that reflects our problems as a country of almost continental size? True, that country has been trying to undermine the security of Jammu and Kashmir, and terrorists sent from its territory have killed thousands. But we lose more people every year because of disease, accidents, or natural calamities. And terrorists from Pakistan are not the only ones trying to subvert our security. This does not mean that we must forget the problem in Kashmir, or pretend Pakistan doesnt exist. What one is asking for is that we see that the country and the problem it causes in a rational and practical context, that reflects our own immediate concerns.																								Yes, Pakistan has nuclear weapons. So have we. And Id tend to believe the former chief of army staff, S. Padmanabhan, who said in a press conference that if any country were to use nuclear power against India, that country would cease to exist. His words, not mine. But he wouldnt have used them unless he knew just what he was saying. And you can be sure that if he knew it, the establishment in Pakistan knew and knows it only too well. So lets not go on and on about Pakistans nuclear arsenal. Its not the only one around and it would only be used if it took a decision to obliterate itself. 																								There are other factors that can not only damage us but also bring us close to obliteration. HIV/AIDS, for example. Something is being done to control its spread but that something may be too little too late. Its something we need to worry about much more, as we need to worry about our appalling health services. After over fifty years, we may have some fancy specialized hospital facilities available for the rich, but what about the network of primary health centres, of district hospitals? How many of us have been to them, seen the patients lying on the ground in wards that havent been cleaned for months, if ever, with cockroaches running up and down saline drip tubes, and mange-ridden dogs nosing around inside the wards with no one to prevent them from coming in? 																								How many have seen schools in villages and in the poorer parts of our cities run by corporations or local bodies? Many have no buildings; many have buildings without roofs; many have no teachers; many have teachers who dont teach; many have no books, blackboards or even benches on which children can sit. This, after more than half-a-century dedicated to the development of the nation.																								So why, when we have all this to worry about, do we spend hours and hours on what someone in Pakistan said about us, or didnt say? And why do the media obediently carry all this, and what our folks say about it, day after day? SAARC is important in that it brings all its member countries together  and yet its seen as an opportunity for India and Pakistan to talk to each other. The fact is, Pakistan cannot overrun us. Neither can Bangladesh or Nepal. Why then do we give it this pathological importance?																								In part it has to do with the kind of leadership we have. They seem, for the most part, to be north Indian  that part of India which is, now, worse educated; economically in a shambles, except for a few pockets; culturally a desert; but because its spawned more babies through the years, it now has more MPs, and thus more ministers and also senior political leaders who control opinion, among them. And this lot are forever talking of the shared traditions and shared cultures and shared languages of the two countries. What shared cultures, what shared traditions, for goodness sake? Shared with some communities of India certainly; but with others, those who constitute the bulk of India? 																								What traditions does Pakistan share with Orissa, or Karnataka or Maharashtra or Tamil Nadu? Do Pakistanis understand Kannada, Tamil or Oriya? Do they eat curd-rice, or bisi-bele-bhaat? Merely because they speak Punjabi or Urdu and eat kebabs and butter chicken doesnt mean that theyre something special, something to engage the unending attention of our news channels, our newspapers and our government officials. What about Nepal, with which we share so much more? What about Bangladesh? Merely because the Bangladeshis too speak Bangla, and love ilish macher jhol doesnt make them the object of the obsessive attention we give Pakistan.																								But lets not blame only the political leadership or the media. The former cannot help it because their world is inevitably a restricted, narrow one, and Pakistan they can understand  Bangladesh they cannot. The media  well, they reflect what the obsessions of the power centres are, and if its Pakistan, then they reflect that, although they do tend to get carried away by Pakistani boys being handed over to Pakistani authorities and such other human interest stories. The same thing on the Indo-Bangla border would not have the same human interest; and in any case were pushing back Bangladeshis every day. Wheres the news or human interest value in that?																								The real blame must lie with the bureaucracy, or, to be more specific, with some ministries  specifically, the home ministry, the defence ministry and some agencies like RAW and IB. Theyve built up Pakistan over the years as the Big Bogeyman, and the ministers and secretaries in the ministries which matter have been duly frightened by it. Whisper ISI to someone in the home ministry and hell instantly start writing a classified note. And why them? Because they too are manned by people whose focus is narrow; their world consists of India and Pakistan  everything else is ancillary to the Indo-Pak gaze.																								But were starting a new year, and its surely time to break the old moulds and look at what Indias  not Uttar Pradeshs and Punjabs  major concerns are, domestically and internationally. The vision of our leadership and that of the administrative authorities supporting them must match Indias position, and be broad enough to determine where our real interests and concerns lie. It does not lie in exchanging verbal notes and suchlike with Pakistan.																								That country and its antagonism will be with us for many decades to come, like an eczema that never goes away. Its time to forget it and look around us at what really matters and what will be of real help to us. Lets carry a stick, by all means; but lets also speak softly to those others around us, who will respond and may over time become true friends.

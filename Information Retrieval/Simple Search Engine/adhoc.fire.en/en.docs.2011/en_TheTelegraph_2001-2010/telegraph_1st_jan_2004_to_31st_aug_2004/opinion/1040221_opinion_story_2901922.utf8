The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 21, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Shining example				 																																																				Sir  Fleecing others to pay for their comfort is a trait not unique to Indian politicians, but it is an art they alone seem to have perfected (Under attack, Rudy pays bill, Feb 10). No wonder Rajiv Pratap Rudy could spend lakhs on five- star comfort, without sparing a thought for the millions of underprivileged he represents who survive without a square meal a day or a roof over their head. Had it not been for the elections, the department to which Rudy had forwarded the bill would have paid up tamely. Even with the elections, many other departments have, probably, already paid up for their respective ministers. Little wonder India is far from shining.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Navin Singh, Calcutta

				 																How to buy love				 																																																				Sir  While we never tire of glorifying our rich heritage and ancient culture, we never shirk from adopting Western customs quite indiscriminately (Heart attacks, Feb 15). Valentines Day has never been a part of our lives. Yet for the past few years, February 14 has been celebrated by the print media and greeting cards companies with great passion. Impressionable teenagers are the usual victims of these shrewd commercial moves. But they do not realize that what they celebrate as love can hardly be anything other than infatuation. 				 																																																				It is the duty of the elders to guide the younger generation and educate them about Indias culture and traditions. The government should also monitor and censor films and television shows to prevent them from generating misconceptions among the youth.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The media are distorting Indian culture. Soaps based on Western-style love-stories do not suit the Indian environment. Considerable damage is also done by the medias popularizing of events like the Valentines Day. The countrys media should feel itself duty-bound to promote the culture of the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The Shiv Sainiks think they are the only people who care about Indian culture (Love in the air, Sena at your throat, Feb 15). Thankfully, their protests against Valentines Day have not succeeded in depriving couples of their freedom of expression. Such expressions of love are neither obscene nor anti-national, contrary to the Senas belief. Also, the Senas claim that they have moral responsibility to protect Indian culture sounds hollow. Does this mean they can destroy places of worship, organize riots and assault women? It is better if the sainiks desist from interfering in other peoples personal matters.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Ahmed, via email

				 																																																				Sir  The news of Barbies jettisoning of Ken on Valentines Day may have shocked many readers. But this was inevitable (Romance over for Barbie and Ken, Feb 14). Many like me have believed that a meek individual like Ken was no match for an emancipated, career-woman like Barbie. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

				 																Ignorance is curse				 																																																				Sir  The people of India are yet to comprehend the enormity of the AIDS threat (At the receiving end, Feb 2). The Central and state governments should formulate appropriate legislation for the medical fraternity to act without any fear or ambiguity. Sex education must be made mandatory in all educational institutions with special stress on the prevention and control of the disease. Religious leaders need to be involved in the drive to help people understand the impending crisis. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully																															
Asit Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In a country like India where female illiteracy and early marriage for women are endemic to society, the report, AIDS risk for women higher (Feb 3), shows how vulnerable the country is to the spread of AIDS. Even if it cannot remove these evils, the government should try and promote the use of condoms by partners. But with ministers like Uma Bharti and Sushma Swaraj around, that is unlikely to happen.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Halder, Calcutta

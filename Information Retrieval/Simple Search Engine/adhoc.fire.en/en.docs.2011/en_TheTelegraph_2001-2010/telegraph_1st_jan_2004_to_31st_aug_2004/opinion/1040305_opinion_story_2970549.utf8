		 Friday, March 05, 2004 							 																						GOD IS A SIXTH FORM BOY				 	 Too many totsSchotts Original MiscellanyBy Ben Schott, Bloomsbury,  pound; 6.99Sherlock Holmes surprised his friend Dr Watson by announcing that he did not know about the existence of the solar system. Holmes explained that his mind was not an attic to be filled with useless information; he didnt know about the solar system because he had no need to store that kind of information. There are other people, in fiction and in real life, who function on the opposite principle. They remember odd bits of information or they remember whatever they read or hear. The Holmes theory of knowledge is opposed to the magpie mind. This book, carefully put together, will be a delight to those who prefer to make their minds akin to an attic.																														Trivia has its own joys provided one sees it as trivia and one doesnt mix up trivia with genuine knowledge. This is not to suggest that trivia and genuine knowledge are incompatible but they are not by any reckoning the same thing. One could argue that in an age of proliferating information, no information is useless. On the contrary, information is power.																														At one level, the pursuit of trivia is not utility-driven. John Dryden once wrote that there is pleasure sure in being mad which none but mad men know. Similarly, the collection of trivia, drawn from a variety of sources, is an end in itself. The uselessness of the knowledge is the charm of it.																														Who, for example, would like to know that an assembly of larks is correctly described as an exaltation of larks? But this might lead to a pontification of priests and nye of pheasants. One knows that parliament is a place where the elected representatives of the people gather to debate matters of consequence to the nation. But there is also a parliament of rooks and owls.																														Not even regulars at the local or the most astute of bartenders would know that a nip is a quarter of a pint; and that a tot of whisky is one-third of a gill which in turn is one-fourth of a pint. So a gill and a nip are equal but the latter is only used to measure ale.																														Most persons with a reasonable familiarity with English and the English way of life will be aware that Worcester is pronounced Woo-ster, and the famous college in Cambridge, Caius, is pronounced Keeys. But what about Featherstonechaugh? It is simply Fanshaw. Similarly, as this book says, St Clair is Sinclair and St John is Sin-jen.																														This book, because it brings together facts that range from the lengths of shoe laces to suppliers to the queen to how to wear a sari, has an addictive quality to it. It cannot be read in one sitting but no way can it be left unread for a very long period of time. It demands frequent dipping into.																														Trivia is tempting and the only way to get rid of it is to yield to it. The previous sentence is an adaptation of a Wildean paradox, a number of which are listed here.																														This miscellany has a list of famous last words. Of these by far the most memorable is what Dylan Thomas said before he died: Ive had eighteen straight whiskies. I think thats a record. There are many such records in this book. It is impossible to remember everything here but if you forget that god is a sixth form boy in Eton, there is trouble ahead of you.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 07, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Silence is not golden				 																																																				Sir  Its back to square one where Pakistan is concerned. First we decided to throw to the winds all the distinct advances we had made since Shimla by going back to the lingo of the Shimla Agreement. Then we lowered the already humbled position of the prime minister by offering to send the leader of the ruling party to Pakistan at Pervez Musharrafs very asking. Then again we reneged on making cross-border terrorism a pre-condition for talks. And now that the general and his men have decided to test our patience by setting off the Ghauri tests again, we have decided to keep mum (Pakistan tests Ghauri again, India stays cool, June 5). There is no doubt that Pakistan sees the change of government as one golden opportunity to step up its offensive against India, and it is in no mood to let go of it. As for India, there may be no need to go nuclear muscle-flexing. But there should be enough activity at the ground level to prevent our silence from being interpreted as our weakness.Yours faithfully, 
Jyoti Sharma, Calcutta Digging for dirtSir  The curtain having risen over the new Lok Sabha, mudslinging has taken centrestage. But even as the Bharatiya Janata Party accuses the Congress-led government of including criminals in the cabinet, it would do well to give a thought to the skeletons in its own cupboard. During its own government, it fostered the very worst types of criminals. There were the most heinous cruelties on innocent victims without the government raising a finger or uttering a word against the perpetrators. All it did was justify the atrocities as acts of justice. Even now the same perverted logic continues to be paraded without the slightest remorse. I agree with Swapan Dasgupta that Narendra Modi cannot be everyones cup of tea but he seems to have overlooked the fact that the man responsible for the post-Godhra pogrom is the nations cup of strychnine (The luxury of defeat, June 4). His poison has proved to be the Congresss salvation. Yours faithfully, 
Mrinmoy Prasad Goswami, Nagaon 				 																																																				Sir  The Congress is getting ready to attack George Fernandes for Tehelka and the coffin scams in retaliation for the National Democratic Alliances attacks on the present Congress-led government for inducting charge-sheeted persons in the cabinet. Even if Fernandes is clean, the two scandals happened during his tenure and he must reveal to parliament those responsible. Fernandes says that the entire Tehelka expose was vague and fictitious  which is clearly not believable  and he has not been able to explain the intelligence failure that led to the Kargil war. These are only two instances of Fernandess mismanagement of the defence ministry  there must be many more that have yet to come to light.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Politicians seem motivated more by the desire for political vendetta than by national interest and the welfare of the people. Of late, the NDA has taken exception to the induction in the ministry of persons against whom there are court cases pending. It is not difficult to take a man to court, but it is the final pronouncement by the judges that will decide whether he is guilty or innocent. If that is not true, the NDA should have demanded the resignation of the president and the chief justice of India when non-bailable warrants were issued against them recently, J.Jayalalithaa should have been sacked as there was a court case against her, L.K. Advani should have quit since he is an accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, and so on. But the NDA leaders spared them. Now that they have swapped seats with the opposition in parliament, they are breaking out in righteous indignation.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rhiju Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The NDAs demands for the removal of tainted ministers from the cabinet might be a boon in disguise for Laloo Prasad Yadav who has considerable experience and expertise in usurping power through the back door (George wont return boycott compliment, June 2). Look at the way he has been running Bihar for years through his wife. At best he could resign from the ministry and install one of his lieutenants  a move that will give him more time to work for the assembly elections next year. In the meantime, parliament will have wasted precious time on unproductive debates.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																Toll duty				 																																																				Sir  Sixty is the retirement age for most salaried people, whereas one has to be 65 to benefit from income tax concessions for senior citizens. I fail to understand this time lag. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Adhir Kumar Bose, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The income tax department is supposed to refund the excess taxes deposited by taxpayers. But is there any authority to make sure that this is done on time?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The income tax department has done well to introduce new tax-deposit forms in just three categories instead of the earlier seven. Moreover only a single copy of the new form needs to be filled now. But the entire tax deducted at source procedure should be simplified by having only one form for returns, tax-deposits, tax-deductions and so on. Also there must be a common rate of say 10 per cent for deduction of tax under different heads. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba

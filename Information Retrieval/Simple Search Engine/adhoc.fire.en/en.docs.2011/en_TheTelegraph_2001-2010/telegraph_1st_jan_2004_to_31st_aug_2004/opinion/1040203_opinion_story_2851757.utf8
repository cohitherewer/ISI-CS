The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 							 																						THE DOVES...																														When in the early years of the Republic, Muslim personal law was kept out of the purview of a uniform civil code, there was the implicit hope that Muslim society would internally reform itself and bring itself in line with the forces of progress and modernity. There have been occasions in the last fifty years or so when that hope has seemed to be too far-fetched. The process of reform has been tantalizingly slow. This has resurrected the old debate about state-driven reforms and reforms from within. In a situation in which Hindu majoritarianism has acquired a new stridency, the tardiness of reforms within Muslim society has only created conditions for more tension and hostility. Under the circumstances, the fatwa prohibiting the slaughter of cows in states where it is banned can only be welcomed. The fatwa came on the eve of Bakri Id from Darul Uloom of Deoband, one of the most influential organizations in India. Most pertinently, the fatwa noted that the law of the land should not be violated. This statement and the fatwa itself are significant for more reasons than one. There is a clear thrust that even Muslim theologians from Deoband are not unwilling to move away from too restricted a definition of the shariat to the law of the land even when the two are in apparent conflict. A very important section of Muslim society, it would appear, has put the preservation of peace and communal harmony above religious fundamentalism.																														This gesture has a splendid lineage. During the Khilafat Movement  the golden years of Hindu-Muslim amity  the Muslims voluntarily stopped cow slaughter in large parts of the country and the Hindus in their turn stopped music before mosques. This time round Muslim society has made a gesture not under the pressure of a political movement dependent on Hindu-Muslim unity. On the contrary, the present fatwa grows out of considerations internal to the Muslim community. Rituals and customs in a multi-cultural and multi-religious society have to be conducted in a manner designed not to offend believers of a different faith. Here reciprocity rather than competition is of the essence. The Muslim society has made the first gesture and it has chosen an issue which is particularly close to the heart of the Hindus. This is a sign that Muslim society is changing from within. The least that the Hindus can do is to respect and appreciate this tendency. One sure way of doing this is to remove the anti-Muslim sentiments which are the stocks-in-trade of the rhetoric of the sangh parivar. Reform from within is a slogan that the Hindus can also adopt.

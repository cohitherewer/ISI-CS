The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 26, 2004 							 																						KEEP TALKING																														The meeting between leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference and the deputy prime minister, Mr L.K. Advani, is likely to provide fresh momentum to the peace process in Jammu and Kashmir. Although it would be nave to believe that a breakthrough is on the anvil, the meeting could be an important step in promoting a real dialogue that could eventually lead to a resolution of the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir. There are several reasons that add to the significance of the meeting. Most important, this was the first official coming together of separatist leaders from Jammu and Kashmir and the top political leadership of the country. 																														Although the leaders of the Hurriyat have, in the past, met unofficial emissaries from New Delhi, they have been unwilling to hold talks with the centres designated interlocutors, including the deputy chairman of the planning commission, Mr K.C. Pant, and the former Union home secretary, Mr N.N. Vohra. On this occasion, they held parleys with Mr Advani and his aides, and subsequently called on the prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. What is equally heartening is that there was a joint statement issued after the meeting. Not only did both sides agree to find an honourable and durable solution to the Kashmir problem through dialogue, but they also hoped that all forms of violence at all levels would end. The Centre and the Hurriyat also agreed to adopt a step-by-step approach that would lead to the resolution of all outstanding issues relating to Jammu and Kashmir. This agreement to end violence and continue negotiations will be widely welcomed in Kashmir. Indeed, Mr Advani and the Hurriyat leaders have agreed to meet again in March. In the interim, a series of confidence-building measures will help to create a more conducive climate for the dialogue. The Centre seems to have promised to consider releasing Kashmiri political prisoners, who have been jailed without trial for several years, and the Hurriyat has apparently recognized the need to reach out to the Kashmiri Pandits, living in camps outside the valley, and facilitate their return to Kashmir. 																														While a good beginning has been made, it is important to recognize that there will continue to be hurdles in the way of a meaningful dialogue. The Hurriyat today, especially the moderate leaders who met Mr Advani, has little control over the terrorist groups who operate in the valley. It is unlikely, therefore, that these groups will respond to a call by the Hurriyat to stop perpetuating violence. There are also important separatist leaders, outside the Hurriyat, who were not part of the meeting. It is possible that these leaders may seek to project the dialogue as a sell-out by the Hurriyat leaders. It is also unclear what attitude Pakistan will adopt to the dialogue. Be that as it may, it is important that the dialogue be sustained until it is possible to arrive at a real modus vivendi.

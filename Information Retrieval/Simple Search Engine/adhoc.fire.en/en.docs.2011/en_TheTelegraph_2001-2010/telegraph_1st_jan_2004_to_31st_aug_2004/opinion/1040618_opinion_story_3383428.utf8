		 Friday, June 18, 2004 							 																						NOT A DROP																														The logic of rivers runs exactly contrary to the logic of divisions of land into states or countries. That the sharing of waters of the same river by neighbouring states is a ticklish issue is pointed up by the fact that under the Indian Constitution, water is on both the state and the Union lists. Article 262 of the Constitution says that parliament may by law provide for the adjudication of any dispute regarding the use, distribution and control of the waters of riverine states. There have been a series of mechanisms put in place to solve inter-state water disputes, beginning from the Inter-State Water Disputes Act in 1956. There have been successful settlements too, unlike the on-again-off-again conflict between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu simmering since the late 19th century. 																														The long history of the present dispute is an indication of the interests that become linked with conflicts over water. The upper riparian state has an advantage over the lower riparian states, and the conflict-resolution mechanisms are aimed at equalizing opportunities among neighbours. The earliest, and still the chief, contenders over the Cauvery waters are Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, although Kerala and Pondicherry are the new parties. Karnataka, the upper riparian, entered the field of irrigated agriculture later than Tamil Nadu, which has an established tradition of farming in the Cauvery basin. But Karnataka feels its rights should not be curtailed for that reason, while Tamil Nadu, especially in times of drought, has felt betrayed by its neighbours stinginess. A spate of intense disagreements prompted the interim order of the Cauvery waters tribunal in 1991. But that aggravated tensions between the Tamils and the Kannadigas. Ethnicity was thus added to the already existing political tension among the states and the Centre. This time too, Congress-led Karnatakas decision to await the decision of the prime minister has led to sharp disappointment in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which is a Congress ally at the Centre. Punjabs refusal to acknowledge the right of Haryana to waters from the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal has a similar confused history, although from the Seventies. This conflict is another combination of inter-state chauvinism and political one-upmanship. The immediate sufferers are inevitably the farmers. For them, adjudication is too uncertain a process. Alternative resolutions, such as water harvesting, change in cropping pattern, conjunct uses of ground and surface water sources must be evolved more systematically. Depending on the monsoons and the persuasive qualities of adjudicating authorities is unlikely to solve problems.

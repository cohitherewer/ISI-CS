The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Letter from Rome				 																																																				Sir  The Vaticans memo to bishops in the United States of America not to give Communion to John Kerry and politicians who support abortion, taps into the emotive debate regarding abortion in that country (Vatican blacklists Kerry, July 12). The life or choice controversy is really a non-issue that has been allowed to take centre stage. And it is by exploiting the religious fervour the abortion issue arouses among the conservative sections of American society that George W. Bush has been able to extend his appeal among American voters  with disastrous results for the rest of the world. But strangely enough, the pope prefers Bush to Kerry, although only a few days ago he was issuing statements against the abuse of prisoners in Iraq. Do the claims of unborn babies take precedence over the large-scale loss of human lives taking place in Iraq as a result of the US invasion, for which Bush and only Bush is responsible? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ranjan Sharma, Calcutta
				 																What have we got?				 																																																				Sir  Who would have thought that the person who presented the dream budget of 1997 would come up with a nightmare of a budget in 2004 (Dream budget man chases new dream, July 9)? Pumping Rs 16,000 crore into public sector undertakings at a time governments all over the world are shying away from running businesses is a retrograde step. There is also a 20 per cent increase in defence expenditure, which brings into question the sincerity of Indias peace overtures to Pakistan. Then the largesse for Bihar  the administration of the state is infamous for its incompetence and high level of corruption  which is likely to line the pockets of the ruling politicians. (If backwardness was indeed the criterion, why was Madhya Pradesh deprived?) The proposed gradual removal of incremental slabs of income tax has produced an absurd situation where an income of Rs 99,900 is tax-free, while that of Rs 100,001 attracts a tax of Rs 9,180. 				 																																																				As for the thrust on village uplift, Rajiv Gandhi had revealed long back the truth about it, saying that barely one paisa out of five reached the target. Although it has been some time since then, it is still only the rich farmers who reap the benefits. What is outrageous is that a consortium of banks has been asked to provide Rs 40,000 crore for rural development. This reminds me of the loan-melas and loan-waiver schemes of the Seventies which became the prime cause of the large non-performing assets of banks. The banks were just beginning to recover, and Chidambaram has sent them back to the dark days again. 				 																																																				His silence on rural connectivity and the national highway projects was stranger still. By acknowledging the good deeds of the last government, Chidambaram would only have boosted the image of his own.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Unlike Laloo Prasad Yadav, P. Chidambaram has avoided falling into the populism trap, despite the tremendous pressures of coalition politics. The expected rise in rural incomes as a result of Chidambarams policy announcements will lead to an increase in rural purchasing power. This will certainly give a much-needed boost to the manufacturing sector. The only grey area is the poor implementation record of state governments and government agencies entrusted with disbursing funds and implementing programmes. 				 																																																				Total tax relief on long-term capital gains, a long-standing demand of the industry, has been met. But will this encourage more people to invest in the stock market? With people like Ketan Parekh around, investors cannot be blamed for steering clear of the stock markets. To get people to invest in the stock markets, tax relief is not as important as the need to make it more accountable and transparent. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raja Sen, Dhanbad

				 																																																				Sir  The budget for 2004-05 is designed to meet the political ends of the ruling United Progressive Alliance. Whether it will help the Indian economy is the question. P. Chidambaram has desperately tried to prove that the Congress-led UPA government is different from that of the National Democratic Alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party. But wasnt the NDA following, in principle, the path of economic reforms shown by the Congress? In his effort to underline the difference, Chidambaram runs the risk of contradicting some of his own partys policies. The Congress had criticized the NDA on the grounds that the fruits of its economic development did not reach the poor. How will Chidambaram ensure that his governments does?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tirthankar Bandyopadhyay, Hounslow, UK

				 																																																				Sir  The two per cent education cess imposed on taxable income for providing basic education was not required at all. Many earlier schemes like the Primary District Education Programme have not been implemented seriously and the amount allotted them left unutilized. The finance minister should have pondered over the fate of these earlier schemes before levying the cess on honest taxpayers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

				 																																																				Sir  It is understandable that the finance minister needs to bring more services into the tax net. But before imposing the service tax on goods booking agents (transporters), he should have sat down with representatives of the transporters. Transport is an essential service, and any large increase in transportation cost will lead to inflation. 				 																																																				But whose duty is it to collect the tax? The service providers or the users? If it is the service providers onus, then does he have to deposit the tax even if his payments have not been realized? In this trade, the payment cycle varies from a month to 6 months, in some cases even longer. If transporters have to deposit service tax every month, their cash flows would be affected. Which means they have to bring in more funds, a tough ask for a sector going through difficult times. They will be badly hit if their debts go bad, because post-budget, their debt would comprise service charges and the tax component. The imposition of service tax on transporters therefore needs a rethinking.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sanjay Jain, Calcutta

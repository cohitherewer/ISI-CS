The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 27, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Playing innocent				 																																																				Sir  So its curtains for the dope scandal. The coaches have got the boot, the sportspersons accused of doping proven to be pictures of innocence and the efficiency of the sports ministry under Sunil Dutt established beyond dispute (Dutt dope hammer crushes coaches, Aug 25). But will the summary removal of the coaches be enough to prevent the recurrence of doping scandals? Unlikely, because sportspersons in India will continue to depend on chemicals to give them an edge over other mediocre people struggling to get whatever little that sports in this country has to offer them. Why then do we believe our sportspersons to be innocent? Do we suppose that their lack of education and awareness makes them preys to the machinations of evil coaches? Isnt the open abuse of drugs in regional and national games by sportspersons themselves enough evidence of their culpability?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Unquiet hills				 																																																				Sir  Of late, many reports have appeared alleging that the Assam Rifles personnel are avoiding appearing before the commission of inquiry in Manipur as they fear venturing beyond Kangla Fort. This is a gross misrepresentation of facts. Despite immunity provided to security forces personnel against appearing before an inquiry commission ordered by a state government, the army has willingly agreed to participate in the Manipur inquiry. What the media forget in their overzealous enthusiasm to condemn the Assam Rifles, even before the inquiry has concluded, is that these men too are local residents and have family members, wives, children and other dependents who can be easily targeted by the militants while going to the market, school or whilst on leave. The army has requested that the inquiry proceedings be held in camera to ensure that the individuals and their families are not targeted by militants. The army is committed to cooperate with the inquiry commission. However, the safety of the personnel and their families must be ensured.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.N. Mukerjee, chief public relations officer, ministry of defence, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In Indefinitely in force (Aug 19), V.R. Raghavan ignores the ground realities. The armys continued presence in the North-east may reflect the failure of governance in the states, but one has to remember that the Centre is equally to blame. Which is why the army continues to stay put and abuse its powers. What Raghavan and policymakers need to know is that Manipuri extremism cannot be equated with militancy. Yours faithfully, 
Kongkham Biplob Singha, Imphal Sir  The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act was passed in 1958 for the security of the army deployed in the early Fifties in the Naga Hills district of Assam, and subsequently extended to Manipur and Nagaland. If the act is still in use it is because the situation persists even now. Manipuris now want the removal of the AFSPA. But can they ensure that this will give them peace and free them from the threat of militants? Will it ensure that militants, for whom militancy has become an industry, will join the mainstream? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramesh Bakshi, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir The army is trained to use force to deal with any situation. Hence, you cannot tie down the army with the laws that bind the police force. Either let the army stay in Manipur with the AFSPA or withdraw the army together with the AFSPA. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Leena Sharma, Siliguri

				 																																																				Sir  It would be a mistake to consider the movement in Manipur anti-national. Had the people not taken to the streets, would they have been heard? The security personnel feel that the people should have shown the same aggression against militants. But if people had the courage, would they still need the security forces? Have the majority of Indians been able to rise against gangsters and jihadis? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pr. Shyleyn Chothe, Imphal

				 																																																				Sir  I wonder where the protest in Manipur will lead to. Under no circumstance will the Centre remove the AFSPA. A political dialogue will never happen in Manipur as the insurgents have already indicated that they will never negotiate. The only ones who will continue to be affected are the people themselves. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Romen Singh, Imphal

				 																																																				Sir  In the name of sovereignty, many innocent lives have been lost and people have had to suffer untold miseries for years. A terrorist is a terrorist and should be dealt with the same way as criminals. How can the government expect these ruthless, cold-blooded murderers to talk peace? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Yaisana Luwang, Imphal

				 																																																				Sir  Although Manipuri insurgents do constitute a grave threat to the human rights of people, the army is a bigger menace for the common people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Robin S. Ngangom, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir  If a rapist can be given death penalty in a civilian court, why not army men who rape? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Chongtham Boba Singh, Chennai

		 Saturday, January 17, 2004  ARM CANDY MAN
 From a whipping boy for right-wing  groups to a wannabe toyboy for poster-girl Padma Lakshmi,  writer Salman Rushdie has come full circle  Exit, Salman Rushdie, the author.  Enter, Salman Rushdie, the boyfriend. When the famous   and in some quarters, greatly infamous  writer visited  India last week, he clearly didnt do so as an award-winning  wordsmith. He came to India accompanying Padma Lakshmi,  his girlfriend. Rushdie played the perfect, doting  boyfriend on his holiday. He visited his companions home-town,  Chennai, made best friends with her grandfather and feasted  on tayeer saadam like a veteran southerner. In Mumbai,  Rushdie took his girlfriend on a guided Salman tour. Rushdie also doubled up as the  official Padma Lakshmi spokesperson. When the Manhattan-based  Boom heroine was quizzed about her disastrous debut  film, Rushdie went hammer and tongs at director Kaizad Gustad.  He called Gustad a difficult director who treated his crew  badly. In Rushdies words, he was in India this month in  the capacity of a side-kick boyfriend. He insisted on  calling himself the insignificant bearded man accompanying  the leggy model-turned-actress. A wry sense of humour is a typical  Rushdie trait. The Indian-born author was visiting home-town  Mumbai  his abiding muse  after a 16-year-long exile.  In an interview to a television channel, he said he loved  the smell of home. Rushdie looked every bit an international  30-something models arm candy, in his black and navy suits.  But pushing 60, age showed in his increasing paunch and  receding hair-line. Post-Padma, curd-rice isnt the  only new thing in Rushdies life. The author plans to give  Bollywood a go. He is reportedly scripting a film from his  short story, The Firebirds Nest. Padma Lakshmi will  play the female lead. But, of course. The story revolves  around a young woman of Indian origin in New York who meets  an older man. But, of course. The one thing that the Rushdie-Padma  sojourn succeeded in doing was scotch rumours of a strained  relationship. Last year, there had been media speculations  galore that Rushdie found Padma too bird-brained and she  thought him too boring. This year, Padma is talking about  marriage. Obviously, the mutual admiration still runs thick.  Padma has been quoted as saying of Rushdie, To Indian people,  hes as large as Faulkner or Hemingway. When I think about  that, I wonder when hes going to figure out that Im just  a silly girl. Rushdie, in turn, has no qualms playing poster-girl  Padmas smitten lover. In India, Rushdie didnt remain  the prosaic bearded man for long. Mumbai-based right-wing  Muslim groups got wind of him and wanted the The Satanic  Verses author out of the country. A protest rally was  held where an award to blacken his face was announced. The author made a hasty back-door  exit from his hotel and took the next flight out of India.  Salman Rushdie knows what it is like to be on the run. He  spent nine underground years after the Iranian spiritual  leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against  him, in 1989, and called on all zealous Muslims to execute  the author. Rushdie terms his time in hiding,  the plague years. In a recent book, Step Across the  Line  which is an effort to put the fatwa behind  him  he writes about the bodyguards, secret residences,  bulletproof mattresses and the painfully slow international  wrangling that set him free. I missed my ordinary life,  he said. The ban and fatwa made The Satanic Verses  the most widely unread best-seller. And Rushdie became more  than a writer. To some, he became a symbol of an individuals  right to expression. To others, he was merely the Wests  poster boy on Islamic fundamentalism. Rushdie once said in an interview  that the story of his life would read like, a bad Salman  Rushdie novel. Its like an Indian movie, very over-blown,  he said.  The author came from a wealthy,  Mumbai-based business family. As a child, Rushdie spent  his time in the world of the flying carpets of his favourite  book, Arabian Nights. At the age of 14, he left for  England, to study at Rugby School. He had always idealised  English society. So it came as a shock to discover that  he was considered an outsider  a wog  at school. After  graduating, Rushdie went to Pakistan, where his family had  moved. But this no longer was home to him. He was a displaced  person and though he hated Rugby, he decided to go to Cambridge.  Rushdie describes his return to England in 1965 as one  of the most disorienting moments of my life. Rushdies first novel, Grimus,  was published in 1976. The science fiction, based loosely  on a Sufi poem, received poor reviews. It was only after  a decade of working as a copy writer that Rushdie got his  breakthrough. Midnights Children won  Rushdie the Booker, the Booker of Bookers and catapulted  him to fame. The book is an unflattering satire on modern  India, with former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as its main  target. Gandhi sued and won a case demanding a revised version  of the novel. She was assassinated soon after and the revised  book was never published. But the reviews havent always  been glowing. Rushdie has been mocked for his cross-cultural  writing. Hes been described as a disaffected intellectual  who makes fun of everything. His unprovoked tirade against  authors writing in Indian languages was one Rushdie-ism  that few can forget. Rushdies toodling away on a  new book these days. He says it has a lot of India in it.  But Padma Lakshmi says the book is all about her. So whos  right? Same difference, as Padma Lakshmi would say.

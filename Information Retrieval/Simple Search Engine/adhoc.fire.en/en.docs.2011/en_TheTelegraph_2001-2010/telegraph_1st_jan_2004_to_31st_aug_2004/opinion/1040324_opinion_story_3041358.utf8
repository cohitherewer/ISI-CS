The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Husband vs wife				 																																																				Sir  One would have expected Sonia Gandhi to be more sensitive to Hema Gamangs plight  both being wives forced by circumstances to enter politics (Cong list mollifies Gamang, March 21). Only in Hemas case, it was her husbands selfish wish to retain control over his parliamentary constituency after he was made chief minister of Orissa in 1999 that was responsible for her entering Parliament. With Giridhar Gamang now out of job, it is perhaps reasonable that he should be given the Congress ticket in Koraput. Hema may even be thankful that her husband didnt ask her to vacate her seat as soon as he lost his chief ministership. Such brazen chauvinism would have been quite characteristic of the man who threatened to divorce his wife of 29 years because she was given the Koraput ticket instead of him. But for Sonia Gandhi, who has now reversed her earlier decision to give the Congress ticket to Hema, there is obviously no room for female solidarity in politics. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Ramani Dutta, Bhuwaneswar
				 																A domestic tragedy				 																																																				Sir  I was more saddened than shocked by the report, Self-sacrifice at altar of unemployment (March 19). Who do we blame for the suicides of Kaushik and Vaishali Chatterjee? While it is not easy to point to any one culprit, the constant nagging by Kaushiks parents was definitely a trigger. When youngsters most need the support of parents, they do not get it. In reality, parental love is becoming more and more conditional. No wonder many youngsters get into the wrong company and pick up all kinds of bad habits and, when driven too far, even resort to desperate measures like Kaushik. When will this attitude towards youngsters change? How many Kaushiks will it take for society to learn that every individual is different from the other? A parent must try to be a friend more than a guide who is always telling his children that all they do is wrong.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is a shame that a state government, in power for more than two decades, could not provide a job to a deserving candidate like Kaushik Chatterjee. The extent of depression that led him to take such a drastic step can only be imagined. People who think the couple should not have attempted suicide have no understanding of what it is to be faced with a bleak, jobless future. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Albert Ashok, Calcutta

				 																Ad nauseum 				 																																																				Sir  I do not agree with the editorial, Give a break (March 11), that the minimum advertisement time on a television channel should be left to the market to decide. In a democracy like India, everything cannot be left to the market. If that were to happen, telecom companies would not be offering customers the facilities that they now do under the watchful eyes of the Telecom Regulatory Authority Of India. 				 																																																				Frequent ad-breaks can be very irritating  you are watching a cricket match but you dont get to see Sachin Tendulkar hitting a six because of an ad running at the time; or you cant concentrate on a popular serial because of ads coming in every five minutes. You may change the channel and watch another programme or turn off the set. It is this dilemma that the channels exploit. Viewers, especially of pay channels, have to pay the broadcaster and have every right to ensure that they arent take advantage of. They can only turn to the government to do this. Moreover, an advertiser spends not on the programme or channel but on the viewer  the consumer. Just as we have consumer forums, there is need also for a regulator like TRAI to safeguard the interest of viewers. The alternative is to be at the mercy of the channels and see whatever they dish out. 				 																																																				Your faithfully,				 																																																				Prasanta Dangoria, Chabua, Assam				 																																																				Sir  Ideally, the government or the TRAI should not regulate advertising time in a liberalized economy. But television channels are in an extremely competitive business and hence there is need to ensure that the viewer is not short-changed when he is charged a composite rate for a bouquet of channels and not just the particular programme or channel that he is interested in. By no stretch of the imagination can such tactics be justified and the state must intervene so that viewers are not charged for programmes they do not view. Again in a liberal economy, why cannot there be more than one cable TV operator in an area and the choice of operator left to the viewer? Until such issues are thrashed out in the interest of consumers, some authority needs to intervene to check the monopolistic tactics of channels and service providers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.M. Chowdhury, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is not for TRAI to specify the advertising time on channels. As most channels will eventually turn pay, it is upto the consumers to choose which one to buy. If a channel earns more by showing more advertisements owing to the popularity of its programmes, it should be free to do so. Is this the governments way of promoting free-to-air channels like Doordarshan and others? The latter can well try to attract viewers in a more creative manner, by improving standards.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aparajita Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Doordarshan must be congratulated for stealing a march over Ten Sports and getting the rights to telecast the cricket series between India and Pakistan. The hoi polloi who could manage a TV only but no cable connection and bothered little about respect for international trade pacts must be happy at the Supreme Courts interim directive. The government too is on Cloud Nine for being able to render such a great service to the cable-less common man, who also constitutes a major chunk of the voters, for whom cricket on the TV screen is more than a square meal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 							 																						MANY LAYERS OF REASON 															- Document  Excerpts from Abortion in India: overview and synthesis of emerging issues from the qualitative studies by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 A little bias																														On medical advice: The studies by Barua, Radkar and Prakasamma indicated that abortions were resorted to for medical reasons such as when a womans life is threatened or when there is a fear of malformation of the foetus. However, an interesting divergence in the reasons cited by women and by abortion service providers was noted in a study by Barua. While the providers indicated that they conduct abortions for medical reasons such as poor health of mother, an ill-formed foetus was only rarely the reason for an abortion, a fair number of women who were interviewed in the study indicated that they resorted to abortion on medical advice. 																														It is a moot point whether the terminology used by women is a euphemism for sex selective abortion. This could also be a way of rationalizing the abortion related decision-making and shift- ing the onus on to the practitioner.																														Abortion among single, divorced or separated women: None of the studies directly inquired about why or when women outside marriage resort to abortion or whether having a child outside wedlock is an option even for some women. At the same time, in several of the studies, this issue came up and the married women expressed their opinions on the need for abortion by women not in marriage. Three of the studies in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh indicated that if a woman outside marriage became pregnant, then in order to preserve family honour, she must abort the foetus. In the Maharashtra study, during group discussions, some of the women further opined that since such a pregnancy was a result of immoral behaviour of the woman or was an act of sin, it has to be aborted. 																														However, some of the respondents were sympathetic towards the women and conceded that pregnancy can result due to rape or violence or caused by someone known to the women. When such a mistake occurs, abortion must be performed secretly and the mistake must be rectified in order to preserve the family honour. Overall, abortions outside the framework of marriage were characterized by secrecy, shame and stigma...																														Emerging challenges and advocacy: As highlighted before, findings and leads from small and disparate micro studies cannot be generalized to represent the situation in the country as a whole. Their findings always need to be interpreted with caution and in context. Nevertheless, these qualitative studies undertaken to look into abortion issues...have thrown up some common patterns and themes: 																														The links between the unmet need for contraception and abortion: While across studies women wanted to limit family size or space births, abortion often seemed to be a preferred alternative to the perceived side-effects and the difficulties of obtaining and using temporary spacing methods...																														Son preference: Averting the birth of a female child or ensuring the birth of a male one, often under pressure from the conjugal and extended families was reported as one of the reasons for abortion in most settings. While the use of modern sex detection tests was more common in the western and northern parts of the country, studies from the southern part of the country highlighted that women and communities use more traditional methods of predicting sex of the foetus but with the same objective of averting female births.

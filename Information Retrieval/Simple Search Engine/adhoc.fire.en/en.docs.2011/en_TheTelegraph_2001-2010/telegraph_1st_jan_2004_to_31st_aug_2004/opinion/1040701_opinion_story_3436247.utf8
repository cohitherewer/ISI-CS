The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 							 																						WITHOUT COVERS 																														Lifting a veil is always risky business. It might uncover conflicts too complicated to smooth over with a homogeneous notion of rights. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that banning Muslim headscarves in state schools does not violate the freedom of religion and can counter Islamic fundamentalism. The ruling was made on the case of a Turkish student, who was barred from attending Istanbul University medical school for wearing a headscarf. There is irony in the fact that Turkey, an Islamic state exceptional for its progressive measures and now waiting to enter the European Union, and France, a secular state with the biggest Muslim population in Europe, have both found in the hijab a symbol of religious dogmatism. It might be asked whether secularism means the tolerance of other religions and their personal signs, such as the hijab  and logically, the wedding ring  or the ruthless erasure of all overt signs of religion in the educational arena. Frances decision to ban Muslim headscarves, Jewish skullcaps, outsize crosses and other signs of religious affiliation in state schools had already opened up a fierce debate. There is a real fear that the Western hostility towards Islam, and on a different scale, anti-Semitism, were being given official status. The secular wisdom, which says that banning the hijab is a valid way to counter fundamentalism, seems to be ignoring the destructive power of the siege mentality. Intervention of this kind may be the best way to consolidate fundamentalist forces.																														Various rights have been repeatedly defined. It is time to define the word human that precedes rights, to ask what human being is pictured behind this apparently universal notion. All talk of skullcaps and crosses has faded with the hijab in the limelight. The conflict of secularism and religion is being played out on the attire of women, and on their freedom of choice  whether of headscarf or identity. The debate over the headscarf as a sign of gender-oppression is a different issue from that of the headscarf as an overt sign of religion. To collapse the two in the name of secularism and human rights in order to establish the case for pervading Islamic radicalism is to ignore the deep divisions within Islamic society over religious law and gender rights. It is to make things more difficult for those within the community fighting against religious extremism, its opponents and victims. As a secular move, the banning of the hijab is self-defeating. As a move for human rights, it is absurd, for it is using women as fodder. As a step towards the integration of minorities, it is seriously suspect.

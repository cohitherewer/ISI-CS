The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 							 																						ANOTHER COUNTRY																														Anything is possible when talks take the place of arms. If the rebels in Assam agree to talk, that itself could be a big leap forward. The Union minister of state for defence, Mr Bijoy Krishna Handique, rightly suggested this when he indicated that the Centre was not averse to holding talks with the United Liberation Front of Asom abroad. Sceptics might argue that this was not the first time New Delhi offered to hold talks with the ULFA in a third country. But several rounds of talks with Naga rebels in Geneva and Bangkok should suggest that the Centres offer to the ULFA was genuine. There is no reason why the Centre cannot do with the ULFA what it has been doing for several years now with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah. Obviously, New Delhi has moved away from an earlier position that such dialogues on foreign soil meant a dilution of the idea of national sovereignty. The point is whether the peace initiative reflects a genuine change of heart. It is for the ULFA leadership to prove that it really wants to begin a dialogue with New Delhi. Once that credential is established, it may not be all that difficult to resolve differences, some of which may well be over semantics. 																														One such difference, apparently insurmountable, is over the question of the ULFAs demand for sovereignty. It is worthwhile to recall that the talks with the NSCN had long stumbled on this very question. Even now, while the talks have continued, the NSCN and New Delhi had different perceptions of how the issue could be resolved. The differences notwithstanding, it has been possible, though, to stick to the ceasefire and create the right conditions for the talks. This could hopefully serve as a model for a dialogue with the ULFA as well. The ULFA leadership has so far belied the Assamese peoples hope for peace by not responding to the governments peace offers. Mr Handiques suggestion has once again revived that hope. It is true that the ULFA has suffered major setbacks in the wake of the Bhutanese armys operations against its training camps and shelters inside Bhutan last year. It was no secret that the Bhutanese offensive had been backed by the Indian army. In the North-east, rebel groups have sometimes pretended to respond to peace offers as a strategic ploy in times of adversity. They have used the truce to regroup and re-arm themselves. The ULFA leaders must prove that their response is no such deceptive move. A genuine belief in peace is the first prerequisite of a meaningful dialogue. It is for the ULFA to win the governments trust.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 19, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A dark agenda				 																																																				Sir  The case of Iraq exposes best the minds of the Western democracies, especially the United States of America and the United Kingdom. In the name of the liberation of Kuwait, the US militarized the Persian Gulf area. After Iraq withdrew, the US and UK used the United Nations to maim it in economic and military terms. They even established no-fly-zones around Iraq without a UN mandate. They have regularly bombed Iraq even before the current invasion in violation of UN rules. They also chose to ignore the voice of the majority of their own people against invasion. After invading, they denied the UN any major role, but now want it to work on their agenda. They have violated the UN conventions of St Petersburg, Hague and Geneva by killing and terrorizing Iraqi civilians. It is easy to see through their ploy of installing a democracy through their hand-picked Iraqis. Their past and present actions betray their plan of never letting Iraq become a sovereign nation.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Roquaiya Shaheen, New Delhi
				 																Party first				 																																																				Sir  Here are some of the mistakes in the Congress campaign. First, no Congress leader has tried so far to explain to the electorate that the economic growth rate was higher during P.V. Narasimha Raos regime. Second, the party has been letting the Bharatiya Janata Party take all the credit for new telephone and cooking gas connections, when in truth, these are the outcome of the policy of the previous Congress governments. The Congresss election strategists have committed another mistake by letting a clash of ideologies (Hindutva versus Nehruvian socialism) develop into a contest between personalities. Surely the Congresswallahs do not harbour such illusions as the popularity of the party president being higher than Vajpayees. 				 																																																				Even L.K. Advani, one of the leaders of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement, has been going around the country, proclaiming the BJP to be a secular party. The Congress has not been vocal enough against Advani, nor has it tried to explain that secular is not anti-Hindu. The party should also try to make full use of the visibility of the Gandhi children, Rahul and Priyanka, by making them carry the vision of the party to the masses. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Bhaskar Ghoses article, The endless line (April 14), reminds us of how the Congress is increasingly behaving like a fusty dowager desperately trying to match up to the BJP in terms of tactics. Dependence on the family of Indira Gandhi has robbed the once-respected organization of effective leadership from outside the family, which has several luminaries from all professions in its ranks.				 																																																				In a bid to remain afloat, they are looking in desperation at the family bloodline as if none but a descendant of the dynasty can govern India. It is not right to invoke the ideas of rajas, rajputras and rajkanyas, knowing that these still stir the naive villagers of India although they are practically non-existent.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is typically Indian to push back the truly important issues  such as poverty, illiteracy, lack of electricity, drinking water and other basic amenities  and harp on the foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi. It seems that our priorities have gone horribly wrong.				 																																																				While persons facing criminal charges are having little problems contesting elections, it is strange that the manifesto of the National Democratic Alliance gives more importance to bringing in legislations to ban foreigners from holding high offices. The voters of the country must reflect and decide which issue should be given priority over the rest. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Why is The Telegraph so obsessed with the Congress and the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty? Even while the paper is expressing its views against the dynasty-culture, it is in effect giving importance to an issue which does not deserve it. The Congresss election manifesto also shows how distant it has become from the masses. Achin Vanaik is quite right in saying that the party does not have an alternative vision(Swing high or low, April 15). But then, did the Congress have a vision ever? Its manifesto is too high-falutin for the masses, half of whom do not how to read or write.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Noble thoughts				 																																																				Sir  Amartya Sen has rightly perceived that the preservation of Rabindranath Tagores ideals is more critical than the preservation of his possessions (Amartya puts ideals above medal, March 30). The rapid ecological degradation of Santiniketan is possibly the greatest insult to his vision, since nature was for Tagore the greatest inspiration behind all creative activities. He also regarded nature as the greatest teacher for continuously reinforcing values of life in an otherwise utilitarian education system. In less than 60 years since his death, through the callous inefficiency and greed of the authorities, politicians and builders, Santiniketan has turned into a concrete jungle. Crying over stolen medals is no use if we cannot recover the stolen ambience of Santiniketan.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Purnima Dutta Gupta, New Delhi 

				 																																																				Sir  Amartya Sens response to the Nobel heist was shocking. How could he be so disinterested about the place where his roots are? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avinash Gupta, Bandel

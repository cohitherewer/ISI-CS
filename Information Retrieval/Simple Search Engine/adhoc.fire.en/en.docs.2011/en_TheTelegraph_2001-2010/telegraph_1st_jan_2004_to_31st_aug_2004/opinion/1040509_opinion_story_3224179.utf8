		 Sunday, May 09, 2004  GROUND BENEATH HER FEET 
 							 - Post-election, Mamata is set to quit coal ministry With Mamatas magic fading, Trinamul Congress is going through an identity crisis. Even mayor Subrata Mukherjee is more of a star than the TMC supremo. Sumit Mitra reports																														Ten years ago, Sonarpur was little more than a hick town from where the maids came every morning by train to serve the Ballygunge homes. Today it is the suburban nest of the upwardly mobile with its twisting lanes lined by highrise tenements and its market square. On Sunday afternoons, it is filled with men in bermudas alighting with their wives from small cars bought on easy installments.																														For Mamata Banerjee, four- time MP from South Calcutta of which Sonarpur is a part, the campaign visit last week to the local Karna Mandir grounds must have held out a surprise. In the 1998 and 1991 polls, when, to quote Trinamul Congress MLA Partha Chatterjee, she carpet-bombed Sonarpur with meetings, the crowds swarmed with her wherever she went. 																														Local residents recall that in 1999, the same grounds the size of a football field was packed at least an hour in advance of Mamatas scheduled time for arrival, with no sign of the crowd thinning out till shed finished speaking. But now there were no more than a hundred people, mostly middle-aged, who sat through the routine delay of two hours for Mamatas cavalcade to arrive. 																														The local upwardly mobile were conspicuous by their absence. Absent were the youngsters who, in the past, yelled didi at the sight of her and waved at her. This time around, as she drove through the lane in an ordinary Maruti Zen, followed by the commando car, the crowd hardly filled a quarter of the field.																														She began her speech with the usual sympathy-grabbing line  Im not keeping well, yet I have come because youre so dear to me  but there were no claps. She offered to distribute a free pamphlet listing her achievements, but no greedy hand was stretched out. She began her litany of abuses at the CPI(M), particularly at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, the useless buffoon. Still no response. Then she changed track, delving into the irresponsibility of the Congress  didnt it pull down the Vajpayee government by a single vote?  asking why they couldnt name their prime ministerial candidate. Still no response. 																														The crowd finally cheered at an awkward moment, when, perhaps exasperated by the sullen rows, she paid a minor compliment to Jyoti Basu, her bete noire of 23 years. The applause left her visibly flabbergasted, making her wonder if shed come to the wrong rally.																														But the fact is, her anti-CPI(M) fireworks are not very popular in Bengal any longer. Her speeches have fallen flat in every sort of place  be it amid jobless industrial workers at Serampore, the mobile middle-class at Dhakuria (men in bermudas) or the agricultural workers in South 24 Parganas. The responses are on a somewhat low key everywhere in this election, and it applies to all political parties, including the CPI(M), explains Chatterjee, who looks after Trinamul Congress media affairs. 																														But a Mamata meeting is different from the traditional campaign rallies. With its folksy doggerels, high-pitched slander of men in power and fluctuating moods, it is closest to experiencing rock music live. Why is she not getting the applause now? Is she getting old and tired? Are the people disenchanted with her? Or is it both?																														Before exploring the reason for her chemistry being lost, one should add that shes still the CPI(M)s most feared opponent, a badge of honour that no other anti-left politician wears. But the fear is waning. 																														Earlier, the Left Front would assume her South Calcutta seat as lost from day one, and would give the ticket away to lightweight intellectuals and assorted hangers-on. But this time it is dead serious, evident from its choice of Rabin Deb, the partys chief whip in the Assembly whos also one of the best-networked among its GenNext leaders. Hes a tough cookie when it comes to electioneering, having snapped up the Ballygunge Assembly segment in the South Calcutta Lok Sabha constituency in the 2001 state election, a year and a half after Mamata had secured a lead of 17,000 votes there. 																														Once the Marxists felt that that the lady of Kalighat was within the range of fire, it turned the battle for South Calcutta into their own Da Nang, mobilising, according to one estimate, about 5,000 experienced party workers. Earlier, Deb made a presentation of his strategy at Jadavpur stadium before Basu and state party chief Anil Biswas, and party bigwigs have continuously fine-tuned it. 																														When Basu was the chief minister, he hardly ever did any intensive campaigning in Mamatas citadel. But Bhattacharya cared to hold an hour-long road show as late as Friday in areas that are a stones throw away from Mamatas famously modest house in Kalighat. 																														In South Calcutta, the odds are no doubt stacked in Mamatas favour. Still, there is a feeling that shes close, perhaps too close, to blinking. In April, when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees office announced the plan of his campaign visit to Calcutta, the North West and North East candidates, Subrata Mukherjee and Ajit Panja, reasoned with Mamata that the PMs rally should take place at Shahid Minar for its central location. 																														But she wouldnt agree and would have the rally nowhere other than at Deshapriya Park, which is smack within her constituency, on the rather emotional plea that the patch close to home is lucky. 			Her party workers frankly admit that with her superstar popularity dented, she cant do without the prop of Vajpayees aura. 																														In other constituencies, her party candidates are not clamouring for her presence, as they did in the past. In the neighboring area of Calcutta, on the other hand, Mukherjee has a more inspiring presence as, being the mayor, Calcuttans identify him with many tangible improvements in civic amenities. But Mamata has fallen way below their radar, except as an oddball in politics known for her antics. 																														Mamata may be a gutsy politician but shes getting marginalised due to her severe cultural backwardness, something that is common in electoral democracy in a country as socio-culturally heterogeneous as India. It happened to H.D. Deve Gowda when he became Prime Minister by a quirk of fate, or to the late Sitaram Kesri who became Congress president due to infighting within the partys elite after P.V. Narasimha Raos downfall. Both men suffered a huge culture shock on reaching their highest stations in public life, and left their offices in disgrace. 																														With Mamata, however, the cultural factor didnt show up in her first two general elections as the Trinamul chief, in 1998 and 1999, when she showed a remarkable beginners luck by obtaining, with the BJP, 34.62 and 37.95 per cent of the polled votes respectively. She drove the Congress into its ghetto of Malda and Murshidabad, and chased the Marxists so far away from Calcutta and its surroundings that then at least they looked like barbarians whod soon be beaten back from the gate, after all.																														As Basus tired rule since 1977 was continuing at that time, and the state was sliding into Bihar-like backwardness, nobody at that time stopped to take a close look at Mamatas eligibility as a leader of a state that had once been in the cultural forefront. 																														However, her deficiencies were all too apparent. If Deve Gowda was a taluka-level politician, and Kesri too servile, Mamata has been typical of her generation of Youth Congress recruits  brash, rustic and rapacious. But unlike some of them (like Mukherjee), she never developed a taste for governance. Essentially a rabble-rouser, she fared miserably at across-the-table negotiations, doodling away if she couldnt avoid staying away. The more she withdrew into a shell, the more persecuted she felt, till political relations broke up on the flimsiest of grounds.																														Like after the 1998 poll, when she turned down Vajpayees invitation to join the Cabinet on the ground that the public wanted her to sacrifice ministership. Instead she began blackmailing the Centre, throwing at Vajpayee a Bengal package, which is in fact financial abracadabra couched in the format of a trade union-style charter of demands. 																														The Panchayat elections that year was her real test of popularity in rural Bengal and she failed. In Delhi, BJP leaders started calling her the medium wave radio but she failed to grasp her shortcomings. Instead, she put the blame squarely on the state BJP, a minor player then, as it is now, and announced that she was suspending her support to the NDA, this time for the Centres failure to impose Presidents Rule in Bengal.																														But the BJP bore it with grin, and the alliance did even better than the previous year. Trouble began as the CPI(M) played a masterstroke by replacing Basu with a younger, more humane and development-minded Bhattacharya just six months before the Assembly elections. With the equations changing, she desperately sought to move out of the NDA as she feared that being a BJP ally, she wouldnt get even a slice of the states 24 per cent Muslim votes. 																														She got the opportunity with the Tehelka expos. She gave Vajpayee a 72-hour ultimatum for removing George Fernandez, but quit NDA (and the railway ministry) in 12 hours even though Fernandez was removed the next day. Her rough and ready alliance with the Congress was a marriage going sour. 																														Her party went further downhill in the Panchayat elections last year, while her image took a severe beating for her instability, her incapacity to understand the idiom of todays politics of development, and her way of running the party like a tin-pot dictator. In the six years since Trinamuls birth, it hasnt witnessed any serious party election and most of its office bearers are her factotum. 																														She publicly fought with her MPs Sudip Badyopadhyay and Panja on the suspicion that they were getting too close to the BJP. Her MLAs hold her in awe rather than respect. Vajpayee and Advani know her to be a difficult customer, and are probably prepared that post-election, she might quit her present portfolio of coal on any ground that suits her. It may be to protest against the promise in the NDA poll manifesto to close down the terminally sick coal mines. 																														If she quits again, itll be in search of her identity as Bengals saviour, like a gender reversed Don Quixote. Its the windmills who are in fact getting all the pats at the Centre and from investors in India and abroad. And, in the elections, theyre getting the winning numbers too. But why should it deter Mamata from her imagined crusade?

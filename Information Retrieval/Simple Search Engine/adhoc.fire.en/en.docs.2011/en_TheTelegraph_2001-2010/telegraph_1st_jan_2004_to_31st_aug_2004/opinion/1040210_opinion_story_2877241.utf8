		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 							 																						MEN OF STRAW Mani Talk / Mani Shankar Aiyar				 	 The misadventurers																														Jack Straw, the British foreign and commonwealth secretary, is on his eighth visit to India. (He first came here on his honeymoon 25 years ago and went everywhere it was possible then to go). On February 6, in New Delhis Teen Murti Auditorium, he delivered the second Madhavrao Scindia Memorial Lecture.																														Straw chose as the theme of his lecture the subject, Terrorism and Global Order. He began by praising Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his initiative on India-Pakistan relations. (Somewhat indelicate that, as Scindia had risen to national pre-eminence by routing Vajpayee in their common home-town of Gwalior in the general elections of 1984!) Straw then went on to share the grief of the 42 families bereaved by the terrorist bomb blast that morning on the Moscow subway. He did not, however, explain why the sorrow of the families of these 42 innocent victims of terrorism is any different from the sorrow of the thousands of families of the innocent victims of the wars unleashed by George W. Bush and Tony Blair on Iraq and Afghanistan.																														Warming to his subject, he pronounced that the United Nations security council resolution 1441 of November 2002 was based on the unanimous belief of the international community that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction. This was British prevarication at best and British humbug at worst. The only reason Syria, then representing the Arab states in the UN security council, agreed to support the resolution was that their Baathist counterparts in Iraq had assured the Syrians that there were no WMD to be found in Iraq and, therefore, no objection to the resumption of UN inspections. 																														Indeed, the international community is represented not in the coterie of the security council but in the UN general assembly. And the vast majority of members of the international community were so alarmed at the arm-twisting going on in the security council that they passed a quite separate resolution in the general assembly that deliberately eschewed the self-serving half-truths and ambiguities on which 1441 was based.																														Straw then stressed that 1441 had been forced on Iraq because Saddam had thrown out UN inspectors in December 1998 as they were on the edge of unveiling his masked WMD programme. Another British sleight of hand. It was not Saddam who ordered the UN out; it was the UN that withdrew at the instance of the United States of America. And the US had pulled the inspectors out because Monica Lewinsky had preened to a friend wired by the intelligence agencies of the games she and William Jefferson Clinton had been playing with cigars in secluded corners of the Oval Office. The bombing of Baghdad was a cynical move by Clinton to distract public attention from his private philandering. There are reams of written testimony by the top dogs of the inspection team over how they were astounded at being asked to leave  lest Clintons bombs fall on their blameless heads.																														Straw then claimed that 1441 gave them all the authority the US and United Kingdom needed to launch their armed assault on a sovereign fellow-member of the UN. Why, if this was so, Bush and Blair had gone back to the security council, and there failed to get the additional resolution they sought, Straw decided to delicately skip. 																														Instead, he took recourse to what he said was his countrys right to preventive action. The slip of the tongue was significant. Straw speaks such exquisite English, so fluently and so mellifluously, that the one and only word he tripped on was preventive. It was not his tongue that tripped; it was his conscience. For there was nothing preventive about his coalitions military action. It was a pre-emptive military strike. Bush flaunts his Bushmans law of pre-emptive action. The more discreet Brits find it a little bit more difficult to be in such flagrant breach of the UN charter, which makes no provision for pre-emptive military action based on empty suppositions. For, after all, pre-emptive action was Adolf Hitlers justification for annexing Austria, dismembering Czechoslovakia and then invading Poland and later the Soviet Union. Hence, Straws preventive.																														But let that go. Saddam, said Straw, had to go because he was defying the world community on WMD  by having them when he had no right as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty to have them. For so doing, he had to be punished. Now, I can understand punishing a husband for killing his wife. But can you punish him for not killing his wife? How could Saddam deliver his illegitimate WMD when he had no WMD to deliver? Saddam went not for possessing nuclear weapons  but for not possessing them. Because if, like North Korea, he actually had WMD, he would have been no more vulnerable to Brit-Yank military invasion than Kim Il-Jong, who warns that one false military move by Bush-Blair and he will blow the nearest British or American asset  or their friends  to smouldering radioactive smithereens. 																														In the jungle that Blair and Straw have made of international law, the only currency that is sterling yet in England (William Shakespeare, Richard II) is naked nuclear power. What Straw and his cohorts fail to realize is that it is their parading of nuclear muscle that tempts countries like India and Pakistan and Israel  and North Korea, Iran and Libya, and, yes, perhaps, Iraq  into stocking the same currency of power. It is the hypocrisy (and racism) of keeping their n-arms but deeming it sin for anyone else to hold them that lies at the root of the single-most dangerous threat that terrorism holds to global order  nuclear terrorism. To go by his lecture, the thought has not even occurred to Jack Straw.																														Straw now wants to restore global order by getting the UN to come up with an unanimous definition of terror, terrorist and terrorism. Good thinking, Jack  but why did that not occur to you before you sent your gunboats up the Tigris? The fact is  and I speak as a former mid-Eighties joint secretary, United Nations, MEA  the UN has been wrestling with this problem of defining terrorism since the last thirty years at least, ever since Yasser Arafat put the Palestine state on the international map by insisting that Palestinian terrorists could be called off only if Israel desisted from state terrorism. 																														The crocodile tears which Straw shed for the victims of the bomb blast on a Moscow subway constitutes the heart of the problem. He is shocked at the thousands killed in the Twin Towers but totally insouciant about the thousands killed in Operation Shock and Awe. Why? Death is death  whether it comes at the evil hands of Osama bin Laden or the benign hands of Bush and Blair. The Brit-Yank effort to make the world cry over American deaths and rejoice over Iraqi deaths is only acceptable to a people as reared in unctuous humbug as the Brits.																														Which is why Straw hemmed and hawed, feinted and waffled, and twisted and turned Her Majestys English to answer Vasant Sathes simple question: would Bush-Blair now at least assure the world community that they would never again invade another country except with UN sanction and by and through the UN? Straw could not answer because the answer was given by Krishna Menon at the Hyde Park speakers corner decades ago when a heckler called out that the sun never sets on the British Empire and Menon replied: Thats because even God doesnt trust the British in the dark. When Clement Atlee decided on his scuttle, Winston Churchill warned that India was being handed over to men of straw. The Empire strikes back. It is now Britain that has been handed over to men of Straw.

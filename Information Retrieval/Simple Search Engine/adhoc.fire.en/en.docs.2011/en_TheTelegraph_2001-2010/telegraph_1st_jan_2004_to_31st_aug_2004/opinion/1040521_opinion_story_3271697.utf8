		 Friday, May 21, 2004 							 																						NEW BEGINNING																														A trial by fire is nothing new to the Congress. But the trial that Congress workers and elected representatives underwent on Tuesday is somewhat unprecedented in the distinguished annals of the party. The Congress was swept into power under the leadership of Ms Sonia Gandhi. It was in many ways Ms Gandhis personal victory. She was the acknowledged and the undisputed leader, and the natural expectation was that she would become the prime minister and lead the country. When she refused the prime ministership, the atmosphere was one of stunned disappointment. Nobody in the Congress could quite accept the fact that Ms Gandhi would not be prime minister. In the meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party, where Ms Gandhi announced her decision, there was an initial unwillingness to accept the most unpleasant fact. Outside, on the streets, there were demonstrations to force her to reconsider her decision. Ms Gandhis wishes prevailed and the partys acceptance of her decision was a function of the unique stature that Ms Gandhi enjoys and a new spirit of discipline and coherence that now informs the Congress.																														This discipline is a direct outcome of Ms Gandhis intervention in Congress politics. She eliminated factionalism. She centralized decision-making but allowed powerful chief ministers to run their own states. This infused the party with a new morale and confidence. It was this discipline that came to the fore on Tuesday night when Ms Gandhi stood aside from the prime ministership of India. There could have been chaos, but there wasnt because it was a different Congress. It was a Congress that had come through hard times and had been tempered by defeats. This was not the Congress that had grown soft on power. Congress members did not exactly like Ms Gandhis withdrawal, but they knew that they had no other option but to trust in her wisdom. They could do this because they were convinced that Ms Gandhi would do nothing that could damage the Congress in any way. It was a landmark day in the history of the Congress, and the days events provided clues for understanding the success that the party had in the hustings. There was trust between the leader and the workers of the party. Despite unprecedented pressure and extraordinary circumstances, the individual and the collective will of the Congress did not fall apart. The heartfelt desire to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party out of power was only a part of the story. It was complemented by a remarkable chemistry between leader and party. The Congress has entered a new era.

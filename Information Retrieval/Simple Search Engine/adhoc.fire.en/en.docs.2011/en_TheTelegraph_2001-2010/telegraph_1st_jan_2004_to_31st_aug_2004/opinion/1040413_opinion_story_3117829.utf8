		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 							 																						HOPE AND SUPPORT																														Fear and stigma, founded on ignorance, continue to rule the lives of people with HIV/AIDS in India. But a recent initiative in north Bengal takes a promising step towards community mobilization in the care and support of those who have developed AIDS. In Siliguri, a group of people who are themselves HIV+ or are suffering from AIDS have organized themselves so that they can visit AIDS patients who are isolated by their communities and are also severely ill. This group not only provides support to those who are in the last stages of their illness, but also informs and counsels their families and community members to counter the paranoia and ostracization. This has gone a long way towards reducing the helplessness and indignity of those suffering from AIDS in the area. And the presence of a publicly visible group of people with AIDS who are actively supporting others like them is bound to make a significant difference in the perception of and attitudes to HIV/AIDS. This group is being helped by the health department and a non-governmental organization, Janaseva Ashram. Together, they have been running a drop-in centre since last May. Here, people with HIV/AIDS meet every week for advice and support, and often bring along carers, family members and neighbours to help them be informed about and understand their condition.																														It is also significant that this initiative grew out of a voluntary counselling and testing centre opened by North Bengal Medical College and Hospital. Patients attending this centre spontaneously felt the need to mobilize themselves for supporting one another. They also felt, together with their doctors and counsellors, that visibility and the dissemination of information were crucial factors in dispelling the brutal ignorance with which society responds to HIV/AIDS. The patients were also acting out of a sense of the human rights dimension of their predicament  their entitlement not only to treatment and support, but also to information, confidentiality and basic human dignity. Now that West Bengal has at last sat up to the imperative of voluntary testing and counselling at every HIV/AIDS clinic, a development from one such centre ought to provide a concrete example and model. HIV/AIDS demands nothing less than a revolution in Indias social, sexual and medical attitudes and behaviour, just as it necessitates a different kind of political will on the part of governments. The north Bengal initiative shows that a clear and courageous sense of justice and dignity works far better than paranoia and moralism in dealing with the human complexity of HIV/AIDS.

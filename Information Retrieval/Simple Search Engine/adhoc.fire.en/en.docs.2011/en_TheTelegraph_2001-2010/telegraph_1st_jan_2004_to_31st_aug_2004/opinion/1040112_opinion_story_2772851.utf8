																								Since there will be no budget till the elections are over, the mini budget is the only clue to the finance ministrys thinking  and a promise of good things to come. But changes in tax and duties cannot be all a budget is concerned with. A hint of liberalization issues, such as expenditure reforms, could have been expected, if only to see where the finance minister stands in regard to the recommendations of the expenditure reforms commission. Far from going that way, this mini budget focusses on changes in indirect tax rates. The chambers of commerce argue, persuasively, that the government did not want to postpone tax reform. Had that been the governments aim, though, there would have been some invocation of the exemption removal proposals of the Kelkar task force recommendations, or firm steps towards partial value added tax. The last is particularly noticeable, since the states had been amenable to partial VAT, while North Block baulked at the idea. This alone is enough to identify the driving impulse behind the mini budget: the finance minister chose those proposals which smell of reform but would be welcomed, while avoiding the harsher ones. He has, for example, abolished inland and foreign travel taxes and reduced excise duty on aviation turbine fuel to 4 per cent. But these moves originate in the Naresh Chandra committees recommendations on civil aviation, which was intended as an integrated package. 																								The understanding was that there should be a single central VAT rate and central excise should move towards this. Yet excise reduction has been selective. The middle classes will warm to the fact that excise duty and customs duty have been reduced on their products of interest. The Kelkar task forces recommendations warn against the distortionary effects of such discretion. In a special case, such as information technology, the reduction in import duties may be permissible. India has signed a plurilateral agreement that requires zero import duties on IT products by 2005. But the logic of discretionary reductions in import duties remains confused. 																								One good decision is the overall reduction in basic customs duty to 20 per cent for manufactured products. But it needs to be made clear whether this also covers goods where there are yet no World Trade Organization bound rates. Then again, scrapping special additional duty of 4 per cent is premature without VAT, because SAD compensates for state-level sales tax. But there is little substance in the revenue loss argument from customs and excise duty cuts. Accepting possible revenue losses, and even tackling the danger of Indian industry becoming more protectionist with rupee appreciation, is best faced now, with the gross domestic product, industry and non-oil imports buoyant. Also laudable in this mini budget are procedural improvements and simplification, even if some categories have been spared tax returns. The economics is good in some places, but the politics is better.

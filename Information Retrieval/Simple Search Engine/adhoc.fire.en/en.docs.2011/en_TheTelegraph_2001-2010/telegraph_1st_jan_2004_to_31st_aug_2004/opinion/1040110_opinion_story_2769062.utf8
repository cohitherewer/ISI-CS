The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 10, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																In dubious company				 																																																				Sir  Cadbury may be using Amitabh Bachchan to wriggle its way out of trouble, but what does the actors accepting such an assignment say of him (Bring on the brand baron to crush the can of worms, Jan 8)? No ad campaign can save a brand seen as being slip-shod on quality  whatever management gurus might tell Cadbury to the contrary. Bachchan is risking his much-vaunted credibility by such campaigns. Given the fortune he charges for endorsing a brand, Bachchan should be very wary of the uses to which his image are put. For images are like Humpty-Dumpty  once broken, they cannot be put together again. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Rita Ghosh, Calcutta 
				 																An Indian summer				 																																																				Sir  Congratulations to the Indian team on some of the best cricket seen in Australia in recent years. The Indian players did their country proud in the final test in Sydney, and all through the series. This is excellent news not only for Indian cricket, but also for cricket-lovers everywhere, especially since the present team looks set to be a very good one for a very long time. This is exactly what cricket needs to raise interest in the game elsewhere in the world. The Indians should now strive to keep it up. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Richmond, Perth

				 																																																				Sir  Even before the Indian team went to Australia, pundits had written it off. But the picture at the end was quite different. The Border-Gavaskar trophy stayed with India, as the series was levelled at one win each. Confidence in his players, the choice of Bruce Reid as bowling coach and perfect planning, make Sourav Ganguly one of the most respected figures in world cricket today. He has matured a lot over the years.				 																																																				This is the first time the Indian team has applied itself to the fullest overseas. Gone are the days when outside the off-stump balls were a nightmare. With rock-solid players like Rahul Dravid, a complete cricketer like Sachin Tendulkar, an elegant Sourav Ganguly and a classy V.V.S. Laxman, the Indian team has re-discovered itself. 				 																																																				Another important thing seen in this series was the way Ganguly dominated. The chin-music theory faded away once Ganguly showed his prowess with a knock of 144 in the first test. This time the Australians were at the receiving end of some willow-music from the Indians. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The test series between India and Australia saw some spectacular revelations and vicissitudes but everything was overshadowed by the farewell of Steve Waugh after the last test at Sydney. To watch Waugh lead his team from the front, seal the fate of the match and then silently walk back  on a score of just 20 short of a century  amidst thundering applause, was a rare treat. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhadip Guha Thakurta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If Deep Dasguptas keeping was bad in South Africa, Parthiv Patels in Australia was worse. Patel just kept on missing, which surely resulted in India not being able to win the deciding test and the series. He let off Jason Gillespie in the first innings of the last test in Sydney, which resulted in the Australian tail doing well; and compounded it by failing to stump Ricky Ponting in the second, thereby helping the Aussies to play for a draw. A wicket-keeper commands a place in the team by his keeping, not by the audacious shots he can play. If tender age is the reason, then he should not have been picked to do national duty so early.				 																																																				It is really surprising that Sourav Ganguly did not play Dasgupta in Sydney after Patels lacklustre show in the first three tests. Was Dasgupta taken Down Under only as a tourist? And will he be considered as the first choice for the Pakistan tour?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manjul Saha, Rourkela

				 																																																				Sir  The decision of the selection committee not to give a chance to V.V.S Laxman in the one-dayers against Australia is unjustified. The Indians have already paid dearly for leaving him out in the World Cup, 2003. Laxman is the most in-form batsman and did a lot of damage to the Australian pacers. Besides he has improved his technique and can now collect some quick runs. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Susanta Das, Baripada

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 							 																						WILL																													AND																													GRACE She ruled the waves in the pool and then turned social activist. Now with an election debut lined up, Nafisa Ali is ready to make the dash from page three to page one																														Cheese and chalk appear like identical twins when compared to the two women about to hit the streets of Calcutta. One of the two is immaculately turned out, the other is not. One smiles all the time, the other does not. One is a political greenhorn, the other an old hand. One is a constant feature at society parties, the other is yet to make a page-three debut. One is Nafisa Ali, and the other is Mamata Banerjee.																														Comparisons, as the old man said, are odious. But Nafisa Ali  chosen by the Congress to take the Trinamul leader on in her own bastion, South Calcutta, in this election  is not fazed by the analogies that she has been deluged with ever since newspapers whispered this week that she was the chosen one. I am a shy, hard-working, grassroot person, she says earnestly. I am not a page-three type.																														The nicest thing about Ali  her USP, really  is that you want to believe her. The media has given her monikers that still tend to follow her around, long after they were first coined. Look at that, now they are calling me a Sometime-Water-Baby, says the former swimming champion of Bengal, pulling out a thick file of newspaper cuttings. The media never looks at the hard work I do, she complains.																														This time round the hard work promises to show, for fighting Banerjee will be no childs play. But then, Ali can work hard  which, her colleagues say, was most apparent when she spent several days in Gujarat, both during the earthquake and the riots. 																														Social activist Shabnam Hashmi believes that it is her drive that sets her apart from other actresses in politics. If she is in town, she will join anything that she is invited to, a small meeting or a big rally says Hashmi. 																														Ali, 47, is the new slogan in the millenniums first Lok Sabha elections  page three meets page one. Nobody is talking about bijli, sarak aur paani yet and Lal Krishna Advanis Bharat Uday Yatra is still to take off. So Ali  who says that her work with people living with AIDS has always been sidelined by the media  is making news. 																														An army wife (as a teenager she tied a thread in Fatehpur Sikri urging God to give her the right husband), Ali believes in her secular moorings  she was born of a Muslim father and a Christian mother and is married to a Sikh. I am spiritual, she says.																														Barring her looks, there is nothing starry about Ali, even though she is late coming in (her Armada, a Mahindra jeep that she bought from friend Anand Mahendra for Rs 10,000, was giving her trouble). Radiant in a pink Bengal cotton, Ali is perturbed that people tend to brand her. I am not a socialite. I may have been born beautiful, but I have nothing to do with that, she says. I have stopped going to parties because every time, its my face  out of the 1500 who are there  that makes it to the society pages.																														To her credit, she is not one of the regulars of the glam-clan that has dramatically announced its entry into politics in recent times. Unlike many of the former stars who now dot the political arena, Alis debut is not linked with an election. My interest in politics developed in the last five years as I watched the Sangh parivar grow. I was concerned, she says.																														The actress  mostly remembered for her small role in Shyam Benegals Junoon of 1978 and as Amitabh Bachchans wife, exactly two decades later, in Major Saab  joined the Congress as a primary member five years ago. 																														Last year, when Delhi went to poll, she asked chief minister Sheila Dikshit if she could fight from an assembly constituency called Kasturba Nagar, near upmarket Defence Colony and not too far from her Greater Kailash home. 																														But then you know how it is, says the old Martiniere, smiling at the last-minute political manoeuvres that left her out in the cold. The Congress, Ali points out, lost the seat.																														When elections were announced this year, Ali called Dikshit up again. She wanted a seat from Delhi  instead she got a call from Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee, who urged her to fight from South Calcutta instead. I said I am a soldier of the party, Ill go where you want me to, says Ali. 																														The buzz in political circles has it that the Congress wanted to field a parvenu because it wanted to keep its channels with the Trinamul open. Says a political watcher: After all, Nafisa can always be accommodated in Rajya Sabha later.																														But Ali, like the good worker she insists she is, is not going to get bogged down by rumours. If and when her name is announced, she will start to campaign in the city that she grew up in, and where her 82-year-old father, photographer Ahmed Ali, still lives in their old Hindustan Park house. People have seen me growing up there, says Ali, stressing that even her rusty Bengali will pick up once she starts speaking.																														In some circles, the encounter is being dubbed as WWF meets Bambi. But Ali, sweet smile in place, is unfazed. Mamata may have fire power, but I have flower power, she says.

		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 							 																						IN JEOPARDY																														The dialogue between the All Party Hurriyat Conference and the Central government could be jeopardized by recent developments in Kashmir. Not only has the Peoples Conference, an important part of the separatist alliance, split, but the APHC also seems to be under considerable pressure to suspend its talks with New Delhi. A breakdown in talks would be most unfortunate, and it is essential that New Delhi and Srinagar take remedial steps to prevent this from happening. It may be recalled that only last month, a meeting between leaders of the APHC and the deputy prime minister, Mr L.K. Advani, seemed to provide fresh momentum to the peace process in Jammu and Kashmir. The meeting was seen as an important step in promoting a real dialogue that could eventually lead to a resolution of the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir. This was the first official coming together of separatist leaders from Jammu and Kashmir and the top political leadership of the country. There was a significant joint statement issued after the meeting. Not only did both sides agree to find an honourable and durable solution to the Kashmir problem through dialogue, but they also hoped that all forms of violence at all levels would end. The Centre and the Hurriyat also agreed to adopt a step-by-step approach that would lead to the resolution of all outstanding issues relating to Jammu and Kashmir. This agreement to end violence and continued negotiations was widely welcomed in Kashmir. Indeed, Mr Advani and the Hurriyat leaders had agreed to meet again in March. This forthcoming meeting seems to be now in trouble for several reasons. The APHC leaders believe that the Centre is not serious about implementing measures to build confidence while the dialogue is being carried out.																														Apparently, the Centre had agreed to release political detainees, who had been languishing in Indian jails without trial, but this has not happened. Simultaneously, there has been a highly publicized incident of alleged human rights violations by the security forces near Srinagar, which has put the APHC on the defensive. There are also important separatist leaders outside the Hurriyat who are projecting the dialogue as a sell-out by the Hurriyat leaders. Finally, one of the most important wings within the Hurriyat, the Peoples Conference has split. As a result, the moderate and charismatic chairman of the Peoples Conference, Mr Sajjad Lone, is out of the APHC. All this does not augur well for the dialogue. It is essential, however, that the Centre and the state government do their utmost to ensure that the dialogue be sustained until it is possible to arrive at a breakthrough.

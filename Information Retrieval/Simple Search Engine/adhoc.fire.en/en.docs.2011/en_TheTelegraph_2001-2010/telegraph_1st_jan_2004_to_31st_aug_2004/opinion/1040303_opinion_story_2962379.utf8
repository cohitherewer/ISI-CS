		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 							 																						POLICIES THAT PRESERVE Shobita Punja																					The Archaeological Survey of India was established in 1861 by the British government in India to centralize the collection of exhibits in the museums from site explorations and ancient monuments. At the age of 47, Major General Alexander Cunningham retired from the army to become the first director-general of the ASI, and he made a systematic exploration of north India from the frontiers in Afghanistan to Bengal. James Burgess, who became director-general in 1885, completed the documentation of historical sites in western and southern India. At this stage in the life of the ASI, preservation was not one of its functions.																					After the arrival of Lord Curzon in 1899, the term archaeology included exploration, excavation, research, epigraphy, publication and protection of monuments. In Curzons own words, the function of ASI was to dig and to discover, to classify, reproduce and describe and to cherish and conserve.																					In 1902, John Marshall was appointed director-general of the ASI. He followed Curzons directive to the last letter, with impressive digs at Sanchi, Taxila and Sarnath. He started the ASI annual reports series that gives fascinating accounts of excavations especially at Mohenjodaro and Harappa to inform the world that Indias cultural heritage was as ancient as that of Egypt, China and Mesopotamia. Marshall filled ASI museums with sculptures and other antiquities he had discovered. He organized the first consistent work of conservation of the principal monuments in all parts of the country. Notably, for the first time too, Marshall appointed Indians to the ASI  R.D. Banerji, who first discovered Mohenjodaro; Pandit M.S. Vats, who excavated Harappa and Mohenjodaro; Daya Ram Sahni, who later became the first Indian director-general of the ASI.																					It was during Marshalls time that, in 1904, the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act was passed for the preservation of ancient monuments, to exercise control over exploration in certain places, and for the protection and acquisition, in certain cases, of ancient monuments and objects of archaeological, historical or artists interest. It is now exactly 100 years since the act was passed  and so much has changed between 1904 and 2004																					Old glories, new sheen																					Today, the director of the ASI is an IAS officer. The ASI protects, preserves and conserves about 5,000 buildings that represent historic structures of national importance. These cover prehistoric sites, proto- and early-historic sites, religious edifices, stupas and monasteries, megalithic remains, rock-cut caves, temples of different faiths, mosques and tombs, palaces, havelis, gardens and miscellaneous buildings. The ASI has done yeomans service in protecting our heritage scattered over this enormous country. It does this admirably by adhering to secular values. A Buddhist site at Sanchi gets the same attention or indifference as, say, the temple complex at Khajuraho.																					What we need to know today is what the ASIs mandate is, 100 years after the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act was passed? Has the ASI added any new buildings to its original list of protected buildings or was the list given to us by the British?																					The emphasis has changed today  we have lakhs of visitors to the Taj Mahal, and few explorations are conducted today. While the ASI continues to preserve buildings under its care, there has been a huge move now from excavation to visitor-management. Today, the ASI needs to reorganize its priorities and efforts to meet ground realities: how to look after sites under its care, how to interpret the site so that visitors understand the historicity of the building. It needs to have a clearly defined site management plan for each individual location, and provide visitor facilities and visitor centres, where visitors can learn about the site in an enjoyable way.																					Management, presentation, and conservation should be the new focus and a new act of Parliament needs to be formulated to protect more of our heritage that is owned by private and public agencies. The brilliance of our heritage need not be dulled by outmoded policies, but could be given a new sheen.

		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 							 																						WRONG MOVE																														Vengeance can never be the basis of politics in a democracy. Thus the demand emanating from within sections of the Congress to cleanse the administration of elements owing allegiance to the sangh parivar is a dangerous one. The choice of administrators cannot be based on ideology or on loyalty. It can be based on merit and competence and only on these two considerations. When Mr Arjun Singh, the human resource development minister, spoke of detecting the fascist forces of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the first duty of the Congress and the government, he displayed a perverse set of priorities. The primary duty of the government is to establish an administration that is clean, efficient and transparent. Mr Singh and all else who are baying for RSS blood forget that two can play the same game. If the sangh parivar, in the states where it is in power, were to follow the same policy and clean the administration of secular elements, governance would acquire the nature of a vendetta and thus come to a stop. Mr Singh does not realize how dangerous a precedent he is trying to put in place. More pernicious is the proposal voiced by some Congressmen to ban the RSS. This will only serve to make martyrs out of the sanghis and thus increase their popularity within their own constituency.																														Lurking behind these proposals is the failure on the part of the Congress to combat the sangh parivar politically and culturally. The Congress has tried to fight Hindutva by putting forward its version of soft Hindutva. The Congress has shied away from formulating a strong secularist line because it harbours fears about alienating the majority vote. This is the major reason why secularism has weak roots in India: the party of secularism has betrayed the cause too many times. Mr Singh and his ilk, by suggesting authoritarian steps against the sangh parivar, are driving a wedge between democracy and secularism and thus further weakening the latter. The proposal to clean the administration of RSS elements is also related to the politics of patronage. Mr Singh wants to get his own loyal men into key positions. One convenient way of camouflaging this kind of blatant patronage-mongering is to give it the veneer of ideology. Enough damage has been done to Indian public life in the name of ideology. It is time good governance was freed of such shackles.

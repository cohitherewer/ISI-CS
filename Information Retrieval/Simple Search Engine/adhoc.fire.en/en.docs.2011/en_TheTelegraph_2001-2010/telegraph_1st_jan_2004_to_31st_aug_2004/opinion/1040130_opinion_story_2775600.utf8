The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 30, 2004 							 																						DESIGNED FOR INEQUITY Gyan Pathak																					The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance, despite having ruled the country for the last five years and done nothing substantial to promote socio-economic equity, seems to have suddenly woken up to the injustice done to people in provising loans at inequitable rates of interests. The lower rates the government had promised students, concessional loans at 2 per cent less than the prime lending rate to small and medium-scale industries and agricultural infrastructure projects, and the 2 per cent cut in loan rates for corporate companies for infrastructure projects are also, ironically, inequitable, since the rates are lower for the rich and higher for the poor. 																					The Supreme Court said in a judgment in 1984 that a democratic form of government demands equality and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in all its functions. In another it had ruled, as early as 1976, that equal justice is an aspect of social justice. 																					Keeping in mind these two judgments, it can be argued that the very approach of the market economy being pursued by the country is inequitable. Market forces create imbalances for making profit. Also, there are different prices set for different classes of people. 																					Hardly creditworthy																					Take the case of our banks and their interest rates. Policy-makers claim that India is moving towards a market-driven interest-rate regime. This is baseless, the Reserve Bank of India decides the lending rates to be followed by banking institutions all over the country, that is, the interest rates are calibrated. Moreover, the interest rates are not driven by forces of demand and supply, but by the whims and caprices of the bankers who actually disburse the lending money on different written and unwritten terms and conditions to different people .																					The average prime lending rates of the banks in our country have been brought down from 19 per cent in December 1993 to 12 per cent in December 2002. At present, it moves between 10 and 11 per cent in different banks. One logic forwarded by the government for this reduction was that our banks have more cash with them but there is a lack of demand for credit. Though this seems logical, the reality is otherwise. 																					Lending rates have been lowered for the government and corporate sectors only  banks account for a large share of borrowings and they stand to benefit from lower rates. Besides, lower rates are a simple political tool to ease the burden of the huge fiscal deficits of the government and also to enable the big companies to garner more profits. 																					A lopsided story																					Big corporate houses get loans on easy terms  banks loan them money on the basis of their balance sheets including that of their subsidiaries. However, medium and small-scale sector industries, which play a big role in the growth of our economy but are cash-starved, are regularly refused loans by the banks and financial institutions. 																					The loan refusal story is the same for the huge yet poor agrarian classes too. Their woes are compounded if a person happens to be landless, as properties are usually taken as guarantee for loans. The governments announcement of farm loans up to Rs 50,000 at a rate of 9 per cent is yet to be implemented. Today, a farm loan can be procured at roughly 11 to 13 per cent despite the fact that our economic growth largely depends on agricultural growth. Agriculture needs more investment than the current 1.3 per cent of the gross domestic product. In housing loans too, the main beneficiaries are the urban elite and the middle classes. 																					When it comes to the sections whose loan requirements are most crucial, it is seen that students get loans at a rate of 11 per cent and the small- and medium-scale companies at 10-11 per cent or more depending on the prime lending rates of the banks. 																					The current interest rate management is inequitable and harmful. Risk-ridden loans are given to the rich and not the poor, leading to huge accumulation of non-performing assets of banks and financial institutions. The poor need to be given loans at more equitable rates. This would also raise the credit demand from banks.

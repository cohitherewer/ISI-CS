		 Friday, March 26, 2004 							 																						A PROBLEM OF PLENTYSelected Poems: Rabindranath Tagore Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford, Rs 495																														A selective representation of Rabindranath Tagores vast poetic oeuvre is, quite understandably, a difficult task. This is primarily because such a selection entails a painstaking process of elimination, which cannot always be justified logically or stand up to accusations of personal bias. 																														While this applies more or less to all versatile and prolific poets, certain problems are specific to Tagore, who experimented tirelessly with Bengali metre  and even invented some. He was also one of the most gifted composers of songs of all time. Therefore, any selection must adequately highlight the unique aspects of his poetic achievements.																														Clearly, this edition of Tagores poetry seeks to tackle these tricky issues by putting the claims of demonstration over those of mere representation. While this is quite an acceptable strategy, it does not always work. 																														For instance, there are surprisingly few songs  only 12 out of 151  in this volume. This is all the more shocking because Tagores greatness as a poet rests largely on his genius as a composer of songs. It would have been a different matter had the songs been kept out of the purview of this edition altogether. 																														The poems in this edition have been selected by the famous poet and Tagore-scholar, Sankha Ghosh, who had edited a similar volume in the vernacular, Suryabarta, way back in 1989. But unlike in his earlier edition, Ghosh does not give any clues about the principles which have guided him in this selection.																														The translations, the bulk of which have been done by Sukanta Chaudhuri, are of a very high order. The need for formal approximation has been commendably addressed in them. In the preface, Chaudhuri gives convincing explanations for avoiding certain forced rhymes and slightly altering a few of the original metres.																														The aim is always to suggest the overall movement rather than the precise pattern of rhymes, says Chaudhuri. No one can find fault with this noble objective. But why has he tampered with certain rhymes, which not only fall into place but also convey the original rhythm without straining very much the syntax of the language into which the poems are being translated? 																														For instance, take the first two lines of Devoured by the God  From village to village the news went round:/ Maitra Mahashay was bound on pilgrimage. This could have been easily rendered into a rhyming couplet, as in the original  The news went round from village to village:/ Maitra Mahashay was bound on pilgrimage. 																														In some poems like Children by the Shore, the original line-lengths have also been tampered with. These changes may not be unwarranted, but arent they somewhat uncalled for?																														But the technical virtuosity of the translators remains quite impressive despite such minor anomalies. Ghoshs introduction too is comprehensive and insightful. But he could have elaborated upon the Bengali payar metre, which Tagore had experimented with extensively and which became the staple metre of Bengali poetry in the post-Tagore era.

		 Friday, August 06, 2004 							 																						WHEN THE BIG GUNS BACKFIRE Abhijit Bhattacharyya																					For the Indian government, the task of modernizing its defence forces and choosing its ordnance systems is fraught with danger. For accusations of underhand dealings are inevitably levelled against those who are involved in the process. For example, the deal to acquire Bofors guns in the Eighties continues to raise political tempers. Thus, the governments decision to acquire 155 Field Howitzer guns for its artillery regiments runs the risk of courting such scandals.																					According to Janes Armour and Artillery, the Indian armys artillery includes 14 varieties of self-propelled guns, Mountain Howitzers, field guns, Howitzers and multiple rocket launching systems. The countrys tenth five year plan makes a plea for standardization of these guns in the interests of economy, logistics, maintenance and effectiveness.																					In the Eighties, four countries were shortlisted by India for the supply of 155 mm Field Howitzers to the army  Austria, France, South Africa and Sweden. The last won and 410 Bofors Defence 155mm FH-77B Field Howitzers were delivered, along with ammunition, fire-control systems, tractors and training equipment. Although India was expected to undertake local assembly and later production of these guns, the subsequent political drama aborted the plan. Bofors had to wait until the 1999 Kargil skirmish to prove its worth, which led to fresh orders by India for spare parts. 																					Select few																					To decide which company to buy the guns from, without giving rise to controversy, may be difficult, but it can be done. 																					Janes reports that the Indian army is likely to procure 400 new 155mm/52 calibre towed artillery systems and that 7 companies have been invited to send their...systems for extensive trials. These are  BAE Systems (Britain); Bofors (Sweden); Giat (France); Denel (South Africa); Patrial Vammas (Finland); Santa Barbara (Spain) and Soltlam Systems ATMOS 2000 SPG of Israel.																					In the Eighties, 410 Bofors guns had cost India $1.4 billion. In 2004-2005 or 2006, how much will the guns cost, allowing for cost escalation, and changes in labour, technology, value of the rupee vis a vis the dollar and profitability of the supplier? 																					But surely the fear of scandal does not mean that no decision is taken? Especially, considering the defence-preparedness of a country of Indias size and diversity. 																					There were murmurs when India chose the Jaguar for its air force in the Seventies, and later when the Mirage 2000 entered the squadron service. Questions were also raised when the Airbus 320 was selected over the Boeing 757. And today there is media debate on whether to buy the Admiral Gorshkov from the Russians. 																					Bad blood																					If the Bofors gun is the front-runner this time, not the least for being time-tested, it could bring to life the old controversy. But allegations will be levelled even if any of the other guns are chosen. Especially if the deal is clinched by Israel, one can be sure of loud protests. It will not matter that the Israeli guns are produced as required, are efficient, that Slovenia, Cameroon and Botswana have used them and have certified to its various parameters.																					Given the controversy and the muck-raking that is inevitable to follow any defence deal made by any government in India, which civil servant will consider sticking out his head to strike the deal? Which army officer will testify to the guns usefulness or point to their futility? And which defence minister will be brave enough to stand up to allegations of kickbacks? And which prime minister will plead his and his governments innocence amidst the din of accusations?

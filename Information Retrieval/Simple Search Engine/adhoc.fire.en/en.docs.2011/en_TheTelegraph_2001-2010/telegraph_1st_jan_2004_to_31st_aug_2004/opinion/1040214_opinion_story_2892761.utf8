The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 							 																						NINE YARDS OF CLOTH The role of the  sari as a cultural marker is deeply  ambiguous. It can signify both  conservatism and  rebellion What does the sari represent,  woman power or culture power? When Ms Sharuna Sagar took  to wearing a sari  with clearance from her boss of course   for the evening edition of the news on the BBC Midlands  channel, she was undoubtedly thinking of culture power.  Born in Nottingham of parents who had emigrated from Hyderabad,  the elegance of the sari was a discovery for Ms Sagar when  she visited India for a holiday. She was amazed that the  sari-clad newsreader on television lost none of her authority  and no one batted an eyelid. Such navete is hardly unexpected  in one who is, to all intents and purposes, a Westerner  in spite of her Indian origins. In a country where the sari  is both formal and informal wear, and has been so for generations,  nobody is likely to bat an eyelid. But for Ms Sagar, to  wear a sari while reading the news is to do her bit for  Indian culture. Hardcore defenders of Indian culture, a  concept that in itself is deeply anomalous, may bridle at  this easy smugness. After all, for Ms Sagar, this is just  a glamorous costume legitimized by her origins, which additionally  has the incomparable virtue of exotic difference.																														But clothes seldom end with the hem, or at the edge of nine yards, as in the sari. Ms Sagars bit for Indian culture unknowingly contains in it histories of regional diversity and identity politics, designer teleology and symbolic forms of rebellion. Ms Sagar herself admits rejecting the sari when she was young; with her it was clearly a question of adopting the codes of the land she knew as her own. But recent generations of Indian women for whom the sari was the natural, at one time the only, apparel, have had a far more troubled relationship with it. On one level, it could be made to signify confinement within the home and an effort to underplay the beauty and individuality of the womans body. But even without considering this quasi-symbolic dimension, many women who started going out to work began to find the sari impractical. Rebellion against convention and the demands of convenience together have gradually changed the place of the sari in India too. It is no longer the only wear, even in regions where there was no alternative a generation ago. This is an ongoing drama. Although the sari is the national formal wear for women, schoolteachers in West Bengal are fighting hard for the right to wear the salwar-kameez in their workplace even as designers experiment with ingenious new ways of displaying the sari ensemble. If Ms Sagars donning of the sari on the BBC channel symbolizes the diversity that Britain professedly celebrates  given the bulk of its Asian voters  the sari is part of a very different kind of diversity that the Indian woman is claiming as her own.																														Apparel as a cultural marker becomes more troublesome when the culture denoted is specifically religious. The hijab has pushed France to a peculiar dilemma between secularism and democracy. The issue there too is culture, and the limits of assimilation. As the Sikhs cry out in pre-emptive protest, Ms Sagar might consider herself lucky that the sari is, as yet, blissfully free of the celestial touch.

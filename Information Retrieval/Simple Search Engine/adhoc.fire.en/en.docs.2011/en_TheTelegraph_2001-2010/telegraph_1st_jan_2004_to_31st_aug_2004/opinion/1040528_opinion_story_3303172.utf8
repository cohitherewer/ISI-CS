		 Friday, May 28, 2004 							 																						BRIGHT CITY, BRIGHTER LIGHTS																														F.S. Aijazuddins LAHORE: ILLUSTRATED VIEWS OF THE 19TH CENTURY (Mapin, Rs 1,500) attests, above all, to the obsession of the Lahori with his own city. Without this, the tenacity of a mountaineer alone would not have sustained the search for an exhaustive compilation of mostly forgotten and little-known water-colours, drawings, engravings and lithographs from British and private collections. This watercolour, by William Simpson, of the marble sarcophagus of Jehangir, with his sun-umbrella against the plinth, is among the more famous ones. Aijazuddin writes, He was not the first western tourist to show such disrespect, and goes on to recall an East India Company chaplains observations about how sahiblogs would never take off their boots in such places. Details such as this enliven the recounting of the history of the city through the artwork of the period, which is, without doubt, diligently collected.

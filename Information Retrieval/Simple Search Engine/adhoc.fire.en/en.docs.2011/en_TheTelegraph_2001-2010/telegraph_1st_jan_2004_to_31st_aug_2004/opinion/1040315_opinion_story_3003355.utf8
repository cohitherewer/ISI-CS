The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, March 15, 2004 							 																						ARM TWISTING																														Obduracy is the last thing a successful politician needs in his arsenal of tactics. But Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, the minister for human resource development, seems to be under the delusion that obduracy is a virtue. He has got himself and the bureaucrats in his ministry into a completely unnecessary confrontation with the Indian Institutes of Management. These institutes, together with the various institutes of technology, are the most successful and competent of Indias institutions of higher learning. There is no denying that these institutes have an elitist bias, but so do all business schools and institutes of technology across the world. Elitism is embedded in their very definition. But this is an elitism of merit and not of birth. Mr Joshi harbours the belief that since the government funds the IIMs, it has the right to interfere and meddle in their day-to-day running. The HRD ministry, under the guidance and approval of Mr Joshi, has decided to bring down the fees of the IIMs. 																														There is nothing in the spirit and the letter of the charter that quite justifies this kind of interference. The fees that students should be charged have always been left to the discretion of the institutes. Even in the heyday of socialism in India, and when education was under the aegis of Nurul Hasan, never did the HRD ministry (or the education ministry as it was then) stoop to the level of dictating the fee structure of the IIMs. For Mr Joshi, this confrontation is nothing more than a show of power. This is proved by the kind of language that the government nominee on the board of IIM Ahmedabad used to make the board toe the government line. What he said was tantamount to a threat, the language of mafia dons and not that of polite society. Those who run IIM Ahmedabad, to their eternal credit, refused to be browbeaten by such deplorable behaviour. It is to be hoped that the other IIMs will follow the Ahmedabad example. Mr Joshi has done himself a serious disservice. In one stroke, he has alienated a body of people who are important as opinion-makers in India. His words and deeds have opened up a yawning contradiction within the BJP. The latter is pro-reform and is therefore, by definition, against an expansion in the role and power of the state. But Mr Joshi has shown himself to be a meddlesome  some would even say, vindictive  minister. His attitude is indefensible because it is totally out of tune with the spirit of the times.

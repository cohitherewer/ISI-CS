The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 21, 2004 							 																						TO TANGO THE READERTHIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT SINGH				 	 Early risers of Tawang																					Who would believe that a book on the proper use or abuse of punctuation marks like commas, colons, semi-colons, apostrophes, hyphens, question marks, exclamation marks, italics, full-stops and so on would be of any interest except for proof-readers of texts? Eats, Shoots amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation by Lynne Truss is just that and yet about the most instructive and amusing book I have read in a long time. Its interest is not limited to grammarians, sticklers of literary norms or proof readers. It is meant for all who love the English language.																					Not many people realize that a punctuation mark placed in the wrong place, or wrongly inserted in a sentence, can totally alter its meaning. A good example is the title of the book based on the dietary habits of pandas who live on bamboo shoots and leaves. If you insert a comma between eats and shoots, the sentence will imply that a panda eats, fires a gun and departs. 																					Similarly, writing about the execution of King Charles I of England, a child wrote, Charles the First walked and talked half an hour after his head was cut off. It makes no sense till you insert a full-stop after walked and talked to read, Charles the First walked and talked. Half an hour later his head was cut off.																					Oriental languages like Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, as well as those that evolved out of them, were blissfully unaware of the importance of punctuation. For centuries, it remained a matter of concern only to languages of Latin origin. Punctuation marks are the traffic signals of language: they tell us to slow down, notice this, take a detour and stop, writes Truss. 																					Thomas McCormack gives it musical overtones: to tango the reader into pauses, inflections, continuities and connections that the spoken line would convey. For example, take the commonest punctuation mark, the comma. Some writers, notably Shakespeare, used it with great abandon, others considered it dispensable. It has been compared to the claws of a feline: A cat has claws at the end of its paws,/ A commas a pause at the end of a clause.																					The Czech novelist, Milan Kundera, was very fussy about punctuation marks. He fired his old-time publisher who insisted on replacing a semi-colon with a full-stop.																					Another example where the absence of a comma could be a matter of life or death is the sentence, The convict said the judge is mad. Without a comma it would appear that it is the convict who thinks the judge is mad. Now place a comma after convict and another after judge and see, it is exactly the opposite: The convict, said the judge, is mad.																					Did you know that the question mark was not known till the 15th century? It was invented by an Italian, Aldus Manutivus (1450-1515). Nobody knows how he decided to give it the shape it has today. It was unknown to the classicists, Greek or Sanskrit. None of sacred texts  the Vedas, Upanishads, Gita or Granth Sahib have question marks even after sentences posing questions.																					With the growing use of e-mail and internet, we have the resurrection of what once was popular as a childrens word game in which a letter of the alphabet stood for the word it sounded like. A familiar example was inviting a lady for a cup of chai: BBG,T POG. To which the Bibiji replied, No thanks, P K IE G.																					Truss quotes another: I saw Jim  he looked gr8  have you seen him  what time is the thing  C U there 2 morrow. Or the verbal shorthand C U B48. Can you work this out?																					A friend has the following message painted on the door of the bathroom to guide guests whose bladders are bursting: For U 2P.																					With such examples culled from Lynne Truss, I trust you will C why her book is worth buying. Dear reader, C U next week.																					Eccentric English																					I have an uneasy feeling I have come across this piece earlier in some journal. But Vipin Buckshey of the Visual Arts Centre of Delhi has sent it to me and it makes very amusing reading about the vagaries of the English language:																					We will begin with a box, and the plural is boxes; but the plural of ox became oxen not oxes. One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, yet the plural of moose should never be meese. You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice; yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.																					If the plural of man is always called men, why shouldnt the plural of pan be called pen? If I spoke of my foot and show you my feet, and I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, why shouldnt the plural of booth be called beeth?																					Then one may be that, and three would be those, yet hat in the plural would never be hose, and the plural of cat is cats, not cose. We speak of a brother and also of brethren, but though we say mother, we never say methren. Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, but imagine the feminine she, shis and shim. (shimwhat a beautiful mistake!) Lets face it, English is a crazy language.																					There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins werent invented in England. We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.																					And why is it that writers write but fingers dont fing, grocers dont groce and hammers dont ham?																					Doesnt it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it? If teachers taught, why didnt preachers praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If Dad is Pop, how come Mom isnt Mop?																					Sometimes I think all the folks who grew up speaking English should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what other language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?																					We have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm goes off by going on.																					Timely mistake																					When my friend and I paid a visit to the monastery of Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, the elderly monk at the information desk handed us a pamphlet. Glancing at it, my friends mouth dropped open in surprise. This must be a mistake! he exclaimed. It says the monks rise each morning at 3 am.																					The monk at the desk smiled. Its definitely a mistake, he said. But its true.																					(Contributed by Reeten Ganguly, Tezpur)

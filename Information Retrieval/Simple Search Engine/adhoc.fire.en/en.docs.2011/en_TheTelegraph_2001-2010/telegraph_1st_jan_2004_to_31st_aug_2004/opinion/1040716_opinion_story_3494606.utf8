				 																																																																														a is no stranger to the rewriting of textbooks. One doesnt know whether previous instances of rewriting were accompanied by the kind of nationwide discussion taking place in India today. But a very recent attempt was discussed widely in the Chinese media.				 																																													Last October, the Chinese astronaut, Yang Liwei, tried in vain to catch a glimpse of the Great Wall from his Shenzhou V capsule during the 21 hours he spent in space. On his return he admitted, The Earth looked very beautiful from space, but I did not see our Great Wall.				 																																													This admission was in itself courageous, because millions of Chinese have grown up with the knowledge that their own wonder of the world was one of the two man-made structures visible to the naked eye from earths orbit in space. Its hard to trace the origin of this belief, but at least for the past decade, school textbooks in China have been carrying this patriotic fact. The average Chinese probably felt as let down by Yangs candid revelation as Yang himself must have felt when he failed to see the ancient site.				 																																													But no one in China doubted Yang, nor was any attempt made to blame anyone. The authorities immediately ordered that the falsehood be deleted from school textbooks. Its inclusion in them was probably the reason the misconception had become so widespread, they said.				 																																													However, some Chinese experts argued that weather conditions might have prevented Yang from seeing the Wall. Chinese astronauts should be specially trained to spot it, they said. Others suggested lighting up the Wall at night. One senior official felt this fairy-tale could be allowed to remain in textbooks, as its intention was to make students proud of their motherland.				 																																													But the governments decision did not change.				 																																													This is just one in a series of purges carried out in Chinese textbooks. The first took place after the 1949 revolution, when history, politics, even literature, was rewritten from the politically correct perspective. Confucius was out, class struggle in; peasants and workers replaced scholars as role models; the United States of America was the enemy.				 																																													Primary school students no longer study politics. Peasants and workers continue to be cast in the heroic mould, but only as characters in textbook stories, far removed from the reality where workers get laid off or slog in sweat shops, peasants grow poorer and migrate to the city for work.				 																																													Soon, even these stories may be rewritten. In todays China, heroism is considered more of a risk than a virtue. Apparently, inspired by the real-life stories of courageous youth who risked their lives to save others children have been seriously injured or have even died trying to emulate these role models. In these days of only one child per (urban) family, the authorities have decided to teach other virtues, all of which can be summed up in the pragmatic motto: Discretion is the better part of valour.				 																																													A far cry from the Great Teachers seemingly immortal aphorisms: Forget self, serve the people ; Dare to struggle, dare to win. But then, could anything be more apt for a market economy, integrated with the global village?

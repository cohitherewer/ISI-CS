		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 							 																						MAOIST MYTHS																														A spectre is haunting many parts of India in these times of the elections  the spectre of Maoism. It is no coincidence, though, that the Maoist threat should loom so large at the time of the worlds biggest democratic exercise. For those who still swear by Mao Zedongs dictum that power flows from the barrel of a gun, the massive electoral process is a huge rejection of their violent creed. Hence their desperate attempts to strike at the process and threaten democracy from within. Curiously, outfits like the Peoples War of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and the Maoist Communist Centre have thrived because democracy allows dissent. Although they cannot hope to halt the march of Indian democracy, their hit-and-run violence is a cynical ploy to try and terrorize people out of the process. It is the states constitutional obligation to defeat this subversive game and enable the voter to exercise his franchise without fear. But as the administration prepares to save democracy from this anarchist threat, it is also necessary to bust the Maoist myths. If the spectre of Maoism is spreading to new areas and more states, it is largely because it feeds on these myths. 																														The biggest Maoist myth is that the elections are a futile exercise as far as the common people are concerned. The truth is exactly the opposite. The vote is the only power that the people have against the powerful. It is the only weapon of the powerless to try and change their lot. And the elections are the only time they can hope to exercise this power. At other times, the people have little option but to suffer the injustices done to them by an insensitive politician or government. For all the caricatures, the picture of the politician greeting the voter with folded hands symbolizes the peoples power. The problem is that this symbolism is often lost in caricature. Cynicism about money or muscle power in the elections often leads to an unthinking devaluation of the democratic process. It would be unrealistic to deny the weaknesses of the electoral system or to ignore the need to reform it. In fact, there is much in the electoral system that cries out to be reformed to inspire greater public faith in it. But a violent subversion of the system cannot be the remedy for its ills. It is one thing to trap a politician or a policeman in a killing field, but quite another to change a system. History is replete with examples to show that violent ways change little, but unleash more violence. The vote, on the contrary, is an effective tool for change. The Indian voter has called the Maoists bluff before and will hopefully do it this time too.

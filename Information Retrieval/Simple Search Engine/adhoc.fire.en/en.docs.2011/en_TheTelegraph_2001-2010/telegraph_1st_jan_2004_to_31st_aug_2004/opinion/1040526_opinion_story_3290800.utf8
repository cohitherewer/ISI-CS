		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 							 																						WATER BEFORE POLIO																														Control over natural resources is a form of empowerment. In the under-developed villages of India, the awareness of this often gives rise to specific forms of political protest. Hence, there is a pathetic political logic behind the inhabitants of Hetkahan in West Bengals Purulia district boycotting the governments pulse polio programme to protest against the lack of drinking-water facilities in their hamlet. The villagers here have very clearly stated their priorities. Immunizing their children against polio is less important, or a less immediate concern than the one over having to walk over a kilometre to get drinking water from a well outside the village. Their pleas to the local administration to get a tubewell sunk in the village have been ignored so far. Saying no to the pulse polio programme is therefore a form of political action  the villagers way of expressing their sense of entitlement. This is not the first time that this is happening in Bengals villages. In February and April, two rural communities had boycotted the polio programme to protest against the lack of development in their villages.																														Water has been a crucial election issue this year in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In all these states, villagers, and particularly Dalits and adivasis, have had a large role to play in keeping the issue alive. Depletion of groundwater because of unthinking development, bad river management, corporate exploitation of rural water resources exists everywhere in India. Administrative callousness, corruption and greed are largely responsible for this, together with brutal inequality and disempowerment. The best-known example of this is the contamination of drinking water by arsenic in West Bengal, and the inhuman lack of political will shown by the government in tackling this. However, states like Kerala have managed to create forms of self-government in the villages, where local panchayat bodies have wielded considerable power in motivating the right kind of water management for their villages. This has given rise to a new kind of environmental activism, much of which is not as self-destructive as what the people of Hetkahan have had to resort to. The government must take this gesture seriously and act on what it is trying to communicate.

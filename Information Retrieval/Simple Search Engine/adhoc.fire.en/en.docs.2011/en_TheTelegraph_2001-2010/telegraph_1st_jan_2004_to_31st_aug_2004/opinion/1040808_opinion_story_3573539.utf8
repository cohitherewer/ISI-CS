 							 - Bangalore has some 11 shakhas for software prosWary of being branded an old-fashioned outfit, the RSS is going for an image change. And though khaki shorts are not yet pass, Bermudas are welcome. Bishakha De Sarkar reportsIn Keshav Kunj  the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs sprawling but spartan complex in the heart of New Delhi  the search for the Real McCoy can be confusing. Is it the man who is manning the one-room reception  the frail old gent in a yellowing vest and trousers, who stares at the buttons of a cordless telephone with what seems like a childlike incredulity? Or is it the young pracharak who sits in his office, next to a humming computer, effortlessly articulating the RSSs programme in English? Will the real RSS stand up please?																														It would  if it only knew the answer. For the RSS is caught in a bind, trying to run with  and against  time. Nearly eight decades after its birth, it is in the process of reasserting its ground, while it simultaneously looks around for new directions.																														The RSS has a two-pronged programme in sight. On the one hand, it seeks to push its straying political affiliate, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), towards the path of tradition that the RSS feels the BJP has been forsaking for political survival. On the other hand, the RSS is also taking pains to ensure that it is not branded an old-fashioned outfit that has long served its purpose.																														We have to move on, says a senior RSS member. Lets learn from the death of the Hindu Mahasabha, he says.																														The RSSs dilemma is being heatedly discussed now that the Chintan Baithak of the BJP  a four-day meeting that ended in Goa on Monday  has kick-started a debate. Immediately after the defeat of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre, the BJP had hinted that it was going back to its old plank of Hindutva. But at Goa, egged on by the moderates, the party decided it would focus on the issue of nationalism instead.																														Nationalism-cum-development is our mantra, says BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. Someone can call it Hindutva if they wish to, or anything else, he says.																														In some quarters, this is being seen as a victory for the moderates in the BJP, and a defeat for the RSS-backed hardliners. But not many in the RSS believe that Hindutva is really being shelved. Hindutva is not a political philosophy, argues Seshadri Chari, the former editor of the RSS-organ, the Organiser  who is now on deputation to the BJP. It is an umbrella term signifying the ethos followed by our society.																														In the final analysis, Hindutva may or may not be on the backburner, but the RSS seeks to stress that its concerns  often voiced when the BJP ruled at the Centre  figured prominently at the baithak. Its no secret that for the last six years or so, there have been conflicts  not of interest, but at the ideological level  between the parivar organisations, says RSS spokesman Ram Madhav.																														There is a growing feeling in the RSS that while the outfit has been sticking to its principles, affiliated organisations such as the BJP have been veering away from them. Power has a corrupting influence, says an RSS leader. We had once thought that our own men were incorruptible, he says.																														In fact, at a meeting in Nagpur  the RSS headquarters  held in the aftermath of the BJPs defeat at the Centre, senior RSS leaders even suggested that the BJP was defeated because it had moved away from its moorings.																														There have been several meetings between the BJP and the RSS after the NDA defeat as well. Late last month, the two senior-most leaders of the BJP  L. K. Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee  dropped in at the RSS office in Keshav Kunj for a 180-minute-long meeting.																														In the discussions, the RSS raised three issues of concern  ideology, organisational strength and conduct  areas that it felt the BJP was ignoring. It conveyed to the BJP that RSS cadres had complaints about the BJP leaders increasing inaccessibility. Advaniji has himself said that there is a perception that the BJP is changing, says Madhav. But politics is all about perceptions, not about reality. If this is the perception, we need to correct it, he says.																														The RSS won the round. The very first issue in the BJPs 10-point conclusions adopted in Goa refers to each of the three areas that the RSS had expressed concern over. The BJP resolution says it aims at strengthening and further expanding the party with focus on ideological orientation and renewed emphasis on work culture, individual conduct and organisational discipline.																														It has also been decided that RSS men will be given a prominent position in the BJP in the near future. Already, at least 60 RSS full-timers hold high positions in the party.																														The RSS has insisted that the BJP be in regular communication with other members of the Sangh parivar. Former minister Arun Jaitley has been in direct touch with the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, which the RSS believes, has helped soothe ruffled feathers in the anti-reform Manch.																														Tightening its control over the BJP is one of the battles the RSS is focussing on. But while the conflict with sections of the party goes through its see-saw motions, the RSS is also seriously trying to increase its own base.																														Though the RSSs rollbooks show an increase in the number of shakhas  up from 30,000 in 1995 to 49,300 now  Madhav stresses that efforts are on to attract the young who have in recent times steered away from it. The youth has no time for any extra activity, says Madhav. What he leaves unsaid is the growing view in the RSS that the educated youth is not greatly drawn to the image of a lathi-wielding, khaki shorts-clad shakha regular.																														Can you imagine asking doctors and engineers to do exercises in shorts while wielding lathis? a senior RSS member scoffs. When I go to a shakha, I go in my normal clothes, he says.																														Clearly, the khaki shorts  a pair of half-pants that has symbolised the RSS from its very start  are in trouble. Soon after the RSS had a meeting of functionaries at Nagpur last month, there was a report that said the RSS, in a bid to increase its base, was planning to allow members at a shakha to don T-shirts and jeans, instead of the mandatory half-pants. Last week, the RSS clarified that jeans were still not on the agenda. Anybody who wanted to attend a shakha  as RSS gatherings are known  would still have to come in shorts.																														But everybody wears shorts these days, argues Ram Madhav. And anyway, we have men who come in Bermudas  and those are in fashion, he says.																														But the RSS has already been introducing changes to lead more people into its folds. Chari recalls that decades ago, as the RSS focussed its attention on workers, shakhas in Mumbais mill areas were held a little after midnight instead of in the mornings to ensure the participation of workers getting off night shifts.

Bangalore, for instance, has 11 shakhas just for RSS-supporters in the software industry. These shakhas are for discussions and power-point presentations, says Madhav. We are trying to restructure our activity, he says.																														But RSS leaders realise that the youth  caught between high-pressured jobs and a lack of interest in politics  have little time for something as anachronistic as a shakha. What is worrying is the increasing urbanisation of the youth, says a pracharak. The youth is drawn to a new cultural lifestyle which is alien to our tradition, he says.																														One of the ways of getting the young into the RSS is by becoming more visible. The RSS, for long years a shadowy presence in the wings of political activity, is now not just going to be busy  but seen to be busy as well. In the coming summer, the RSS will start a year-long celebration to mark the centenary of founder M.S. Golwalkar. Members of the RSSs womens wing, the Rashtriya Swayamsevika Samiti, will hold a meeting in Kanyakumari next month. And in October, RSS supporters from tribal areas will gather in Delhi for a five-day-long meeting.																														But the most significant of all meetings will be held in November, when the RSSs national executive gathers in Haridwar. Madhav stresses that several important issues  including whether or not its experiment of starting a political outfit has been successful  will be discussed in Haridwar.																														This will be a very crucial meeting, says Madhav. We will have to decide whether power politics have helped us  or harmed us, he says.

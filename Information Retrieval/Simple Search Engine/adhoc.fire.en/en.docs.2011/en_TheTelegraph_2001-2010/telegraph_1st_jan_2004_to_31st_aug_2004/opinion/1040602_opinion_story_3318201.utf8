		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 							 																						LAND, ROCKS AND ARTShobita Punja																					Nothing can quite prepare one for the surreal landscape of Hampi. The village is situated on the southern bank of the Tungabhadra river, in the Bellary district of Karnataka. It was the capital of the Vijayanagara kingdom from the mid-14th century to the mid-16th century. As one enters the site, great mountains of granite rock burst out of the earth and gargantuan boulders stand precariously on one another  as if frozen in the act of tumbling for centuries. 																					From this topsy-turvy landscape the organic forms of the temples and palaces can barely be discerned, they play hide-and-seek behind the boulders, sometimes eclipsed by low hills from which the buildings appear to grow. It is here that one witnesses a moment of perfect synthesis  of buildings and landscape, the rock and the carving. The scale of Hampi is enormous and the landscape of rolling rocks, boulders and the heritage site spreads over 25 square kilometres.																					Even in its heyday, when the temples were brightly painted with mineral colours, the magic of the boulders and the emerging buildings  made of the same material, in many cases in situ  must have created a vision of a world in harmony with its surroundings. Today the paint has gone and the hand of nature and that of the artist-architect blend in an artistic mirage.																					Before the powerful Vijayanagara kings chose it as their capital, Hampi was steeped in myth and legend. Even today, the local boys will tell one quite convincingly, showing an exact point on the ground or tank or hill, that this is where the gods descended to marry, to bathe or to meditate.																					Hampi is also linked with the Ramayana. When Ram and his brother went in search of Sita, it is believed that, at various locations in the region, Ram encountered Sugriva, the monkey king, and the much-loved Hanuman, who became his faithful ally, and finally found Sita in captivity in Lanka. The neighbouring town of Anegondi is reputed to be the birthplace of Hanuman or Anjaneya, the Malyavanta hill marks the place where Ram and Lakshman stayed, and therefore is crowned by the large Raghunatha Temple.																					This mythical landscape is captivating, for it speaks of an Indian ability (though sometimes dangerous) to create a microcosm out of the wider universe. So a little hillock called Hemakunta refers to the high Himalayas many miles away, and the entire story of one episode of the myth of Shiva is enacted here on a diminutive scale. The Hemakunta hill leads to the great and grand Virupaksha temple where each year the marriage of Shiva and the local goddess, Pampa, is conducted in the very same way as it is done for a human wedding, following the ancient Vedic rites in every detail. In fact, the whole landscape in and around Hampi is strewn with local legends where many different communities perform rituals, for this to them is a sacred landscape from time immemorial.																					Little traditions																					Local legends do have validity and enable us to understand the living significance of a site. While royal temples, palaces and audience halls lie broken and ruined, the passage of time does not seem to erase the mythological significance of a site, and that part outlives the rest by far.																					The dangerous side of this frail line between myth and history or fact and legend is that the two have, for political reasons, been mixed and often confused. In 1992, when Hindu fanatics broke down the historic Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, they did so in the belief that it stood on the very place where the legendary Ram had been born, and politicians claimed that the myth was a historical fact.																					However, in the field of heritage conservation, the very demarcation of the World Heritage Site is inappropriate at Hampi. The UNESCO declaration of what constitutes the site for protection encompasses merely the heritage buildings and known historic structures rather than the whole living fabric of this strange and mythical landscape, where every rock is chiselled with mythical meaning for some nearby community. A heritage site needs to embrace high art and the little traditions that still give soul and meaning to the place, long after its historic significance has disappeared.

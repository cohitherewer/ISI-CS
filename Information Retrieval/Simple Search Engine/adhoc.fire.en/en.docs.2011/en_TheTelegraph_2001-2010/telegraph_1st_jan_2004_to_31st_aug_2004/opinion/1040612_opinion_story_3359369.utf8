The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 12, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Games they play				 																																																				Sir  The picture of Govinda and Naveen Jindal on page 6 of The Telegraph encapsulates the new political culture in India. Here are two young legislators, successful in their own fields, taken up completely with their hi-tech acquisitions. Inside parliament, they will, in all probability, continue to be occupied with their gadgets, may be even play games on it. The debate will not bother them, nor the people for whom they are staged. For they are, after all, self-engrossed people who are there in the house for their own reasons  one to diversify his acting career, another to reap the benefits for his industry.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,J. Acharya, Calcutta
				 																Hunger trail				 																																																				Sir  The wave of farmer suicides sweeping Andhra Pradesh is one indication of the unbridgeable gap between the rich and poor in society (Bottomless graves dug with debt, June 8). The spate of suicides in such a short span is unprecedented even in the history of Andhra Pradesh, which, incidentally boasts of being the hub of the information technology industry in the country. The shocking regularity with which the news of suicides has flowed in best illustrates all that is wrong with a system that has marginalized the poor while heaping favours on the elite. Nothing has been done to reduce the rural-urban divide, and the agricultural sector continues to be the most neglected and ignored. Lack of state investment in irrigation has forced the peasants to take their lives. The previous government had failed to intervene in agricultural markets to stabilize them. Even after the new government has assumed office, the suicides continue. The trend proves that farmers are not sure that their condition will improve. The new government should realize that announcing debt-relief packages and conducting public campaigns are not enough. The government should organize psychological support for the debt-burdened farmers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  This is not the country we dreamt of. When hundreds of farmers are compelled to kill themselves every day, thousands of others are facing starvation, we cannot put the blame for this tragic situation on any particular government (Mobile is at hand, food is not, June 7). When N. Chandrababu Naidu was in the chief ministers chair, he was accused of engaging himself only with the development of greater Hyderabad, leaving the rest of Andhra and Telengana untouched. The mood was quickly cashed in on by the Congress, which has returned, bringing with it populist gifts for farmers  free electricity, waiver of debts, and compensation packages for each family whose members killed themselves during the previous regime. Yet, even after the takeover by the new government, the deaths have not ceased. Why? Probably because the administration, new or old, is incapable of understanding the distress and agony of the poor. Since those who head the administration belong to the high or middle classes of society, the welfare measures they initiate are largely restricted to their own classes. They do not percolate down. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  The reason why farmers in Andhra Pradesh continue to kill themselves is because their misery couldnt have ceased within days of the new government taking over. Then why the series on suicides by Sujan Dutta? An investigation could have been undertaken only after some time had elapsed during which the Congress would have had the chance of redressing some of the grievances. Had it been found wanting in its attention to the plight of farmers or agriculture on the whole, the government could have been hauled over coals. But it is too early now. And there is little need to bother the hungry to recount their sorrows for readers. There has already been an overdose of such hunger stories prior to the elections.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterjee, Calcutta

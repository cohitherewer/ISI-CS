The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 							 																						OF JOBS AND JOBLESSNESS Kalyan Sanyal shows how the unemployed  and underemployed surplus workforce have no place in the modern  states vision of the economy The author is professor of economics,  University of Calcutta				 	 A condition of existence																								Fifty lakh applications for twenty thousand posts of gangmen. The required qualification was the eighth grade in high school, but the applicants included a large number of engineers and MBAs. The outcome: a bloody job-war waged by the sons of the soil against migrant labourers in Assam and Maharashtra.																								Politicians in power, South Block mandarins and the neo-liberal ideologues are sparing no pains to paint a rosy picture of the Indian economy. With a rate of growth expected to exceed 6.5 per cent, an overflowing foreign exchange reserve, a vibrant capital market and the granary bursting at the seams  everything, we are told, is working out in the right direction. And the media are routinely announcing Indias awakening.																								The disturbing question of what is perhaps the most important indicator of an economys health, employment, is getting lost in the noise. The employment scenario, to say the least, is black, and what has happened in Assam is only the tip of the iceberg. One certainly would share Pratap Bhanu Mehtas concern in his piece in The Telegraph (A problem not named, December 17).																								For any observer of the current economic scene, it is difficult to resist the temptation of presenting the right solution to the employment problem and pitting it against the wrong ones prescribed by others. It might however be interesting, and perhaps in a sense more meaningful, to stay away from the business of peddling solutions and explore the question from another perspective: one that focusses on the changing rhetoric of the Indian state on the employment issue. Because the unemployment problem, and the state policies designed with the aim of coping with it, is rooted in a broader vision of development and its accompanying technology of economic, political and social control.																								Numbers hardly capture the agony and suffering of those without a livelihood; yet to begin with, let us confront a few numbers. In May 2002, the report of the special group chaired by S.P. Gupta, a member of the Planning Commission, on the employment opportunity for the tenth plan period, was published. The report highlights the fact that employment growth in the Indian economy fell from 2.7 per cent per year in 1993-94 to 1.07 per cent in 1999-2000, despite an acceleration in the gross domestic product growth from 5.2 to 6.7 per cent over the same period, revealing a sharp fall in the employment content of the output. More important, the report reveals that the organized/formal sectors employment generating capacity came down to near zero (for the public sector, it has been negative) while in contrast the unorganized/informal sectors labour absorption capacity has been much higher. In 1999-2000, the formal sector contributed a mere 8 per cent to the total employment, whereas 92 per cent of the jobs were created in the informal sector.																								In designing the future strategy, the report emphatically states that to generate adequate employment opportunities, there is no option other than to rejuvenate the growth of the unorganized sector[which] needs to be made more productive to sustain itself against domestic and international competition.																								A quick trip down the memory lane. The draft outline of the third five-year plan published by the Planning Commission in 1961, dwelling upon the question of employment, stated: Sustained programmesfor an expansion of modern industries will be the only solution to the problem of unemployment; and in the transitional period it is necessary to promote labour intensive methods of production to the fullest extent so long as this does not lead to a smaller aggregate production in the economy.																								By contrasting the recommendations of the Gupta Commission with the strategy announced by the architects of the third plan, one finds that the employment perspective of the Indian policy-makers at the state level surely has undergone a profound change. The current perception of the employment problem and its solution is radically different from what it was for the early planners.																								In what the third plan outline said, the phrases, expansion of modern industries and in the transitional period, are important. They are embedded in a notion of development that sees economic development as an all-encompassing process of transformation that ultimately brings the entire economy within the fold of the modern sector. The continued existence of the non-modern, traditional, labour-intensive sector is only a transient phenomenon, an object of strategic manipulation by the planner to generate employment in the transitional period. It will ultimately wither away, dissolving into the expanding modern sector of the economy.																								In other words, the development imaginary underlying the early Indian plans was one of a big bang transformation of the economy from the traditional and backward to the modern and advanced. This notion of development saw the traditional sector as primitive and stagnant, incapable of independent growth, and posited development as a process that ultimately necessitates its elimination in the face the expansion of the growth-oriented modern sector.																								The traditional-modern binary that lay at the heart of the early planning practices was only a moment of the development trajectory. There was a single programme, a single goal posited for the entire economy, and on the employment front, the planning exercise was predicated on the assumption that the entire unemployed and underemployed surplus population would eventually find a place within the modern sector.																								A binary still marks the states vision of the economy, but now it is of a fundamentally different kind. It is the formal-informal or the organized-unorganized binary that informs the states discourse of development. But the current rhetoric of the state distances itself from the pre-globalization one by explicitly stating that the informal sector, far from being transitory, is going to be a permanent feature of the economy. It is an integral part of the development trajectory itself, a reservoir for the part of the potential workforce rendered surplus by the expansion of the formal sector.																								The formal sector is no longer the ultimate destination for the entire labour force. It will have its own growth dynamic driven by capital accumulation and technological advancement; and with its high-productivity, high-wage employment, will accommodate only a tiny fraction of the population. The rest of the labour force will have to eke out a living in the vast, low-productivity, low-wage informal sector. The informal sector is an economic space to be mapped, structured and monitored for the political management of the surplus population.																								In other words, for the early planner, the traditional sector was a remnant of the past waiting to be transformed by the development process; it could serve as a temporary source of employment in the transitional period. In the current perception, the informal sector is endogenous to the modernization process, a necessary supplement to the formal sector and its inescapable political condition of existence.																								Some might argue, some in fact do, that the informal sector will eventually be in a position to qualify as a formal sector. In course of time it will experience technological progress and productivity growth, and finally acquire the formal sector characteristics. The fallacy of this argument quickly becomes apparent if we consider the fact that the strategic deployment of the informal sector as an indispensable source of employment in the current discourse is predicated on the assumption that the formal sector, given the nature of its growth dynamic, is incapable of generating adequate employment opportunities to absorb the entire labour force. Now if the informal sector undergoes the transformation and turns formal, it will by definition cease to be a source of employment and the economy will be back to the very problem of surplus labour it started from.																								In the current Indian economy, the formal sector, with modern industries, high wages and high-quality jobs, exists as small, glittering islands. And these islands are surrounded by a vast sea of low-wage, low-quality employment  an informal economic space where the castaways of development are confined, development serving as the political and social condition of their existence.																								But then, the informal economy will also, and inevitably, encroach upon, unsettle and subvert the islands, and the state will have to use all the coercive instruments at its disposal to keep it at bay. Political management of poverty, after all, is not an easy task.																								The media, however, continue to inform us that the Indian economy is waking up. Waking up to what, one wonders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 09, 2004 							 																						IMPROVIDENT All those who thought that elections  were far away, must think again. The cabinet has gone into  election mode. Natural gas prices will not be hiked. Wages  for public sector employees will be increased. And most  hare-brained of all, there will be a social security scheme  for unorganized sector workers  at least, on a pilot basis.  Not reforming the rigid labour laws in the organized sector,  but extending the same rigidity to the unorganized sector,  has been the labour ministers pet thesis. While that legislation  is still awaited, and the parliamentary affairs minister  has promised one, there will temporarily be a pilot scheme.  The state where this experiment will be carried out is still  unknown. This will presumably be decided on the basis of  where the National Democratic Alliances electoral fortunes  are likely to be most favourably affected. The pilot proposal  is the following. There will be a flat pension of Rs 500  per month for all workers not covered by the Employees  Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, provided  the entry salary is less than Rs 6,500 per month. Pension  will be paid on retirement, disablement or to widows and  children in case of death. Personal accident insurance and  universal health insurance worth Rs 1 lakh for the individual  and the family can be purchased additionally.																								The pension will be financed through a contribution of Rs 50 from employees, Rs 100 from employers and 1.16 per cent of the national floor wage from the government. Coverage, compliance, registration, record-keeping and delivery will be through the Employees Provident Fund Organization. Does the government (Centre or state) have the resources to finance this scheme? What are the opportunity costs of these resources, spent elsewhere? Existing social security schemes only cover the organized sector and there is no denying that more than 350 million people, who work for the unorganized sector, also need coverage. However, delivery through EPFO and the government is the most inefficient of mechanisms, not to speak of problems of enforcement. All that is achieved is pre-emption of funds by the government through EPFO, conveniently used to finance revenue deficits. The essential principle of any pension reform is income flows that are no longer guaranteed, but vary, depending on the individuals appetite to face risk. The government finds this logic acceptable for new entrants to government service from January 1, 2004, but knocks out for the unorganized sector. Meanwhile, another inspector raj descends on employers, who may often be small. Mr Sahib Singh Varma has never been known for his economic sense. Given an election year, he will run riot.

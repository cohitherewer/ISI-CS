The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 							 																						MINIMUM ACCEPTANCE No matter how much the left struts and frets, it has no option but to continue supporting the UPA government, writes Ashis Chakrabarti				 	 More confrontation																														Awar of attrition is raging between the left and the Congress over the new governments policies. It was not unexpected, but has come sooner than expected. Every other day, one hears of the left crying halt to some decision of the United Progressive Alliance government or trying to force some agenda on it. The result is a confusing scenario in which one doesnt quite know if the left is more an adversary than a friend of the government it is supporting from outside. 																														One day it is the governments budget proposal to raise the ceiling on foreign direct investment in telecommunications, aviation and insurance sectors. Then it is the fight over the interest rate on the public provident fund. Another day, it is the hike in oil prices. There seems to be no end to the lefts problems with the policies of the new regime. 																														We thus have Sitaram Yechuri of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) threatening that the leftist watchdog may bite hard at the government if that becomes necessary, and A.B. Bardhan of the Communist Party of India prescribing what the prime minister should offer the country in his Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. In Calcutta, CPI(M) leaders warn the Congress not to take its support to the government for granted.																														At the same time, the left would not withdraw its support to the government, we are told, or do anything else to destabilize it. Yechuri says in an article in the party organ that the CPI(M) was never responsible for the fall of a government that it had supported. 																														But does the left really have a choice? For all its bluster, the left is as much a prisoner of its compulsion to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party at bay as the Congress is of the compulsions of coalition politics. Despite Yechuris claim to the contrary, the CPI(M) did withdraw its support to the Morarji Desai government in 1979 and paid for it by indirectly helping the return of Indira Gandhi to power in the elections a year later. It is unlikely that the CPI(M) would now do any such thing to facilitate the return of the BJP to power. 																														So we have a scenario in which the left stands to lose either way. It loses support among the common people if it fails to keep the UPA government on course. The government loses credibility, if not its stability, if the left continues to play the spoilsport for reformist policies. But the left stands to lose its new-found status in national politics if its obstructionist role destabilizes the government. 																														It could be interesting to compare the role the left is playing now to the one the BJP played in 1989 when it supported V.P. Singhs Janata Dal government from outside. The comparison shows that the lefts position as a collaborator of the government is politically worse than that of the BJP in 1989. 																														In 1989, the BJP supported the Janata Dal government not just to keep the Congress at bay, but primarily to prepare the ground for its own bid for power. The fall of that government led to the Congress reclaiming power once more in 1991. But to the BJP, it was only an interregnum; seven years later, the saffron parivar had its first taste of power at the Centre. 																														The left cannot hope to make any such gains from the fall of the UPA government. Not even a third front, headed by the left, can fill the vacuum. So, no matter how much the left struts and frets, it has no option but to support the UPA government. 																														It would be wrong to think that the newly-formed coordination committee between the left and the UPA is going to ease problems all that much. The committee may work as a platform for bargaining over the governments policies and programmes, but it is unlikely to keep the differences from popping up in public.																														That is because the left has a strategy to try and use the differences for its own political campaign. It will see them as an opportunity to put into practice the communist theory of unity and struggle. That it will do so is evident from CPI(M) leaders statement that they would follow a strategy of both co-ordination and confrontation with the UPA government. It is doubtful, though, whether the strategy will help the left as much as it will embarrass the government. 																														If all this looks confusing, it is largely because the left itself is pretty confused over how to keep the government on what it considers the right track. It is easy to say that the solution lies in the government implementing the common minimum programme. But matters may actually be far more complex.																														At the centre of the tussle is the lefts unclear attitude to economic reforms. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have his own compulsions for taking a more aggressive stance on reforms in West Bengal. But there still are enough members in the CPI(M)s central committee who remain unconvinced about the fruits of a truly liberalized economy. The battle over FDI in telecommunications, aviation and insurance is a reflection of the lefts lukewarm acceptance of a globalized economy. 																														It is true that the CMP talks of maintaining the pre-eminence of the state sector. But the Congress is no longer the party of Nehruvian socialism it once was, and it has embraced an open economy a lot more than the left would like. The decision on FDI in three sectors and on the privatization of Delhi and Mumbai airports is an indication of things to come. 																														Communist countries like China and Vietnam may have an insatiable hunger for FDI in all sectors of their economy. But Indian communists, like the hardliners in the sangh parivar, are still unsure of the virtues of all things foreign. 																														It is possible that even the left will slowly accept an increasing role for FDI in the economy and more reformist policies in general. But, until that happens, the lefts own confusions may queer the pitch for the UPA government. 																														So far, the Congress responses to left noises have been rather muted. It may be a matter of time before the Congress starts crying foul. There already are signs of some Congress ministers resenting the communists attempts to control the decisions. The friction can only get worse if the left continues to prick the government. 																														Many of the senior CPI(M) leaders would like the friction to be reduced. They are even prepared to accept larger doses of reforms than the CMP had envisaged. But then, the left as a whole remains as wary of reforms as ever. How much reform is acceptable may ultimately be a test more for the left than for the Congress.

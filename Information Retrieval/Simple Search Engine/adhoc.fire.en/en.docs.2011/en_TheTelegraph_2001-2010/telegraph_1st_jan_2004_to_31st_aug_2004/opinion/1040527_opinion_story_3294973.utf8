		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 							 																						AT LEAST THIS TIME, THE LEFT IS RIGHT The left is justified in staying out of the government because it did not have the peoples mandate to do otherwise, argues Ashis Chakrabarti				 	 Sitting out																														Well-wishers are not necessarily the best judges of mens actions. Most of those who have regretted the decision of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) not to join the Congress-led government at the Centre seem to wish the party well. That does not mean that they have got things about the party right. A closer look should actually convince them that the partys decision was correct in the circumstances in which it was taken. In fact, I think it would have been dishonest and politically incorrect for the party to decide otherwise. Here are my reasons for thinking so.																														First of all, the party had clearly maintained during the election campaign that it would work to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. It had not told the voters that it would join a government with the Congress in it. So, if the party had joined the Manmohan Singh government, it would have done something for which it had no mandate from the voter. I have no doubt that many who are now blaming the CPI(M) on this account would have called its decision to join such a government dishonest and a fraud on the peoples mandate. Those who now accuse the party of wanting to have power without responsibility, would have then charged it with defrauding the mandate for the sake of power. 																														Things were very different in 1996, when the left had fought the elections with the promise to try and form a third front government minus the Congress and the BJP. The people gave their verdict for such a government. So Jyoti Basu could call the CPI(M)s decision to stay away from the United Front government a historic blunder with plenty of justification. It was a different scenario this time. 																														It is amazing how, in a country where politicians do everything for power, the lefts rejection of power is seen not as a sacrifice, as in the case of Sonia Gandhi, but as another historic blunder. Obviously, different yardsticks are being applied to judge the actions of the new Gandhi and the left. This makes one suspect that for some people any stick is good enough to beat the left with. 																														True the CPI(M) had made common cause with the Congress in the elections. It had openly said that it would support the Congress candidate wherever it or any other left party is weak. In several states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, the left entered into seat adjustments with the Congress. But even in these states, the party had not told the people that it would join a government in Delhi in the company of the Congress and its allies. 																														And in the three states of West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, where the left picked up 54 of its 61 Lok Sabha seats, the Congress remained its principal enemy. How could the party go back on the mandate from these states and take a U-turn after the elections? 																														Curiously, it has been argued that the CPI(M)s decision to stay away from the government reflects its frog-in-the-well strategy. The party, it has been said, does not want to venture into the unknown and bigger world of India for fear of losing its bases in these states. 																														It is a hopelessly flawed argument which overlooks the fact that the CPI(M)s  or the lefts  importance in national politics derives directly from these bases. Without these bases intact, the CPI(M) would be seen in New Delhi as no more than a ginger group. For the party, therefore, any strategy that undermines its position in these bases must be rejected out of hand. 																														Besides, if the left joined the government, the entire opposition space would have been taken over by the BJP and its allies. It would have been suicidal for the left to allow the saffron parivar to have such a windfall. 																														Then there is the argument of stability. It has been said that the new government would be more stable with the left in it. Events since the elections seem to suggest quite the opposite. If the CPI(M)s demand for the scrapping of the disinvestment ministry upset the capital market the way it did, its presence in the government could have made the market jittery all the time. One capital market analyst on a popular television channel pointed to this fear when he spoke of his anxiety that the left and the Laloos of this world will roger the reforms. It is another matter that the analyst did not quite understand that the vote of 2004 was precisely against such idols of the marketplace. 																														In fact, quite the contrary may actually be true of the stability argument. The left outside could make the government more stable than the left inside. Such a scenario would make the left more responsible for the governments stability. A carping left inside the government would have been disastrous for both its stability and its policies. Besides, forces of destabilization would have made merry with the frictions within the government.																														How then does one justify the lefts preeminent role in not only putting together the government but also shaping its common minimum programme? 																														From the lefts point of view, this is exactly the kind of role it had promised to play during the election campaign  and got the voters mandate to play. Contrary to what our capital market analysts suggested, the left would fail to meet the peoples aspirations if it fails to influence the governments policies. 																														The argument, therefore, that the left has shirked its responsibility by staying away from the government is not valid. Its support to the government binds it inexorably to such a responsibility. Successes or failures, the left would be answerable for the governments actions. 																														Those who are disappointed at the lefts decision say that it had a better chance of influencing the governments decision from within. They obviously do not see the practical aspects of the question. The concept of the cabinets collective responsibility would have made it impossible for the left to oppose the governments policies from within. Even if its cries of dissent leave a jarring note on the government, such noises from within would have made things immensely more difficult both for the left and for the prime minister. 																														There is possibly some merit in the assumption that the left may not get such a large number of seats in the Lok Sabha ever again. It has taken the left more than half a century to increase its Lok Sabha tally from 16 in the first general elections in 1952 to 61 in 2004. It is important to reiterate that this tally has come mainly from the three states of left dominance. 																														But I do not agree that the left should have joined the government solely on the basis of its improved tally. Once again, my argument is that it notched up the numbers not by promising to join a Congress-led government, but by aiming to defeat the BJP and by offering to support a secular government that might include the Congress. One needs to go back once more to the politi- cal nature of the verdict in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura to expose the fallacy of the argument of numbers. It remains to be seen if the left can get this kind of numbers if it goes to the polls with a categorical commitment of joining a Congress-led government after the elections. At least in these elections, the left made no such commitment. 																														The biggest argument for the left joining the government has been that it would have given it a rare opportunity to show the country the big difference between the left and other parties. Upright and incorruptible leftist ministers, it has been said, would have been so different from the ministerial stereotypes from other parties. Their performances would have made the leftists known to the majority of Indians who have only vague ideas about what the comrades really stand for. So, here was another missed opportunity to spread the good word from the wonderlands of Bengal and Kerala. 																														But if the left has not grown in most parts of India in 50 years and more, it is due to the nature of politics in those areas. It is doubtful if the left in government could have substantially changed that. 																														All said, I think the left has done the right thing by staying out of the government because it did not have the peoples mandate to do so.

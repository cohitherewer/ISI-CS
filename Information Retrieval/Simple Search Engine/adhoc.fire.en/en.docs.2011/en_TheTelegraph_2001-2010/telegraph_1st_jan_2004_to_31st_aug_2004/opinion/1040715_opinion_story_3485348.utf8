		 Thursday, July 15, 2004  GOOD INTENTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH 
Higher plan allocations for the social sector in this years budget do not mean much. Unless delivery mechanisms are made more efficient, most of these funds will be plundered along the way, argues Abhirup Sarkar The author is professor of economics, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta All for the people The Union budget this year is supposed to signal long-term changes in economic policy. At least the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, intends it to be so. The finance minister, as a prelude to his budget speech, pointed out that the people have sought a change in the manner in which this country is run, a change in national priorities, and a change in the processes and focus of governance. He said that he wanted to make every effort to be true to that mandate. But why did the people give their mandate for a change? What was there before that needed to be changed?The earlier coalition kept its faith in the market. It tried to provide incentives, as much as it could, to private investors by reducing interest rates, taxes for strategic industries and bureaucratic hindrances to set up new ventures. It took the first shot at introducing flexible labour laws so that hire and fire by firms could become easier. It quickened the pace of disinvestment to arrest the drag on the public exchequer. It reduced public investment in the hope that the latter would be substituted by private investment. Indeed, the buzzword was private investment and the National Democratic Alliance coalition was prepared to go a long way to boost it.These policies had immediate adverse effects on the rank and file though. The reduction in interest rates cut the income of the non-pensioner elderly middle class almost by half. Flexible labour laws threatened the security of organized labour. Divestment of public sector units forced employees to accept voluntary retirement. The lack of employment opportunities in the formal sector created a downward pressure on informal wages. The lack of public investment in agriculture, especially in irrigation, kept productivity and the income of small farmers abysmally low. In short, the market-oriented policy of economic reforms took its toll on the common man.This did not mean, however, that no one in the country gained in the liberalization scenario. A newly affluent class emerged as a result of the market-oriented policy. Professionals, corporate managers, cyber-coolies, people with special skills to sell or anyone who could take advantage of market opportunities, found the going as good as it could get. Their incomes went up, their standards of living became comparable with that of their counterparts anywhere in the world. To serve the needs of this newly affluent, shopping malls, condominiums, health clubs, plazas and the like emerged, changing permanently the faces of major Indian cities and making parts of them look like the envied West or the coveted Far East.All this implied a significant rise in inequality, so much so that in spite of the impressive 8.1 per cent growth last year the ruling government was voted out of power. This striking rise in inequality, it goes without saying, was the last thing the NDA coalition desired. Like any other political alliance, it wanted to come back to power and in a parliamentary democracy, it was impossible to come back to power by hurting the majority and benefiting a few. Actually, the economic think-tanks in the NDA had assumed that the incentives given to private investors would increase investment which, in turn, would raise the level of output and employment in the country. In other words, through an increase in private investment, the NDA policy-makers expected to improve the economic condition of the poor and thus sail through in the general elections.Unfortunately, in spite of all the incentives given, private investment never picked up during the NDA rule. As a percentage of gross domestic product, it hovered around 16-17 per cent during the five years of NDA governance.Why did private investment remain stagnant? Partly, it was sheer bad luck that a substantial part of the NDA rule was eclipsed by a world-wide recession. But that apart, there are at least two solid economic explanations for why private investment remained dormant. The first explanation is from the demand side. The initial hardship of the masses, created by market-oriented reforms, had an adverse effect on the general purchasing power of the people and the demand for mass consumption goods.This restricted the markets and the prospects of fresh investments. The second explanation is from the supply side. The NDA think-tanks wrongly assumed that public and private investments are substitutes and that a rise in the former crowds out the latter. In reality, the two types of investments are often complementary. A private entrepreneur, for example,would not consider building a factory in a place where there are no roads. But building roads is surely an act of public investment, the responsibility of which lies entirely with the state. So private investment suffered also because complementary public investment was not forthcoming. Apparently the new coalition wishes to plug the holes in the old economic policy and the budget is supposed to signal that intention. The budget speech of the finance minister talked at great length about removal of poverty, restoration of the public distribution system, provisions for education, health services and drinking-water facilities for the underprivileged, the building of rural infrastructure, especially irrigation, and above all, providing employment to the poor. Words like economic reform and privatization were carefully avoided to give the impression that the United Progressive Alliance is primarily committed to the needs of the masses and not so much to those of the corporate community.The problem is that the budget allocations for 2004-05 do not quite reflect the changes announced in the policy stance. In the previous year, agriculture, rural development and irrigation taken together attracted Rs 17,000 crore, but this year these sectors were allocated only Rs 14,000 crore. Industrial allocation, on the other hand, has increased by almost Rs 2,000 crore. Part of this increase, however, will be used for restructuring sick PSUs.There is an even deeper problem. Even if we grant that the present budget was prepared in haste and the hurriedly-made plan allocations do not always reflect policy priorities, we still have to have blind faith in the ability of the government to deliver social justice. Let us go back to the Seventies and Eighties when the government intervened in a big way in our daily lives. That model of government intervention was abandoned precisely because it was utterly inefficient and indicated a massive governmental failure. The folly of the Nineties was to assume that government failures could always be cured by bringing market forces into play. The pathetic defeat of the NDA coalition points to the fact that there are important sectors of the economy where only the government can enter and perform. The UPA government has presumably understood this. But how can it be guaranteed that there will be no more governmental failures in the social sectors themselves? How can we guarantee that the government will efficiently deliver basic health, education or drinking-water to the underprivileged? After all nothing fundamentally has changed with either the bureaucracy or the politicians who will be running the show.It is, thus, the implementation of the budget that one needs to worry about. Just plan allocations do not mean a lot because in our country if one rupee is allocated to welfare, not more than 20 paise actually reaches the deserving. The rest is plundered by thugs at various levels. By assigning the government a greater role in the process of development of the country without improving the efficiency of the government delivery mechanism will simply allow these thugs to grab a larger share of the pie. Unfortunately Chidambarams budget gives no clues as to how the vultures might be kept at bay and government failures avoided.

		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 							 																						TINKERING WITH THE ECONOMY Gwynne Dyer																					Has anybody else noticed that there is a plot afoot to turn economics into an exact science? Since we are all part of the experiment, I think we should be told.																					Economics is about the behaviour of human beings, so it has the same drawback as other social sciences  you are not allowed to confirm your hypothesis by repeated experiments on live human beings. Somehow, though, an undercover team of experimental economists has managed to trick the Bush administration into re-running the great Reagan adventure in voodoo economics of the Eighties. They cant tell us which theory they are testing for fear of influencing the results, but it looks like its about the relationship between the size of budget deficits and the severity of the subsequent recession.																					Ronald Reagan set a peacetime record for budget deficits in 1984, the year he was seeking a second term: 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product. He justified it by grossly inflating the threat from the Soviet Union, which was actually on the brink of collapse (intelligence agencies were as eager to please the administration then as now), and pumping up the defence budget to fight the evil empire. The short-term result of this extra spending, no doubt by purest coincidence,was to make the economy of the United States of America grow by 7 per cent in 1984, guaranteeing Reagans sweeping re-election victory.																					Deficit is good																					The longer-term effect was to jack up interest rates as the government competed with private borrowers for credit. But the recession at the end of boom in the late Eighties was the grimmest since the Fifties. Small wonder that the father of the current president dubbed the Reagan budgets voodoo economics when he was seeking the Republican nomination in 1988. But it didnt save President George H.W. Bush from the recession that followed and voters punished him by electing Bill Clinton in 1992.																					In only three years, President George W. Bush has turned the 2 per cent surplus he inherited from Clinton into a deficit that is now nearly 5 per cent of GDP. Since the defence budget is already full to bursting, he did most of it by pushing through unfunded tax cuts targeted at his core supporters.																					The massive deficit  $ 520 billion this year, and the final bill for Iraq could drive it still higher  is already producing the desired short-term economic boom. If it starts to create jobs as well by the middle of the year, then only a drastic deterioration in the security situation in Iraq could stop Bush from winning in November. But thats not what interests the economists-in-disguise who tricked Bush into this repeat of the Reagan experiment. They just want to see how bad the subsequent recession will be.																					Nobel intentions																					Recessions are bound to occur from time to time, but they vary in severity. Many people expected a particularly bad one after the nine-year Clinton boom, mainly owing to a superstition that the universe will always get even, but the recession we have just come through was one of the mildest on record. So you can see the cutting-edge economic theorists getting together and coming up with a brilliant new theory  budget surpluses are followed by gentle recessions; huge deficits lead to brutal recessions. 																					But if your discipline is to be recognized as a science, then you must reproduce the results under experimental conditions. But the whole world would face a long, bitter recession in a few years if the US went down that road again. Have we the right to do that to people in the name of science?																					Of course we do; science is important, and besides, well probably get the Nobel Prize in economics. So the operation went ahead. 																					Its hard to create conditions that exactly duplicate those of the Reagan era. This time, for example, there is no opposition-controlled congress trying to cut the deficits and mandate a balanced budget, so the swings may be more extreme than the first time round. But if you want to test a theory to destruction, this should work just fine.

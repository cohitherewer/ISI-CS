		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 							 																						A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE						DOCUMENT The Common Minimum Programme of the United Progressive Alliance, May 27, 2004				 	 For a better life																														The UPA government will take the lead to introduce legislation for one-third reservation for women in Vidhan Sabhas and in the Lok Sabha. Legislation on domestic violence and against gender discrimination will be enacted.																														The UPA government will ensure that at least one-third of all funds flowing into panchayats will be earmarked for programmes for the development of women and children. Village women and their associations will be encouraged to assume responsibilities for all development schemes relating to drinking water, sanitation, primary education, health and nutrition... 																														The UPA government will bring about a major expansion in schemes for micro-finance based on self-help groups, particularly in the backward and ecologically fragile areas of the country. 																														Food and Nutrition security: The UPA government will strengthen the public distribution system particularly in the poorest and backward blocks of the country and involve womens and ex-servicemens cooperatives in its management. Special schemes to reach foodgrains to the most destitute and infirm will be launched. Grain banks in chronically food-scarce areas will be established.																														Antyodaya cards for all households at risk of hunger will be introduced. The UPA government will bring about major improvements in the functioning of the Food Corporation of India to control inefficiencies that increase the food-subsidy burden...																														Panchayati raj: The UPA government will ensure that all funds given to states for poverty alleviation and rural development schemes by panchayats are neither delayed nor diverted. Monitoring will be strict. In addition, after consultation with states, the UPA government will consider crediting elected panchayats such funds directly																														The UPA will urge the states to make legislation for conferring ownership rights in respect of minor forest produce, including Tendu patta, on all those people from the weaker sections who work in the forests...																														The UPA government will launch a comprehensive national programme for minor irrigation of all lands owned by Dalits and adivasis. Landless families will be endowed with land through implementation of land ceiling and land redistribution legislation. No reversal of ceilings legislation will be permitted. 																														The UPA is concerned with the growth of extremist violence and other forms of terrorist activities in different states. This is not merely a law-and-order problem, but a far deeper socio-economic issue which will be addressed more meaningfully than has been the case so far. False encounters will not be permitted.																														The UPA government will immediately review the overall strategy and programmes for the development of tribal areas to plug loopholes and to work out more viable livelihood strategies. In addition, more effective systems of relief and rehabilitation will be put in place for tribal and other groups displaced by development projects. Tribal people alienated from land will be rehabilitated. 																														The UPA government is very sensitive to the issue of affirmative action, including reservations in the private sector. It will immediately initiate a national dialogue with all political parties, industry and other organizations to see how best the private sector can fulfil the aspirations of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe youth.																														Eviction of tribal communities and other forest-dwelling communities from forest areas will be discontinued. Cooperation of these communities will be sought for protecting forests and for undertaking social afforestation. The rights of tribal communities over mineral resources, etc as laid down by law will be fully safeguarded. TO BE CONCLUDED

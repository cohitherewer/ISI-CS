The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 05, 2004 							 																						NO SUGAR																														West Bengal has an acute aversion to sugar and spice and all things nice. According to the rather arch nursery rhyme, that is what little girls are made of. West Bengal, in tune with the rest of this country, most definitely prefers little boys, never mind that they are made of slugs and snails and puppy dogs tails. So woe betide the unfortunate mother who bears a little girl, she might be deserted with her newborn in the nursing-home itself, with the bill unpaid and with no one to sign her out. There was a time when the preference for a son could be glibly attributed to unenlightened, underprivileged rural families, whose concerns were said to centre around keeping land within the family or with the need for more men to work. The traditional ways of killing off newborn girls were evolved out of such needs, since supporting a girl all the way to marriage with dowry was considered a terrible waste of meagre resources. If the present sex ratio could be explained away with these arguments, it would have been some consolation. If there is a hint of reason, then there is an equally reasonable chance of changing the circumstances, and hence the attitudes.																														But lack of enlightenment or resources cannot explain the plight of the new mother stranded in the nursing-home. It cannot explain why another young mother tried to throw her baby girl out of the hospital window  she had had twins  sometime back. Instead, the undimmed popularity of illegal sex determination tests followed by unethical abortions would argue the presence of adequate enlightenment and the mobilization of plenty of resources. West Bengal takes tenth place in a list of thirteen states in the son preference index, but that says very little about the states general attitude. The index, based on a survey, merely lists states on the basis of the craving for sons, it gives no clue to the active antipathy towards daughters. That has to be inferred, and the plummeting sex ratio in the whole of India suggests that the worst speculations might be true. But the figures in Calcutta are quite staggering. Eight hundred and twenty-eight women to every thousand men is not accidental, it is design and determined effort. West Bengal as a whole has 934 women to 1,000 men. And this is after the warnings about changing sex ratios. Since the poverty-ignorance thesis holds no water, it has to be argued that the Calcuttan, who prides himself on his advanced views, not only shows the greatest gender bias, but also the most heartless cruelty  both towards girls and their mothers. The proportion, after all, has to be measured against the privileges he enjoys.

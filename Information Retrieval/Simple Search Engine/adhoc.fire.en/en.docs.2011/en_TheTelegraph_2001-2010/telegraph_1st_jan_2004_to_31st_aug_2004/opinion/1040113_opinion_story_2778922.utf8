 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 				 	 Under cover																								Institutional development and political freedoms: In ...the above cases, it could be argued that punitive measures associated with HIV status, the role of legal and other restrictions related to the practice of sex work or drug use actually contribute to the spread of HIV, rather than curtailing it...In addition...a study of sex workers in Nepal found that women who had been coerced into entering the sex trade were three times as likely to be HIV-positive than those who had not. The incarceration of sex workers in rehabilitation homes and prisons is also likely to result in their remaining underground, an approach that could prevent them from accessing health messages.																								The impact of coercive laws can be expected to increase the risk potential of drug user behaviour for three reasons.																								The illegality of drug possession means that drug users might prefer to stay underground, and so are unable to obtain ready access to prevention messages associated with HIV; drug users might prefer to move to more efficient methods of drug use  injection as against inhalation or smoking  so as to reduce the transaction costs of being caught while possessing drugs; when either drug or paraphernalia possession is illegal, it would be beneficial for injecting drug users to share injecting equipment and not have everyone carry their own equipment in order to reduce the risk of being suspected of carrying drugs. 																								Family and community health levels: Health status too, can affect HIV transmission. There could be behavioural factors as individuals with a lower life expectancy may have low self-esteem and low levels of health-seeking behaviour and might take risks with their health  including exposure to HIV infection compared to those in better health. This has adverse implications not only for the individual but the household and community as well. 																								Lower investment in human development in terms of health and education would lead to lower human capital. Thus, even from the narrower human capital perspective, the lower the optimal investment in health human capital, the fewer are the periods in which a return to the investment can be expected. This indicates that the constraints and opportunities in the enabling environment of human development have a direct bearing on the ongoing relation to HIV.																								Human development and HIV infection, cross-country evidence: At a macro level, there is a systemic link between human development and HIV across countries. The analysis shows that human development achievements, including a higher real income per capita and lower degree of economic inequality as measured by the gini coefficient, tend to contain the extent to which HIV prevalence is increased owing to the duration of its presence in a population.																								Treating the time span of the epidemic as constant, the analysis also indicates that the major indicators of human development achievements are also strongly associated with HIV incidence, and their effect is to lower HIV incidence. 																								The other variable that has a statistically significant effect on the prevalence rate (at 5 per cent or 10 per cent levels of significance) is economic inequality as measured by the gini coefficient. The results...indicate that, all else being the same, a greater degree of economic inequality is associated with higher HIV incidence and prevalence in the adult population. Further, the effects of all these variables become larger in size the greater the length of time an epidemic is prevalent in a given population. This is a desirable outcome, given that an initial infection of HIV is likely to be associated with several secondary infections... TO BE CONCLUDED

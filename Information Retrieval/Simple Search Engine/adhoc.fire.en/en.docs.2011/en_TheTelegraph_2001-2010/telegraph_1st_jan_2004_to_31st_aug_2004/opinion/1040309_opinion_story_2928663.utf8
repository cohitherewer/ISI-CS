The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 							 																						TALKING HEADS AND TAILS Anuradha Kumar																					Last January, the much awaited dialogue process between the Centre and the All Party Hurriyat Conference took off on a note of optimism. The initiatives of Track-II diplomacy appear to have come to some fruition. Both sides, in a joint statement, agreed to find an honourable and durable solution to the Kashmir problem, and to follow a step-by-step approach towards peace. This first meeting was designed to kick-start the process of dialogue rather than make progress in search of a solution to the Kashmir problem.																					Nevertheless, while both parties stressed that what mattered was a cordial atmosphere, for the Hurriyat moderates, it was important that they were seen to have secured important concessions from the Centre. Earlier in the run-up to the talks, the APHC, which has been marginalized in the recent past, with Pakistan recognizing the hard-line breakaway Geelani faction, had expressed great optimism in the process. Much of this optimism seemed based on the growing ability of the moderate group to resist militant coercion. 																					Also the presence within the APHC team of Fazul Qureshi, who is backed by pro-dialogue elements of the Hizbul Mujahedin, helped add the necessary weight to Hurriyat moderation. But while international applause was forthcoming, appreciation from within was not. The Centres agreement to meet some, not all, Hurriyat demands, was seen as a mere pat on the back for having agreed to talk.																					Faction fracas																					While the feeling of euphoria stayed on for some days after the talks, the ground realities remained unchanged. Soon after its return, the Hurriyat called for a strike on Republic day  a norm in the valley for some years now. Meanwhile, the Centre also ruled out a key Hurriyat demand to declare an internal cease-fire in the valley. More recent developments also threatened to throw the dialogue between the Hurriyat and the Centre into jeopardy. 																					The Peoples Conference, an important constituent of the alliance, split, and the pressure mounted on the APHC to suspend its talks with New Delhi. Since the talks, the APHC accusations of sellout against the APHC have been flying from the Geelani faction and other Kashmiri parties. With the much-publicized incident of alleged human rights violations by security forces at Bandipore, the APHC had little option but to go on the defensive.																					A breakdown in talks would be unfortunate. The Hurriyat believes the Centre is not serious about implementing measures to build confidence. While 18 prisoners were freed on Republic Day, those still in jail are affiliated with the Geelani faction; the release of prisoners could help to win over some factions opposed to the ongoing dialogue.																					Test of durability																					Also, the Hurriyat moderates attempts to make a shift from its previous isolationist stance and to broaden the scope of the dialogue by involving the people of Jammu, Ladakh and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, appear to have been rebuffed so far. The Indian government can use its influence to ensure that the largely displaced Kashmiri Pandit community is made amenable to a dialogue. Thus far, the Panun Kashmir, an umbrella group of the Kashmiri Pandits, has labelled the talks a mere gesture that has neither emanated from a change of heart or outlook of the Hurriyat. 																					The question still remains on how durable the dialogue process will be. Jihadi groups oppose any talks with the Indian government and have threatened the Hurriyat leaders as well; Pervez Musharraf may, for all his brave talk, himself come under pressure from the militants. The recent flexibility shown by the Pakistan government, especially on issues it was earlier intransigent to  the promise to open the Uri-Muzaffarabad road, and the positive noises made on intra-Kashmir dialogue  has been encouraging. Much will also depend on whether the Pakistani army is serious about a real de-escalation of violence in the valley and how much influence it has on the militants.

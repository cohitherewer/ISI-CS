		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 							 																						SECOND IN IMPORTANCE 															- Document From The State of Civil and Political Rights in Sri Lanka, published by the Asian Centre for Human Rights, 2003				 	 No questions asked																														Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979: the PTA provides a broad and loose definition of terrorist acts to include ordinary cases of murder, robbery, theft and the like. Terrorist acts are so broadly defined that any person who without lawful authority erases, mutilates, defaces or otherwise interferes with any words, inscriptions, or lettering appearing on any board or other fixture on, upon or adjacent to, any highway, street, road or any other public place can be arrested as a terrorist under Section 2(i) of the PTA. Therefore, even the hooligans or naughty adolescents could effectively be arrested as terrorists for defacing with any words, inscription, or lettering appearing on any board or other fixture on, upon or adjacent to, any highway, street, road or any other public place.																														There is no legal requirement to inform the reasons for arrest or provide a copy of the detention order. A person may be held under the PTA on mere suspicion and need not be charged with an offence. Hundreds of Tamils arrested under the act have been released after several months or even several years, without any charge.																														Section 7 of the PTA allows arrests without warrant and permits detention without the person being produced before a court, initially for 72 hours. If the defence minister extends the detention under Section 9 (upto 18 months), the magistrate must obey detention order issued by the defence minister and shall,make order that such person be remanded until the conclusion of the trial of such person. The magistrate does not have the power to examine the reasonableness of the detention order of the defence minister and therefore, serves as the rubber stamp. Only with the consent of the attorney general, the top government lawyer that the Magistrate shall release such person from custody. There is no mechanism as to how to seek the consent of the attorney general. Therefore, under the PTA, the judges are subservient to the attorney general and defence minister.																														Under Section 8, Any police officer may at any stage of an investigation or trial produce before any Magistrate any person conversant with any fact relating to the commission of any offence under this Act, and the magistrate shall thereupon record the statement of such person upon oath...The magistrate must listen to the police officer and has no independence.																														Under Section 10, an order made under Section 9 by the defence minister shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court or tribunal by way of writ or otherwise. Therefore, the defence minister is prosecutor, judge and jury...																														Under Section 11(1) the defence minister can also impose prohibitions or restrictions on any suspects in respect of (a) his movement outside such place of residence as may be specified; or (b) the places of residence and of employment of such person; or (c) his travel within or outside Sri Lanka; or (d) his activities whether in relation to any organization, association or body of persons of which such person is a member, or otherwise; or (e) such person addressing public meetings or from holding office in, or taking part in the activities of or acting as adviser to, any organization, association or body of persons, or from taking part in any political activities, and he may require such person to notify his movements to such authority, in such manner and at such times as may be specified in the order.																														Under Section 11(5), the order made imposing the above prohibitions and restrictions ...final and shall not be called in question in any court or tribunal by way of writ or otherwise. Therefore, once again, the executives caprice prevails over judiciary. TO BE CONCLUDED

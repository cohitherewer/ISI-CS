The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 22, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Theatre of the absurd				 																																																				Sir  An anti-globalization meet will naturally have protest marches, heated debates and first world bashing. The ongoing World Social Forum in Mumbai witnessed all this and much more than anyone bargained for  sex and high drama (Winnie wades in to stand by judge in rape row, Jan 21). Whether the high profile lawyer from South Africa is guilty of raping a fellow delegate is of secondary importance here. The point is that they show up conferences like the WSF as instances of tokenism, where the rich and famous flaunt their half-baked ideas about globalization. No effective solutions come up at these junkets on how to counter poverty, marginalization and unequal distribution of wealth. While the real crusaders continue as always, delegates at such meets behave like they are on a pleasure cruise  staying in five star comfort and enjoying chance sexual encounters. India being a third world country should be careful about such hypocrisy, both in words and action.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Shivani Roy, Calcutta
				 																Down with dynasty				 																																																				Sir It is hard to disagree with Sunanda K. Datta-Ray when he says that domesticity would suit Sonia Gandhi better (Back to the hearth, Jan 17). If she takes the backstage, a vacuum will be created that can be filled by leaders like Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Though the latter is reluctant to join active politics, there is little doubt that she will bring in some glamour to the Congress. The party should realize that without an able leader it hardly stands a chance in the coming polls, even with the help of numerous allies. The present leadership has failed to instil hope in the rank and file. The results of the recent elections in three major states have proved that the Bharatiya Janata Partys strategy is more effective than that of the Congress. The party needs much more than handshakes and tea parties to defeat its competitor. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sycophants of the Nehru-Gandhi family are clamouring for Sonia Gandhis daughter to lead the Congress in the coming elections (Karunakaran in Priyanka cry, Jan 18). What is so special about the family that makes them the preferred ones to lead the Congress? When the Congress has someone like Manmohan Singh, who initiated the economic reforms the fruits of which are being reaped by the country now, why should the party look elsewhere? Perhaps they feel that Priyanka, being inexperienced in the rough and tumble of Indian politics, can be used to their own profit. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhis advisors seem to have decided to use her charm to make friends and palliate foes in order to keep the Congress alive. She had no qualms courting M. Karunanidhi, or breaking protocol to accept Sharad Pawars invitation to tea, or wishing Mayavati on her birthday. This shows that Sonia Gandhi is ready to break her image of an anointed empress. With each move, she is moving towards the tally of 290 members of Parliament that she had once boasted of and failed to produce. The setback in the assembly elections has the Congress fighting for survival. But by forging alliances, left, right and centre, she is showing that the Congress too can play the game the BJP had fine-tuned over the years. 				 																																																				It is a foregone conclusion that the Congress will emerge the largest partner in a secular alliance. If Sonia Gandhi follows the policy she adopted in Jammu and Kashmir and settles for second place in the interests of the country, the Congress may well find itself in the government in the near future. If not, the party is surely heading for extinction.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai

				 																 Unjust claims				 																																																				Sir  Gyan Pathak makes a number of baseless statements in What those numbers conceal (Jan 9). Take the statement, investment in all sectors of production has plummeted to a new low. Readers would have been better served had he told them whether he had excluded the service sector from his calculations. Pathak further says that many medium and small industries were falling sick, and some were compelled to shut shop. But what connection does this have with the economy doing badly? After all, many of them were inefficient and could not have been kept running. Readers would also have liked to know the names of the companies and banks who charge more for their services. 				 																																																				Pathak must be more precise in his allegations. While referring to population figures and Indias share in world trade, he does not mention what they were before the present government came to power. The points Pathak makes may be worthy of debate, but they have to be supported by relevant comparisons. A sweeping comparison from 1790 to 1947 and then this year will not help.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ravi Prasad, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Gyan Pathak has been quick to accuse the BJP of failing to revive the economy. But has he not heard that India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world? The growth rate may have fallen to 4.5 per cent of the gross domestic product last year, but even the most developed economies are not immune to fluctuations. Yes, unemployment and population continue to be a problem but they are being tackled. He is entitled to criticize but making baseless allegations does not make sense.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arnab Basu, Ranchi

				 																																																				Sir  It is nice to note that Gyan Pathak has not been bitten by the feel good bug. His article clearly proves that far from shining, Indias economy has a bleak future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashok Banerjee, Calcutta

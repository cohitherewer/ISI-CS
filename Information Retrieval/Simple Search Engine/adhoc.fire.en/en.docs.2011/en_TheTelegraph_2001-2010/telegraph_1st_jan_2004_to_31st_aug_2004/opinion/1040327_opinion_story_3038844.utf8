The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 							 																						WHATS LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?This Above All / Khushwant Singh				 	 Crucial minutes																					Some weeks ago, I wrote about Paulo Coelhos The Alchemist, which remained on the top of the worlds bestsellers lists for months. I was somewhat grudging and condescending in my appraisal. So my friend Zamir Ansari, who is the sales manager of HarperCollins, sent me another of Coelhos novels, Eleven Minutes, also published by them. The jacket claims that Coelho is one of the most widely read authors in the world today. He has sold more than 43 million books and has been translated in 56 languages. That would probably make him the worlds richest pen-pusher.																					Eleven Minutes is an intriguing title. Half-way through the novel, the reader learns that according to Coelho, sexual intercourse lasts just about that time. And they are the most crucial minutes in the lives of adult males and females. So the most important ingredient in cooking a bestseller is sex. Next comes religion and the third, violence. The three make a heady cocktail, the most important ingredient being sex. 																					Coelho starts his tale with a quotation from the scriptures, then he introduces his main character, 11-year-old Maria, daughter of poor peasant living in a remote village in Brazil. Her first crush is on a schoolmate, who asks her to lend him her pencil. She can see he has one in his shirt pocket. She is too shy to respond to his overture, but hopes he will repeat it. 																					She turns nineteen, a well-rounded, dusky Brazilian beauty. She has her second heart-break but decides to first try her luck as a model or a Samba dancer in Rio de Janerio. She is picked up by a Swiss procurer to work in a dance hall in Geneva. She accepts the offer and arrives in Switzerland, only to discover that she is meant to be a prostitute. Her first client is a rich Arab, who gives her more money than she has ever seen. Then she gets a regular job in a night-club-cum-pick-up joint called Copacabana. There are over two dozen girls working there. It also has a regular clientele of whore-mongers. The drill is set  first ask for a fruit cocktail, then dance with the client, who then pays the tavern-keeper his commission and takes the girl to his hotel and pays her for her services. 																					Maria is quick to fall in line. She services three clients every night and earns a lot of money. But there is no love or romance. In her months in Geneva she has only two affairs  one with a sado-masochist who can arouse her to an orgasm. The second is with an artist which comes closest to what she has been looking for in life.																					The novel revolves around the sex at its rawest. The world revolved around something that only took eleven minutes. And because of those eleven minutes in any one twenty-four hour day (assuming that they all made love to their wives everyday, which is patently absurd and a complete lie) they got married, supported a family, put up with screaming kids,...ogled dozens,...paid prostitutes to try to give them what they were missing, and thus sustained a vast industry of cosmetics, diet foods, exercise, pornography and power, and yet when they got together with other men, contrary to popular belief, they never talked about women. They talked about jobs, money and sport.																					Something was very wrong with civilisation, and it wasnt the destruction of the Amazon rainforest or the ozone layer, the death of the panda, cigarettes, carcinogenic foodstuffs or prison conditions....																					It was precisely the thing she was working with: Sex.																					In another passage Coelho writes about Marias notion of love: Everyone knows how to love, because we are all born with that gift. Some people have a natural talent for it, but the majority of us have to re-learn, to remember how to love, and everyone, without exception, needs to burn on the bonfire of past emotions... until they can see the connecting thread that exists behind each new encounter; because there is a connecting thread.																					And then, our bodies learn to speak the language of the soul, known as sex, and that is what I can give to the man who gives me back my soul...That is what he asked me for and that is what he will have; I want him to be very happy.																					The only concession Coelho makes to love is to admit that making love is more than just an encounter, it is a genital embrace. There is a lot of phoney philosophizing on man-woman relationship designed to be taken as profound statements. He tells us about vibes and light which emanate from the person you love. It boils down to Coelhos claim to have discovered the womans clitoris as the ultimate seat of sensuality.																					A life-saving drug																					Sometime ago, in a weak moment,																					Disgusted with aimless strife																					I tried to embrace peaceful death																					And end my sad, miserable life.																					I went to a reputed medical store																					And purchased a potent poisonous pill.																					This effective deadly device I hopedGap between pain and peace would instantly fill.																					I consumed the drug and tell asleep																					But death is death, not a fun.																					Next day I got up as usual.																					Alas! The drug was a spurious one!																					(Courtesy G.C. Bhandari, Meerut)																					Overhead costs																					A businessman known for his honesty was never questioned by income tax officers on the returns he filed. Once a new tax commissioner scanning his returns found some expense item baffling. They included expenditure on elephants, horses and donkeys. The commissioner summoned the businessman to his office and asked him to explain these items, particularly as he did not have elephants, horses or donkeys. Before entering the commissioners office, the businessman gave a tip of Rs 10 to his chaprasi sitting outside the commissioners room. Then he explained items on his expense list. When some minister or politician comes to the city, I have to spend large sums of money on their hospitality and on donations for their election campaigns. This I put under the heading expenditure on elephants. I also have to keep babus happy and pay them regularly to ward off their wrath: this expenditure I put under the head expenditure on horses. Before being allowed to enter your room I had to tip your chaprasi. This expenditure is shown on expenditure on donkeys.																					(Contributed by S.R. Rakheja, Delhi)

		 Monday, July 26, 2004 							 																						THE TWISTS IN THE TALE While both the Congress and the BJP have used Shibu Soren in their political games, the JMM leader may still have the last laugh, argues Uttam Sengupta Setting a new targetWhoever advised Sibu Soren to scoot, did him an immense disservice. It merely made the issue of his arrest more muddled than was ever necessary, either politically or legally. Soren also arguably lost an opportunity to point out that he was accused of committing murder at Chirudih in 1975, but only with his words; that the only substantial evidence against him, a dying declaration, accused him of delivering a rabble-rousing speech that eventually provoked a mob of Santhal tribals to attack the village of Chirudih. Not only has he now lost his claim on public sympathy, which could have come his way once the technical absurdity of the case became clear to the people, but he has also played into the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party by going into hiding. 																														To be fair to Soren, one must concede the possibility that the events caught him by surprise and he reacted, as he has always done, instinctively. The life of a fugitive is not new to him. In the Sixties and Seventies, he was forced to play hide-and-seek with the police. 																														The movement for a Jharkhand state then did not have the cloak of respectability or, for that matter, the support of mainstream political parties that the demand for a separate Telengana enjoys today. From the Jan Sangh on the right to the Communist Party of India on the left, every party considered the Jharkhand movement a fly in the ointment. 																														The Congress government in Bihar was particularly vicious on any idea of bifurcating the state. Its partisan police enjoyed a free hand in beating up Jharkhand activists, arresting them and slapping charges  some of them were trumped up  on them. Once in a blue moon, the usually docile tribals did get out of hand, forcing the police to open fire and kill. No compensation was paid to the victims, as is now done at the drop of a hat, because they were usually deemed to constitute violent, riotous mobs trying to disrupt the government, or obstruct the police or other public servants from discharging their duty. Their regular course of duty often included taking over tribals land, displacing them for public projects and denying them access to either forests or streams, unless they paid up. Regular raps on the knuckles of mass leaders who did not fall in line was also not an exception. 																														Soren rallied the Santhals, led them to dream and organized little resistance groups to fight the local landlords, police and moneylenders, almost all of them settlers from outside. There were Bengali lawyers, Bihari moneylenders, Muslim farmers and even Kurmi traders, not to speak of the predominantly Bihari police force, which took devilish delight in exploiting the illiteracy, ignorance and innocence of the tribals, usurping land, grains and even women.																														It is hardly surprising that there are scores of police cases still gathering dust in old, decrepit police stations and moffussil courts in Jharkhand. Many of these cases, if not most, are unlikely to pass judicial scrutiny because of arbitrary charges framed by the police, inadequate evidence and perfunctory investigation. It would be unfair to compare Soren with the likes of Pappu Yadav, Suraj Bhan or Mohammed Shahabuddin, all of whom have at their beck and call armed men and resources to strike terror. Soren, in contrast, was a rebel and a political pariah till 1977, when the Congress was voted out of power at the Centre and in the states. It is nothing short of an irony, though, that Soren was won over by the Congress in 1980 though successive Congress governments in Bihar had hounded him and forced him to lead the life of a fugitive. It was a Congress government which was in the saddle when the Chirudih clash took place. 																														It was again a Congress government in Bihar in 1986, when ostensibly the last warrant of arrest was issued against him. Had he been a shrewd politician, Soren would have easily demanded that all cases against him be withdrawn in return for his political support. But then, even a de-classed Soren, who rarely flaunts his tribal credentials as Laloo Yadav does his OBC ancestry, retained enough of his tribal simplicity and gullibility to trust his political allies. The allies, in turn, were happy to be generous with platitudes and promises while discreetly keeping the cases alive as a possible bargaining chip in the future. None of them could have imagined that these ghosts of the past would be resurrected to embarrass both. 																														The ironies do not end there. The BJP leaders, who have been appearing constipated on television and delighted off it, can scarcely explain why cases against Soren failed to surface in Jharkhand during the last four years. Soren himself, to his credit, never tried to hide the fact that the Chirudih case was pending against him. Newspaper reports suggest that even in this years general elections, Soren made the declaration to the Election Commission while filing his nomination. He had probably done the same the last time he won a bye-election to the Lok Sabha, and his BJP rivals had known about it. They did not rake it up then because it was not necessary. Indeed, they tried to humour Soren and persuade him to join the National Democratic Alliance. There appears some merit therefore in the Congress accusation that the BJP thought of making this an issue only when it lost the general elections and was badly mauled in Jharkhand itself by the Congress-Jharkhand Mukti Morcha combine earlier this year.																														Whats more, had it been simply a case of a judicial process, the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate at Jamtara could easily have sent a summons to Soren. It was after all the fault of the court that case records went missing, and the warrant-order of the SDJM in 1986 for the arrest of Soren and others was kept in abeyance for 18 long years. Had Soren failed to appear before the court, a warrant of arrest would have been entirely justified. It is interesting to note that the former law minister, Arun Jaitley, had talked in parliament about a warrant pending against Soren on July 13, four days before the Jamtara court actually issued a fresh warrant of arrest and six days before it was handed over to the Jamtara superintendent of police. 																														It is no less significant that the BJP-led government in Jharkhand constituted a police team in less than 24 hours and flew it to New Delhi to serve the warrant to the JMM chief. If the BJPs gameplan was to drive a wedge between the Congress and the JMM, the week-long drama might actually have quite the opposite effect. The BJP might have just lost an opportunity to put the Congress on the mat, by accusing it of framing false charges against Soren in 1975 and getting a warrant of arrest issued against him in 1986. Those familiar with Sorens politics will not be surprised if he still has the last laugh. The NDA has probably handed the next Jharkhand chief ministers chair to him on a platter.

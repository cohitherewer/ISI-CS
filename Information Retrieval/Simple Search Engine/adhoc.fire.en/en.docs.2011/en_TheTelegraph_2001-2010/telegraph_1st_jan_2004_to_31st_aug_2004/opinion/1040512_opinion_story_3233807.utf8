		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 							 																						WITH FULL RESPONSIBILITY						DOCUMENT From the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949				 	 At mercy																														The undersigned plenipotentiaries of the governments represented at the Diplomatic Conference held at Geneva from April 21 to August 12, 1949, for the purpose of revising the Convention concluded at Geneva on July 27, 1929 relative to the treatment of prisoners of war, have agreed as follows:																														Part I: General Provisions Article 1: The high contracting parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances. Article 2: In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace time, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any of the armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a high contracting party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance. Although one of the powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations...																														Article 3: In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the high contracting parties, each party to the conflict shall be bound to apply...the following provisions: 																														(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat...shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:																														(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; (b) taking of hostages; (c) outrages upon personal dignity... (d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. (2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the parties to the conflict. 																														The parties to the conflict should...endeavour to bring into force, by special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention. The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the parties to the conflict...																														Part II: General protection of prisoners of war 																														Article12: Prisoners of war are in the hands of the enemy power, but not of the individuals or military units who have captured them. Irrespective of the individual responsibilities that may exist, the detaining power is responsible for the treatment given to them. Prisoners of war may only be transferred by the detaining power to a power which is a party to the Convention and after the detaining power has satisfied itself of the willingness and ability of such transferee power to apply the Convention. When prisoners of war are transferred under such circumstances, responsibility for the application of the Convention rests on the power accepting them while they are in its custody...																														If that power fails to carry out the provisions of the Convention in any important respect, the power by whom the prisoners of war were transferred shall, upon being notified by the protecting power, take effective measures to correct the situation or shall request the return of the prisoners of war. Such requests must be complied with. TO BE CONCLUDED

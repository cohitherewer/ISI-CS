The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 30, 2004 							 																						BIRDS																														Asia is being menaced by chickens. Bird flu is spreading through the continent at what the World Health Organization has declared to be a historically unprecedented rate. It has already broken out in China, although the Chinese strain of the virus has not yet started infecting people. There have been a number of human casualties in Vietnam, and a couple in Thailand so far, with some more who are ill and being treated. Poultry in Pakistan is also being culled rapidly and extensively, although infection from birds to humans has not been reported yet from that country. The outbreak in Holland last year was serious, although confined to poultry; six people died in Hong Kong in 1997; in 1918, when there were no anti-viral drugs, a pandemic form of bird flu claimed around 40 million lives all over the world. The 1918 outbreak was so devastating because the virus had then mutated within human beings to become a dangerous human pathogen, which could then spread from person to person without the help of birds. This is the worst thing that could happen this time as well, next to the virus becoming able to jump from birds to human, as in Vietnam and Thailand.																														The situation has come to this largely because of governmental delay, evasion and perhaps even the downright suppression of facts. It has been strongly alleged that the governments of Thailand and Indonesia were deliberately sitting on information indicating the outbreak of the epidemic among chickens. China had done this with SARS recently, with nasty human and political consequences. Indonesia is now finding it difficult to enforce culling because it cannot afford to compensate its farmers. Co-operation between the affected countries, and help from the safer and richer ones, are therefore imperative. The Centre and the West Bengal government have both sat up to the emergency, checking imports and patrolling borders. The virus, in all its strains, can be detected clearly. So India must set up very many more testing centres for suspiciously dead poultry, instead of relying on the one centre in Bhopal. Checking at airports must also be handled intelligently. Airport officials must be told that the only way to determine whether someone showing ordinary flu symptoms is suffering from bird flu is through performing the test. This will prevent needless panic and harassment. What has to be fought is complacency  the attitude of people and governments that emergencies always happen to other people. The state animal resources development minister must also stop reassuring people by telling them that he has just had chicken for lunch. Such an assurance does not really make any sense.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Running after the pill				 																																																				Sir  It is incredible that The Telegraph should choose to endorse drug-use in sport. The editorial, Descent from Olympus (Aug 14), suggests that drug abuse should be legalized because the point is to win. It wilfully ignores the fact that sport is between individuals, not between laboratories. If the point is just to win, we might as well dispense with human competitors. Banned drugs are not taken blindly, but for specific purposes, such as increasing stamina or muscle mass. So, one knows which drugs are likely to be used for which athlete. And these drugs are hardly harmless. They can, and do, ruin athletes health, shorten their lives (remember Florence Griffith-Joyner?) and play merry hell with the whole concept of fairness. But it is the mindless commercialization of sport which is to blame. The athletes themselves are just pawns on the board of big money.

				 																Baffled by the numbers				 																																																				Sir  Although the state is renowned as the cereal and vegetable granary of the country, West Bengals agricultural production and consumption statistics are puzzling indeed (Rural Bengals puzzle, Aug 10). The puzzle is also reflected in the West Bengal Human Development Report, 2004 (Health And Nutrition chapter). For example, per-capita consumption of vegetables in the state was 64 grams against reported per-capita production of 439 gms. The official production of milk and milk-products was 116 gms, that of eggs 11 and fish 30 grams per head per day, the corresponding consumption being 46 gms, 7 and 18 grams respectively. The government boasts that the state has surplus production in cereals, but in figures, the production was only 413 gms per head per day against consumption of 499 gms. The consumption figures are from the National Sample Survey 1993-94, while the production figures are official and from 1999-2000.				 																																																				Though the gap in the case of cereals can be explained by imports through the Food Corporation of India and trade sources, the huge differences between production and consumption of other food items are baffling. West Bengal is not a large exporter of vegetables, eggs, milk and milk products to neighbouring states. It exports, of course, fish (mainly prawn) to foreign countries but imports a larger amount from other states. What, then might be the explanation? Fabrication of production statistics? Here is an example from an official document, Economic Review. In it, meat production in the state was shown as 6.5 lakh tonnes, much higher than the 5 lakh tonnes of fish production, for 1987-88. This embarrassed the government no end. Later it gave 3.5 lakh tonnes as the meat-production figure for 1990-91 which was subsequently raised to 4.5 lakh tonnes in 2000-01 against 6.5 lakh tonnes 13 years ago. Until collection and compilation of production statistics are assigned to professionals, Bengals puzzle will remain unresolved.

				 																																																				Sir  Omkar Goswami is absolutely right in his view that the salvation of rural West Bengal lies in more investment in these areas. However, he appears unaware of the long tradition of interference by local political leaders  mainly left  which is why no investor in rural Bengal can have effective control over any unit he sets up there. Neither the chief minister, who is eager to draw investment to his state, nor anyone else, has been able to find a solution to this problem. Therefore, investment in Bengals villages is a near impossibility in the foreseeable future. A few I know who had invested in these parts are now trying to salvage whatever they can from their doomed investments and shift to Calcutta or out of the state.

				 																Heres looking at you				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph, by all means, has become one of the best-loved English dailies in the city; and the recent refurbishment for the international look will further enhance its appeal. But the claim that the paper is equivalent to other international papers is a bit premature. The sheer bulk of newsprint devoted to foreign affairs, or in-depth analyses of political and social news that one sees in any of the leading international dailies still remains out of the reach of The Telegraph. And the recent refashioning reveals no such aspirations either. The editorial policy seems to be to make the newspaper more attractive by adding glamour, glitz and entertainment news. This commercialization not only brings out the deplorable state of Indian journalism, it also underestimates the intelligence of conscientious readers. It has either never occurred to the editors that the addition of an exclusive literary or cultural supplement would have been greatly appreciated by a wide section of readers; or the idea must have been abandoned as a commercial disaster. Even the more modest step of increasing the editorial and book-review pages, which are truly international in their scope and content, would have been appreciated.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  What on earth possessed The Telegraph to go in for the new look? There seems to be much less substance and a lot more fluff in the daily now. Valuable front-page space is wasted on non-news events. The Telegraph has brought itself down to the level of the other rags in the city. Was that the intention? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anuradha Roy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Thank you for bringing Luann back. But what about Phantom and Modesty Blaise? Arent you going to complete their stories?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Akashdip Singh, Calcutta

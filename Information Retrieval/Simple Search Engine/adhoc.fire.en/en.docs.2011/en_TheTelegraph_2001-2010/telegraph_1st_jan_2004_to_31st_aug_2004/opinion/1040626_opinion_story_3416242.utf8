The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 26, 2004 							 																						WRECKED BY LOVETo glorify vandalism as the expression of love for Bengali is to push the language further towards mindlessness and mediocrity
The Bengali language appears doubly cursed. Its demise is routinely and ritually lamented in Calcutta. And, as if this were not bad enough, its most ardent champions now seem hell-bent on making it die a particularly uncivilized death. The lovers of Bengali have recently recharged their movement by deciding to go on a vandalizing spree. They attacked shops in the Esplanade area, littering them with pamphlets, defacing the windows and glow-signs with posters and the walls with graffiti, roughing up the staff, and in one case, smashing the glass of the main window. They were punishing these shops for not putting up Bengali signboards, despite repeatedly being urged to do so. The shop that had its window-glass smashed and manager beaten up sells an international brand of shoes and accessories. Three organizations fighting the cause of Bengali, together with their supporters, had got together to express their impatience with the governments inability to make bill-boards and hoardings in Bengali compulsory in the state.																														There is pathetic irony in a language being revived by hooligans. But this hooliganism is only the other face of an even more unfortunate failure of intelligence in the movements more exalted sources of inspiration. Eminent writers, sportsmen and local celebrities have associated themselves with this linguistic agenda. Many of them have seen this latest eruption of lawlessness as the natural consequence of a culpable unconcern for the language. The most eminent among them has described it as the first sign of a more open and direct struggle  a word that alludes to nothing less than Indias struggle for independence. This is confused and pernicious thinking. It is the kind of ideology which led to the Left Fronts protractedly damaging experiments with English-teaching in government schools. It is, indeed, a lamentable reality that the substandard teaching of Bengali is largely responsible for the young Bengalis ignorance of and profound lack of interest in the language and its literary traditions. The degradation of the language in the contemporary media and political rhetoric is yet another manifestation of this neglect. To link, moreover, the demise of Bengali with the rise of English is to give this mix of insecurity and chauvinism another unthinking twist. Supporting such a crass expression of love for a language undermines not only the value of the language, but also the principles of democratic politics itself. 																														The decline of everyday as well as literary Bengali should certainly be pondered and debated in all kinds of public or political fora. It is a problem that should continue to worry and enthuse writers, critics, educationists and policy-makers. The social and economic inequalities fostered by a blundering and blinkered government policy on the relative importance of English and Bengali have only now begun to be acknowledged and rectified. The impulse behind this is more pragmatic than intellectual. But justifying destructive stupidity as a linguistic revolution will not revive a neglected language. It can only push Bengali further towards mindlessness and mediocrity.

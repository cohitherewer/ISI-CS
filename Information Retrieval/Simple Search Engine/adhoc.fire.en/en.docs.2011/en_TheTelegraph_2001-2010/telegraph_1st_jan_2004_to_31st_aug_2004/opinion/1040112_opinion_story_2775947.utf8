 															- Document Extracts from the UNDP report HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 At high risk																								Primary healthcare is, thus, a neglected area as is the treatment of communicable diseases. More often than not, the lack of insurance coverage has serious implications for affordability of care...The study by Bloom et al (1996), using interviews with the staff of insurance companies in Sri Lanka, demonstrated that, as of 1995, individuals with HIV/AIDS were excluded from health and life insurance schemes, with limited exceptions in circumstances where premium requirements had been fulfilled.																								Rural-urban economic differences, unequal opportunities, conflict, natural calamities, social factors and exploitation are the main factors behind migration. In many cases, the economic inequality reflects an underlying social inequality  like the lower status of women relative to men, which is reflected in their lower educational status, fewer remunerative opportunities and assets, and access to health. Migration, in itself, does not have an inevitable correlation with HIV, but in the absence of information and access to services and adequate preparedness, mobile populations become vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking and HIV.																								Economic deprivation: Economic deprivation and HIV/AIDS incidence appear to be linked, and there are a number of reasons why one can expect low levels of economic achievement to be rooted in HIV. The dynamics of the sex industry illustrate this linkage starkly. Extreme poverty often forces women and young girls into the sex trade, which increases their risk of exposure to HIV. In one study of female sex workers in Sri Lanka, nearly 37 per cent of the women interviewed described the need for survival as a major reason for their entry into the sex trade. The numbers were even higher  48 percent  for streetwalkers. One study in...the Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal quotes an interviewee as saying, No one can survive on farming only There would be a famine here without the sex trade. Examples of economic need leading to entry into sex work can be found in Bangladesh and Pakistan as well...																								Levels of remuneration are also a determining factor, especially if alternative economic opportunities are not as attractive. For instance, a study of Bangkok massage parlours in 1980 indicated that the average earnings of masseuses exceeded what they earn in occupations elsewhere by nearly 1,700 per cent. This also indicates that quality of employment is as important as the quantity in the context of expanding employment opportunities.																								Global economic processes and macro-economic policies serve as a factor in increasing the vulnerability of certain sections of society. Increasing mobility in response to demands for cheap labour and the absence of safe mobility options create situations of vulnerability for migrant workers. Long periods of separation from the family, marginalization...and absence of social capital often lead to the migrant workers seeking multi-partner sex in order to meet their physical and emotional needs. Infection rates among Nepalese workers who had worked in India were found to be substantially higher (10 per cent) than those who had not (2 per cent).																								Indeed, a study of the region found that truck drivers routinely stop at roadside hotels which provide food, rest, alcohol, drugs and sex. Some countries in the region  for example, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have not experienced high rates of HIV infection among truck drivers thus far. The evidence available indicates, however, that truck drivers, even in these countries, are at high risk of HIV infection, with some 60 per cent in a recent sample of Bangladeshi truck drivers reporting engaging in commercial sex twice a month.

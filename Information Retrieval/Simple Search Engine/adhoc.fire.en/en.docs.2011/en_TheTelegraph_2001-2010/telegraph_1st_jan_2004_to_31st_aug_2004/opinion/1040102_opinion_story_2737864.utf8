The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 02, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																The past has only just happened The good doctor (Penguin,  Rs 250) by Damon Galgut is a spare, strange and  original novel set in a rural hospital in post-apartheid  South Africa: The past has only just happened. Its not  past yet. It explores the relationship between its two  resident white doctors, Laurence and Frank, who share a  room, and regard each other with an ambivalence of deepening  complexity. The writing is self-assured and restrained,  although quite recognizably in the School of Coetzee (of  Disgrace). The epigraph is from Chekov: Hundreds  of miles of desolate, monotonous, burnt-up steppe cannot  induce such deep depression as one man when he sits and  talks, and one does not know when he will go. Galgut wrote  his first novel when he was 17, and called it A Sinless  Season. The universe of science  (Rupa, Rs 195) by Hyman Levy is the reprint  of an important polemic against the isolation of science  from human and political values, written by an eminent mathematician  and member of the British Communist Party until 1958. It  is irritating that Rupa does not provide the date of original  publication of this book anywhere in its scanty editorial  apparatus. The WTO and india (Dronequill,  Rs 250) by Narendar Pani is a rather expensive  but handy little book which tries to explain to the intelligent  layperson why countries act the way they do in the WTO  and why they are sometimes willing to give up part of their  sovereignty for a set of global rules. Technical or academic  jargon is deliberately eschewed, and so is journalese. There  are clever epigraphs to each chapter. Transition and development  in india (Routledge, price not mentioned) edited  by Anjan Chakrabarti and Stephen Cullenberg takes a  series of Marxist debates on Indian modes of production  and subaltern studies in a new direction by developing an  alternative model of transition and development. This model  also seeks to contribute to the current policy discussions  over liberalization and globalization. It also hopes to  contribute to the many struggles the world over to create  a new global community that is concerned with ending injustice  and class exploitation. The age of consent: a manifesto  for a new world order (HarperColl- ins, Rs 250)  by George Monbiot is an unabashedly utopian defence  of democracy in the age of globalization. Monbiots projected  task is not to overthrow globalization, but to capture  it, and use it as a vehicle for humanitys first global  democratic revolution.

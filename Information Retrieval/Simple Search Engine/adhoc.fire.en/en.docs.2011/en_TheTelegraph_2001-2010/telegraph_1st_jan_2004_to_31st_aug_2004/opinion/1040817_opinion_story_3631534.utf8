		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 							 																						A TRYST STILL AWAITED Malvika Singh																					Incredible India! But, does India beckon? Fifty-seven years down the road, have we generated pride or have we descended into a quagmire that we find difficult to get out of? One should be celebrating an emergent India, an India that is playing an independent and active role in shaping international values in a world plagued with human horrors. Our tried and tested philosophies, our patience and resilience, our ability to adjust, all our intrinsic qualities should be at the forefront. Instead, we are being projected on the world stage as a backward nation, ridden with corruption, ruled by opportunists, administered by draconian laws meted out by a rusty bureaucracy steeped in insecurity.																					Lets return to the past for a brief moment. There was a time, after independence, when India had a voice in world politics. The stature of our leadership was at a different level, one that could be looked up to. There were many ups and downs, many policy changes, some disastrous decisions, all of which are a part of governance. It was with the declaration of Emergency in 1975 that this country, its values and its institutions, were torn apart, and that period became a watershed that changed norms. Every form of corruption, including intellectual corruption, was institutionalized. The first coalition in 1977 just did not have the wherewithal or political calibre to restore all that was destroyed during those years. 																					Going down																					There was no radical reform of that devastating period. It suited the political class to have had those draconian seeds sown for easy manipulation and corruption. They squabbled amongst themselves, had no real leadership traits, generated personal wealth, created divisive constituencies and perpetuated the politics of the Emergency years. No correctives were put in place. Till today, there has been nothing but deterioration in the politics, administration and morality of Bharat.																					We desperately need to recover and gain ground for ourselves. As a people we should pledge to fight for renewal  renewal of our values and our sense of integrity. The reason why our fundamentals have been corroded is because the political and administrative machinery, draconian, not democratic, norms virtually forced, Indians to become what they are intrinsically not  corrupt. There was no other way to survive the onslaught of the corruption and extortion of The Authority. The latter took away our dignity and it is for us to demand it back.																					To dream again																					From all reports, the Congress that went through many years being ineffective seems to have been re-energized with its recent restructuring. There is a palpable change in mood. There is an upbeat sense of challenges that have to be faced. The party president, having segregated party from government, has made the first move in what appears to be an attempt to bring back into operation the democratic parameters that the party was built on. If the Congress pulls off this renewal, makes its leadership accountable for its responsibilities, recruits younger members across the hinterland, returns to the principles of seva, the political mood in the country could change. 																					It could also pressure other parties to look again at themselves, to energize themselves with new attitudes. Maybe the time for reappraisal has come and hope will once again begin to ignite our imagination. We, the people, deserve something to look forward to, something to participate in with renewed vigour, something to celebrate.																					We have entered a new year. It is time to discard the follies of the past and work towards generating positive endeavours that make us proud of ourselves once again. There is another generation today that has a dream. Make it happen.

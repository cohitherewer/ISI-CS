The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 							 																						AFTER THE PARTY																								The party system intermittently throws up two kinds of problems. More common is the problem of parties struggling to find the right leaders. The other, which the case of Mr P.A. Sangma typifies, emerges when some leaders find themselves at odds with their own parties. When such a situation arises, the odd leader throws a spanner in the partys works, as Mr Sangma has sought to do to the Nationalist Congress Partys moves to ally with the Congress for the forthcoming general elections. The season of electoral alliances is usually the time when some leaders find themselves hoisted with their own rigid positions. Some others, like the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mr Kalyan Singh, become the odd men out for an entirely different reason. Seemingly willing to join any of the alliances led by the Bharatiya Janata Party or the Congress provided he gets a good bargain, he has found himself hanging in the middle because both camps are wary of accommodating him and thereby upsetting other potential allies. In Bihar, Mr Ram Vilas Paswan may well become the odd man for poll alliances, despite Mr Laloo Prasad Yadavs anxiety to accommodate him in the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Congress combine. Whatever the reasons for their isolation, the oddballs may strut and fret their way only to their own political irrelevance. Mr Sangma may go the way of the National Democratic Alliance but only as an insignificant ally.																								All this is not to suggest, though, that dissenting leaders do not have their points. When Mr Jyoti Basu differed from the majority of the central committee members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on his party joining the United Front government in 1996, his arguments were not necessarily wrong. But having made his points, he decided to go with the majority view within the party. That is the choice that leaders who find themselves at odds with their parties have to make. They have to either leave the parties or submit to their organizations collective wisdom. Mr Sangma is entitled to stick to his opinion on Ms Sonia Gandhis ineligibility for Indias prime ministership because of her foreign origin. Neither he nor the NCP found that argument an obstacle to forming an alliance with the Congress in Maharashtra or Mr Sangmas own Meghalaya. Mr Sharad Pawar obviously thought that an alliance with the Congress at the national level was the logical step after the state-level understanding. The point is not whether Mr Sangma is right or wrong, but that he finds his position unaccepted within his own party. But he is not the first to presume that leaders are bigger than parties. Even if some leaders are, Mr Sangma has never looked like one.

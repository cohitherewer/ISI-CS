		 Friday, May 14, 2004 							 																						SPEAK UP AND BE COUNTED				 	 Rallying pointMultiple Marginalities: An Anthology of Identified Dalit Writings Edited by Badri Narayan and A.R. Misra, Manohar, Rs 600Deprived, downtrodden and treated as untouchables, the Dalits in north India had a hard life. They lived in mud-houses, were barred from collecting water from the wells belonging to upper castes and even the residential areas of the upper castes; their women were humiliated by the zamindars. 																														The editors, Badri Narayan and A.R. Misra, argue that the hegemonic caste structures which emerged in the early phases of the Indian civilization continued even after the advent of the British in India.																														These brutalities sparked off a literature of anger and protest mostly in the form of booklets. The editors select eight in this anthology in which the Dalit writers delve into the past and into religious scriptures to discover anti-heroes who... had been pushed into the villainous realm by authors of the Brahminical order. Manu was adjudged the principal enemy because he had promulgated the social laws favourable to the upper classes. However, the spread of education and the rise of the print medium led to the articulation of voices of dissent and popularization of a different framework of history with new analytic tools. 																														The first Dalit work published was a poem by Heera Dom entitled, Achut kee Shikayat (Compliant of the untouchable). Umesh Kumar notes in his booklet, Bharatiye Achambha, that today the Dalits, backwards and religious minorities have a better standard of living because they can vote, a freedom available to them mainly through the efforts of B.R. Ambedkar. 																														In Mool Vansh Katha, G.B. Prashant extols Ambedkar as the one who gave dignity to the Dalits. But he urges them to reject Hinduism, and also to capture the power of the state instead of remaining satisfied with the available rights only.																														Two of the booklets in this collection are in verse form. One of these presents Ambedkars ideas while the other  songs composed by R.C. Bauddha  is a call to Dalits to adopt Buddhism in order to be rid of the caste system. No literary form is as effective in transmission as poetry, which explains why Dalit writers use poetry to communicate the piteous condition of untouchables in Indian society. The poems by Kanwal Bharati belong to this category.																														The other champion of the Dalit movement, besides Ambedkar, is the Swami Achhuanand, claims Chandrika Prasad Jagyasu. A pioneer of the Adi Hindu movement, Achhuanand theorized that the conquerors established a social system in which non-Aryans were dubbed sudras and pushed to a corner. We want to have our natural, civil and political rights restored, Swamiji asserted.																														Two plays have also been included in this anthology. Angulimal is an analysis of religion and society while Shambook Badh highlights the erudition and organizing skills of its hero, Shambook, to show that the spiritual wealth of India was not the gift of the Aryans alone. Thus Aryan supremacy was not the product of superior knowledge or military skills, but the result of conspiracy against and manipulation of the indigenous population.						PIYUS GANGULY

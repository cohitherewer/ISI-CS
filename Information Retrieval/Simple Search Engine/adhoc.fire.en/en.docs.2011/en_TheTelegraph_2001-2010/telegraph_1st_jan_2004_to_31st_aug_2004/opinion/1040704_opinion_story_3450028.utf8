The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, July 04, 2004 							 																						DEAD MANS BOOTSTop footballers perform better when playing for their clubs than while playing for their countries. Soccer thus confirms that the nation state is deadThe nation state has been fraying at the borders. The announcement of the demise of the nation state a few years ago by Mr Francis Fukuyama may have been a trifle premature as there was a sudden spurt of strong national feelings after the events now referred to as 9/11. But Mr Fukuyamas reading of current trends has received corroboration from a most unexpected  some might even say bizarre  source. The source is soccer, and the occasion is the Euro 2004 on which the curtain comes down tonight. The results and, more than that, the performance of individual top players confirm the overall impression that playing for ones country is no longer an inspiration for most of the stars. Patriotism does not stir footballers to dribble, to shoot and to score. This trend was first noticed in tennis, in the Davis Cup where the top players, representing their countries, always play below par. At one time, some of the top players even refused to play in the Davis Cup: their performance in that tournament in no way affected their rankings. It needed some amount of arm-twisting to get the stars back on the court for Davis Cup. Similarly, soccer players turn out for their country in the World Cup and the Euro, but they preserve their best for the clubs they represent. The players are only too conscious that their showing at the club level determines their market rates. Most soccer fans admit that despite the hype, the quality of football on show in the Euro was inferior to what fans see in club championships  the Primera Liga, the Premier League in England, the European Cup and the Champions League.																														Most of the great players looked tired. One only had to look at Zinedine Zidane  on reputation the greatest footballer in this tournament  to realize that he was weary after his seasonal stint with Real Madrid. Barring the two goals he scored in the dying minutes of Frances match against England and a few moves he initiated, there was little in Zidanes football that was really memorable. His Real Madrid colleague, David Beckham, sporting Englands colours, will have to make an effort to forget this tournament in which  belying his magic with the dead ball  he missed not one but two penalties. Missing one penalty is unfortunate, missing two is a disaster  one could say slightly altering the words Oscar Wilde put in the mouths of his characters. Beckham precipitated such a crisis. Patrick Vieira, all over the pitch when playing for Arsenal, was nowhere to be seen when playing for France.																														Tonight, when Greece meets Portugal  or as one wag said, when Socrates plays Saramago  Mr Fukuyama will encounter the nation state embodied in soccer. In a sense, this is a fixed match in favour of Mr Fukuyama. Overall global trends in many fields suggest that the nation state is living on borrowed time. Time has run out not only on the nation state as a viable political unit, the idea of the nation state, first set out in the 19th century, has run its course. All it needs is a firm kick for it to be caught in the net of history. Soccer will continue to flourish but a match between Real Madrid and Manchester United will surely produce better quality football than a match between England and Spain.

		 Friday, June 04, 2004 							 																						NOTHING IS BUT WHAT IS NOT				 	 Tricky gameWant to Play? By P.J. Tracy, Michael Joseph,  pound;6.99Gore is an indispensable part of the modern detective story. In Want to Play? the revelation of flamboyant incisions on the chests and stomachs of a kneeling old couple already shot dead at the back in a quiet rural Wisconsin church is exactly the kind of shock beginning that the contemporary addict would love. The nature of the crime, its victims and its setting immediately establish the presence of a slightly unbalanced, but determined, hatred that drives the story to its hideously blood-soaked end 410 pages later. 																					P.J. Tracys debut novel has woven together just the right mix of fetid psychology, bewildered sexualities, artfully concealed obsessions, rank fear, brittle courage, and skewed passions to hold the readers attention for all of those pages. There are also real policemen with private troubles, the monotony of routine police-work and unresolved love in uncongenial circumstances. The story unfolds around a clever computer-game. At each level of it is a murder, with the clues and backgrounds given, and the player has to locate the murderer by inference and elimination. Want to play? asks the screen, as the game begins.																					Tracys touch is light, and her narrative is quick-footed. It is not easy to pinpoint at which point the virtual world begins to take over the world of narrative reality, like a nerve-wracking parody of the life-imitates-art thesis. The series of copycat murders is like a tongue-in-cheek pointer to a deeper and far more frightening permeation of the real by the unreal in the minds of people apparently in perfect control of their lives. Nothing is quite what it seems to be.																					The modern detective novel has left behind a simpler world where a murder or a series of murders had an immediate cause or, at most, an easily comprehensible source in a remoter past. It was easier then to follow the eccentricities and illuminations of the single individual, whether a brilliant amateur like Margery Allinghams Thomas Campion, or a handsome policeman, like Ngaio Marshs Roderick Alleyn. It is no longer possible to say of the richly gory modern thriller that the story is over when the narrative begins, that is, the murder is the end of the real story, while the narrative of detection is the reconstruction of the plot. That was the special skill of the Marples and Maigrets. Now the first murder is just the tip of a pile of bodies, most of which are hidden in the past. There are two distinct narratives, one of the past and another of the present, and there is no escape for the thriller addict until the two converge.																					The new world of detection is also high-tech, where the dogged trudge of a relentless intelligence must be matched with the knowledge and mastery of the tools of reprography and communication. There are new enemies in cyberspace (hackers and spies), and new obstructions (firewalls and erasures). Tracy plays cheerfully with this new set of tools, making them not just part of routine police equipment, but the very locus of the crime.																					It is sensible, therefore, to have a whole team of professionals working on a crime, rather than one brilliant amateur with his less gifted foil. Tracy not only handles her police team with humour and deftness, she seems to take great joy in a large cast of characters. However contemporary her mode, her virtues are the old ones of the classic detective-fiction writer: she keeps the reader glued to the page, willingly believing in the incredible, and always a little afraid to trust in the characters. They all seem normal, but are always somehow touched with the sinister. That is what is most disturbing: one is not sure if the story is over when the book ends.						BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

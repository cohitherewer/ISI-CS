The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, February 16, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The going gets tough				 																																																				Sir  The inclusion of Hillary Clinton as a member of Americas top 25 tough guys by Mens Journal is unlikely to soften the hearts of the feminists in the United States of America (Hillary in tough-guy list, Feb 13). Toughness in America is an exclusive attribute of men who have the impeccable physical features now immortalized by Hollywood stars. Little wonder that Hillary shares the list with wrestlers, athletes, racers and martial artists  mostly men who are all brawn and little brain. The former first ladys nomination, for the tough-handling of her husband, is also a cruel joke on American women who often have to undergo the trauma of sexual assaults, date rapes and other forms of physical and mental violence. For a media accustomed to currying favours from the rich and famous, the senator from New York must have been an ideal choice. But Hillary should know that the real test of her strength lies in ensuring justice for people less fortunate than her husband.

				 																Gone down under				 																																																				Sir  The performance of the Indian cricket team in the VB series finals does not do justice to their talent (Too many negatives dogged India, Feb 10). This tour has been a very long one and our team gave the Australians a good fight in the test series. We also played well in the first two one day internationals. Cricket is a great leveller, and this time, India was at the receiving end. The critics view of Indians being paper tigers is not true. In the test series, Sachin Tendulkar had a bad run, but he came back in the final test with a double century. V.V.S. Laxman displayed superb batting form and got five centuries. Rahul Dravids class is unquestionable, while Sourav Ganguly carried the burden of the entire team and scored a brilliant hundred to save the first test. Irfan Pathan and Lakshmipathy Balaji bowled extremely well under pressure, and Rohan Gavaskar, who debuted in this series, showed perfect temperament and all-round skills. Veteran Anil Kumble was also the highest wicket-taker for India in the test series. The critics overlook these facts while dismissing the Indian team and the media tends to blow two under-performances out of proportion. Such reactions are an indication of the fact that we expect too much of the team.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sourav Ganguly and his team should be made to account for the poor performance of the Indian team in the finals of the VB series. It seems that the Indian team, including our captain and coach, John Wright, lacks the skills required at the highest levels. A test bowler is expected to bowl a good line in the slog overs. Both Ashish Nehra and Irfan Pathan showed that they do not have that skill. The present bowling line-up is, at best, good for club-level cricket. Also, Indian batsmen play one good innings for every nine bad ones  look at Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, and Hemang Badani. 				 																																																				The Indian captain also lacks leadership qualities. Captaincy is not about shouting for the wrong reasons. When the chips are down, a captain should lead from the front. Ganguly was so meek when he was batting that he complained to Ricky Ponting about sledging like a highschool student instead of reacting like a professional and complaining to the umpire. Wright failed to devise a good strategy, both in the world cup final and this time. India should consider Ian or Greg Chappell or Geoffrey Boycott as a consultant for big matches. They understand the game, as is evident from their impeccable television commentary. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sanjay K. Shukla, Marshfield, US

				 																																																				Sir  An impotent pace attack coupled with lacklustre batting and sloppy fielding from India made the VB series final a treat for the Australian supporters (India crumble against mammoth 359, Feb 9). Indian supporters were left high and dry by their teams lack of aggression. India should compete only in domestic tournaments. After losing the TVS Cup final on home soil, and now they have sold out to the Australians. Yours faithfully, 
 Richard Saviel, Highgate, Australia  Sir  The thrashing that India got in the two final matches of the VB series, apart from the three losses against Australia in the preliminary matches, shows that our cricket team runs more on hype than substance. Some time ago, former Pakistani skipper, Imran Khan, had created a stir by saying that Sachin Tendulkar is not a match-winner. He has been proved right again after the one-day series in Australia. It was sad to see Tendulkar being clean-bowled by a Brett Lee delivery in the first final. One may even argue that Simon Katich is a better player than Tendulkar as he saved the fourth test against India. Indian bowlers too are found wanting at the international level. Had the third contestant been any other team barring Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, India would not even have made it to the finals. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  How many more times should Sourav Ganguly praise Ashish Nehra despite his game being deeply flawed. Also, why did he leave out Ajit Agarkar and Rohan Gavaskar in the second final? He may find solace in the fact that losing against the world champions is not a matter of disgrace.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Menon, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The Indian cricket team is no better than the South Africans who win all their league matches and lose when it matters the most. Indias poor show needs to be analyzed and monetary fines imposed on each player who were in the team. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Indian cricket management should have the courage to drop Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar on the basis of their recent (non) performance during the series in Australia.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

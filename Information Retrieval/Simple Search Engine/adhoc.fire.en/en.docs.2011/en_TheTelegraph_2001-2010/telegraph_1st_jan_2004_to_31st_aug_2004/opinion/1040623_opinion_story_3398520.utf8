		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004  NOISES AFTER A QUIET REVOLUTION 
International aid for Liberias reconstruction may be puny, but there is no doubt about the earnestness with which change is desired, writes Jyotirmoy Pal Chaudhuri The author is former head, department of history, University of Liberia, Monrovia Slow to change On August 11, 2003, Charles Taylor, president of the west African state of Liberia, handed over power to his vice-president, Moses Blah, and, at the invitation of the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, headed for exile in Nigeria. The rather unusual ceremony of handing over power by an elected head of state before his term of office had expired was witnessed by several African leaders including Thabo Mbeki, John Kufuor, Joaquim Chissano, the presidents of South Africa, Ghana and Mozambique respectively. The presence of Chissano and Kufuor added extra significance to the ceremony because Chissano is the current chairman of the Africa Union, and Kufuor is the current chairman of the 16-member Economic Commission of West African States. Taylor is now at Calabar, a town in south-eastern Nigeria.Taylors decision to quit came in the wake of the tremendous pressure put on him by the participants of a conference held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, on June 4, 2003. The Accra conference was attended by representatives of the government of Liberia  which included Taylor himself  and leaders of the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia. The last two are the major rebel groups which had challenged Taylor, and after successfully establishing their control over the countryside, were about to capture Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. The peace talks were facilitated by the ECOWAS mediator and former Nigerian head of state, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, with the support of the representatives of the Africa Union and the secretary-general of the United Nations, Kofi Anan. At that meeting, Taylor said that he was prepared to step down for the sake of peace. By handing over power and leaving for Nigeria, Taylor, for a change, honoured his commitment. The people of Liberia got rid of a ruler who had subjected them to all kinds of suffering for a period of 14 years. Some significant political developments within Liberia, Taylors own adventures in the neighbouring states, and a series of bold diplomatic moves initiated by the African leaders had paved the way for the Accra meet.Liberia, a small republic of hardly three million people and land area of over 40,000 square miles, had been going through a bad patch since 1980, when Master Sergeant Samuel Doe staged a coup and captured power by killing President William Tolbert. Poorly equipped to handle affairs of a modern state, Does administration was characterized by rampant corruption, and brutal suppression of political opposition, individual and press freedom. Doe survived for about ten years but despite the tremendous diplomatic and economic support he received from Ronald Reagans America, the Liberian economy, which, at one time was one of the best in Africa, was totally destroyed by poor governance during his rule.Taking advantage of the popular discontent, Taylor  who went to college in the United States of America for his degree in economics, and, during the late Eighties, was living in exile in that country  formed the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, and in 1989, launched a movement to oust Doe. NPFL had acquired considerable fire power through deals Taylor had struck with Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso. The uprising led to one of Africas most brutal civil wars, involving at least seven rival factions and claiming 250,000 lives. In September 1990, Doe was assassinated but fighting among various factions continued. In April 1996, through the initiative of ECOWAS, a peace agreement was signed and in July 1997, elections were held. In the elections, Taylor, who had emerged as the strongest warlord, won. Liberians voted for Taylor because they knew that if Taylor, who by then controlled most of the country including the areas which had the iron mines, diamond, timber and rubber, did not win, the fighting would not end.Unfortunately, President Taylor did not behave differently from warlord Taylor. Instead of ameliorating the miseries the Liberians were subjected to for ten years by Doe and the seven years of civil war that followed his assassination, Taylor gave Liberia an administration which was corrupt, oppressive and universally hated by the people. What was worse, Taylor got obsessed with the idea of extension of his political influence and control over the neighbouring states of Sierra Leone, Guinea and lvory Coast.In Sierra Leone, Taylor sponsored Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader whose Revolutionary United Front controlled the diamond mining areas in the south-eastern parts of the country and challenged Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, the democratically-elected president of the country. Taylor sent his boys across Liberias northern borders to trouble Lansana Conteh, the president of Guinea. Even Ivory Coast, which in the late Eighties had helped him, was not spared. Taylor sent three of his notorious lieutenants there to create problems for President Laurent Gbago. The wealth Taylor acquired by dealing in blood diamonds and Liberian timber was used to maintain a dictatorship at home and perpetrate destabilization in the neighbouring states. The UN, convinced of Taylors vicious role in the export of terror and the trade in blood diamonds, slapped sanctions on Liberia. At the same time, a UN mandated court in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, indicted Taylor for war crimes relating to civil war in Sierra Leone.The leaders of west African states, working through ECOWAS with the support of the Africa Union, had expressed their deep concern for the state of affairs in Liberia and had taken an active role in bringing an end to the civil war. ECOWAS sent a peace-keeping force in 1992, and on several occasions, brought the warring factions to peace talks and even got them to sign agreements. With a belligerent Charles Taylor as a major party, these agreements, more often than not, proved to be brittle. Flush with diamond and timber money, Taylor could not care less. But the great success of LURD and MODEL at home, UN sanctions and the demand for his trial for war crimes  Taylor was referred to as Africas Milosevic  and the tremendous pressure from African leaders, the UN-backed International Contact Group which had the US and Britain as members, forced Taylor to accept the reality. He realized that he had no choice but to step down.The comprehensive peace agreement signed at Accra on August 18, 2003, by all parties authorized Moses Blah, Taylors vice-president, to lead a caretaker government till October 14, 2003, when the 76-member Transitional National Government of Liberia would be sworn in. Representatives of LURD, MODEL, Taylors group  which constituted the government of Liberia at that time, all political parties, various countries and important groups drawn from civil society would comprise the TNGL. It would choose a chairman who would be the head of state. Elections would take place in October 2005, and the chairman of the TNGL would hand over power to the elected president in January 2006. The major task of the TNGL would be to demobilize, disarm, reintegrate and rehabilitate about 38,000 soldiers, many of whom were children who were made to fight by all the warring groups. To induce the over-200,000 Liberians who had left the country either for other African countries or the US or Europe to come back to Liberia, rebuild the ravaged infrastructure and the ruined economy would, of course, be the other major responsibilities. A tall order indeed for a motley group to accomplish in a country which had gone trough continual bloodshed and bad governance for 24 years. Charles Gyudie Bryant, a successful businessman, emerged as the consensus candidate for heading the TNGL. On October 14, 2003, the new government was sworn in.The UN demonstrated its total support for the TNGL through a resolution adopted by the security council and authorized the deployment of a 15,000 strong multinational force to be called the United Nations Mission in Liberia to facilitate implementation of the Accra peace agreement. The secretary-general appointed Jacques Klein, a retired US air force officer who was involved in the work of reconstruction in Bosnia, as his special representative in Liberia. Troops sent by ECOWAS now wear black berets and are a part of UNMIL.Charles Gyide Bryant has a bumpy road ahead of him. Fortunately, for him, the international community has been impressed by the smooth and peaceful transition of power that took place in Liberia, and many countries are coming forward to extend a helping hand in rebuilding the country. On February 6, 2004, an International Reconstruction Conference on Liberia was held in New York. Colin Powell, Kofi Annan, a team from the European Union and representatives from 106 countries attended the conference and pledged to donate $520 million to Liberia.Some are happy over the outcome of the New York conference; some are not. Two billion for Kosovo, one hundred and fifty billion a year on Iraq, forty billion a year on Afghanistan and only half a billion for Liberia  this is not fair they say. Opinions on the outcome of the New York meet may differ but there is no controversy as to what they would all like to see happen in Liberia. Everybody would love to see supply of power and running water back in Monrovia, schools reopened, teachers paid their salary on time and above all, children carrying books on their back and not AK-47s.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Minority report				 																																																				Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees decision to ban Taslima Nasreens Dwikhandita is a perfect example of tokenism from a man who knows that he has nothing to show in terms of real work in the areas that count (Quick to ban book, little to show in jobs, Jan 13). Coming down much too heavily on Dwikhandita on grounds that the book could have endangered communal harmony is strange coming from the man who declared madrassahs to be the breeding grounds of Islamic terrorism. For all Bhattacharjees claims of his state being the most minority-friendly, Muslims continue to be discriminated against in the spheres of jobs, education and healthcare. Banning a book is not about to solve any of these problems. But then, Bhattacharjee is a politician first. His overtures towards Muslims are a crafty political manoeuvre, aimed at consolidating the minority vote bank. In this respect, there is little difference between red and saffron, given the BJPs new-found friendliness towards Pakistan and Muslims in general.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Islam Bakht, Calcutta
				 																Misplaced pride				 																																																				Sir  Mixing politics with culture is not new, but India is heading towards dangerous times as a ban culture gains acceptance (Maharashtra bans book on Shivaji, Jan 15). That the activists of the Sambhaji Brigade, responsible for the attack on the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, are being hailed as upholders of Maratha pride speaks volumes for the fundamentalist threat looming large over the country. In banning James Laines book, which allegedly questions Shivajis parentage, the Maharashtra government has given in to fundamentalist pressures. Being intolerant to criticism is as unhealthy as refusing to accept human foibles in historical figures. Historical research cannot flourish in an ambience of fear.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir Two events have demonstrated the poor state of governance in Maharashtra. The first is the vandalizing of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute by some Hindu fanatics (Mob ransacks research institute, Jan 6). They ransacked the institute, which houses one of the biggest archives of historical documents in the country. Instead of invoking the law to counter such vandalism, the state government banned the book at the bidding of the fundamentalists. 				 																																																				Some years ago, some Muslim orgnizations had threatened to blacken Salman Rushdies face and had even announced a reward of one lakh rupees for anyone who did it. They also held a rally with banners like Kill Salman Rushdie and challenged him to enter Mumbai. The Maharashtra government played the silent spectator. Civil society should put pressure on the government to take action against groups or individuals who terrorize society.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shailesh Gandhi, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir Shivaji was a great Maratha warrior whose valour remains unmatched in Indian history. He is as much a cultural icon of the Marathis as he is for the rest of India. Therefore, any work which is disrespectful to the mighty historical figure needs to be censored by the concerned authorities, keeping in mind the popular sentiment. The Maharashtra government deserves to be congratulated.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Deb, Calcutta

				 																Men of dishonour				 																																																				Sir  Unbelievable but true, gender discrimination is still a fact of life in many countries even in the 21st century (Lifting of ban on women singers irks Afghan court, Jan 15). Whether it is Afghanistan or India, honour killings, restricted mobility, censure are the lot of women. Veil ripped off honour killings (Jan 13) about the horrific practice in Rajasthan also reflects the agony of women who are powerless. It is a shame that on the one hand, we are thinking about setting a station on moon, and on the other, women continue to get killed in the name of preserving family honour. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir Women are easy prey to harassment in the villages owing to illiteracy, poverty, ignorance and lopsided social norms (Surviving the male gaze, Dec 31). But they are not any better off in the cities, where they are victims of eve-teasing and other forms of violence. Sensitization of men is the only remedy to these ills.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.N. Bose, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Every conviction for a crime against women brings joy. So has 10 years in jail for tease trio (Dec 20). Three despicable social creatures have been put behind bars. Deshdulal Chatterjee should also be praised for ignoring the religion barrier and marrying the victim.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N. Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir Anuradha Sengupta and Dola Mitra have done great service by focussing on the violence faced by men (The invisible man, Dec 28). Article 498A of the Indian Penal Code, which empowers a woman to lodge a complaint against her husband and in-laws in case she is subjected to torture and demands of money after marriage, is open to misuse. We need more organizations like the Pirito Purush Poti Parishad to protect men from being harassed. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																No smoke without fire				 																																																				Sir  Burning of non-fuel materials like agricultural refuse, leaves, plastic, tyres, municipal and hospital wastes, either in the open or in an oven is currently not an offence under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Constitution desires that If the state government, after consultation with the state board, is of the opinion that the burning of any material (not being fuel) in any air pollution control area or part thereof may cause or likely to cause air pollution, it may, by notification in the official gazzette, prohibit the burning of such material in such area or part thereof. Since the whole of West Bengal is a declared air pollution controlled area, the state government must notify the names of all combustible non-fuel materials, open burning of which ought to be prohibited here. West Bengals example may serve as a model for Delhi and the other states in the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sivabrata Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir The acute sound pollution created by frequent pop music programmes at the Nazrul Mancha needs to be controlled, keeping in mind the plight of the panic-stricken birds on nearby trees. This is too high a price to pay for merry-making. The administration has to ensure that the city is not left without any feathered friends.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

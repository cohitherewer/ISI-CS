The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 							 																						FOR AN INDIA CONFUSINGThis Above All / Khushwant Singh				 	 A typical Sardar																					We had a surfeit of election coverage in our media. I was upto my neck with all I could swallow from the time the Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced that he would go to the country for another term of five years before the present one was over. We were told to feel good, to see India shining and vote for those who made us feel good and gave Mother India fresh radiance on her fair face. We were also told that the feel good and shine on the face was a lot of eyewash and the little that India had achieved was not under Vajpayees rule but initiated by his predecessors of the Congress. 																					I did not know what to believe. The public opinion and the exit polls further compounded my confusion. They seemed to be as much based on guess-work and personal bias as they were on samples of voters views. For me it was neither feeling good nor seeing India shining but an India confusing.																					Being stuck in a small rickshaw cantonment in the Shivaliks with no TV to help me keep up with the events, I had to rely entirely on papers published in Chandigarh and Jalandhar. Never before in any election campaign had I seen issues that really matter put on the back-burner and personal attacks on the character of rivals brought to the forefront. 																					Punjab was the worst. Day after day papers carried half-page advertisements. One showing the chief minister, Amarinder Singh, as a sharaabi-kababi (hard-drinker, big eater), with a nubile young lady filling his glass of wine. Not to be outdone another page had Prakash Singh Badal and his son (the Akalis) depicted as bade-mian and chhotey mian outdoing each other in the amount of cash and property they had amassed. Where was the Election Commission? Who paid for these advertisements?																					If the elections were confusing, their outcome was confounding. No one really believed that the BJP-led coalition would be defeated and the Congress stage a spectacular come-back. I for one admit I am delighted to find I was proved wrong. Much as I have affection and respect for men like Vajpayee, Jaswant Singh, Jagmohan and Arun Shourie, I felt the party they belonged to deserved to be rejected by the people. I regard the outcome as a decisive verdict in favour of secularism and rejection of religiously motivated politics of the fundoos.																					Big and violent																					There is a young man in town who, under his fathers orders, calls on me once a week to have a meaningful dialogue on matters of national interest. Bapu says you must see that buddha Sardarji off and on and get his views on subjects that interest you, he tells me. As a token, he gives me a ball-point pen as guru dakshina every time he visits me. His main interests are film stars, cricketers and politicians. Our dialogue goes somewhat as follows:																					What do you think of Aishwarya Rai? he asks																					Very beautiful.																					How many marks do you give her?																					Ten out of ten. Also, to Sushmita Sen, who is both beautiful and bright.																					and Hema Malini?																					I used to give her ten out of ten; but since she became the second wife of Dharmendra, I have reduced her count to five out of ten. She also tells lies. She is an Iyengar Brahmin, which is true. But she calls Dharmendra a good Hindu, which he is not. He is a Deol Jat Sikh. I am not sure if both converted to Islam pro tem to get married but there is no doubt that their relationship is bigamous and against the law of the land. Dara Singh calls Dharmendra a simpleton. I agree. I use the same word for Dara Singh. He was pehelwan. He made a good Hanuman. He should wear a tail on his buttocks and jump about, but keep out of politics. I give him three out of ten.																					Poonam Dhillon?																					Only seen her photographs. Okay to look at. Not much in the upper story. Two out of ten.																					You dont like film people going into politics? he asked. 																					Not as a rule. People should stick to doing what they can do best. There can be exceptions. I give Shabana Azmi ten out of ten. If I could, I would give more; good looker, superb actress, dedicated social worker. The same for Sunil Dutt: good actor, saintly person. About Vinod Khanna, I know nothing. That doesnt apply to Shatrughan Sinha. I know him: first rate orator, second rate actor, third-rate minister of government.																					There are different kinds of people in films: actors, directors, producers, distributors. Of these actors get more exposure and therefore draw more crowds. There were M.G. Ramachandran and N.T. Rama Rao. Producer-directors like Karunanidhi and Chandrababu. So different marks for different people. Full marks for Chandrababu Naidu. By any reckoning he was the best chief minister any state had. You have to go to Hyderabad to see what he has done to Andhra Pradesh. But the people have rejected him.																					What about cricketers? You think they should join politics?																					Whether I think they should or should not, they will do so if they get as much applause and money as they did when they scored centuries. Take for example this Sidhu fellow. As handsome and powerfully built a Sardar as can be seen anywhere. Also has a violent temper. His is a bigger gas bag than Shatrughan Sinha. In the Lok Sabha, he will give that Bihari a run for his money. Shatru is now low on gas; Sidhu had his tank filled up recently at the parliament street petrol pump.																					And that Jat boy from Najafgarh who scored three centuries against Pakistan. Hes probably read nothing besides books on cricket. But his pitaji who knows which side his chapati is buttered volunteered to offer his son to canvass for Sahib Singh Verma. It could not prevent Vermas downfall.																					You have left out Jayalalithaa?																					Deliberately, I replied. She is in a class of her own. Very good to look at in her younger days. Now somewhat bloated. Never saw any of her films as I dont follow Tamil. A bit of an enigma, a Brahmin leading an anti-Brahmin party. Democratically elected dictator with dictatorial ways. She had Karunanidhi roughed up. Vaiko locked in jail. Doesnt take a step without consulting her astrologers. If she becomes the queen of Bharatvarsha as is predicted for her, no one will be allowed to break wind without first seeking her permission. I will take the first flight out of India.

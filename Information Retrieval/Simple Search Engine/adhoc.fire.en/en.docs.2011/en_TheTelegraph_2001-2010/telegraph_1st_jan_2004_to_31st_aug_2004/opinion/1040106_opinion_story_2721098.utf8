		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004  AFTER SADDAM, CHAOS RULES 
 Arshi Khan 
	The capture of Saddam Hussein on December 13 has raised  many questions about the future of Iraq. Will the illegal  occupation of Iraq by the United States of America bring  peace, stability and democracy to the country? Will such  democracy conform to the principles of modern governance?  And will the United Nations be the catalyst in restoring  the sovereign rights of Iraqis, now or later?  
	The neo-conservatives in the US have made Iraq the nub  of their strategic doctrine of benevolent dominance  of the world. And events are moving in their desired direction.  The liberals in the West have finally come around, under  the face-saver of bringing about democracy and freedom in  west Asia. The former communist states of Europe are trusted  partners in the US occupation of Iraq. Most Arab countries  have chosen support for the US strategy over defiance, while  other Afro-Asian countries are following the usual policy  of benign neglect of Iraq. Only Syria has been consistently  emphasizing the need to safeguard the unity and sovereignty  of Iraq, as guaranteed by international law.  
	Most Iraqis have denounced the US as an aggressor. To them,  the issue was not Saddam Husseins capture but the  lifting of sanctions, which were harming Iraqi citizens.  The US has been talking about the reconstruction of Iraq,  but even if the occupiers leave the country now, it will  take many years to restore it to its pre-war condition.  
	Cut him to size 
	It may be recalled that Saddam Hussein was aided by the  Americans in the war against Iran and the campaign against  the Kurds. But he became a liability when he got too assertive,  particularly in the Persian Gulf region. Is it any wonder  that the world now feels that Saddam Hussein has been punished  for his defiance of US authoritarianism, support for the  Palestinians, agreements with Iraqs neighbours and  moves to bring about Arab solidarity? 
	Arabs and people all over the world are even more outraged  at the US aggression because they remember the many compromises  Saddam Hussein had made submitting all documents  relating to weapons of mass destruction to the UN as well  as allowing inspectors unlimited access, and permission  to surveillance flights. Their outrage has been strengthened  by the fact that no WMD has been found in Iraq. 
 Such is its double-standards that the US has never paid  any attention to para 14 of the security council resolution  687 (pertaining to a WMD-free west Asia) under which the  number of Israeli nuclear weapons increased from 14 in 1967  to 400 in 2002.  
	Imperial designs 
	Iraq will remain unstable under the US policy of encouraging  the presence of the Kurds in Iraqi affairs. By deliberately  fomenting Shia-Sunni discord and aiding Iraqi opposition,  Iraq will remain unstable and divided.  
	The two words, freedom and democracy,  used to justify the US war, have been frequently used by  the two countries with imperial ambitions France  and later Britain to quell popular rebellions against  them or to defeat the Ottomans after World War I. 
 The US is perhaps looking to make Iraq a semi-permanent  military base from which to control west Asia. The project  has already got underway with the imposition of sanctions  against Syria. Iran is now firmly under the control of the  International Atomic Energy Association, while Libya has  announced its surrender to the US.  
	Interestingly, occupying powers have a dismal record in  promoting democracy where the prime motive has been exploitation  and hegemony. In west Asia, the imperial forces have traditionally  promoted sectarian divide, tribal rivalries and crushed  popular revolt. They have also kept the Arabs at war with  each other.  
	In Iraq, the new measures adopted so far imposing  a puppet interim government, creating a new Iraqi army and  police force, and victimizing the opposition are  evidence that the US-sponsored structures of governance  in Iraq lack legitimacy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 							 																						QUIT NOTICE																														The fear of the outsider is an old phenomenon in Indias North-east. Often, it is a reflection of a small communitys sense of insecurity. The flare-up in Nagaland over the rape of a four-year-old child allegedly by Bangladeshi settlers, however, suggests hatred more than fear. It was a horrible crime that would have triggered a public outrage anyway. But the suspected involvement of Bangladeshi infiltrators has given a completely different dimension to the incident. The Naga Students Federations quit notice to outsiders in the wake of the crime may have been an exaggerated reaction. But it is crucial to understand why the students group reacted the way it did. It was essentially an ethnic communitys sense of isolation and insecurity that prompted it to link the crime to the bigger problem of an imagined threat from outsiders. Certainly, the Bihari labourers who worked in Nagaland posed no such threat. Nor did the genuine residents of Assam who had gone to the neighbouring state in search of a meagre living. It is not disputed that many outsiders, especially those working on development projects, are helping the states economy.																														The Bangladeshi influx is, however, a different issue. Two kinds of failure have complicated the problem for several states in the region. One is the big administrative failure which leaves too many loopholes in identifying and deporting illegal migrants from Bangladesh. The government in New Delhi must share the blame for this failure with the local authorities. Even as governments cry foul over the influx, there seems to be no serious attempt at putting a system in place to check the influx. The other failure is political. Many local politicians have no qualms about using the illegal migrants as vote-banks. The most glaring example of this has been in Assam. The Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act failed to work there primarily because of the lack of political will. It is time the Union and state governments realized the cost of their indifference.

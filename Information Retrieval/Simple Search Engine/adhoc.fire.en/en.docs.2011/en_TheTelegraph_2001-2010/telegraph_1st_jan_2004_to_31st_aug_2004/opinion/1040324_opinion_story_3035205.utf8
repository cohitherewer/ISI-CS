		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 							 																						BY THE RIVERS OF TIME Shobita Punja																					One of the most profoundly thrilling experiences in Varanasi is seeing the river move constantly past the ghats, framed by a window or temple doorway. This framing of the flowing river is a deeply meaningful picture because here you see life going by, or time moving on. The meaning of the observation that nothing, not even life, stands still, echoes everywhere in such cities.																					In Varanasi or Maheshwar, and in the mighty Brahmaputra flowing past Guwahati, the movement of the river is a constant reminder that time waits for no one. This adds a charge and dynamism to thoughts and to life. Many great, modern, vibrant cities are famous because of their rivers, and London is a perfect example.																					Delhi was built on the river Yamuna that served to protect it on one side in medieval times. Humayuns Tomb and the Red Fort looked out onto the enormous expanse of water that brought cool, wet breezes into the palace halls and dusty city streets. Today, Delhi has literally turned its backside to the Yamuna, excreting into the river all its filth, so that by the time the river leaves the great capital, it is nothing more than a contaminated sewage-line.																					Let the breeze blow																					Many cities, like Bangalore, had an amazing water system. Water from the high grounds collected in 90 lakes, cooling the city and giving it a lush greenery and the name, garden city of India. Water filtered into the ground and fed the underground canals and wells. Today, town-planners and politicians are converting these life-giving lakes into bus terminals. Politicians love turning lakes into football stadiums, as this is another occasion to be chief guest at an inaugural function, with press coverage and publicity, to tell the world how much they have done for their city and their voting public. Can a football stadium be compared to a lake? Is it better for anyones health or the future?																					The lakes in Bhopal, built centuries ago, still give the city a special feel. A hundred and twenty lakes in Hyderabad, now protected by law, offer sudden and welcome relief from crowds and clutter. From the claustrophobic heat and dust of the city comes the cool breeze as it sweeps across the lake waters. Its a place where people walk with their families in the evenings. For the poor, who have no space in their homes to meet and talk with friends and family, the lakeside offers a space where evenings can be spent without tension and by taking a calm walk by the lake.																					In Khajuraho, there was found a unique water system that had been used in ancient times to keep the cycle of water constant and pure. Water running off the low hills and gradients was collected into shallow lakes. This water was held through the year in these lakes, and as the water filtered into the soil, it recharged the ground water. The lake-water was also filtered and cleansed by the soil and rocks over which it passed as it resurfaced in wells as clean drinking water. Each lake is an integrated unit; with a well for drinking water for the community and a temple near its edge. The gods protected the water that provided the essential ingredients for agriculture and clean living.																					Steps to the water																					But the most ingenious water structures, unique to India, are the step-wells of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Here, fearing that the heat of summer would swallow up and evaporate the precious waters collected in the slim monsoon season, the people of this region built elaborate wells that served as water-stores.																					The well had a roof over it to limit evaporation by the sun, and steps down to each storey or level of the well. Each storey of the step-well was beautifully carved and decorated with pillars and sculptures and served as a place where village-women could meet and talk as they collected water. As summer advanced, the water-level fell, the steps would lead down further to another storey and the water.																					As summer begins and the water-levels begin to fall, it is time to make a case to preserve our traditional water-harvesting systems and to appreciate the magnitude of simple ideas.

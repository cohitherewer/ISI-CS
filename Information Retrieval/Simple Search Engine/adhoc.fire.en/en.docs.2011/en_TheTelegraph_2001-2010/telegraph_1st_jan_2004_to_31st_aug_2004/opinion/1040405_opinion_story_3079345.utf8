		 Monday, April 05, 2004 							 																						PERMISSION DENIED Rather than protecting the rights of tribals, the system of permits is used in the North-east to hound out refugees and traders, writes Sudipta Bhattacharjee				 	 On the run																														The Dornier took off from Kochi and droned across the Arabian sea for a couple of hours before a tiny cluster of emerald isles appeared below. The aircraft banked above the westernmost island and landed dextrously on Agatti, the only airstrip in Lakshadweep. Relieved and excited tourists were herded into the one-room terminal while a stringent check was carried out on their entry permits.																														Lakshadweep is one of the strategically located and demographically unique states and Union territories in India to which entry is regulated. Among the passengers was a Mizo government official, native of a state where outsiders need an entry permit. However, being clueless about the requirement of permits to enjoy a weekend break on the islands, he was sternly informed that the term government officer would cut no ice and sent back on the return flight.																														This is how permit inspection is supposed to work. But in the North-east, where three states  Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland  are governed by the inner-line permit system, procedural rules are practically non-existent. In Arunachal Pradesh, there is a desk at the Naharlagun helipad for cursory inspection of permits, but road travellers are seldom checked. In Mizoram, airport officials are so delighted when a flight actually lands (inclement weather and a tricky terrain often force pilots to beat a retreat) that mandatory checking rules are thrown to the winds. Nagaland hardly gets any tourists, which probably accounts for its low permit fees.																														Implemented under the East Bengal Frontier Regulation Act by the British, the ILP today comes with a validity ranging from a week (for tourists) to six months (for skilled workers). Its intention is to keep the demographic profile intact by checking infiltration. The permit helps sift the Indian population from illegal migrants from neighbouring countries and is therefore prevalent in border states.																														Applying for permits, however, can often become an irritant for prospective visitors. In the case of Arunachal, there is no way one can admit to being a journalist assigned to cover elections in the state. The chief minister, it appears, does not approve of scribes. Is there a way out? Write in the application form that you are a teacher wishing to tour the beautiful state, one is advised. This is an imposed loophole, possible because no proof of identity is sought and a politicians whims are being pandered to. The offices of resident commissioners/liaison officers (in Delhi, Calcutta, Guwahati and Itanagar) issuing these permits (at the rate of Rs 15 per sector) must have sent enough teachers by now to have made the total literacy campaign in Arunachal a resounding success. All one gains from the exercise is a piece of paper to add to travel memorabilia, since no one so much as glances at it.																														Despite being considered a regressive step for tourism, the permits are tolerated as they generate revenue. But like the varying cultural mosaic of the sister states, the rates differ, ranging from Rs 20 per head for a week in Nagaland to Rs 120 per head for a fortnight in Mizoram. A uniform rate would have made it less confusing for travellers.																														However, the crisis over the permits is not so much to do with tourists as with settlers. The reason why there is a growing clamour for imposition of the ILP even in tribal-dominated states which have done away with it is that this is a handy tool at election time. This is our land, throw out the aliens, goes the clichd campaign refrain. As with all matters promoted by vested interests, corruption is widespread. (Lapsed ILPs are usually renewed by bribing the police.) There has been some xenophobic bloodshed over this as well. 																														The alarming aspect is that youth organizations have been allowed to take matters into their hands, deporting and terrorizing in the name of ILP violations. Initially conceived as a means of preserving indigenous culture and protecting the rights of local tribals, the permit is being used today as a weapon for hounding out refugees and traders, as well as to facilitate extortion. 																														For instance, in Nagaland last month (March 18), the Naga Students Federation deported hundreds of non-tribals while the state administration pleaded ignorance. The migrants were first identified, then herded into a playground with their hands tied behind their back and then sent out of the state by truckloads. The incident brings to mind the attack on Biharis in Assam following assaults on train passengers from the North-east in Bihar late last year. At that time, too, the activists went on the rampage while the administration remained a passive onlooker. Similar is the case in most other northeastern states. 																														These anti-foreigner drives inevitably get a boost when elections draw near, giving political parties maximum mileage. Politicians whip up ethnic sentiments with hyperbolic speeches targeting the sensitive tribal psyche. Inevitable comparisons are made with Tripura, where non-tribals have outnumbered the indigenous population. 																														On a visit to Itanagar, the capital of Arunachal Pradesh, it is common to encounter graffitis such as Chakmas, dogs, go back, prominently displayed in public places. In Mizoram, a students association, the Mizo Zirlai Pawl, has even set a deadline of April 7 for non-Mizos to leave the state. This is surprising, given that the state recently won praise from the Centre for being the most peaceful in the region. In Manipur, the Ibobi Singh government jailed 20 Bangladeshis in February under the Foreigners Act. The legislators sought a resolution to usher in the ILP to curb infiltration. Of its 24-lakh population, of which tribals account for 7.13 lakh, the number of migrants in Manipur has been estimated at 7.96 lakh already. While the assembly move was legitimate, even underground outfits like the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup issued a warning in December to Hindi-speaking migrants to leave the state. To bolster its threat of stern action for non-compliance, the banned outfit quoted the strict new immigration laws in the United States of America.																														In Meghalaya, it was the Garo Students Union which demanded imposition of the ILP last year to check influx. Around the same time, the Tribal Youth Federation, a frontal organization of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Tripura, called for extension of the inner-line regulations to the Autonomous District Council areas to preserve the tribal majority. 																														But is the permit really worth imposing or retaining? It earns meagre revenue and has been misused and manipulated. Militants and illegal migrants continue to have easy access to the permit areas, threatening the security of the people and the country. In this era of cable television, attempts to use the inner-line permit to reduce the peripheral region to the remotest corner are bound to boomerang. A proactive administration would do well to streamline the permit mechanism so that economic development can be ushered in without having to turn the state and its inhabitants into a classic case of a cultural museum. On the other hand, the governments reluctance to do away with it is understandable. Indias security concerns are now governed by a host of influx-related conflicts, such as the demand for self-determination, autonomy, ethnic conflagration, economic disorder, increased flow of arms, and tussle over the plight of internally-displaced persons like the Chakmas, Reangs and Hajongs. With the general elections beginning this month, the political decision-makers are allowing permit-related matters to fester to serve their own ends. But the repercussions will surely be felt for a long time to come.

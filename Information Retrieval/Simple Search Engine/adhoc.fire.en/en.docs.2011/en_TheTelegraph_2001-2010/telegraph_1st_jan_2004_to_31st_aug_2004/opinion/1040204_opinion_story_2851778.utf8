The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																With a little help from friends				 																																																				Sir  Mulayam Singh Yadav has found his good fairies in Anil Ambani and Subrata Roy, who will transform Uttar Pradesh with one wave of their magic wands (Birthday amp; brother help UP shine, Jan 28). With Reliance promising Rs 10,000 crore and the Sahara group a slew of projects on everything from roads to health to drinking water, all Yadavs problems have vanished into thin air. Indeed, it is strange that politicians did not earlier think of making such innovative use of their industrialist friends. Or is it that Yadavs friends are extra generous? And if they arent  which is more likely since businessmen only care for profits  has Yadav given them a deal they cant refuse? But what seems most likely is that all this talk of making UP an udaharan pradesh (exemplary state) is just a lot of hot air, the promises of power projects, houses, water and roads will be forgotten as soon as the elections are over. After all, fairy magic only lasts till the stroke of midnight. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,  Ranjan Sengupta, Calcutta
				 																																																				Interesting times				 																																																				Sir  The foreign policy of a country should indeed be guided by self-interest, as S.L. Rao stresses in Way to power (Jan 19). But where does Indias self-interest lie? Does it lie in blindly following the United States of America and the European Union? The social, cultural, economic and political needs of different countries vary as do the needs of developed countries and developing ones. Rao lauds the economic and foreign policy decisions of the National Democratic Alliance government, and says that they were taken considering what was right for India. 				 																																																				But the US never shows any consideration for other countries when taking economic or political decisions. This has been proved several times. Take its stand on withdrawing from the Kyoto protocol to limit greenhouse gases, the anti-dumping duties levied on Indian steel, high subsidies given to its farming sector and so on. After the end of the Cold War, the US has undertaken several military operations against hostile countries, but it has been quiet on Pakistani support for terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. Indias self-interest lies in having economic and political policies which benefit its poor and downtrodden, not the US and EU. Only then can India become self-reliant and strong.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  India has deviated from the Nehruvian policy of non-alignment on a number of occasions. But past failures must not be the reason to throw away a policy that was guided by morality and was followed for many years. Also, foreign policy must aim to ensure a better and more peaceful future, which means morality must be an integral part of it. 				 																																																				The good relations we share with the US and Israel today do serve our self-interest but we must continue to criticize Israeli oppression of the Palestinians and help further peace in west Asia  and not merely for the sake of oil and remittances from migrants. Similarly, the dialogue with Pakistan, which began again recently, will not only help bring peace to Jammu and Kashmir but it will also help India regain the high moral ground. 				 																																																				India stopped aiding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, realizing that such assistance was immoral and could turn out to be counter-productive. Indias friendship with the military rulers in Myanmar serves our strategic interest by negating the Chinese influence over that country and by destroying the bases of northeastern rebels. But we also support the democracy movement in that country because only democracy can bring prosperity to the people of Myanmar. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ratnanka Bhattacharya, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  S.L. Rao is being pragmatic when he says that India should look to its own interests and not protest at the US occupation of Iraq or Israeli atrocities on Palestinians. But even if the government ignores such instances of wrong-doing, the media, artists, film-makers and NGOs should rise above selfishness and acquaint people with the reality so that people can side with what is just. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Rajeev Bagra, Baidyabati

				 																Stench of nuisance				 																																																				Sir  The area to the right of the Missionaries of Charity dispensary in Sealdah is a nightmare for pedestrians, especially that along the vendors pathway to the Sealdah (south) railway station. There used to be urinals here once, but only half-broken walls and rubble remain. People have lately started urinating on a wall along the road which has a message asking people not to urinate. The stench of urine is strong enough to stifle passersby. There is a toilet inside the railway station but it is always crowded and so many do not have a choice but to urinate wherever they can. The railway or municipal authorities must take immediate steps to clean the area, and set up toilets for commuters.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debarshi Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  When you drive into Sealdah station through the magnificent blue gate that clearly reads entry, and a railway police hawaldar beckons you in, you shouldnt! Because if you do, and you are not a VIP, the hawaldar will take you to his chief who will threaten to seize your licence, tax-token and insurance, or force you to part with rupees one hundred only. On republic day, I and two other gentlemen paid up to avoid the red-tape. This letter is not intended to malign the hawaldar or his chief or his chiefs chief. But this is to caution the reader who values his hard-earned money and drives into Sealdah station.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

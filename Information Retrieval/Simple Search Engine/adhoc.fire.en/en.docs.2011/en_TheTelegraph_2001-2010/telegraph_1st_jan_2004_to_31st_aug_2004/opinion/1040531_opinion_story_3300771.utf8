The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 31, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Perfect timing				 																																																				Sir  There are very few examples of perfect farewells in the game of cricket. However, when the former England captain, Nasser Hussain, decided to call it a day, he proved to be an exception to this rule (Nasser Hussain bows out in style, May 28). His century, which ensured an English victory against the Black Caps, was a classic instance of a player retiring when on top of his game. This rare achievement has eluded some of the games other greats  Sir Donald Bradman and our very own Sunil Gavaskar did not bother to trouble the scorers in their last innings. Also, Hussains decision was furthered by his desire not to stand in the way of promising young cricketers from playing in the English team. This is a rare gesture, considering the fact that glamour and sizeable pay packets are part and parcel of the modern game. They often force old horses to ply their trade well past their prime. All in all, Hussain belongs to that rare breed who are gentlemen first and cricketers next. Yours faithfully, 
Anand Mukherjee, Calcutta Loose talk				 																																																				Sir  The recent bloodbath at the stock market only shows that the left cannot be trusted (22 minutes of madness, May 18). The uncalled for unilateral policy announcements of the left leaders were largely responsible for triggering off the debacle. The likes of Sitaram Yechury and A.B. Bardhan fail to realize that growth cannot happen without a vision. 				 																																																				The situation in Bengal gives a fair picture of the implication of the lefts economic policies. There has been no change in its outlook towards reforms. Although left parties the world over have witnessed a smooth transition to market economics, their counterparts in India are still trapped in the past. The lefts stability in West Bengal means nothing when we compare the states economic index with that of other states. 				 																																																				The left has always been the first to give excuses and blame an invisible hand for its economic failures. In the Nineties, it was the Congress government. Then, it was the National Democratic Alliance  the left blamed the saffron brigade for playing havoc in the stock market to create instability. The only economics the left understands is that institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should not dictate economic policies. Yet the West Bengal government has gone all out to woo foreign investors. The left simply cries foul when its policies are criticized. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Narendra Khandelwal, Chennai 

				 																																																				Sir Sitaram Yechury and A.B. Bardhan are senior communist leaders. What they say makes a lot of difference to the people of India, especially now. Which is why their views on disinvestment sent the sensitive index crashing recently. They did not once reflect on the consequences of their words. Politicians of their stature should think twice before talking since the fate of many Indians is linked to what they say.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir Sitaram Yechury blaming the National Democratic Alliance for engineering the stock market crash is ridiculous (Left smells rightwing conspiracy, May 18). As the editorial, Talking too much, rightly says, comrades all over the world are against development. They claim that they are fighting for the basic needs of the poor. Then what is the reason behind North Korea and Cubas impoverishment? Why did the Soviet Union collapse? 				 																																																				The stock market is an indicator of the financial health of a country. Economy is the axis, and different ideologies should revolve around it. With 63 seats in parliament, our comrades will try not to allow the government to globalize our economy. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  In the article Singh on a tightrope (May 23), Partha Chatterjee correctly doubts Manmohan Singhs capacity to keep both his allies and the business community happy. This is most clearly figured for the by the common minimum programme, drafted by the United Progressive Alliance with the support of the left, and gives the economic views of the present government. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  I am a smalltime investor who lost over Rs 1,20,000 on manic Monday. Just like the rest of India, I am also trying to come to grips with what happened and why the markets lost so heavily in a single day. I have read that the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, has asked the Securities and Exchange Board of India chief, G.N. Bajpai, to get to the bottom of this. 				 																																																				However, it is unlikely that the SEBI will say much. Bajpai was away attending a conference in Amman on that day instead of being in Mumbai on what was expected to be a rough day in the markets. That Bajpai and other senior functionaries of SEBI chose to be away from the country speaks volumes about their sense of priorities. 				 																																																				Bajpais statements  that it is still premature to say what led to the crash or the market watchdog is analysing the data  are not surprising. SEBIs probe would be an attempt to shift the blame on factors like unknown hedge funds and foreign institutional investors and the uncertainty accompanying the change in government. No one will admit that the crash was exacerbated by the absence of any clarification from the SEBI or the National Stock Exchange regarding rumours of broker defaults, payment crisis, and the switching off of broker terminals. 				 																																																				Bajpai mentioned that he flew to Amman economy class. But by being away on that fateful day, he has ensured that many people like me would not be able to fly economy class very soon.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The drama surrounding Sonia Gandhis renunciation of prime ministership impaired the stock market. Her delay in government formation and declaration of new reforms has jeopardized the future of the market. How can Sonia think of serving the nation when she and her party are overlooking national interests?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Avinash Gupta, Hoogly

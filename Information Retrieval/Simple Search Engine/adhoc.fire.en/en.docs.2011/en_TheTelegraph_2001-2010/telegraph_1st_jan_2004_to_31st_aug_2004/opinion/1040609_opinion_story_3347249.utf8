The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 							 																						TO BE OR NOT TO BE																														What the new government has formulated is a common minimum programme, not a maximum programme. This quip by a prominent left leader suggests that the M in the CMP will allow room for a considerable amount of flexibility and adaptability. This conclusion was strengthened by the speech delivered to the Lok Sabha by the president, Mr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, on Monday morning. Without too much fuss, the president indicated ways in which the government might honour the CMP more in the breach than in its pursuit. It was clear that the United Progressive Alliance, despite pressure from various quarters, would not be following a policy of runaway populism. Mr Kalam cautioned that all policies and programmes would be subject to the availability of resources. The reiteration of the importance of fiscal discipline only confirms that the rhetoric of populism may not overwhelm the hard reality of policy-making aimed at furthering and deepening economic reforms. The presidents address makes it clear that this government has no intention of putting the clock back on reforms. It is clear that the clock will not be made to work faster. The pace will be plodding as it has always been since economic reforms were begun in 1992.																														Dyed-in-the-wool adherents of the free market economy will be disappointed, but not surprised, by what Mr Kalam had to say on privatization and labour reforms. Here too, there is a marked continuity. Mr Kalam said that private sector companies and nationalized banks would be allowed to enter capital markets to raise resources and would offer investment opportunities to retail investors. Thus, like the government led by the National Democratic Alliance, PSUs and nationalized banks will be allowed to disinvest but not necessarily to privatize. A halfway house, but a step forward nonetheless. The nod to the need for labour reforms was set against the need to protect workers and their families. The left hand of the new government curtailed what the right hand of the government is willing to do. What raised worried eyebrows among reformers was the mention of the issue of affirmative action, including reservations, in the private sector. This idea, spawned by the Congress, goes completely against the spirit of a market-driven economy, geared to achieve equity and efficiency. Pragmatism in politics often demands a certain amount of prevarication. This is somewhat inevitable, given the nature of the UPA. The paradox is aptly caught by the fact that Indias pioneer economic reformer is dependent on the lefts support for his governments functioning and survival.

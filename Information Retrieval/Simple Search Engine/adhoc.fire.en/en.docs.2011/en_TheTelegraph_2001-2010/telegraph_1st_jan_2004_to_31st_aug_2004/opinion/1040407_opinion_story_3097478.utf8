		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 							 																						OLD SKILLS AND NEW STYLES Shobita Punja																					One of the most remarkable aspects of India is that we still have artists with skills to rebuild the Taj Mahal. The artistic tradition that has been handed down from father to son, from grandfather to grandson and mothers is the most intriguing part of Indias history today. How did these crafts survive the ravages of time and still be of relevance today? In other countries like Britain, France, and even in the Middle East, the continuity of traditional skills was lost when the countries galloped into the industrial era.																					But India kept most of the traditions alive despite colonial rule for over two hundred years when craftsmen were reduced to poverty and lost all patronage. Gandhiji was right in saying that the villages of India still preserved the essence of living. Here each family could be self-sufficient and the specialized craftsman created what the community around him needed.																					The brave efforts of great women of our era, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Pupul Jayakar, saw the plight of these artists and in the early years after independence sought to save the crafts as well as the families who practised these ancient art-forms. On April 3, one remembers Kamaladeviji on her birth anniversary, knowing what this country owes to women like her. Age-old traditions of pottery and weaving were brought back to life and made fashionable once more. The Dhaka weavers, the gold-spun cloth of Varanasi, the potters and basket-workers of each village were given help and assistance to return to their honourable professions. There are incredible stories of weavers who had taken to bicycle-repair shops and a change of profession, because they could not practise the art of fine weaving, their patrons of old had disappeared and no one wanted to wear expensive hand-woven fabrics as machines made cheaper, more affordable wear.																					A place for everyone																					In conservation work, the repair and preservation of historic monuments, these old traditions are enormously valuable. If we have the patience and will to find them, there will always be someone in the community who knows how the lime plaster was made, how the mural paintings were created and how the stone was carved or the old woodwork repaired. Government agencies need to be sensitized to understand that these creative people are the ones who need to be engaged in repair-work, for they have the skill and aesthetic sensibility to do a job well. Although these craftsmen may not be able to write their names, or fill in a tender application and send in their quotation-letters for government jobs, it is they who have the skill needed to preserve our historical monuments.																					No one demands standards from artists and craftsman. Bureaucratic systems of lowest quotations do not demand pride in workmanship or quality work. How can artists and artisans fit into a system that is not part of their tradition and that does not value quality? For them, individual creations and products are designed for each client they know and understand. No one sees how the roads are made, or the finish of a pavement or curb of the street, or even where the traffic light is placed. No one seems to care for beauty in everyday life.																					Artists make things of lasting value, but today nothing is meant to last. That is the diktat of a consumer society. Waste and high consumption of natural resources have resulted in enormous environmental costs. One wonders if the continuity of traditional skills will be broken? For India, it would mean an irreplaceable loss, as ours is one of the countries in the world that have preserved such skills, and our artists can still make the world a more creative and beautiful place.

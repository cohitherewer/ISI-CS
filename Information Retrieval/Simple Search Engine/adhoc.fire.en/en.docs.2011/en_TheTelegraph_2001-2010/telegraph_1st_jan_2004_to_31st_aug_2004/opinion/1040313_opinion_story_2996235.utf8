		 Saturday, March 13, 2004 							 																						NOT BY BAT AND BALL ALONEIndias tour of Pakistan can increase goodwill between the two nations. But the political overtones given to it will certainly not make for good cricketCricket between India and Pakistan has always been played under the shadow of politics. The tour to India led by Fazal Mahmood, and the visit to Pakistan of an Indian team led by Bishen Singh Bedi were separated by nearly twenty years. Sourav Ganguly takes his team to Pakistan after a gap of 14 years. These suspensions and the present resumption are both determined by political considerations. This impression is emphasized by the fact that the Indian players went to see the prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, immediately before their departure for Pakistan. It is significant that before its tour of Australia, a more challenging tour in cricketing terms, the Indian team did not have to meet the prime minister or any other political leader. Mr Vajpayees message to the players was pious but completely out of tune with the current ethos of sports. He told the players to win hearts, to play in a spirit of friendship while trying to win the matches. It is difficult to understand why friendship and winning hearts should be part of the cricketers aims. They should be concerned with one thing, and one thing only  winning. The other aims come in because this is not a cricket tour but a political-cum-cricket tour with cricket chasing politics. Ganguly and his team are to be ambassadors first and cricketers second.The coil of politics around this tour might serve to create greater goodwill between the two nations, but it certainly will not make for better cricket. The players will have too much on their minds, patriotism and security not being the least of them, to be able to play to their full potential. It cannot be comfortable for any player to be surrounded by gun-toting policemen all the time. Players will also be justified in resenting the mantle of ambassadorship that has been thrust upon them by no less a person than the prime minister. It could be argued that very few Indo-Pak cricketing encounters in the sub-continent have produced cricket of a very high order. The best evidence to buttress this statement is the number of draws that have occurred in the test matches between India and Pakistan. Both teams tend to play safe, and this makes for boring cricket. It is fortunate that draws are not possible in one-day internationals, otherwise draws would have proliferated there as well!																														The circumstances that will make for bad cricket have been aggravated by the popular perception that this tour is linked in some obscure way to the general elections. The perception has been fed by the players visit to the prime ministers residence and also by the governments attempts to make the series available on Doordarshan despite the fact that the latter lost the bid to Ten Sports. There is an unprecedented involvement of the government in this cricket tour. It appears as if the Indo-Pak tour has become part of the India Shining campaign. An Indian victory  and one can lay a reasonable wager on this  will be hailed as a vital addition to the much-flaunted feel-good factor. The hype around this tour makes a good case to turn around C.L.R. Jamess famous lament and say cricketers should only cricket know.

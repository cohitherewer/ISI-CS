The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 							 																						SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE It is unabashedly populist, but Jaswant Singhs interim budget also tries to give a boost to Indian industry by slashing import duties, writes Alok Ray				 	 Consumers paradise																														Jaswant Singhs interim budget is clearly aimed at wooing the electorate. At the same time, it seeks to carry forward the liberalization agenda, taking advantage of the so-called feel-good factor in the economy  the seven per cent plus growth rate, booming stock markets, bulging foreign exchange reserves and so on.																														The peak rate of customs duty for all non-agricultural products has been brought down from 25 per cent to 20 per cent  this rate was 150 per cent in 1991. So, India has come a long way along the path of globalization, though its average tariff rate is still one of the highest in the world, certainly much above the level of the Association of South East Asian Nations. For agricultural products, the import duty even today remains as high as 65 per cent in some cases. 																														In addition to reducing import duty on many products, the 4 per cent special additional duty, introduced in 1998 by the National Democratic Alliance government in order to bolster its swadeshi image, has been withdrawn. Since the SAD was fixed at 4 per cent of the value of goods, inclusive of basic and additional customs duties, its actual impact on domestic prices was in the range of 5.5-6 per cent of the international price of the imported product. Thus, the 5 per cent reduction in basic duty, along with the abolition of SAD, will make imports cheaper by more than 10 per cent. It will be even higher for products on which the basic duty has been reduced by more than 5 per cent. For example, duty on imported machinery and equipment for big projects worth Rs 5 crore or more has been drastically cut from 25 to 10 per cent. The government seems to be moving towards a near uniform customs duty of 10 per cent at the end of 2005-06, as recommended by the Virmani task force. 																														Some commentators see this as the Bharatiya Janata Party jettisoning its swadeshi agenda. This is not quite correct. Many Indian industries will benefit from cheaper imported inputs and will find themselves more competitive, vis--vis foreign goods, at home and in export markets. For example, the cut on the duty on coal from 25 to 15 per cent will reduce the cost of production in the domestic steel, cement and aluminium industries as also in industries like auto-components which use a lot of domestically-produced steel and aluminium. The domestic coal industry will, however, feel the pinch. 																														Similarly, when the import duty on computers or VCDs (rather than on inputs going into their production) is cut, domestic producers of computers and VCDs lose out to competition from cheaper imports. On the whole, the downward impact on domestic costs is being seen as more significant than the competition from cheaper imports. 																														The reduction in import duties for big projects should reduce the cost of infrastructure projects, helping Indian industry. Also, a Rs 50,000 crore fund will be set up to provide cheap loans to infrastructure projects. For Indian companies, the $100 million cap on investments abroad has been removed in favour of 100 per cent of net worth. This will help Indian business grow big globally through acquisitions. So, the budget proposals should not be seen as wholly against the interest of swadeshi industrialists. That is why the Confederation of Indian Industry, Associated Chambers of Commerce, and other industry bodies have welcomed the reductions in import duties, unlike the days of the Bombay Club. It shows the growing maturity and confidence of Indian business in its ability to compete with the best in the world. 																														It is important to note here that since 1991, the Indian rupee has been steadily depreciating against the dollar, making imported goods more expensive in rupee terms. In fact, the increasing exchange rate protection was neutralizing the reduction in import duties to a great extent. This trend has been reversed in the last couple of years. Now the appreciating rupee against the dollar together with the reduction in import duties make imported goods cheaper in India. 																														India recently signed the South Asian Free Trade Area framework treaty, committing to gradually bring down duties on imports from SAFTA member countries to zero, over a period of 10-15 years. But the benefits of such preferential market access get reduced if general tariff rates applicable to non-member countries come down, as has happened with the reductions in import duties and abolition of SAD. 																														There is a feeling that the concessions in import and excise duties will benefit only the rich and upper middle class. It is true that computers, cell phones, VCDs, DVDs and air travel will become cheaper. Passengers returning from foreign trips will now bring back laptops and twice the quota of liquor at zero duty. As for cars, the major price reductions will be for cars in the premium segment where a large part of the components is imported. 																														Ordinary people may not benefit as consumers. But if the price reductions cause a rise in demand and production of these luxury products, even ordinary workers may gain as employment expands in these and related sectors. The significant reduction in air travel costs may promote tourism. In that case, the benefits may go to a lot of ordinary people in this labour-intensive industry. All classes of consumers would also gain as life-saving bulk drugs become cheaper. 																														The largesse has been distributed fairly widely. Farmers will get loans at 2 per cent below the prime lending rate at which banks lend to customers with very good credentials, from the newly-created Rs 50,000 crore fund. A Rs 10,000 crore corpus has been earmarked for small and medium enterprises. Those who earn salaries upto Rs 1.5 lakh per annum will not have to file income tax returns. Pensioners will benefit from a reduction in procedural hassles while filing returns. Higher return bonds for pensioners will be issued and a social security scheme for workers in the unorganized sector has been unveiled.																														It is estimated that these sops have cost the exchequer about Rs 124,000 crore. But will they help the NDA win the elections? According to some observers, the recent state election results show that development is increasingly becoming important for the Indian electorate  the so-called bijli-sarak-pani or BSP factor, setting aside traditional caste and religious considerations. All experts, however, do not agree on this view. But one thing is clear. The BJP wants to make economic issues a major voting plank this time, in addition to the standard issues of caste and religion. It wants to show that its management of the economy has been far better than its predecessors and that it is serious about taking forward the economic reforms and so, the party should be elected to keep up the good work. 																														But public memory is notoriously short. Will the electorate remember this mini budget a few months from now when they actually vote?

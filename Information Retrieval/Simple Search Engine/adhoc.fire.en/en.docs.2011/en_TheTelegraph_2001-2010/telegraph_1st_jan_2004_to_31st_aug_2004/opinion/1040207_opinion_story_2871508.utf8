The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 																																	 Its Cupids month after all. Is it any wonder we hear wedding bells ringing for Hotmails Sabeer Bhatia, arguably Indias most eligible bachelor (if its money, fame and good looks youre after, that is), then? And the lucky girl here is not a certain actress everyones been talking about. Bhatia has his heart set on Washington-based attorney Geeta Oberoi. The two are set to marry in the US in February, and will follow it up with a grand reception in Bangalore in March. We met at a semi-professional gathering. What endeared him to me was his honesty, values and integrity, reveals Oberoi. Thats three reasons added to the ones we mentioned for marrying him. Sigh! 				 																																	 Shes desperate to get rid of her nickname. Norah Snorah Jones makes a noisier comeback this Tuesday with her second album, Feels Like Home, after one-and-a-half years. The album, she says, is a departure from the slow numbers of her Grammy-sweeping first album, Come Away With Me. The 24-year-old singer-songwriter-pianist is also finally finding her roots. Jones was seen merrily pub-hopping and ethnic-clothes shopping with half-sister Anoushka Shankar in Delhi last week. And this was the girl at the Grammys last year vehemently denying the Indian Connection! The half-sisters bonded and posed for photographs like best pals. How times change. 				 																																	 When Mrinal Sen isnt making films that dont become blockbusters , hes writing a book that might just be a bestseller. Tentatively titled Happenings: Discreet Entries of an Indiscreet Person, Sens almost-autobiographical book will feature his experiences with the likes of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Of course Ill write about Marquez. Were friends, he says. He finishes writing next month. 				 																																	 All that fitness freakishness is paying off for Reliance honcho Anil Ambani. He will be seen matching the likes of Zola Budd for pace at the Mumbai International Marathon next week. Considering he jogs 15 km everyday, it should be a cakewalk.

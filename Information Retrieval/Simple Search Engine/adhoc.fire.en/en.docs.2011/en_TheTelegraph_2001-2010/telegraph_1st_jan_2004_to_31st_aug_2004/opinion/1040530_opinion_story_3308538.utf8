The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 30, 2004 							 																						STILL TOO MANY SCREENS																														Anything that is done to protect sexually-abused children is welcome. Since the Supreme Court has responded positively to the public interest litigation filed by a non-governmental organization, there is some hope that abuse victims might find it easier to speak up in court. There are now three new instructions specific to child sexual abuse cases. A screen or some other arrangement must be in place so that the victim and witnesses do not have to see the face or body of the accused during trial; the defence counsel is barred from asking the victim direct questions  the questions must be written out and handed to the judge who would then address them to the victim in a clear and not embarrassing language; and the victims should be given as many breaks as necessary. 																														Careful thought and sensitive imagination underlie these directions. They have been added to the last instructions of the court in relation to rape cases, that trials should be held in camera and preferably with women judges. The court may have done all it can at its end, but in the context of the staggering scale and proportionate invisibility of the sexual abuse of children in India, this is a mere palliative, available only if a case reaches trial. The last remains the big question. The court has urged parliament to consider the recommendations of womens groups to enlarge Sections 375 and 376 of the Indian penal code to include forms of sexual assault other than penile-vaginal penetration. There is yet no specific focus on the sexual abuse of children, although custodial rape and rape of minors call forth heavier penalties. This lack is an indisputable sign of societys deliberate blindness to a crime that is enacted regularly in households throughout the country, in villages and cities, with equal impunity. A 1997 study of 1,000 middle and upper class women living in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Goa, showed that 76 per cent of them had been abused as children, 71 per cent of them by a relative, a member of the family or by someone they knew and trusted. A similar survey of 350 schoolgirls in New Delhi said that 63 per cent had been abused by members of the family. These are just two of the many studies conducted recently, but they are enough to show the magnitude of the problem and the chief reason for silence about it. The sexual abuse of boys is not even included in these two surveys  it is even more invisible than the abuse of girls. 																														The role of law in this situation is necessarily limited. A social or psychological revolution does not fall within its purview. But its role is no less crucial for that. The identification of the crime with absolute clarity, a full recognition of the immeasurable damage  sometimes amounting to destruction  that it causes to the most dependent and vulnerable segment of the population, and unrelenting implementation of the strictest of penalties need to be added to sensitive handling of victims in courts. For the victims who do speak up, this at least will help reduce their sense of shame and feelings of helplessness, assuage rage and restore some of their lost self-worth.

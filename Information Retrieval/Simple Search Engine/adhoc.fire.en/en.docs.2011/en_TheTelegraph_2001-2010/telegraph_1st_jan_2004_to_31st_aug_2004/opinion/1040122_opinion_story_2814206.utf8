		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 							 																						ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING 															- Document Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 To understand better 																														While many serious diseases attract stigma and discrimination, HIV/AIDS is particularly open to generate responses which discredit those who are infected. This is both because the routes of HIV transmission include sexual behaviour and the sharing of injecting equipment by drugs users  behaviours that are considered shameful or illegal in many societies  and because many of the groups that have been most affected are already marginalized and stigmatized within society. This stigma has been compounded by fear due to lack of knowledge within south Asian societies about the modes of HIV transmission. This lack of knowledge is evident even among policy-makers and healthcare workers who have often applied unnecessary and restrictive measures to People Living With HIV/AIDS, thereby fuelling misconceptions, fear and stigma relating to the disease as well as violating individual rights.																														HIV-related stigma is built upon, and serves to strengthen and legitimise, existing social inequalities. The power imbalances and socio-economic and gender inequalities within south Asian societies combine with taboos around sexuality, fear and ignorance about HIV transmission, and inappropriate media reports, to create a powerful stigma attached to HIV-AIDS. Marginalized groups are also stigmatized partly because there is little general understanding of the structural factors that make them vulnerable to HIV. Therefore, better understanding of the development aspects of HIV would help reduce stigma surrounding them.																														Throughout the region, PLWHA have experienced violent attacks, refusal of medical treatment, rejection from families, communities and from the workplace, denial of last rites and many other rights violations. In Bangladesh, there have been cases of PLWHA being held in police custody, while in India Supreme Court judgment had suspended HIV-positive peoples right to marry in 1996, though that right has now been restored. This happening despite the United Nations commission of human rights clearly stating: Discrimination on the basis of HIV or AIDS status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards, and the term, or other status in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts should be interpreted to cover health status, including HIV/AIDS.																														A recent study of the attitudes and behaviour of health service providers indicates that stigma and discrimination pervades the hospital system as well.																														The stigma and discrimination attached to HIV/AIDS also hampers prevention efforts, as people are less willing to test for HIV or to admit to their positive status. Many PLWHA, therefore, do not receive the support needed for behaviour change and are not involved in HIV-related responses. This also results in a lack of accurate information about levels of HIV prevalence, making informed preparation and responses impossible...																														Social Violence and Human Rights Violations: The active role of civil society, including that of local decision-policy-makers, in protecting the rights of individual community members is crucial in sustaining the socio-cultural fabric of any community. Given the existing discrimination, social acceptance is particularly crucial for the effective implementation of HIV-related legislation. There is evidence within south Asia that human rights violations and violence against individuals (including those who have been traditionally marginalized, especially the poor and disempowered, women, those belonging to scheduled castes/scheduled tribes, stigmatized groups) are often aggravated within existing community structures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 26, 2004 							 																						VOICES FROM THE CORNER At the WSF, first-person accounts of violence on the minorities convince Schona Jolly that India and Indians cannot afford to move on until there is justice				 	 Victims of indifference																														Amidst the spectacle of Dalit dancing troupes, adivasis marching alongside burgundy-robed Tibetan monks, unfurling huge banners to be signed by thousands of well-wishers from India and across the world, some voices remain unheard. The colour and carnival of Mumbai 2004 may have made front-page news, or at least spectacular pictures in some of the global media, but many of the important issues did not figure. That would come as no surprise, since it is inconvenient for the worlds largest democracies, and those who aspire to install democracy around the world, to remember that India, the so-called biggest democracy of them all, is not functioning. 																														Through the clamour of banging drums and the stomping feet of an estimated 150,000 people, some of those individuals worst affected by the Indian states tolerance of impunity, was illustrated how the arm of impunity has extended across all levels of the power-wielding forces in India: from the judiciary to the army, and from the ministers accused of participating in pre-orchestrated genocidal plans, to the police force. Violent suppression of minorities has continued since independence. 																														The rise in right-wing fundamentalism is quietly, and often publicly, endorsed. The effects have devastated lives, and generations.With dignity, and often with little more than tremor in their voices, men and women from Punjab, Gujarat, Kashmir and Nagaland came forward to tell their tales to those who would listen. Amongst them sat lawyers, activists and others, who tried to, and continue to push their cases for justice. Indias free press reported none of their stories. 																														It is unlikely that any mainstream newspaper in Europe or the United States of America has reported these aspects of the World Social Forum either. It is difficult not to be humbled by a father recounting how his son was rounded up onto a terrace, with 33 other boys in Ahmedabad, told to strip, and then bend down, to be beaten mercilessly behind the knees, across the elbows until the boys pleaded for relief, whereupon three of them, his son included, was shot dead. He named individual police officers, with the chain of responsibility leading as far as the police chief himself. It was impossible to retain ones composure as one heard eye-witness accounts of women being herded into cul-de-sacs, having kerosene poured on them from the roofs of houses, lit matches sailing down through the air, until the women, their clothes and skin on fire, ran into the waiting arms of the police and the mob, to be brutally gang-raped. 																														Five minutes after the police chief left, the onslaught intensified and hundreds of men, women and children were killed, while the police blocked the entrances of the housing colonies. The man standing before us, his hands slightly shaking as he looked blankly at the makeshift tent walls into which we were all crammed, had lost ten members of his family in this mass murder, including his wife and brother. He personally pulled 58 bodies out of water-tanks, their skin and bones crumbled from the effects of a white powder, which was thrown from bags and bottles across the entire state. 																														Many people mentioned that chemical concoction. It appears to have rapidly increased the rate of burning, so that the victims were stripped of any physical dignity by the time they finally lay dead. The man, timid and unused to public speaking, recounted his story with little emotion and glazed eyes. He has said these words many times. The police officers are still walking free. Even as refugee camps for those whose lives and livelihoods were destroyed continue to be closed down after threats from the ruling authorities, and the sufferings are multiplied by the talk of promotions and rewards awaiting those who led the mobs, the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said in public last week that it was time to move on from Gujarat. 																														A British peer has considered that Gujarat is anembarrassment, since the effect of the massacre has been to discourage international investment in the state. In other words, the Indian government, and those in big businesses, want the world to forget Gujarat, like Punjab and Nagaland have been forgotten. Even the daily victims of Kashmir no longer make headlines. What is this if not state-sanctioned terrorism in the worlds largest democracy? How can Indias allies, and even Indias people, accept this so easily? 																														Jaswant Singh Khalra, a human rights activist in Punjab, estimated that 25,000 people had disappeared in Punjab in the decade following the 1984 riots. His widow stood up in Mumbai this week and told her audience that the authorities had told him that if 25,000 had been killed, another one man would make little difference. So Khalra, too, has disappeared. Mass cremation grounds, each containing at least 2,097 bodies, have been found in Amritsar district. 																														Attempts to bring these cases to justice, both before the National Human Rights Commission and the Supreme Court, have been blocked or hampered at every level. Why is there no international outcry against the Indian government, as the one that rightly followed the unearthing of mass graves in Iraq? 																														A Guardian journalist told me that he was the only British mainstream reporter at the WSF. The media conspires, perhaps unwittingly, and India remains an important trading partner for the United Kingdom, Israel and the US. Indeed, as the India-Pakistan crisis deepened shortly after September 11, 2001, UK was selling British fighter jets to India; at the time, the deal was barely mentioned in the British media. 																														The US simultaneously was busy increasing its own arms sales and aid to Pakistan, to further its own war on terror. The question that has been asked many times over, but still remains relevant is: where does terrorism begin and end? Does it stop being terrorism when one of the parties considers itself to be a democracy? A Kashmiri activist, 26-years-old and frail, described 13 years of life-in-death. His speech lasted just two minutes, coming after the powerful testimonies of the Punjabi and Gujarati genocide victims. His only plea was, Please be human. Give us a right to live. Our womenfolk are raped daily. Our men are taken. There are no young men in Kashmiri homes, just young boys and old folk. We are not asking for freedom of expression, or the right to strike. We want the right to live, and peace.																														Listening to these testimonies, I hung my head in shame. Even my own tears stung with the knowledge that I could move on, if I chose to, assured by Vajpayee, and all those whose short memories serve them well. Each of these eye witness accounts included lists of names. Justice is there to be had, heard and handed over, if only the machinery of state can be persuaded. The problem lies undoubtedly in the small, yet significant fact that those lists would include cogs in that sluggish, yet violent power-wheel. The word victim connotes an inability to take care of oneself, someone who has fallen out of society and been labelled helpless. We all need to reclaim space for those families who have suffered needlessly, whose lives have been destroyed by the state machinery, and national and international indifference. We must not forget these people, nor must we allow our leaders to forget. We cannot move on until there is justice, and that truly involves the whole world-community.

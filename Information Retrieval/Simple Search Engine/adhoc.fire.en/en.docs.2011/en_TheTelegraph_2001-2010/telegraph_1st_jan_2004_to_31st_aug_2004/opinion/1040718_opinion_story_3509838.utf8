 							 - Preference to SC/STs in government orders finds no mention in CMPTrapped between shrinking public sector jobs and an unsympathetic private sector, entrepreneurship may be the only way out for the Dalits. But the odds are heavily against them. Avijit Ghosh reports Hope floats: An elderly man listens to Congress president Sonia Gandhi at a Dalit Chunauti rally 																														Call it a claustrophobic cauldron of concrete, if you like, but property is not cheap in New Delhis Patparganj area. Thousands of middle-class men and women are willing to shell out Rs 20 lakh or more for two-bedroom homes in these parts of East Delhi. Here, demand always outstrips supply. 																														There is one exception, though. Few want to buy a flat in Gaurav Apartments, even at a much lower price. If you probe a bit, you know why: it is a residents society of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe (SC/ST) employees. 																														Many just say, show me a flat elsewhere. Some even say, why didnt you tell us before that it is an SC housing society? says Ram Gopal Singh, a scheduled caste (Dalit) property dealer of the area. The apartment is well-located and neatly-maintained but a flat there is Rs 5 lakh cheaper than similar flats in the area.																														Singh, who converted to Buddhism some years ago, has been in the real estate business for about a decade. And experience has taught him never to flash his caste identity. Like any other Hindu property dealer, he has a miniature temple of gods and goddesses in his office. 																														If I put up photographs of Babasaheb (Ambedkar) and Lord Buddha on the walls, many clients will simply run away. My reputation built over the years will count for nothing. As a Dalit, you are always fighting an invisible battle, he says.																														The battle is getting harder for Indias 170-million-strong scheduled caste community. Trapped between shrinking public sector jobs  their first choice all along  and an unsympathetic private sector, the odds are increasingly stacked against the Dalits in the age of liberalisation.																														Even as the demand for a reservation policy for the historically disadvantaged Dalits (SCs) and Adivasis (STs) in the private sector has emerged as the hottest topic in the Capitals seminar circuit in the past few days, a section of the Dalit intelligentsia firmly believes that the answer to joblessness lies in creating a strong business and trading class within the community. Since the struggle for jobs in the private sector is a long haul, they feel the need to focus on business and trade.																														Says Dalit columnist Chandra Bhan Prasad, The Dalits have a legitimate right to job reservation in the private sector. But through jobs, you cannot enter trade or manufacturing sectors. Dalits also need to be traders, contractors and manufacturers. Otherwise, you cannot have a real stake in the Indian economy.																														Scholar D. Shyam Babu, who has co-edited The Dalit Question with Bibek Debroy, also feels that the community needs to be helped to enter the private sector as dealers, suppliers and entrepreneurs. It is not easy to break out of the shackles on your own when you are cut off from the mainstream for centuries, says Babu, a Rajiv Gandhi Foundation fellow. 																														The thinking is roughly on these lines: the government is the biggest purchaser of goods and services in any country; it also hands out the maximum number of job contracts. If a portion of such contracts or buying of goods is reserved for the Dalits, it would not only benefit thousands of Dalits but also create a thriving Dalit business and trading class.																														In 2002, Congress leader Digvijay Singh, then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, started a pioneering programme, still being carried out by the state Bharatiya Janata Party government. We reserved a certain portion for Dalits in all government purchases and contracts, says Digvijay Singh. According to state estimates, SCs and STs were given orders worth Rs 50 crore till October last year.																														It has worked out for Uma Shing Ahirwar. Speaking on the phone from MPs Vidisha town, the 24-year-old relates how she and her team of 20-odd women make mattresses and school bags from her small office-cum-factory. In the last 18 months the government has bought goods worth Rs 15 lakh from her. The government cannot give jobs to all. But such schemes help many get jobs, she says.																														To those who say that such a practice goes against the spirit of free market, social scientist Gopal Guru points out that the Indian bourgeoisie itself would not have thrived without state support and protection till 1991. Dalit shopkeepers, contractors, entrepreneurs, traders, small industrialists  all need a similar kind of protection for some time. They need capacity, confidence and conditions, says Guru, who teaches political science at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.																														It is true that small Dalit entrepreneurs and traders have existed through the decades. But community leaders hold that at a time when even many established Indian industries are unable to cope with the pressures exerted by a rapidly globalising economy, state support is imperative. 																														Ras Chandra Parmar, a trustee of the Gujarat Anusuchit Jati (Scheduled Caste) Chamber of Commerce, explains how the forum has become defunct in the past two years. Loans are near-impossible to get either from the states financial corporations for SCs or from government banks. 																														The ceramic and the handloom industries  sectors where many small Dalit entrepreneurs flourished before  have fallen on hard times. At least 60 per cent of them have closed down, says Parmar.																														That loans are extremely hard to get elsewhere too becomes clear when Hiralal Bairwa, hovering outside Delhis Scheduled Caste Financial and Development Corporation Limited office, narrates his bitter tale. The middle-aged house painter wanted a loan to set up a grocery store. But the clerk didnt even bother to look up when he asked if there was a scheme for someone like him before saying no. 																														Thats why, Satyawati College student Dinkar Chandra says he wanted to look beyond jobs and do something on his own. But these days, when getting a scholarship is so difficult, how can you even think of procuring a loan and starting something on your own? the 23-year-old wonders. 																														There is a huge gap between what the Dalit wants and what the situation permits him to do. Many were hoping that things would improve if the Congress came back to power at the Centre. 																														For, in its July 2003 Shimla Sankalp  the partys roadmap for the future  it promised the start of a purposeful dialogue with private industry on how best Indias social diversity could be reflected in the private sector in different ways like reservations and fiscal incentives, and how government procurement can promote entrepreneurship among Dalits and Adivasis.																														Expectations rose further when the Congress announced in its 2004 election manifesto that it will create a national consensus on the issue of Dalits and Adivasis getting a reasonable share of jobs in the private sector and determined efforts will be made to promote a culture of entrepreneurship among the Dalits and Adivasis by providing businesses run by them with preferential treatment in government procurement and by extending bank credit at affordable terms. 																														However, the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) is not so direct. It says that the UPA government is very sensitive to the issue of affirmative action, including reservations, in the private sector, and talks of immediately initiating a national dialogue with all political parties, industry and other organisations on this issue. 																														But promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and preferential treatment in government procurement dont find a direct mention in the CMP, although it is possible to argue that the term, affirmative action, is all-embracing. 																														The phrase, first used in the USA in the early Sixties by president John F. Kennedy was used to describe wide-ranging public policies to overcome effects of past racial discrimination. 																														Some activists feel that the Congress  which has been hoping to bring Dalits back to its electoral fold  is being insincere. It is much easier for a government to give preferential treatment to Dalits in purchases than ensuring reservation in the private sector, says Prasad. Why was this clause not clearly mentioned in the CMP? wonders Prasad, who had drafted the Bhopal Document, an agenda for the future of Dalits, on which the MP government based its diversity programme in 2002. 																														However, a senior Congress leader calls this a case of oversight. Wishing not to be named, he adds: We are trying to bring this to Sonia Gandhis notice. She is one of the few politicians to have gone through the Bhopal Document. 																														Arjun Sengupta, former vice-chairman, Congress economic cell, avoids commenting directly on the issue but admits to the need for affirmative action. The question is how to design it, he says. The way it needs to be formulated is a matter of public discussion. 																														Dalits, though, believe that the Congress might be filibustering. And Union minister of social justice and empowerment Meira Kumars reply to a starred question in Parliament on Thursday shows that the political will is hardly resolute: The government is very sensitive to the issue of affirmative action including reservations in the private sector. Since this will require wide ranging discussion with all the stakeholders, no time frame can be indicated for deciding the matter. 																														Without time frames, issues often end up in the backburner. Curiously, Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, which stridently advocates Dalit cause, has been silent through all this. 																														Many Dalits believe that the Maharashtra government which recently passed a bill that paves the way for reservation for Dalits as well as backwards in the private sector could be the way of the future. 																														Others, without discounting the possibility of reservation in the private sector, proffer that only the creation of a Dalit business and trading class can bring about the communitys mainstreaming. 																														The Dalit community is swimming against an unfriendly tide. But there are times when answers come riding on a tide.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 05, 2004 							 																						BEYOND BELIEF																														There are situations when being speechless is the most serious of condemnations. Mr Colin Powells announcement that the intelligence on Iraqs accumulation of weapons of mass destruction was flawed is one such instance. The acknowledgement can only leave everybody aghast. Whether Mr Powell, the secretary of state of the United States of America, and his president, Mr George W. Bush, likes it or not, this admission on Mr Powells part makes the US a naked aggressor. The central public plank of the war that the US declared on Iraq was the fact that Mr Saddam Hussein had been building up an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. That fact has now been publicly acknowledged to be fiction. No such arsenal has been found. Mr Bush thus destroyed Iraq on flimsy and unsubstantiated  some might even say manufactured  evidence. Mr Powell made his presentation to the United Nations on the basis of evidence given to him by the Central Intelligence Agency. He is now trying to distance himself from that evidence by saying that at that point in time, the evidence seemed convincing and that he is not the intelligence community. This is disingenuous, since Mr Powell cannot deny responsibility for the evidence that he brought into the public domain by presenting it to the UN. He could not have been unaware that on this evidence depended the destruction of Iraq and thousands of lives.																														Since the emergence of a unipolar world and the unofficial coronation of the US as the worlds sheriff, the US has tried to claim for itself a moral high ground. It has projected itself as standing for a new world- order, which is different from the one represented by Mr Hussein and Mr Osama bin Laden. It has advocated a world free from terror and totalitarianism. But the US action in Iraq and the fact that it was bereft of any reason have only revealed the hollowness of its own claims. The US rode roughshod over all democratic opinion, including that of the UN, against the invasion and proceeded to unleash a reign of terror against the people of Iraq. Might is right cannot be the basis of a new world-order, as the logical extension of that is a descent into a state of nature. It has been the argument of some that the US is actually involved in the 21st-century version of the great game in west Asia. This might well turn out to be true once the real reasons for the invasion are unveiled.

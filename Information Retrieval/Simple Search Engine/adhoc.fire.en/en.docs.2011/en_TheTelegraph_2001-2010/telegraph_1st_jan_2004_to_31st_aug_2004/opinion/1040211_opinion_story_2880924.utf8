		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 							 																						SWEET TASTE OF FREEDOM Out of jail, Vaiko wants to tap into his partys traditional support base that has been threatened by its five year alliance with the BJP, writes M.R. Venkatesh				 	 Keep up the bravado 																														If Vaiko, the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader, gained anything from his 576-days long detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, it was his elevation as the authentic voice of Tamil nationalist aspirations. In fact, one of the many colourful posters celebrating his release from Vellore Central Prison on February 7 said as much  that Vaiko had joined the pantheon of Tamil nationalist heroes. 																														But the sympathy he has gained among the people of Tamil Nadu is not without its political cost for Vaiko, who was charged under section 21(3) of POTA for a speech he had made at a public meeting at Tirumangalam in June 2002, voicing his support for the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 																														Hundreds of people who felt that Vaiko had been detained unduly long thronged the 160-kilometre long stretch of the national highway from Chennai to Vellore, hoping for a glimpse of him. Even under the POTAs draconian predecessor, the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, imposed during the Emergency, no Tamil Nadu leader had been in jail for so long, M. Kannappan, one of Vaikos senior colleagues and a former Union minister, pointed out on seeing the unexpectedly large turnout in front of the prison.																														Yet, the underlying reality is that Vaiko will find it difficult to live down his image as pro-LTTE, because the people of Tamil Nadu and the state administration are determined not to give any quarter to the banned organization following Rajiv Gandhis assassination in May 1991. His exuberant supporters and party cadre may not know but Vaiko was able to step out into freedom only after the Madras high court relaxed some of the extremely stringent bail conditions laid down by the special court trying POTA cases.																														Indeed, differentiating the just aspirations of the Tamils in Sri Lanka from terrorism is the big task that now awaits Tamil politicians like Vaiko. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, from which he was undemocratically expelled in 1993, has long since distanced itself from the LTTE and watered down its insistence on a separate Tamil eelam as being the only solution to the ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka.																														Vaiko himself acknowledged the enormity of this task while arguing his bail application before the special judge trying POTA cases, L. Rajendran. The MDMK leaders arguments were also a reflection of how the misuse due to political vendetta of the Central anti-terror law, primarily designed to deal with cross-border terrorism and violent religious extremism in the states, has forced the political classes to try and draw a lakshman rekha.																														Vaiko pleaded before the judge that his remarks supporting the LTTE did not in any way mean that he advocated the violent methods of the banned organization in Tamil Nadu, or wanted to give it a base in the state. I quoted only what I had said in the Lok Sabha earlier (during the debate on Gujarat), he said, adding that it was only a small part of my speech anyway.																														In my speech, I had pointed out that the youth of the state should not fall prey to extremism and violence and therefore I am wedded to peace, Vaiko told the judge, urging that his remarks should be seen in their totality. This was perhaps the logic that led the National Democratic Alliance regime, of which Vaikos MDMK is a part, to give more teeth to the POTA review panel, so that political misuse of the anti-terror law could be averted.																														Nonetheless, the Jayalalithaa regimes use of POTA to repress its opposition in the state  first Vaiko and eight other MDMK leaders, and then a host of others including the Tamil nationalist movement leader, P. Nedumaran, and the editor of the Tamil magazine, Nakkeeran, R.R. Gopal  has set off a chain of events. It has accentuated the differences within the NDA, leading to the DMK, the MDMK and the Pattali Makkal Katchi quitting the Central alliance. As a follow-up to all this political churning, the Jayalalithaa-led All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam attended the last NDA meeting in New Delhi just before the Lok Sabha was dissolved.																														Coming out of jail, Vaiko was true to form  he did not wish to give the impression that the long term in prison had tamed him. He cited the Supreme Courts observations on his petition challenging the validity of section 21 (3) of POTA, and how the apex court, even as it upheld the provisions constitutionality, had said that the mere expression of support would not constitute mischief unless criminal intent was also proved.																														Vaiko termed the Supreme Courts upholding of the fundamental freedoms of speech and expression as a struggle I won from the Vellore prison. This was also why Vaiko described his term in prison as an unforgettable boon in my public life.																														Vaiko also kicked off his election campaign from the gates of the Vellore prison by launching a scathing attack against both the Central and state governments. By doing so, he tacitly conceded that the coming Lok Sabha polls would be a tough battle.																														The Sri Lankan Tamils issue is no longer of great interest to the people of the state; they are more concerned with the rising unemployment, the drought in the Cauvery delta, the water scarcity in Chennai and the issue of Tamil migrant workers being unfairly treated in Singapore, Malaysia and the Maldives.																														Politically, sharing power with the Bharatiya Janata Party for nearly five years at the Centre threatens to erode the traditional support-base of parties like the DMK and MDMK in the state. The DMK has traditionally enjoyed a broad understanding with the left parties and the minorities. It is these old reservoirs of support that Vaiko wants to tap, as part of the new DMK-led front. He indicated this by affirming that our friendship with the DMK will continue to strengthen the Dravidian movement from the onslaught of the Hindutva forces.																														Thus, even as he rejoices at his release from prison, Vaiko is aware of the difficult task ahead of him.

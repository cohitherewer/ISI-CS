		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 							 																						AROUND THE LAWPurists would like the law to exist, not for social good, but for its own sake. Most problems relate, however, to the administration of the law. But the controversy over the block-level pre-litigation conciliation bill, which is proposed to be moved in the next session of the West Bengal assembly, seems to have been generally wide off the mark. The bill proposes to give legal sanction to conciliations of local disputes by boards to be formed at the panchayat samiti level. The majority of members of the West Bengal Bar Council who have opposed the bill seem to have done the right thing for the wrong reason. Their opposition is based on the fear that the local conciliation boards would take away the cases which should rightfully belong to the lawyers practising in various courts. The bill is thus seen as an assault on their professional right and worse, as a threat to the lawyers livelihood. This sectarian and openly selfish argument actually weakens the bar councils case against the proposed legislation. The government, on the other hand, argues that the local conciliation boards would serve the greater good of the greater number of people in the villages who cannot afford the costs of lengthy legal battles in courts far from their homes. The other official argument is that going to the local reconciliation boards does not mean that the doors of courts would be closed on litigants. The latter can always go to court if dissatisfied with the verdicts of the boards. The real objections to the bill are of far greater import. For one thing, local reconciliations, even with their legal sanction, will make a travesty of justice. It is unlikely that members of the board will have the legal competence to ensure that their judgments are fair. The result may well be an absurd situation in which persons without training or expertise in law will sit in judgment over legal disputes. To argue that village societies traditionally had such systems to settle local disputes does not address the fundamental issue of the legal and judicial inadequacy of this home-grown process. Similarly, to argue that the local boards would help the people who cannot afford legal expenses is also to bypass the legal question. The other argument against the bill is related to the politicization of the panchayat system in Bengal. It is easy to assume that the boards would be so political in their composition and functioning that they would become yet another tool to settle political scores. Such a scenario would be far removed from even a semblance of justice. Worse still, local overlords could abuse the boards to dissuade the villagers from seeking proper legal help.

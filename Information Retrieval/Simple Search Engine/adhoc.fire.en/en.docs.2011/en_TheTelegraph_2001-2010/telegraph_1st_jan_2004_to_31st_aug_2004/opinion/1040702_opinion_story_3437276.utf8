		 Friday, July 02, 2004 							 																						WAYS TO CHEAT IN EXAMS Neha Sahay																					In China, too, students are committing suicide. In March, before the national college-entrance examinations, two 16-year-old girls jumped off the terrace, leaving behind letters in which they wrote that they felt suffocated by homework and feared that they would disappoint their parents if they failed to clear the exams. Now that the exams are over, other suicides have begun  of students caught cheating.																					Increased vigilance at exam centres to prevent cheating was projected as necessary to ensure credibility in education in todays market economy. Well, the market economy can be a double-edged weapon. First, nothing works according to plan; the only determining factor being market forces. So, despite the much-vaunted honesty bond signed by 7 million examinees, every rule was broken by students desperate to make it to college. The old formula of demand and supply ensured that the hottest commodity going  the right answers to exam papers  was available for the right price.																					The methods used also reflected the advanced stage of market forces in China. Students here dont just settle for stolen exam papers as they do in India. Those unable  or unwilling  to cope with the system, but wanting to succeed, simply avoid sitting for exams. But this solution is available to only those who can afford it: you pay the price, you get someone to write your paper.																					Impersonation for exam purposes seems to have developed into a full-fledged business. In Xian, known the world over for its terracotta warriors, university campuses this year were flooded with flyers offering 2,000 yuan per subject to those willing to be substitute examinees in the college entrance exam.																					Caught in the act																					Of course some got caught. Strangely, the student who had paid someone else to do his exam did not feel humiliated enough to want to kill himself. It was the boy hired to write the paper who jumped off a second floor window after he was caught.																					One of the most imaginative schemes this year was worked out by a network of youth, ranging from undergraduates to school students. They employed a variety of methods: from old-fashioned impersonation to the latest telecommunications technology.																					The scheme involved a series of steps. First, some youth impersonated examinees and left the exam hall with their question papers before the exam was over. Second, these papers were immediately solved by senior school students. Third, the answers were sent to the mobile phones of candidates inside exam centres. These mobiles had been hooked on to the internet.																					The price of these answers? 1,000 yuan each  more than the average salary of an urban Chinese worker.																					The plan failed because the students receiving answers on their mobiles were caught in the act. But the question remains: how were the imposters allowed to leave the exam centre well before the time was up? Indeed, how were they allowed to enter?																					Marks for money																					Obviously, theres more to this ambitious scheme than the six students arrested so far. But with news in China not yet having gone beyond the planned economy mode, it may be months before the names of the officials involved gets out  if at all it does.																					To be fair though, in another case involving more than 100 students, both administrative staff and teachers have been arrested. The seven arrested teachers include, ironically, the deputy director of political education. Here, examinees relayed the questions from the exam hall with the help of digital cameras, and received answers through SMS.																					Its not just dishonest individuals who benefit from the high value attached to exams. Local education authorities too make a neat pile from what is an integral part of conducting the exam  releasing the marks. Students must pay to get their marks from information service centres. The charge for a marks-inquiry phone call to such a centre is 3 yuan per minute. Marks in SMS form cost 20 times the normal SMS charge.																					Talk about market economy!

				 																																	The older he gets, the more prolific he becomes. From poetry to cricket to Prime Ministers and now to engineering giants. This year Mumbai-based writer-poet Dom Moraes has started work on a posthumous biography of Henning Holck-Larsen, the Danish co-founder of Larsen amp; Toubro. This will be his third biography after the ones of Sunil Gavaskar and Indira Gandhi. I am trying to look at the human side of Holck-Larsen, says Moraes, who had lived in the same building as the amp;T founder during his early years in Mumbai. Talk about getting up close and personal to the subject!Lushin Dubey				 																																	The kid sister is finally emerging from the shadows  and all for a social cause (yawn!). Theatre personality Lushin Dubey  better known as Lillette Dubeys younger sibling  is the first actor to get a go-ahead from author Pinki Virani to make a play based on her book, Bitter Chocolate. The play, to be premiered at Delhis India Habitat Centre on January 16, aims to create awareness about sexual abuse of children. Dubey enacts 12 roles in the 55-minute solo show. She plays an advocate, a policeman, a child rape victim, a mother and a psychiatrist as she discusses sexual abuse of children from different perspectives. They say there is a child in all of us...				 																																	 No one missed Suneeta Pari Rao after her disappearing act from the music scene only sometime back. One of Indias earliest pop stars, she was nowhere in sight after Ab Ke Baras created ripples in late 2000. But now shes thinking of a comeback album, which (surprise!) she doesnt want to talk about at the moment. Its nowhere near a release, is all she is willing to divulge. Well, anyway, were not really holding our breath.

		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 							 																						A LITTLE BIT OF ISRAEL IN INDIA SHOBITA PUNJA																					Many cities around the world have tiny areas that have quaint names like Little Italy or Little India or China Town. These cities within a city often played a critical economic role in making the city what it is today. It is the social and economic significance of these areas that bring them the acclaim of great heritage.																					It was the power of the great monsoon winds that sweep across the Arabian Sea during this time of the year that brought the seafaring boats from Arabia to the west coast of India in the first century AD, and from here took the boats to the Far East. These ancient trading ships brought men of different faiths to the Indian shores and amongst them the Jewish settlers. 																					The Jewish quarter in Fort Cochin in Kerala is called Jew Town by some and has charming old cobbled streets with rows of houses on both sides. Within, and often behind, the houses are the enormous stores and warehouses that bring to these streets of Cochin the fragrance of spices  the delicious smell of cardamom, flavoured with pepper and the evocative essence of cloves. For the fragrance alone, such streets need to be preserved, as it is an olfactory reminder of an age that once was.																					It was the trade in spices that brought these early travellers to India  spices such as pepper were called black gold. It was used for centuries to keep meat from stinking and rotting in the refrigerator-less days of yore in Europe. Spices were critical and India was the major supplier. Later, in the 16th century, when the Inquisition drove the Jewish community away from Europe, some of the brethren from central Europe settled in Cochin. A large, white Jewish community inhabited the harbour area of Cochin and established trade and received protection from the local rulers.																					History on the streets																					What protection has our government and local rulers given today to this community that several centuries ago brought India in touch with the world of trade? What have we done to protect the charming row of houses and the streets that look more like lanes in Jerusalem than they do Indian ones?																					Today, because of the general social neglect and lack of government initiative, there are only around 4,000 people left of this community in this country. Many of the young have left for Israel or America to find new and more welcoming homes. The houses have all been converted into antique shops, where Indians sell items stripped from traditional family homes, making a fast buck on every piece of wood they can find. 																					The traditional Jewish spice merchant has been driven out, but there are still a few of them who run shops from where you can buy the best of spices at reasonable prices. This part of Cochin is changing fast and will soon be unrecognizable if something imaginative is not done quickly. We have a little Jewish quarter in India that we need to showcase for the world to see how history played out on our streets not so many centuries ago.																					Falling numbers																					A small Jewish synagogue was built at one end of Jew Town in 1568 (though it was renovated in subsequent centuries). The building is protected by a walled compound and an entrance. Inside the synagogue is a large hall with chandeliers and lamps. The entire flooring is paved with delicately hand-painted white and blue willow-patterned tiles from China, each one of a different design. 																					Golden crowns given by the Maharaja of Travancore and Cochin to honour these worthy guests to the country have been used to cap the Torah. Amongst the prized possessions of the synagogue is a copperplate recording a grant made to the Jewish trading community by Raja Ravi Varman (962-1020). 																					Today this historic synagogue has to wait patiently for foreign tourists to come to Cochin to find the obligatory ten male Jewish members necessary to make up the quorum for the service to be conducted in the only Jew Town of India.

		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 							 																						DIRTINESS IS LIKE VIOLENCE Shobita Punja																					T o remember M.K. Gandhi on the day of his martyrdom would be to remember too what he so firmly believed in, that cleanliness and simplicity were the closest things to godliness. Perhaps he would weep to see the state of our cities, and how careless we have been to those historic monuments of our past. A place that is clean looks cared for, and one knows how one feels when one enters a dirty place and one that is kept clean and dust free.																					Gandhi had advised everyone in the ashram to take turns in sanitary service, saying that it was a special calling but a universal duty that everyone should participate in the cleanliness of their environment: Harbour impurity of mind or body and you have untruth and violence in you (July 6, 1947).																					In the process of preserving our heritage and how we present our cities, it would be economical to realize that good maintenance every day and throughout the year is far cheaper than restoring a building once it has been damaged. Finding that the drain has been blocked and cleaning it is less expensive and can be done by virtually anyone, whereas a blocked drain over years can become a garden patch of all kinds of growing plants and trees with roots which reach down to find water that cause excessive and expensive damage to the building.																					Lime is understood to be a disinfectant, and kept the homes free of ants, insects and termites. We have an age-old tradition  every year after the monsoons and as a means of preparing for Diwali, we would white-wash our homes, and re-thatch our roofs and mud plaster the floor to hold us in good stead through the winter months.																					The simple washing of gold and silver objects with soap and water, and the regular dusting of books and cupboards to coincide with festivals that you celebrate will go a long way in preserving what you and your family treasure. Paper and books kept near sunlight and heat and direct artificial light tend to turn yellow over time and can fade and tear very easily. Grandmothers used to keep sun-dried neem leaves in cupboards and trunks and between books to ensure their safety over years. Grandmothers ways are still the best: simple, easy ways of staying clean and caring for what matters to you and the family. Just dusting wooden objects and ensuring that old family photographs are in albums or between butter paper or tissue paper and not stacked in heaps are ways to prevent them getting stuck to one another when the area is damp and there is humidity in the air. 																					Clean-up time																					Its about the regular care of objects that have some significance to you and the family, and making a ritual out of regular maintenance of things that you hold precious. Say, just before your birthday or a family festival, make it a clean-up time for everyone. Then comes the daily looking-at of historic buildings in your town to look out for tell-tale signs, like water-marks suggesting leakage and drains that are sprouting with vegetation. 																					If enthused by a commitment to conservation, become a constant writer of letters to the authorities. I recently visited a museum and immediately wrote to the director to suggest what they can do to keep the pigeons from entering their galleries and defecating over the sculptures of our deities. Whenever you visit a place of worship, keep your eyes open for tell-tale signs, and inform the authorities. Someone somewhere will wake up to the reality that cleanliness and regular maintenance are much cheaper than expensive repairs, and that cleanliness is godliness in this country, which many revere as the land of Mahatma Gandhi.

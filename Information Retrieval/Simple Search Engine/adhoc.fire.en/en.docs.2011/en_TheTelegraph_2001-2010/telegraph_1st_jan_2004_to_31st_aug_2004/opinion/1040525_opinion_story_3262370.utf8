		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 							 																						FOR MORE VARIETY Brash and unrelenting, Mayavati does not shy away from altering her caste formula if that gets her what she wants, writes Tapas Chakraborty Reckoning with MayavatiThe approach of the Bahujan Samaj Party chief, Mayavati, to Dalit politics has more variety than what her own wardrobe can probably offer her. This feisty woman leader in Uttar Pradesh deviated from her own political script this time, pitched herself as the sole leader of the party as doubts rose about her ability to lead, and emerged stronger by scotching fears of being politically maimed.																														Her partys journey had begun in the Eighties with the politicization of disadvantaged lower castes and poorer classes. Aggressive caste slogans to unite the multi-ethnic backward castes helped to some extent and Kanshi Ram himself came to epitomize the backward caste battle against social orthodoxy. The BSP always aimed at a broad-based party structure. But this time Mayavati seems to have really succeeded in dispelling the notion that the BSP stood for the Jatavs or the Chamars, and that it is just a Dalit party. Even as she kept up her aggressive campaign against social orthodoxy, Mayavati generously allowed for the inclusion of Jhakums, Jadavas, Jats, Kurmis and even Brahmins in her scheme of things. So the subnational identities of the Dalits merged conveniently with contemporary political interests to re-establish a new goal for the outfit.																														During her poll campaign, Mayavati told her loyal voters, who often had to wait for long under the blistering April sun, Our time has come. Mayavatis political rhetoric worked like magic on her voters while the highly emotive issues of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the rather low-key development appeal of the Congress remained limited in their impact.																														Managing her campaign single-handedly while her political mentor, Kanshi Ram, continued to fight a grim battle for survival in a nursing home of New Delhi, Mayavati seized her opportunity. Her party picked up 19 seats from UP, 5 seats more than her 1999 tally. In 1996, the figure was just 6 and in 1998, 10. Mayavatis increased vote share reflects the growing Dalit assertion in politics. In 1998, Mayavatis vote share was 20.90 per cent, which shot up to 22 per cent in 1999, and an estimated 30 per cent this time. Even the percentage of upper caste votes rose from 3.6 in 1991 to 10.2 in 1999. This time, the percentage of upper caste votes increased by 5 per cent, according to party sources.																														Mayavati had asserted in 1999 that her party would do well without an alliance. She has been vindicated. The alliance with the Congress, she realized, would have benefited the Congress more than her own party.																														A break-up of the BSPs tally suggests that it has purely been a triumph of the strategy she had adopted. Not known to be strong in eastern UP, the BSP snatched six seats from both the Samajwadi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party this time. This is part of the area which is considered to be the command area of the temple movement. Mayavati used Mulayam Yadavs own caste formula to outsmart his candidates in these areas. She offered tickets to five rebel candidates of the Samajwadi Party who had parted company with Mulayam Yadav on the eve of the polls and joined Behenji. They are Mitra Sen Yadav (Faizabad), Bholachand Yadav (Khalilabad), Ramakant Yadav (Machlishahar), Umakant Yadav (Chandauli) and Kailashnath Yadav (Azamgarh). They have all won. The Samajwadi Party lost some of its key seats here and the BJP lost all its 11 seats. The Congress, which had drawn a blank in this area, however managed to get the Varanasi and Bansgaon seats.																														In central UP, Mayavati also cleverly used a unique variation in her caste strategy to bag seats. The region, which includes the dacoit-infested heartlands, has its share of baddies. Mayavati used the Kurmi-Jatav-Muslim combination to secure her position here. She has snatched Bilhaur from the BJP and Mirzapur from the Samajwadi Party. In Shahabad, Behenji had initially played a Muslim card, but sensing anti-incumbency, she changed the candidate. Thus the BSP won eight seats from the central region. In Unnao, the BSP gave the ticket to a Brahmin candidate to ensure victory.																														The BJPs explanation  that the party lost because its voters did not come out to vote due to the heat wave  does not hold much water. The party faced dissension in central UP. While senior BJP leaders hovered across the skies in their helicopters and chartered planes, party workers at the district level were left high and dry.																														It is in the Agra-Mathura-Aligarh-Amroha belt of western UP that Mayavati fought a grim battle against the Samajwadi Party and a resurgent Congress. The BJPs attempt to exploit Kalyan Singhs ability to use Lodh-Rajput and Brahmin voters to split the Muslim vote fell flat. The party not only failed to split the minority vote, it was also unable to make any dent in the backward segments of western UP. The Samajwadi Party here offered Mayavati a stiff challenge by forging a Jat-Muslim-Yadav axis. The party had roped in the Rastriya Lok Dal, offering Ajit Singh 10 seats, three of which Singh won. By fielding 17 Muslim candidates and over 27 Dalit candidates for the polls, she sought to put the Jatav-Muslim combine at the vanguard of her new caste mantra. A conscious attempt was also made to rope in non-Yadav backwards like Gujjars and Pasis, who have long felt marginalized in her party. In pockets dominated by upper castes, Mayavati fielded 8 Thakurs and 5 Brahmins.																														But on the whole, all this failed to counter a resurgent Congress and a more organized Samajwadi Party. In Bundelkhand, her candidates faced a severe anti-incumbency wave. Other than the 4 seats which have remained with the BSP for a long time, no more came to Mayavatis fold.																														Despite the drawbacks, Mayavati is quietly working towards broadening her partys caste base by making an appeal to caste sentiments. She is trying to cut across class differences and broaden the political appeal of the disadvantaged socio-ethnic religious segments and provide them a separate identity. Earlier it used to be only Jatavs, now Mayavati shares a section of Lodh votes in eastern UP, and wherever the BJP is losing out on caste votes, Mayavati is moving in. Dhobis used to vote for the BJP. This time the vote appears to have reverted back to the BSP. 																														Like Kanshi Ram, Mayavati has been cutting short her social reforms mission and trying to manoeuvre her way to get a control on the administration so as to be able to offer some concessions to the disadvantaged classes. She has been telling her voters that the criminal cases and scandals involving her are the result of the compromises she had to make in politics to be able to get into the power-sharing arrangement. This time too she had tried her best to lobby for a place in the Central coalition.																														Brash in her style of operation and ever-ready to humiliate those she finds fault with, Mayavati does not see her caste base eroding. She throws out leaders at her own whim. Senior Muslim leaders like Rashid Alvi, once close to Mayavati, was shooed out of her party but Alvi never dared to field himself from Amroha where he had won on a BSP ticket. Incidentally, this brashness of Mayavati does not affect her one bit as far as her political prospects are concerned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, February 23, 2004 							 																						HEALING TOUCH																														Healthcare, in West Bengal, is a violent affair. There are two kinds of violence in the urban and rural government hospitals: first, the often-fatal violence done to patients, at their most vulnerable, by vengeful hospital staff; second, the violently disruptive protests in hospital premises against the first by the aggrieved family and neighbours of such patients, or by local party cadre acting on their behalf. Needless to say, these two kinds of violence feed each other. A few days ago, Sadhana Debnath was brought to the subdivisional hospital in Islampur late at night, after she had delivered a child at home. She was treated by the nurses there, and then sent to an attendant to be cleaned. This attendant demanded Rs 100 from the patients family, who were too poor to pay this. She then pushed the patient off her trolley after assaulting her kin. The patient died soon after, and the babys health showed signs of being harmed by the chaos that followed. This led to the hospitals ward-master and the superintendent being gheraoed by local members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India and the Communist Party of Indian (Marxist) the next day, stalling work within the hospital for the greater part of the day. Apart from the alleged falsification of the circumstances of the patients death by the attending doctors, the superintendent also admitted that the enraged attendant had actually been transferred from the hospital, but had come to work that day in spite of that. Quite typically, she has now been suspended, and an inquiry promised. Last August, in Malda, attendants in a delivery ward refused to look after a baby because its mother had failed to pay them the money they had demanded from her. The unattended baby fell off a trolley and died. The mother was then beaten up by these attendants, after which she died as well. Nothing has yet come of the inquiry into this incident. 																														The shocking level of brutality shown in these incidents is directly the result of infrastructural and administrative failure. Both the vulnerability of the patients and their families and the extreme disgruntlement of the staff have an economic basic. Understaffing, inadequate training, irregularities regarding transfer and failures of accountability of the local personnel to their state-level supervisors are compounded with, and foster, a pervasive and inhuman callousness. This is then taken up into political disruptiveness, and reinforced by methods of inquiry which come to nothing. This is how the desperately poor and ill come to these hospitals to die not only of callous negligence but also of active brutality and exploitation.

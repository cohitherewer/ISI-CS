The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, April 23, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Little big man				 																																																				Sir  As befits someone who is above 40, Sunjay Dutt should take responsibility for his actions. Or at least, his friends like Suniel Shetty should allow him to do so. Dutt seems to have earned Bal Thackerays wrath with his impromptu campaign for his father. But why must his friends try to shield him from the Shiv Sena chiefs anger? The report, Take Suniel, give Sunjay (April 21), could have been dismissed as two actors playing up to the big-screen idea of male bonding. But what is irritating is that every time Sunjay Dutt is in trouble  and he is in trouble quite often  people seem to trot out the theory that he is an innocent babe-in-the-woods who has been led astray by circumstances and his own gullibility. Dutt was once caught by the police with an AK-47 in his house, just as the post-Mumbai blast riots were starting. Worse, the gun was supplied by someone who had connections with those responsible for the blasts. To believe such a person is innocent is to ask for too much. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Rohini Ray, Calcutta 
				 																Expendable lives				 																																																				Sir  The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has done well to double the compensation to be paid to the kin of those who died or were injured in the stampede at the sari-distribution function held to mark Lalji Tandons birthday (Court issues sari notice to Tandon, April 21). The bench was also right to ask why the compensation should not be realized from Tandon and the organizer, Brajendra Murari Yadav. Immediately after the stampede, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had declared that compensation would be paid from the prime ministers relief fund. But this was not a natural calamity, it was a man-made disaster arising out of a political partys desperate bid for votes. Social activists and citizens groups must ensure that the guilty are made to pay. This will prevent such incidents from occurring again.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Why must the prime ministers fund be used to give compensation when the sari stampede was clearly a Bharatiya Janata Party event, organized to bribe poor voters into casting their ballots in favour of the prime minister? The BJP leadership is now busy playing down the tragedy. It has not even condemned the blatant violation of the election code of conduct. Instead, the prime minister and his cohorts have chosen to brazen it out with complete nonchalance. The enormity of the tragedy  the result of colossal mismanagement  does not seem to have touched them. Even the opposition has not gone to town over the issue, perhaps for fear that its own voter-bribing skeletons will be brought out in the open. If Atal Bihari Vajpayee had any sensitivity left, he would have withdrawn from this election, accepting moral responsibility. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shailesh Gandhi, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  God could not have chosen a better place than the prime ministers constituency to explode the India Shining myth. The tragedy exposes the reality of our economic and political scenario. Since dead women tell no tales, the Centre, the state government and the BJP are now jostling to provide succour to the survivors so that they do not lose out on the votes of those who are alive.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mrinmoy Goswami, Nagaon

				 																																																				Sir  The Election Commission has refused to include Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the bribery case registered against Lalji Tandon and two others because at the time of the incident in Lucknow, Vajpayee was not a candidate  he had not filed his nomination papers then. This is really akin to splitting hair. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The stampede could have been avoided had proper permission been taken from the state government or the police. Such mass functions, organized regularly by party-workers to please their political bosses, attract audiences far in excess of that expected  resulting in such unfortunate accidents. The government should implement stringent safety regulations and make police clearance mandatory before such functions are allowed.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  The stampede in Lucknow that resulted in 26 deaths clearly shows that the BJP has no respect for the law or the model code of conduct. The EC should take a strong view of the incident and bring the guilty to book. Besides, is Tandon so important a figure that his birthday should be celebrated on such a grand scale? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In a poor country like India, even a child would have appreciated that a sari distribution function had a lot of potential for disaster. But for the ruling party, which is doing all it can to retain power, the lives of a few poor women do not matter. The BJP, the prime minister and the state government have all made promises of compensation. But setting aside the fact that nothing can compensate the loss of lives, is the money ever going to reach the affected?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The news of 21 women dying in BJPs sari-distribution function in Lucknow and the Supreme Court ordering the Best Bakery retrial out of Gujarat hogged the headlines on the same day. In the circumstances, the only thing the BJP leadership can do to repair the damage to the partys image is to announce exemplary action against Lalji Tandon and Narendra Modi. Tandon erred by patronizing a history-sheeter, Brijendra Murari Yadav  allowing him to be present at the sari distribution ceremony. And Modi should be sacked because he heads a government that has been repeatedly indicted by the apex court for its biased attitude during the infamous 2002 riots. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  All newspapers in Singapore carried the news and photographs of the stampede at Lucknow. The incident not only belies the euphoria about our progress, but is also proof of the widening gap between the haves and have-nots. The BJP and Lalji Tandon were not being kind, they were actually trifling with the poor. Those who really have the desire to help the less fortunate can do so in a less ostentatious and harmful manner. And they need not wait for the elections.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chaitali Tarafdar, Singapore

		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 							 																						KING SEES RED																														A political vacuum is a sure recipe for anarchy. This has been particularly true of Nepal, where the collapse of the political process has added grist to the Maoist mill. Now that King Gyanendra has asked the political parties to suggest an acceptable name for the prime ministers post, there is some hope of an end to Nepals dangerous drift. But the monarchs move may have only broken the ice. Ever since the king dismissed an elected prime minister nearly two years ago, the country has witnessed a deepening distrust between the crown and the political parties. This largely explains why two subsequent prime ministers, appointed by the palace, failed to win the confidence of either the parties or the Maoists. It is crucial, therefore, that the king and the parties work in an atmosphere of mutual trust in choosing the next prime minister. It would spell greater disasters for the country if the parties suspect the kings move to be a ploy to split them. At the same time, the parties now face a challenge of playing their part for the restoration of democracy. Even if the kings actions in the last two years have left much to be desired, the parties too have been disappointing in their responses to the political crisis. 																														Much more than the choice of another prime minister is actually at stake. Whoever takes charge of the government at this stage has two urgent tasks  to resume the political process that will culminate in fresh parliamentary elections, and to persuade the Maoists to return to the negotiating table. And the two tasks are inter-linked. For it could be almost impossible to hold free and fair elections without the Maoists agreeing not to disrupt them. But talking to the Maoists cannot be the same thing as submitting to their politics of blood. The new government has to defeat the Maoists strategy of holding the country to ransom, and thereby forcing the government to accept their radical demands. The two major national parties  the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist)  cannot afford to ignore the Maoist threat to establish a red republic in the country. No matter who the next prime minister is, Nepals fledgling democracy will continue to be in peril if Maoism is not defeated.

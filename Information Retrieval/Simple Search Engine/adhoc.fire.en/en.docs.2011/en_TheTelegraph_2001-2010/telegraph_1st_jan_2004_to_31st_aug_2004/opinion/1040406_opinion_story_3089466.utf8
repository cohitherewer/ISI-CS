The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 							 																						A CANDIDATES DIARYMani Talk / Mani Shankar Aiyar				 	 Leader watch																														My rival, O.S. Manian, propaganda secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (the same post J. Jayalalithaa held under MGR), is bountifully endowed with both muscle power and money power. The muscle power was displayed by his Maximum Leader last October, when I was attacked for the sin of requesting her not to politicize a development forum. As for money power, Manian overwhelmed the constituency in the month that elapsed between his name being announced and our side getting its act together, by festooning every major crossroads and bazaar street with huge hoardings, text and portraits (one Amma: large; one Manian: tiny) printed digitally on expensive flex material, in gross violation of Election Commission directions. 																														The administration apparently saw nothing. Certainly it did nothing. There was also a riot of in-your-face colour on walls and culverts along highways and many public spaces, boring it into the voters eyes that Ammas candidate was none other than the redoubtable O.S. Manian. Panic and alarm in our ranks that Manian had won the first round. A brief but pointed complaint to the chief electoral officer has set that right. The hoardings have been dismantled, the wall-paintings painted over. My alliance partners are amazed that the Jayalalithaa administration can be brought to heel. 																														Round two, I think (I pray!) to me. Going by the calls my wife and I have received, the TV programme on my constituency in the NDTV series, Follow the Leader (Wot me, Leader?), seems to have been seen by several, from Kashmir to Lakshadweep as it were. But the Tamil viewing, particularly in my constituency, has been minimal. Almost no one knows any English, and those who do prefer to get their English-language news bulletins from Sun TVs alternate half-hour telecasts. Our urban middle class might find it educative to learn that the bulk of our electorate does not even know the existence of, let alone be influenced by, what happens on satellite television. A decade after the liberalization of the air-waves, it is still Doordarshan that rules the waves. So, whos afraid of the Star wolf?																														The miracle of cellular telephony has transformed communication between candidates and their minders. So I was taken aback when my chaps asked me to buy them a wireless communication system. (The pressing reason for this was that at one crucial point in the last campaign, the advance vehicle took one fork and my driver another, and we did not meet up again till after sunset!) Cell phones should eliminate a repeat of that disaster. But the footprint fades at the edge of our major towns. In well over half the constituency, the mobile just goes dead. So much for India Shining.																														The endless delay in the Congress finalizing its list of candidates for the mere ten constituencies it is contesting in Tamil Nadu has finally ended. I was among the lucky two to get their candidacies announced many weeks ago. But I could not get my campaign off the ground because the way senior Tamil Nadu Congress leaders went around burning effigies of the Congress general-secretary in charge of Tamil Nadu (and blaming me for not joining in!), frightened many of our alliance partners into fearing that another breakaway Tamil Maanila Congress was in the making. The tumult and the shouting have now died down with the announcement of nine of the ten candidates. But I am being asked whether the Congress is a party or a dharamshala since we have given the ticket to a non-Congressman in preference to a sitting MP, who has turned in an exceptionally dedicated performance in the House. The lesson to be learned is that while merging a faction with a national party, as the returning Congressman has memorably declared, is a process, not an event, apparently getting a Congress ticket can be an event, not a process!																														Manian is proving a true chela of his Amma. Punning on my name, he has said, This Aiyar is a Poiyar (This Aiyar is a Liar). Beats Mani-Talk in its penchant to amuse and abuse! He has also been regaling audiences with his story of a meal in my Delhi house. It was one of the more forgettable episodes of my life, so I cannot for the life of me remember what was on the menu. But Manian was apparently appalled at being served chicken in an Aiyar household. I wish I could find a clipping of Vir Sanghvis Sunday magazine comment, If Mani is a Brahmin, then I am an uttappam. The other extraordinary remark of Manians doing the rounds is that on being asked why the crowds that receive me are larger and more enthusiastic than his, he is reported to have replied, Because Aiyar is fair and I am dark. One can now see the combination of racism, casteism and communalism that marks out the Amma lot for what they are.																														I decided to file my nomination on April 23 because it is the birthday of Shakespeare, to whom I owe both my English and my income. Alas, the astrologers have decided otherwise. April 21 has been declared the auspicious date and 11 am to 12.30 pm the auspicious hour. I have tried to argue that since all candidates will be filing on the same date and in the same hour, but only one will be winning the election, obviously the same date and hour cannot be auspicious for all. But I have been shushed and sternly told that if they continue to listen to me, Ill make atheists of them all. So, its Shakespeare out and the Nadi Josiars of Vaitheeswarankoil in.																														Manian has boasted that as a Rajya Sabha MP (1995-2001), he spent Rs 10 lakh of his MPs local area development scheme funds in the Mayiladuturai constituency. I have been quick to point out that I have spent Rs 10 crore of the same funds in the same constituency and suggested that in proportion to the funds spent, it would only be fair if for every ten votes cast for me, one were to be cast for him. My trump card is the scheme. Through equitable distribution of the resources available, I have succeeded in reaching every one of the panchayats in my constituency and every one of my urban wards. 																														My campaign is, therefore, totally localized, stressing the particular facility provided in the locality rather than the overall performance in the constituency. I discovered to my cost in the 1996 election (which I lost) that when I boasted of a refinery coming up on the coast, voters inland wanted to know, why there, why not here? Thus the first rule of any election campaign: Remember, envy over-rides gratitude. The voter is less interested in what he has been given than in what his neighbour has received. We should hire Onida to run our elections.																														I have often wondered what computers have to do with a backward rural constituency like mine. Now I know. For Manian kicked off his campaign by posing the question: This fellow has been your Lok Sabha MP for two terms, what has he done about the Cauvery? I said I would reply to that question, but first I wanted to have his answer to my counter-question: This fellow has been a Rajya Sabha MP for six years, what has he done about the Cauvery? I then went to the internet for the answer, and was delighted to find that in his six years in Parliament, and six years as a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Manian never once spoke about the Cauvery. So, Ive socked that to him. Thank you, Bill Gates!

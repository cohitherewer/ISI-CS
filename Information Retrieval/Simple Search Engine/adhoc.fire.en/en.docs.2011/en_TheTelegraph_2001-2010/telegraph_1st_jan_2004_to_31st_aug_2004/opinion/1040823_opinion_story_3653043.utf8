The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 23, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Perfectly outrageous				 																																																				Sir  One can imagine that the article, Cute angina adds fuel to outsource fire (Aug 20), must create difficulties for journalists as these potentially life-threatening errors are also hilarious. That aside, there is a clear and insidious streak of nationalism in the article that makes it not exactly objective. Are we to believe the 14,000 a year paid to British secretaries in the NHS is an impressive figure simply because it is three times what is paid to Indian-based secretaries? Does anyone appreciate that given the cost of living in England, 14,000 places a London-based worker barely above the poverty line? The issue here  from the viewpoint of a non-British citizen living in London  is that the NHS has become a quagmire of red tape, a top-heavy juggernaut that has so lost touch with front-line patient care that it is at the mercy of a spellchecker tool on a computer in India. By the way, you are correct on the standards of spelling over here. Atrocious.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sean Maher, Liverpool, UK
				 																A father speaks				 																																																				Sir  On the evening of August 7, my son, a drug addict, came to my shop and took away cash from the cash-box, after slapping and hitting me when I resisted. The crowd of passers-by which had collected on the road were told, it is a matter between father and son. The police at the Bhawanipur Police Station said as much to me when I narrated the incident to them (general diary no. 699 on 7.8. 2004). The officer at the thana was kind enough to suggest that I approach an NGO as the law did not permit the police to intervene. 				 																																																				I understand that there is a law against beating (even if the victim is a 70-year-old man and happens to be an addicts father) and snatching money for the daily fix. The police should have taken action to protect me. My son inhales brown sugar, injects morphine intravenously, and swallows Mandrax and ATS tablets, or a combination of them. 				 																																																				My wife died five years ago but for many years, both of us spared no expense to correct this wayward son of ours. He was sent to a number of NGOs for rehabilitation, but they either gave up on him or he ran away after creating disturbances at their centre. The psychiatrists and psychologists who treated him felt unanimously that he was beyond help as he lacked the will to fight his addiction. He treated addiction as a way to get easy money without doing any work and without fear of law or social repercussions. Doctors treat his abnormal acts of violence and thieving as symptoms of temporary insanity, either real or feigned. Otherwise, he is normal and so, he cannot be restrained on grounds of insanity. 				 																																																				When the doctors have given him up as a lost cause and the law does not step in to protect me from his patently criminal acts, whom shall I turn to? I am in despair as I find no way to redress my plight.				 																																																				In many south Asian countries drug-related offences are strongly dealt with  at times the death sentence is even resorted to  to check addiction which leads to the spread of AIDS and crime. In Argentina, a high-profile addict like Maradona was incarcerated against his will, but our law enforcement machinery turns a blind eye to this menace, even when a specific crime is reported.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
S. Ajaib Singh Gill, Calcutta

				 																High on drugs				 																																																				Sir  Instead of controlling the prices of all life-saving drugs, as proposed by Ram Vilas Paswan, the Union chemicals and fertilizer ministry should identify the drugs which enjoy a monopoly and are excessively priced (Centre-state pact on drug price vigil Aug 19). Even for such drugs, what the government should do is try to provide a conducive investment climate for foreign pharmaceutical companies instead of punishing the monopoly drug-maker with price controls. Greater competition will drive away monopoly and the resultant high prices. The proposal for a uniform tax rate of 4 per cent on drugs is also praiseworthy and should be lapped up by state governments as a precursor to VAT. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sanjoy Banka, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  It is nothing short of shocking to know that by the price a customer pays for a medicine may be several multiples of what a retailer paid the wholesaler. The pharmaceutical companies, it seems, are utterly ruthless in the pursuit of profit and unmindful of its repercussions on that large section of our population which lives in abject poverty. I can think of few offences that are as inhumane. Then there are many manufacturers of spurious drugs to sell their products to physicians and retailers using a load of incentives and freebies. 				 																																																				A medicine is not like other products. Few buyers are suspicious or resentful when buying medicines though they may complain about the unaffordable prices. Every citizen should stand up against such exploitative practices so that no company ever has the nerve to fleece customers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Salil Gewali, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir  If a medicine that costs about Rs 2 per strip of ten is marked up for sale at a maximum retail price of Rs 25 plus tax, then such profitability should be equally attractive for the drug mafia. Shouldnt the latter then switch over to the pharmaceuticals business? Such huge profit margins are not only akin to loot, but they are quite unethically earned on human suffering. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

				 																																																				Sir  While it is good that Ram Vilas Paswan wants to regulate the prices of essential drugs, the Union chemicals minister must know that price controls are a relic of an earlier era of greater government control. Globalization has helped Indian drug companies the most, especially by opening markets abroad. He cannot now turn back the clock.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ganesh Saha, Calcutta

				 																Say it again				 																																																				Sir  Cusec, by definition is a unit of flow, especially of water, equal to one cubic foot per second. As such, 10,000 cusecs per second communicates nothing, apart from the ignorance of the correspondent (Tibet dam overflows but holds, Aug 13).				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Tapan Pal, Batanagar

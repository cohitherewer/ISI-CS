The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 22, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Who did Avtar Singh in? The party. At least that is one rumour doing the rounds at present. The doings of the Jyotirmoyee Sikdar-Avtar Singh duo, apparently common knowledge in political circles for some time, are supposed to have created a serious divide in the North 24 Parganas leadership. While a section of the leaders is alleged to have been happy to operate through the couple, given the rich dividends the association bore them during the elections and even normal times, others were definitely not (for reasons of their own). The latter group got in touch with the top brass, particularly those leaders in Alimuddin Street who were unfavourably disposed to Sikdar-Singhs alleged patron in the party. Another dimension emerged soon. Since it would not be too pleasant to have an open fight in the red ranks, the greens were roped in. The dissenting North 24 Parganas leadership reportedly got in touch with their Trinamooli friends to kick up a fuss. The matter could then be officially looked into. But then people seem to have been in a desperate hurry to cause Avtar his headaches and nausea. Which is probably why the raid preceeded any speeches from the podium against Avtar. Clean up before the municipal elections?				 																																																																														 Is Pranabda still sulking for being denied the countrys top post and being forced to work under a man he himself, as finance minister, once appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of India? Mukherjees anger seems to have been on public display on August 15, when, breaking protocol, he failed to turn up to receive the PM at the Red Fort. Yet the Independence Day function at the fort is organized by his own ministry. Or was it just a coincidence that Pranabda arrived late that day?				 																																																																														 Newshounds can now have more reason to be happy about posing questions to Amar Singh, the Samajwadi Party leader, as a recent encounter proved. The other day, when Singh was waiting for his car in the crowded portico of the parliament, scribes cornered him for his views on the Congresss decision to go back to its BMW (Brahmin-Muslim-weaker sections) plank in UP. Singh answered them in his usual glib style. There was an added feature though. He had a popular ditty to go with almost every answer  an evidence of his rich repertoire of Hindi songs, among his other talents. 				 																																																																														 What is it that made Nata Mullick sick that day after the hanging? Some very natural emotions about the dead man, or the pressure of having to live up to the image of a newsmaker, or worse still, the anxiety of having to negotiate with the newshounds of the electronic media who had gathered outside the jail and were stalking his home? A war apparently had broken out among the news channels for getting an exclusive with Nata after his official act. Prices were quoted and Nata, reportedly, wooed with the bottle. Reporters apparently even went to the extent of feeding each other wrong information about the itinerary of the hangman to shoo off others following the scent. In the end, only one channel managed to nab him. Wonder at what cost to Natas health and their pocket!				 																																																																														 North Block officials have much to thank their stars for. P Chidambaram seems to have mellowed down after his long political isolation and is now far less abrasive in his behaviour towards his babus than in his previous ministerial innings. The fact that he did not relocate any of his key secretaries and instead decided to wait for them to retire before filling the slots, is also proof of the new PC. The latest buzz in the N Block corridors is that after the present rev sec, Vineeta Rai, retires next month, PC wishes to appoint KM Chandrasekhar, a Kerala cadre officer and presently Indias ambassador and permanent representative to the WTO. Hope things go well.				 																																																																														 Is it time for Mamata to come back to the Congress? Priya Ranjan Das Munshi is believed to be talking to her and she is also under pressure from her party cadre for a merger. She is yet to give the final nod, but given the rush of homecomings to the Congress recently, will she be able to hold out for too long?				 																																																																														 When LK Advani was Union home minister, all traffic was stopped till his entourage had passed by. Informally, Advani was given the same security as the PM. As opposition leader, Advani reportedly enjoys the same Z-plus security as before given the threat perceptions. The present incumbent in Advanis seat of power, Shivraj Patil, faces no such security threat, but he is loathe to part with the same security. Patil, however, had not anticipated the trouble that this might cause. One fine day the parliament security staff stopped none other than Ambika Soni from proceeding in her car before the home ministers entourage had passed. Soni, being Soni, sought from the securityman the relevant order which could stop her. It turned out that there were only verbal order to that effect. Soni was then allowed to proceed, though till then there was no sign of Patils cavalcade. One still doesnt know how madam has taken the news of the bravado. That would be Sonis chief worry, not Patils reaction to her behaviour.

Not likely. Author Jean chenoz has been here for a while (since 1979, to be precise), and isnt fading out so soon. Credited the father of French magic realism, chenoz is all set to launch the translated version of his fifth book, Im Gone (published by Rupa), on September 2 in India. The book, which has already won the Goncourt Prize, is a tale of a Parisian art dealer who takes up a whole new life. As the French say, magnifique.  Lata and GitaWhat is all the song and dance about, you might ask. But dancing sisters Lata and Gita, last seen as teenagers years ago on Doordarshan in serials like Upasana and Aalayam, have found themselves back in the news again, now that theyve grown up. The girls, back from a serial for Singapore-based TV12, are now trying to spread the message of peace through their dance. They started with adapting old plays like Shri Aurobindos Savitri and the Tamil classic Vaibogame to the dance form. And now, its Kabirs dohas and Jesus teachings. But weve been true to the form of the dance, they insist. The President of India loved their work last week. Certificate enough!

		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 							 																						ACTS OF TERROR																														Keeping promises, especially electoral ones, is an honourable thing. When the National Democratic Alliance had announced its own war against terror by pushing through the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Congress had duly opposed the law, particularly in the states ruled by it. The opposition had to stick to its position when it came back to power, and repeal of the POTA was therefore one of the promises made in the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme. Now, in a necessary political move, the UPA has announced its intention to move a repeal bill in the second half of the budget session. It has also become important now, after 9/11, for India to present its credentials to the international community with regard to its commitment to counter-terrorism. Interestingly, both the NDA and the UPA have used the POTA with the United Nations as proof of the effective implementation of the UN security council resolution 1373.																														An anti-terror law acquires its character from the way it is used by the society in which it exists. In the long history of opposition to the POTA, the Supreme Court had repeatedly pointed this out, ruling that it was not essentially unconstitutional for the Centre to ensure the existence of such a law. Each state had to sort out its attitude to and execution of the law. And this had to do with its understanding of the relations between security, justice and power. This was the level at which the POTA revealed its draconian potentials, its capacity to undermine fundamental human rights and civil liberties. It is therefore still possible to preserve part of the spirit of the law within the garb of an earlier, less condemned, law. This is what happened when the POTA took over from the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, and the government will have to be careful while working on the existing Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, to prepare it for replacing the POTA. As the uses of the latter in states like Gujarat, Kashmir and Jharkhand have repeatedly shown, some of the fundamental premises of the evidentiary and investigative process may be turned on their heads by a law that had reversed accepted principle and practice by placing the burden of proof on the accused. Nothing less than a clearer definition of terror and terrorism is needed for the new law to strike the proper balance between legality and firmness.

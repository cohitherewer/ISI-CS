The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, February 16, 2004 							 																						WITH BAT AND BALL																														The prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, did not need to bowl a googly to ensure that the Indian cricket team tours Pakistan. The alternative proposal that the tour should take place after the elections in May was too absurd to be even contemplated. Only someone who has completely lost his marbles could have seriously considered playing cricket in May in Pakistan. The outcome of Mr Vajpayees intervention was a foregone conclusion, since cricket between India and Pakistan was part of the peace initiative that the prime minister had mooted a few months back. Doubts over the tour arose out of security concerns. It should be pointed out to those voicing the fears that if security is a serious consideration, then a tour in March or May makes no difference. It is highly unlikely that the situation in Pakistan will improve dramatically in the next two months. In todays world, it is not possible for security to be foolproof anywhere. It can be expected that since Mr Pervez Musharraf is so eager to resume cricketing ties with India, he will take extra care to provide security for the Indian players. This can bring some psychological comfort to the players and their families.																														One of the key instruments in Mr Vajpayees poll tactics is what the spin-doctors have dubbed the feel good factor. This factor will be multiplied many times over when millions of Indians will see the Indian players performing on Pakistani soil. And if the much-flaunted uncertainty of cricket brings forth a win in Pakistan, Mr Vajpayee can go laughing all the way to the vote bank. The prime minister, just before the general elections, is in a win-win situation so far as cricket with Pakistan is concerned. A victory by the cricket team will help him no end, but even otherwise he will receive kudos at home and abroad for having taken the initiative to break the ice and for having persuaded Sourav Ganguly and Co to place patriotism before security. The cricketers go to Pakistan, therefore, as ambassadors of peace. This may not be best for the game of cricket, but the latter, like ping-pong between China and the United States of America in the Seventies, will be a proxy for a major diplomatic breakthrough. Ganguly and his boys will have the rare satisfaction, if not honour, of knowing that they played more than cricket for India. The bat and the ball and a piece of green might succeed where diplomats have failed. An English game will bring together two people the British divided.

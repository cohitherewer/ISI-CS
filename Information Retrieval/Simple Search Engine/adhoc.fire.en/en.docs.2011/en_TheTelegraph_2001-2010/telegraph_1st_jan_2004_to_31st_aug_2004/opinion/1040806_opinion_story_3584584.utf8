Faced especially with the Western way of warfare, Indian princes were forced to modernize their governments and armies. For Europeanizing their regimes, the Indian monarchs depended on the skills of European officers. This provided an opportunity for enterprising Europeans to make money in India. Claude Martin was one such. The 262 letters, written by him to persons in India and Europe, and edited here by Rosie Llewellyn-Jones, throws light on his life and times.																														Martin was born in Lyon in 1735. His father was a vinegar-maker. At the age of 16, he joined the army of the French India Company. With his sharp political instinct, he realized that its future was not too bright. So, in 1760, he deserted it to join the British East India Companys army. Llewellyn-Jones refuses to call this a treachery, classifying it as a clever career move. Using his political connections, Martin got himself appointed as the superintendent of the Nawabs arsenal at Lucknow. With Lucknow as his base, he went on to make money by various means. His letters contain details of his commercial activities.																														Martin bought a huge estate named Najafgarh, where he produced indigo and sold it to the markets in Europe. He also bought indigo from merchants of north India and sold them at a higher price to European business houses. Martin indulged in usury as well. He lent money to Company officials, European mercenaries, the Marathas and the Awadh treasury at 12 per cent interest. He further increased his profit by investing in East India Companys bonds. He helped European mercenaries like General De Boigne (who made a fortune while serving with the Marathas) in their commercial transactions. Such transactions always involved a hefty commission for him. Martin used his profits to build a grand mansion at Lucknow. He also imported high-quality glass, cutlery, watches and dresses from Europe.																														Martin realized that he could make hay only as long as the East India Company tolerated his presence. To please the Company, he provided news of Awadhs political conditions to its officials in Calcutta, despite being an official of the Awadh Nawab. Martin reported the lethargy of Nawabi administration to Company officials and urged them to annex the state. Being a cartographer too, he passed his know-how about Awadh to the British. This helped the British to move troops along the roads and river crossings of Awadh during emergencies. In his letters to the governor-generals, Martin claimed that he had become a British and wished them success within and outside India.																														Martins attitude towards India and Indians, regardless of class and gender, remained poor. He never stopped carping about the Indian weather. In his letters to Company officials, he abused the nawabs of Awadh. Indian businessmen and officials who came to Martins aid also got a bad name. With his wealth, Martin maintained a zenana. Towards the end of his life, he wrote to De boigne that being unable to leave India, he had to do with the Indian beauties who were no match for the European ladies.																														Llewellyn-Jones is too soft on Martin, who always contrasted the alien and inferior India with the West. Indians today know him as the founder of the prestigious La Martinere schools. But his letters portray him as a womanizer, a treacherous, racial bigot and a man singlemindedly in pursuit of money.						KAUSHIK ROY

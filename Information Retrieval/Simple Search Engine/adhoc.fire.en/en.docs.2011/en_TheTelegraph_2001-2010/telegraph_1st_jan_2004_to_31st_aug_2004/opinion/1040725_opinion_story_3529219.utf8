The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, July 25, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Gone with the flood				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Taken at the flood (July 22), made amusing reading because it shows that like the rest, The Telegraph has also been taken for a ride. Every year task forces are religiously formed after natural calamities strike, and they die an unsung death. The prime reason behind this is the siphoning off relief funds. A cartoon of yesteryear is worth recalling. It showed a politician confiding to another, Last years relief funds helped to send my son abroad for higher studies. Hopefully, I shall be able to get my daughter married off with this years quota.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta
				 																Tragic tale				 																																																				Sir  Six murders and a suicide (July 19), was a gruesome tale. How could Shibendu Saha murder all his family members and then die a cowardly death? Who can think of killing his own children, a three-month-old infant at that? Behind this brutal mass killing lie the pressures of metro life. Other weak people like Shibendu should understand that there is more to life than horrible death, and that nothing can be achieved by taking the life of near and dear ones. Whether Amalendu Saha, Shibendus uncle, is the real culprit will be decided in the court of law, but the main culprit is definitely Shibendu, who has committed a heinous crime. The state government should hold workshops where experts will educate the common people about ways to deal with disappointments and will answer their questions about life. One more thing, there should be a ban on the extreme violence shown through the media.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The shocking murders and the lone suicide on Tollygunge Road are a sign of our times and our lack of faith in values that provide strength to live life properly. A balanced attitude is all that is needed to avoid heartbreaks. In this incident, business setbacks apparently compelled Shibendu to take the fatal step. Nothing could be more tragic than wiping out innocent lives over trivial concerns that could have been resolved with a little application of mind. Ironically, such cases are increasing with each passing day. We are obsessed with our status so much so that even a minor setback raises our heckles. Commercialization has not only eroded our finer values but is setting ourselves against our very nature. It may be difficult to face the reality but the solution does not lie in embracing death or taking lives. Yours faithfully,

It was a horrible reaction to the pent- up emotions against his uncle, and what he supposed were his aunts machinations. Pyschiatrists will attest that there are several like Shibendu whose over-sensitive minds turn the violence they feel against others inwards. Which is why we find teenagers committing suicide because they wish to punish their parents or their teachers, or, very foolishly, the establishment. Shibendu carried this logic a bit too far, by including within his orbit of hate his unsuspecting family members as well, even his young children. One wishes Shibendus immediate family had been more sensitive to his state of mind. But then social relationships are always known to distance people rather than bringing them closer.

				 																Club class				 																																																				Sir  Euro Cup has virtually revolutionized European soccer. Not only did heavyweights like Germany, Italy and England crash out, the performance of many stars also did not stand up to their reputations. Englands David Beckham became the butt of jokes for missing penalties. It was lesser-known players like Tomasson, Wayne Rooney, Ibrahimovic, Nedved and Van Nistelrooy, who stole the show.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunita Singha, Guwahati

				 																																																				Sir  The footballer, David Beckham, has been eclipsed by Brand Beckham. Beckhams dedication to the game has often been in doubt like when he said that his family mattered more to him than soccer.

		 Friday, July 16, 2004 							 																						BY THE STROKE OF THE BRUSHNOOR By Sorayya Khan, Penguin, Rs 250It was an eerie dream-vision which told Sajida, the protagonist of this novel, the exact moment when she had conceived. From that night, Sajida instinctively knew that her yet-to-be-born child would be very different from her  Sajida was certain about her unborn childs sex  peers. As the sun rose above the Margalla Hills in Rawalpindi the next morning, the name of the child suggested itself  Noor, meaning light. Noor became Sajidas secret which she could not share even with her husband.																														Sajida had come to Pakistan after being picked up from a street in Dhaka in the early Seventies, when she five and six, by an armyman called Ali. She had lost her fisherfolk family to a devastating cyclone and was taken to live in Alis household in Islamabad. Ali became her new father and Alis mother, her doting Nanijaan. 																														It was here that Sajida fell in love with and married Hussein. Until her marriage, there had been no rifts in the emotional bond between the members of the family. But things started changing  and radically  after Noor was born.																														Noor was born a clinically abnormal child, which sorely disappointed her father. But from a very young age, the little girl exhibited a strong aptitude for painting, inspired by a kind of extraordinary clairvoyance. Uncannily, her paintings revealed forgotten  and even lost  fragments of the cautiously-guarded personal memories of members of her family. As these memories came burningly alive in Noors paintings, they started to clash violently, impinging on the relations in the family.																														Sorayya Khans narrative in Noor has a dark, poignant beauty. She explores the myriad ways in which personal memories can rewrite versions of a formalized national history  in this case the history of the Bangladesh Muktijuddho in the early Seventies. 																														The novel also chronicles the process by which historical details go down as personal memories, and from there into the arcane preserve of the human subconscious.																														Khans method of rendering a psychological history depends, to a large extent, on her ability to interweave personal, biological and historical times. For instance, Noors sight of her first menstrual blood evokes in her mind the image of a red river. This, in its turn, reminds Sajida of her childhood memory of a corpse floating hand-tied in the river. This is Khans own brand of magic realism which, with its sweeping poetry, dissolves the conventional order of time and space in the narrative. 																														In a way, Noor fictionalizes the timeless and pointless, yet inescapable and horrific, human suffering which stretches from the personal to every part of his existence. The compelling images in Khans narrative thus represent an impassioned creative urge to de-anaesthetize, as it were, history.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 							 																						MORE THAN JUST SKIN-DEEP 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Semi-informed																														Addressing drug use: The expansion of injecting drug use in south Asia has been a factor in the spread of HIV/AIDS in the region...																														Much of the official response to injecting drug use has been to de-emphasize its social importance and stigmatize users as marginal members of society. Women injecting drug users are heavily stigmatized. As with other aspects of HIV/AIDS, the drug connection has not yet become a part of the official dialogue and response in many countries. Throughout the region, drug use is illegal and this leads to harassment by the police. This only prevents injecting drug users from availing of counselling and treatment services.																														Most countries offer some detoxification services, but a wider set of harm-reduction programmes that focus on both drug abuse and HIV infection hardly exist, with just one notable exception. Despite drug use being illegal in India, the north-eastern state of Manipur has undertaken harm-reduction services on an experimental basis in an attempt to reduce the vulnerability of injecting drug users. The programme includes needle exchange and education about sterilizing drug equipment. This is the only needle exchange programme operating in the country. The results have been positive, with a one-third decline in HIV infections among injecting drug users between the mid-and late-Nineties.																														Effective responses, focusing on harm reduction: Given this background, the potential exists both for HIV to spread beyond injecting drug users and for a range of actions by policy makers and influential authorities. The policy response must involve the following: recognizing that injecting drug use is a factor in national HIV epidemics; ending the prevailing discrimination and marginalization of injecting drug users, with legal reforms, where necessary; and taking up harm reduction strategies, including needle exchange programmes and education about sterilizing injecting equipment.																														Adolescent Sexual Health Needs: The fact that adolescents are sexually active is a reality most south Asian societies tend to deny. Despite high levels of sexual activity, adolescents were found to have limited knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases, reproductive tract infections and HIV. Ignorance about sexual health issues makes them less able to make informed choices about safer sex and, hence, increases their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The problem is compounded by the fact that, across the region, policy makers and opinion leaders disapprove of efforts to increase adolescents knowledge about sexual health and see it as polluting young minds. Girls are especially vulnerable since they have little control in sexual relationships and are not supposed to be aware of sexual matters. Some countries like India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal are making attempts to make youth aware of sexual health issues and improve reproductive health services but such efforts are not systematic. Sri Lanka stands out as the only country whose population and reproductive health policy has specific provisions about adolescents. Moreover, a large number of young people also form part of mobile populations, with associated vulnerabilities.																														Effective responses, acknowledging the problem and addressing it: Any effort to check the spread of HIV among the youth has to first acknowledge the fact of adolescent sexuality. The other elements of the strategy to reduce the vulnerability of youth should be: undertaking information, education and communication programmes that will increase the awareness of youth about matters relating to sexual health; and addressing gender inequalities and disempowering norms in life skills programmes.

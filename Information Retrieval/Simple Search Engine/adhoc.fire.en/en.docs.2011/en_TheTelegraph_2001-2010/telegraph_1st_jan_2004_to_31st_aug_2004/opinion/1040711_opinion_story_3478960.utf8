				 																																																																														 The problem with budgets is that they are one-man shows. The rest of the political cast has nothing to do but play a supporting role. Worse, even for a walk-on role, one must have at least a rudimentary knowledge of economics, enough to give sensible sound bytes to the media. No wonder, Sadhu and Subhash Yadav felt that they had some catching up to do if they wanted to bask in the reflected glory of their brother-in-law, Laloo Prasad Yadav, presenting this years rail budget. With this in mind, they dropped in on RK Singh, railway board chief. Singh had little time for the duo, but considering their proximity to the minister, he began to explain the finer points of the budget in slow but chaste English. Just as he thought the briefing was almost over, Sadhu interrupted, asking whether it wouldnt be better for the national audience if he spoke in the rashtra bhasha. Realizing that Sadhu had understood nothing, Singh began again, in Hindi this time. But if he expected any gratitude for his troubles, he wasnt going to get any. Singh had not said anything he hadnt known before, Subhash chipped in this time. So miffed was Singh that he didnt even bother to switch on the TV to find out what the duo finally said. 				 																																													Kalyan Singh, on the other hand, had a more sophisticated way of covering up his ignorance. When the TV cameras sought him out for his reactions, he beat a retreat, mumbling that he had to study the proposals more closely. But that didnt mean the former UP chief minister was pleased when the more suave Ravi Shankar Prasad appeared on the scene, willing to take on the reporters. Some people still think they are I amp;B ministers, Kalyan sniped. Some people have opinions, Prasad might have retorted. 				 																																																																														 Monkey business  thats whats complicating life for Mani Shankar Aiyar these days. Having won in Mayiladurai and taken over as the minister for petroleum and natural gas, Aiyar was on the lookout for a nice big bungalow. Not an easy task with ministers of the erstwhile NDA cabinet yet to vacate their houses. Aiyar thought he had a lucky break when the Pataudis  Mansur Ali Khan and his wife, Sharmila  vacated a plush bungalow on Kamraj Road, a stones throw from Parliament House. But just as he was about to move in, an unusual snag occurred. Apparently, the house was a favourite haunt of the monkeys that swarmed this part of Lutyens Delhi and sometime ago, the dogs of a neighbour had mauled a baby monkey. Ever since, groups of monkeys had taken to conducting surprise raids on all the houses on the road in a kind of simian reprisal. The Aiyars are back, it seems, to house-hunting. Better luck to them this time! 				 																																																																														 Journos in the capital had a gala time last week at the farewell party of Navtej Sarna, the MEA spokesman. Only Sarna wasnt going anywhere. His transfer as joint secretary, disarmament, had been overturned at the last minute. MEA sources say that this flip-flop happened owing to the need to ensure continuity. But the real reason has reportedly to do with the fact that Sarna is Yashwant Sinhas nephew, and Natwar Singhs realization of this connection only after he had ordered Sarnas transfer. Not that it explains anything. But at least the party wasnt called off.				 																																																																														 But Navtej Sarnas is not the most unusual placement decision taken in the ministry of external affairs lately. That distinction should go to Tara Singh, who was to have retired in June but was given an extension  or reemployment for one year  as ambassador of Belarus. Not only is this unprecedented, but it is also in violation of service guidelines. Rumours have it that Tara Singh owes his good luck to Harkishen Singh Surjeet, who was in Minsk for an operation. Clearly, the grand old man of the Indian left hasnt given up on the Soviet dream, even if the world has. Whatever, Surjeet spoke to the powers-that-be in New Delhi, who are more inclined to listen to him these days. 				 																																																																														 Why is Sonia Gandhi so enamoured of Punjab? Four of her partys candidates for the Rajya Sabha polls are from Punjab  among them Sukhbans Singh Bhinder, who lost three consecutive Lok Sabha elections from Gurdaspur. Two of the governors the Congress president nominated recently are Punjabis. Earlier, she had favoured the Punjab da puttars in the Lok Sabha elections from Delhi. And last but not the least, Manmohan Singh too is from the state. No wonder Congressmen joke, Punjab ki balle balle, baki sab thalle thalle.				 																																																																														 Why was Madanlal Khurana the only governor appointed by the NDA to have escaped the recent mass sacking? Apparently, the Congress doesnt want him back in Delhi where he could queer the pitch for Sheila Dixit. They feel he is more useful in Rajasthan where he will brew trouble for Vasundhara Raje. 				 																																																																														 Indian politicians are a little too free with the sweet talk, the false smile, the insincere promise. Mostly they get away with it, but there are times when no amount of charm can mend matters  as Sushil Kumar Shinde, the chief minister of Maharashtra, recently found out. He was taking a flight on a private airliner to the capital and was a good 45 minutes late for boarding. Naturally, the plane was kept waiting with all the passengers fuming at the delay. The negative vibes were so strong that Shinde could sense them as soon as he got in. He tried a weak smile and a feeble apology about urgent business that had kept him away. But when that didnt work, Shinde went on the defensive, offering to get off if that would pacify his fellow passengers. To Shindes utter surprise, a passenger in the economy class took up the gauntlet, asking him to please, suit actions to words. Thankfully, an airhostess saved the day, saying that Shinde should stay on as his leaving would cause further delay. The CMs office was gracious enough to send her flowers the next day. Politicians are not all bad!

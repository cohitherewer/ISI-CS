 Shams Afif Siddiqi																								Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste By Gail Omvedt, Sage, Rs 550																								The rise of Hindutva in our country has brought to the fore issues of religious, social and cultural identity. It has led to a fresh evaluation of Indias heritage, its culture and religious thoughts. In the circumstances, Indians must learn to think about their past in the right perspective. This book looks at the importance of Buddhism, a religion swayed millions of our countrymen and countered the sophistry of the Brahmin class. 																								Before going into the basic teachings of Buddhism, Omvedt takes care to inform readers about the events that helped it to come up as a potent religious force. But the religion itself, its teachings and its effects on the social set-up are compressed in three chapters. The rest of the book deals with related matters like the defeat of Buddhism and challenges its followers faced. There are also chapters on the Bhakti movement, a religious revolt of low-caste men and women, and Navayana Buddhism. 																								The book encompasses around 2,500 years of Indian history. Omvedt begins with B.R. Ambedkars reinterpretation of Buddhism and shows how his unique interpretation of Buddhism, skirting both the Marxists and other reformers, might well be a powerful revolutionary tool. 																								The history of Hinduism too finds place in the discussion. Hinduism, according to Omvedt, was originally a geographical idea. During the British rule, the Nationalist elite fixed on the term, Hinduism, to identify their religion. As she describes it, ancient India was not Hindu, as is propagated, but largely Buddhist. Brahminism only revived in India from the 7th century onwards. 																								Omvedt is probably right in saying that the problem of Indian history is the lack of documentary evidence of society and its people. The life of the times is largely constructed from coins, inscriptions and archaeological excavations. 																								Omvedts chapter on the disappearance of Buddhism is worthwhile. This is a subject for further research, for though Buddhism is not very popular in the land of its birth, it has flourished in countries like Sri Lanka, Tibet and China. 																								Omvedt writes clearly and marshalls her arguments well. She is also clear about the objective of the book. She challenges Hindutva concepts of caste, religion and history. Her book will be of interest to all those who are genuinely interested in Indias heritage but do not get bogged down by narrow parochial interests. 						SHAMS AFIF SIDDIQI

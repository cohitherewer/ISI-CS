		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 							 																						NO ROSE REVOLUTION  The USs enlisting of Uzbekistan in the war on terror will neither curb human rights violations by the state nor bring economic progress, argues Barun De				 	 Lack of direction																														The Uzbek state had it coming. Since its independence on September 1, 1991, Islamic extremism  which came northwards across the Amu Darya with young Soviet and Muslim recruits of the army driven out of Afghanistan, demoralized by and resentful of Russian expansionism that had sent them to suffer in a fellow Muslim country  had been dormant in the Ferghana valley in the countrys east. It had also been dormant in the narrow river valleys running south from the Tajik border towards Termez, on the road from Tashkent and Samarkand to Mazar-i-Sharif. Repressed by the former communist government in the Nineties, the anger had burst out in raids led by leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the young ex-soldier, Juma Khojaev (who called himself Nomonghani), and the slightly older, bearded mullah from Nomonghan, Tohir Yuldashev. These guerrilla attacks, heralded on February 15, 1999, by five simul-taneous explosions in central Tashkent  the main one just missing President Islam Karimovs motorcade on his way to work  attracted world attention at the time of the rise of the taliban. 																														The Uzbek army stamped out their support in the poverty-stricken villages north of Tashkent, where the nations elite went in summer for mountain sports. September 11, and the subsequent Uzbek alliance with George W. Bush to supply a bombing base north of Termez to aid the Northern Alliance, seemed a short-term solution. But the fact that it was a solution has been belied. 																														At first reading, the recent violence in Tashkent appears specifically to avenge the harm done to Yuldashev, who is supposed to be lying seriously wounded in his refuge among the Waziri clans beyond Wana in southern North West Frontier Province in Pakistan (Khojaev is thought to have died in the winter of 2001). The objective behind the attacks is similar to that of the 1999-2000 raids in the mountain forests. Policemen, who are notorious bribe-takers and accustomed to brutality as arms of the Uzbek state power, have been targeted in popular resistance to secular authority, one of the strongest remnants of the old Soviet power. The latest news from Interfax is that at the time of the bomb attacks in Tashkent as well as in Bukhara, the Charvak reservoir for Tashkents water supply (around which are the decaying hill resorts and the villages serving them with their silent shuttered houses and veiled women) has again been singled out for bombing. Multiple police check points on the roads leading to the mountains had proliferated anyway at the turn of the century, when helicopter gunships were scouring the forest villages. Now one reads of the police cordoning off entire quarters of Tashkent where the explosions took place. Presumably, the same counter-insurgency is going on in areas where religious fundamentalist bodies exist and which call for a return to the moral Caliphate of ancient Islam and end to godlessness (the Hizb-ut Tahrir, is somewhat similar but not the same as Wahabism, in which Saudi Arabia believes), or rebel against the remnants of the IMU. 																														The new uprising in Uzbekistan is different. The raids at the end of the 20th century were the carry over of the fraternal ties among young Uzbek conscripts, traditionally distrustful of Russian racist supremacy and harbouring pristine sentiments of cultural liberation together with the Afghan mujahedin. Pakistans raising of the taliban, the tangled oil diplomacy; the collapse of new business around gold prospecting, car manufacture and gas exploitation in Uzbekistan (which has no oil reserves as Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan); Uzbekistans failure to gain a full convertibility regime and a hard currency system backed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; bureaucratic corruption and red-tapism that discourage multinationals from persisting with large investments  all these have combined with the natural indolence of a decrepit sub-imperial elite in the most fertile part of central Asia to create a lot of anger against a one-time communist and now pro-American establishment. This establishment has failed to bring development, socio-economic progress or even political transparency, let alone democracy, to alleviate the rigours of the market or make any significant gain from its connection with Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States of America. 																														There is now a tendency to react violently against the enforced poverty from which communism had once artificially shielded the lower classes by giving them mass primary education, public health, almost free domestic energy and water, and above all a sense of participation in progress. Friends in Tashkent report horror stories of people resorting to even murder to settle personal quarrels. These are all concomitants of the Eurasian return to capitalism. Earlier attacks had been against the police  Ferghana women came out to bemoan their missing sons and brothers. Now female suicide bombers reportedly blow themselves up, as in the recent instance in north Tashkent. Have the Chechen techniques, seen in the Moscow theatre, come south?																														The new context does not necessarily envisage the sort of facile solution that the Western world found in the Caucasus, where the unknown Mikhail Saakashvili was welcomed in a rose revolution and a veteran like Eduard Shevardnadze hustled into well-paid obscurity. Georgia had many points in common with Uzbekistan  both located on the southern periphery of the former Soviet Unions soft underbelly, both subordinate to Russian racist overrule, both at odds with the new Russian policy (against the Chechens and the Tajiks), both with separatist problems in their western regions, both plagued by lack of oil-financed surpluses and by corruption, both looking for ways to compete with their better-off north-eastern neighbours, Azerbaijan (in the case of Georgia) and Kazakhstan (to which some Tashkent elites hope to migrate for job opportunities and shopping malls).																														However, not all unrest, even if more widespread than in the past (the capital city and new gaswork centres of Bukhara have now been targeted along with Tashkent) leads to regime change. In Asia, one need look no further than Nepal to see that US military presence is just as good at keeping a repressive political regimes in power (when there is no alternative to it, which would be friendly or acceptable to the West) as it is in toppling regimes if a complaisant subordinate is found. Just enlisting Uzbekistan or Georgia or Nepal in a catch-all war on terror will neither provide a solution to human rights infringements by the state nor improve the prospects for economic development. Without gaining these two pre-requisites, terrorism or guerrilla warfare will not stop.

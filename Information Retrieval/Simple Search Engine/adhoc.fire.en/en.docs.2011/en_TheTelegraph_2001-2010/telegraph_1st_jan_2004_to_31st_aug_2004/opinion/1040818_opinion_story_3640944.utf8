The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Presumed guilty				 																																																				Sir  What exactly are the crimes for which Avatar Singh has been arrested (Athlete-turned-MPs husband in vice net, Aug 17)? That he was involved in the flesh trade? But do Singhs hiding in a room on the second floor of Merlin Park and the obscene pictures on the wall constitute adequate evidence of his involvement? The eight couples arrested could have been anything  even married. However, the police are probably right. But surely Merlin Park is not the only place where clients take prostitutes or where adulterous couples rendezvous? Such dens of vice abound in almost every locality in the city, and often with the knowledge and connivance of the police. The only reason Singhs arrest has made a splash is that he is Jyotirmoyee Sikdars husband. But why should it be presumed that the husband of an Asian Games gold medallist is a saint?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Roshni Basu, Calcutta
				 																Promises and lies				 																																																				Sir  The United Progressive Alliance government seems to have made up its mind to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act. There is no need for the law, it feels, since the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act of 1967 is enough to tackle terrorism (Right spirit, July 18). If that were so, then why did a later Congress government introduce the Maintenance of Internal Security Act in 1976? At that time, terrorism was unheard of. Was Misa then meant for all those who did not accept the ideology of the Congress? Also why was the Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act introduced? Pota is now being revoked merely to score a few points off the National Democratic Alliance. It will be interesting to see how this government combats terrorist activities in the North-east and Kashmir without any anti-terror law. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  Pota was enacted by the NDA government in line with United Nations resolutions, post 9/11. If it is scrapped, the country will have no law that defines a terrorist and tackles the funding of terrorism. It is apparent that the UPA government wants to score political points by repealing the act, as it had promised in its common minimum programme, instead of waiting for it to lapse on October 24, 2004. 				 																																																				If the present government felt that Pota had been more misused than used, necessary amendments could have been made to prevent further misuse after seeking the opinion of security agencies on the implications of the repeal and then debating it in parliament. 				 																																																				However, I suggest the UPA reserve the name, Pota, for its new law in order to protect those tainted leaders with whose support it came to power. In that case Pota would stand for protection of tainted allies.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
V. Krishnakumar, New Delhi 

				 																																																				Sir  Fulfilling promises can be addictive. After all, the UPA politicians have to fulfil promises made to their mentors, the criminals, who helped them win elections.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kr. Rahul, Gopalnagar

				 																																																				Sir  The governments decision to repeal the draconian and controversial Pota is welcome. It is well-known that those caught in the net are ordinary people, the minorities and opposition politicians against whom those in power have a grouse. Pota is used by vindictive authorities to suit their interests.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shadab Ahsan, Gaya

				 																																																				Sir  It is good to note that at last Pota will meet its end, hopefully never to return again, in the coming session of parliament. The repeal of the legislation has, in fact, been long delayed since it has been widely misused both in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. But better late than never. 				 																																																				It is good that the Tamil Nadu government has withdrawn all Pota charges against Vaiko. Especially since the special judges committee, appointed by the previous government to review cases booked under Pota, has concluded that there was no prima facie evidence that justified booking Vaiko under Pota. But who will give back to Vaiko the 16 months he spent Vellore Jail for no fault of his?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  It is inexplicable that the Congress-led government at the Centre, while willing to throw overboard the draconian Pota, is firm about retaining the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act which is equally, if not more, repressive. The former, at least, is subject to judicial overview while the latter is not. Is it because Pota is related to Kashmir, while the AFSPA is for the north-eastern states? 				 																																																				If things continue to be as they are, the day is not far off when Kashmir-like insurgencies will develop in relatively calm states like Manipur.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

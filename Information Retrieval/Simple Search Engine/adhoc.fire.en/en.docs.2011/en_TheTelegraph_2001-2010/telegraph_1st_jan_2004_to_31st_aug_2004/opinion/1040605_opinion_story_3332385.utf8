The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 							 																						FREEDOM WITHOUT SAFETYThe betterment of the status of women in West Bengal cannot be talked of without confronting the real dangers they face everydayThe chief minister of West Bengal was right on both counts. At the one-day NGO meet on womens empowerment in West Bengal, attended by Ms Purnima Advani, the chairperson of the National Commission for Women, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said that womens empowerment should be one of the priority areas for a modern society. And he added that his state was one of the first in the country to reserve 33 per cent seats for women in panchayats. Neither statement need be disputed, but it might be asked what exactly was being done to see that the priority was being maintained. Encouraging statistics can be reeled off, they often are. There are 1,077 women among a total of 2,813 councillors. Among the more than 19,000 people working in the computer companies in Salt Lake alone, 50 per cent are women. There are thousands of self-help groups in the rural areas, working towards the economic empowerment of women. It sounds good. Also, it is not the whole picture. 																														Ms Advani, although sufficiently congratulatory, did mention that it is best not to depend on statistics, since they tend to give a partial picture. Perhaps West Bengal could look more closely into the conditions of womens safety. Maybe she had not forgotten her experience of speaking to women daily passengers in Sealdah station that morning, where each speaker had a tale of sexual harassment or molestation to report. The common theme in their tales was police indifference. The chairperson was also aware of the fact that numerous incidents of sexual violence perpetrated upon women from the underprivileged classes were not recorded at all. The chief minister, however right he is in the statements he makes, is careful in never making certain other statements. For example, the fact that the indifference, non-cooperation, disrespect and negligence of the police, whenever a sexual crime against a woman is concerned, is one of the inescapable everyday realities of West Bengal.																														The chief minister said that the way to stop atrocities on women is to help them become independent. Right again. But it is necessary to examine exactly how this equation between security and independence works in the state. One example out of thousands would be quite sufficient. A woman returning home to Calcutta from her office near Barasat was beaten up, tortured and molested by a gang of drunken young men at Hridaypur station while waiting for a train. The charge against her was that she was travelling in public with her boyfriend. The man assaulted and pushed into a train on this latter charge was the colleague accompanying her. The complaint was registered this time, after the damage, and arrests made. But the girl left her job. The betterment of the status of women, rural and urban, cannot be talked of without seriously confronting the real dangers that they face everyday. There is nothing of the modern state in that. It is promising that the meeting in which the chief minister spoke welcomed the participation of non-governmental organizations that work with women. That may work as a reality check if nothing else does.

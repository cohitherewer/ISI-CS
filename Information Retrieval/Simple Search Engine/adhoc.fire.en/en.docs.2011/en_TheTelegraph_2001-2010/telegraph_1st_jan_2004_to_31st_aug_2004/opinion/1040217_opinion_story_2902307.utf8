The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 							 																						PARTY GAME																														One of the things politicians across the board believe in is that promises are made to be broken. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) knows how to break promises with true lan. Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India took over the streets of Calcutta in their hundreds on Sunday, with never a care for the poor souls trying to reach their destinations for humbler causes than that of the party. The DYFI flouted one-way restrictions and completely overturned the promise the government had made to the judiciary, that a part of the road would be left open for normal passage during processions. Behind this reckless defiance, not only of the civic proprieties  for which the party cadre has ever shown scant regard  but also of accountability to the court, lay the implicit support of the CPI(M) leaders, of the chairman of the Left Front, Mr Biman Bose, and of the chief minister himself. Mr Bose reportedly held his wonted fire, and spoke briefly at the rally. This was just three days after his defence of his own statements made against the ruling of the judge, Mr Amitava Lala, against rallies. That defence, cleverly worded and avoiding the real issues, was unbecoming of the senior leader. But the double-speak enshrined in it had had the desired effect, the DYFI knew exactly what to do.																														The chief ministers role is more ambiguous. His efforts to invite investment to the state seem in direct contradiction to the indiscipline in city life that he is obviously doing nothing to prevent. In the rally, he urged his followers to let every poor household know that the government was not about to impose a tax on cattle, domestic animals and rural transport in spite of the Trinamool Congresss propaganda to the contrary. Surely this message did not necessitate such a flagrant breaking of all promises  unless the primary concern was just a show of strength. The opposition was given the strength of numbers to reckon with, while the helpless populace had to be reminded that the party is a law unto itself. Such an attitude, encouraged by the leaders, some of whom also head the government, tacitly nurtures violence. It is no coincidence that numerous offenders in all parts of the state are found to be associated with the CPI(M), and like the hundreds of offenders against judicial strictures who clogged the streets on Sunday, most of them go scot-free. That Mr Bose did not go overboard during this last rally means nothing. He has had his say, and the chief minister has made his promises. The real message is scripted within this clever double-speak. And there are hundreds of ears willing to receive it.

		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 							 																						NO CONFIDENCE MOTION Joseph Stiglitzs criticism of globalization carries a lot of weight, but it will be a while before it inspires a revision of IMF-World Bank policy, writes Alok Ray 				 	 Voice of dissent																														Joseph Stiglitz is a discontented man. But why should the rest of the world bother? Stiglitz is a mainstream economist who won the Nobel prize. He was also the chief economist and a senior vice-president of the World Bank. Earlier, he was chief economic advisor to the Clinton administration. So when he criticizes the management of globalization by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and the World Trade Organization, people must take it seriously. It cannot be dismissed as the views of an extremist utopian.																														Since Stiglitz is the star spokesman at anti-globalization rallies, his views are often oversimplified in the media. One book where he cogently presents his case, in addition to numerous articles, is Globalization and its Discontents.																														Stiglitz believes that globalization can potentially bring enormous benefits to people everywhere, including the worlds poor. Export-led growth has enriched much of Asia and a lot of people are enjoying a better standard of living. New foreign firms have introduced new technologies, provided access to new markets and introduced new products including life-saving drugs. Global connectedness has spread new ideas, forced improvement in working conditions throughout the world and has even helped foster the anti-globalization movement on a global scale. Stiglitz is a strong believer in the importance of markets and incentives. But he also emphasizes the importance of institutions and governance. Without these, markets cannot function efficiently. This is a stand generally taken by all serious development economists. What is novel is that this criticism of the working of international institutions comes from within the establishment.																														According to Stiglitz, the IMF, World Bank and WTO are forcing their brand of globalization on developing and transitional economies, irrespective of the specific needs of those countries. He believes that the agenda of these institutions is dictated by the government of the United States of America in the interests of Wall Street financiers. He is against this one size fits all approach. Besides, there is a huge imbalance of power between these institutions and client states. So, while negotiating, representatives of client governments often keep silent out of fear that they may incur the wrath of the IMF, which would then not only cut off international assistance but also, indirectly, their access to global capital markets. In Stiglitzs opinion, globalization  as pushed by these institutions  has not brought the promised benefits to a lot of countries, especially to the poor.																														His sharpest criticism is reserved for the IMF. Some of Stiglitzs critics detect a bias here. They feel that he largely spares the World Bank because he was a senior policy advisor there  though both the fund and the bank are involved in furthering the agenda of the so-called Washington Consensus.																														In simple terms, the Washington Consensus suggests that when a country is having serious economic difficulties, it should cut fiscal deficit, reduce subsidies, privatize state-owned enterprises, remove restrictions on international trade and capital movements. The term was first used by the economist, John Williamson, in 1989 to describe a minimal policy package for Latin America that would be acceptable to Washington. He did not explicitly incorporate a better income distribution objective as it might not be palatable to either Washington or to vested interests in Latin America. Thus the cuts fell on food subsidies rather than on subsidies for the rich. 																														This package became part of the orthodoxy, recommended for almost any country applying for IMF assistance, irrespective of the basic cause of its economic crisis. Income-distribution considerations may have found mention in IMF documents but it was never given any importance.																														Latin Americas problem was, in the main, excessive and wasteful government expenditure and the consequent inflationary pressures. Even if the Washington Consensus policy package was somewhat appropriate for Latin America, the same medicine was prescribed to tackle the east Asian financial crisis in 1997. According to Stiglitz and other analysts, the problem in east Asia was not one of high fiscal deficits, subsidies or excess demand. These were all high-saving economies, often with fiscal surplus and no balance-of-payment worries. Their principle problem was premature capital account-convertibility, coupled with exchange-rate rigidity and absence of prudential regulation in the financial sector. Cheap short-term dollar funds were borrowed massively to finance investment in real estates and secondary stock markets, fuelling a bubble. When it became evident that the bubble would burst, investors (both domestic and foreign) resorted to capital flight before the domestic currency depreciated. Financial companies went bust one after another. Massive capital outflow led to large exchange-rate depreciation, causing the effect to spread to many other sectors and countries. 																														The IMF responded by raising interest rates and fiscal discipline, which led to even higher cost and lower availability of funds for beleaguered banks and business firms facing a liquidity crisis. It did not allow exchange control to stop the capital flight, loss of foreign exchange reserves and currency depreciation. In the process, it made things worse. Malaysia was one country which imposed temporary exchange control, without paying heed to IMF advice. It stemmed the crisis better than others.																														The IMFs defence is that no one could predict that a crisis was coming in east Asia. It was a totally new situation and in the absence of a precedent, it followed its standard recipe. It may have been a mistake but it was not a Western conspiracy. 																														Stiglitzs point would be that even if there was no full-scale conspiracy, possibly the IMF found it convenient to follow the standard prescription as it coincided with the interests of international bankers and shareholders. They would like to get their funds out of a country in crisis as fast as possible. They would also like the IMF to ensure that governments do not go for default or impose exchange control. The IMF and US treasury also took this opportunity to bend policies in client states in difficulty (like South Korea) to suit the interests of US business and finance.																														Stiglitz also strongly criticizes the IMF policy on reforming transitional economies like Russia. The IMF went for privatization and markets almost overnight (big bang) without realizing the importance of putting in place appropriate institutions for the markets to work. In their absence, privatization degenerated into selling off shares at throw-away prices to vested interests and control of the economy by mafia-like organizations. Again, the trouble was that IMF policy-makers were too confident. They tried out shock therapy on millions of human guinea pigs with disastrous results.																														As for solutions, Stiglitz advocates democratization and transparency in policy-making at the IMF and World Bank. Instead of voting rights being proportional to economic power and contributions as at present, he recommends moving towards a more equitable one-nation-one-vote system. It does not seem achievable in the near future. Perhaps, a greater degree of transparency and a wider debate are more likely to happen, as Stiglitzs voice has been joined by other influential academicians. 																														Stiglitz also proposes a plan whereby any new global money creation by the IMF would be used to create global public goods and for projects specifically aimed at the poor. Some others have suggested that in future the policies and projects supported by the IMF and World Bank in a country should be judged by how these have benefited the poorest (say the poorest 20 per cent) of the population. It remains to be seen how long it takes for such ideas to move from the pages of academic research papers into the revised Washington Consensus.

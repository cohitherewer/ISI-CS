		 Friday, February 13, 2004 							 																						BOOKSHOP BLUES				 	 Space jam																														Intellectuals, often seized by the romantic notion of working in a bookshop, should read George Orwells sparkling little essay of 1936, Bookshop Memories. After describing working in the midst of a frightful torrent of trash  that give off more and nastier dust than any other class of object yet invented, Orwell writes that the net effect was to lose the love for books because of the constant dusting and hauling them to and fro. Besides, like any other commodity five to ten thousand at a time, books were boring and even slightly sickening. 																														Hence the whole notion of a bookshop as a readers paradise  where you could put your feet up, pick and choose what interests you  is false. Bookshops are there to do business and turn in profits. Nothing more, nothing less. Bookshops today quite often double up as newsagents and stationery stores. Two factors have made the bookshop messier. First, the lack of physical space to accommodate the volume of books, new and old, that need to be stocked to meet the diverse demands of the market. Second, the economics of retailing that leave smaller and smaller margins to the bookseller, largely because of increased warehousing costs. This has meant that booksellers have to go for high-discount books, which means (in most cases) remaindered stocks that no longer sell in large numbers, or at least are not a great business proposition.																														Take the numbers game first. With continuous expansion over the years of the old publishers and the birth of many new players, over 50,000 new titles in English alone are published every year, apart from reprints. Against this, bookshop space has not expanded, or at least not proportionately. 																														It is said that a bookseller lives on his windows, that is, the face upwards displays. When this is unavailable, good books get buried under the bad. The net effect is poor retail sales, which affects the cash flow, and finally the overall profit. The Indian book trade has always been strapped for cash because over 80 per cent of all sales are to institutional libraries which hold up payments for 60 days or more. The only solution is retail sales to individual customers. But the pressure of numbers is making this increasingly difficult.																														Sales and profits are the only criteria for success now, but this is becoming difficult for two reasons. First, publishers have not increased their discounts to retailers or their credit terms. Varying discount schemes have been introduced, but this is strictly tied down to payments made within the stipulated credit terms. For bookshops, heavily dependent on institutional purchases, strict adherence to credit terms is almost impossible. Sooner or later, they have to give in.																														How then do bookshops survive? First, they have to be family businesses, preferably not saddled with rent and other overhead costs. Second, they have to mix the new, low-discount books with the old (or remaindered) high-discounted stocks and hope that this way, they have something left in the till at the end of day. But it still remains survival by the skin of the teeth. 						RAVI VYAS

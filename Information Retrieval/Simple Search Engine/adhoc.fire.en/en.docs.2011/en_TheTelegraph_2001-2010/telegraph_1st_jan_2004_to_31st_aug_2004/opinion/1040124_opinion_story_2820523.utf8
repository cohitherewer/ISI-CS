																													LOVES
																													LULA
 As a child, he was a shoeshine boy. Now, he baits Americans as a pastime. Brazilian President 
Luis Incio Lula da Silva, the chief guest for the 
Republic Day Parade, is a leader who packs a punch 
																														A mortal once went crawling up a mountain in search of an ascetic who had the answers to all questions. What is the secret of life? he asked the sage. Its nothing but right timing, the guru replied. 
																														A dramatist understands the significance of a cue, a speculator knows when to buy and sell, astrologers have their own take on time and a politician recognises the strength of being at the right place at the right time. So, when the president of Brazil claps his hands  as any rubber-boned, Samba-honed South American naturally would  in time with the folk dancers of India on Rajpath on Monday, there is bound to be a bit of squirming in some uncomfortable political quarters.
																														Everybody, of course, loves Lula. Just as they loved Pele before him, and several other Brazilians with four letters to their name  Zico, Didi and Kaka, to name just a few. But really, did Luis Incio Lula da Silva have to irk the Americans just days before his visit to India? This, the 58-year-old Leftist President must know, is bad timing. At a time when the Americans are seeking honorary membership of the Indian Cabinet  theyd like to tell us what to do with our soldiers and farmers  did the Brazilians, Indias new-found friends, have to rub the Americans up the wrong way?
																														Actually, to be fair to Lula, it wasnt really he who provoked the Americans. Brazil is among the 27 countries whose nationals will have to be fingerprinted and photographed if they desire to visit the United States. Brazil, where emotions run as high as inflation, found that offensive, and a Brazilian federal judge promptly ruled that all Americans visiting Brazil would be singled out and fingerprinted at airports. The Americans had a sophisticated profiling system that took less than a few minutes. In Brazil, visitors from America were sometimes made to wait for nine hours before they were welcomed in with old-fashioned ink and rubber-stamps. 
																														Not surprisingly, relations between Brazil and the United States are not all amigo-aw-my-gawd. A Brazilian newspaper poll showed that 98 per cent supported the ruling  the reason, no doubt, why Lula and his cabinet felt the need to continue the finger-printing exercise for a month before taking a final decision.
																														But Lulas Indian hosts are not greatly perturbed about his run-in with the Americans. The foreign office shrugs off suggestions that the Indian political leadership may find it embarrassing to sit next to a gentleman who has been thumbing his nose at the Americans. We have a relationship with Brazil that has little to do with the United States, says an official. And even the Americans will know that the Brazilian President had been invited to India well before the finger-printing controversy.
																														For long years, there was not much that an average newspaper reader in India knew about the South American country. They played football wearing green and yellow and held carnivals wearing feathers. And when they were not doing either, they organised international meetings against globalisation. 
																														It was the Brazilians fondness for such meetings that led to the January visit of President Lula  a shoeshine boy who became a factory worker, formed and led a workers party and last year became the first Leftist President of Brazil in 40 years. Lula had apparently wanted to join the Mumbai World Social Forum  an anti-globalisation platform that had its first meeting in Brazil four years ago. The Indian government, no doubt shuddering at the thought of Lula encountering Arundhati Roy, instead urged him to be the chief guest for its Republic Day Parade.
																														Lula and Atal  sorry, there are no surnames in this bonhomous relationship  have been shaking the hand of friendship ever since they met in Lausanne, Switzerland, last summer. To check cross-border infiltration, India wants an air-surveillance system that Brazil uses to monitor environmental threats to its rainforests. India is already getting some of its oil from Brazil and has placed a $600 million order for executive jets. Last year, along with South Africa, the two nations formed a tri-continental rainbow coalition called the India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum. The forum hopes to take on the rich nations in such fractious fora as the World Trade Organisation.
																														So, finger-printing or no finger-printing, India needs Lula. To toast a budding friendship of the kind, the French would have kissed the tips of their fingers and said, Ooh la la. In India, they are manfully shrugging their shoulders and saying: Lulala.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 							 																						PART OF POLL																														It is bizarre that political parties should consider the Indian voter to be fickle and unstable. Earlier this month, almost all political parties had agreed that opinion and exit polls should not be announced in the media till the entire election process has been completed. The assumption is that voters get influenced by these polls and thus change their preferences at the last minute. This suggests that the political parties think that Indian voters are prone to be buffeted around by external influences and have no real fixity of choice. This, to say the least, has no basis in the reality of the voting figures. Indian voters, over a period of time, have been remarkably firm in indicating their political preferences. The great examples are the overwhelming support and the overwhelming rejection of Indira Gandhi in 1971 and 1977 respectively. Even in the late Nineties, when the era of coalition governments began, voting preferences had remained fairly stable. It is possible to show statistically that certain groups in society, most of the time, vote in particular ways. The emergence of the caste parties in north India is indicative of this. This is not to suggest that this kind of bloc voting along caste and communal lines is good for democracy but only to demonstrate that Indian voters are not influenced by external influences like what they read/hear in the media about electoral choices in other areas.																														The fact that opinion polls and exit polls are sometimes wrong is neither here nor there. An opinion or exit poll might be wrong because it has been incompetently carried out or wrong conclusions drawn from the sample collected. Such failures are no reason for throwing out the science of psephology. The study of voting preferences from voters samples is a fairly sophisticated exercise which, if carried out with the necessary precautions, provides trends of voting patterns within certain margins of error. It is simplistic to see opinion/exit polls as infallible tools. The Supreme Court is entirely justified in not imposing a ban on such polls for the rest of the present elections. The apex court decided not to be over hasty and thus did not impose a stay. The court thus has time now to look into the entire issue in some depth and to hear various viewpoints. There are no grounds for treating opinion and exit polls as the voice of god or for consigning them to the devil. They should be treated as a part of elections and their attendant paraphernalia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 12, 2004 							 																						SCREEN SAVER																														The immense popularity that cricket enjoys in India has produced a grotesque kind of double standard. The government of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee is committed to liberalization. It believes that, in principle, the state should not interfere in business and the operations of the market. But this principle is often diluted by large doses of populism. The television coverage of the forthcoming cricket series between India and Pakistan is an example. As things stand, the rights to telecast the matches live have been bought in open auction by Ten Sports, a Dubai-based channel. Doordarshan tried to procure the rights but failed in the bidding. In other words, Doordarshan lost out in the play of market forces. But now the information and broadcasting ministry has woken up to the fact that millions of viewers, who have no access to cable television, will be unable to see the one day internationals and the test matches between India and Pakistan. There is also the fear that because of the bickerings between Ten Sports and cable operators, the latter might black out the matches. The government is now under the shadow of antagonizing people by making them miss out on what is arguably the most important cricketing encounter of this year.																														The governments mode of getting rid of this threat is to exercise its muscle and influence, and secure the telecast rights for Doordarshan. According to reports, the minister for information and broadcasting, Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad, met the prime minister and apparently requested him to speak to his counterpart in Pakistan to intercede on Doordarshans behalf. There are two different but interrelated arguments here. One is a kind of vulgar patriotism which says that since India is playing, Doordarshan should automatically have the telecasting rights. The other implicitly links the Pakistan tour to the elections, and therefore the government does not want to deprive the public from viewing what has been billed as a historic series. Both the arguments run counter to the logic of the free market. Doordarshan should be allowed to function as a stand-alone business enterprise in competition with other television channels. Patriotism or any other ism should not be allowed to come into this at all. Neither should elections nor the popularity of the government. Ten Sports paid money to secure the rights for itself and it should be allowed without let or hindrance to enjoy the fruits of those rights. Anything other than that would be downright unfair and against business interests. In a liberalized economic regime no government should short circuit the market process.

		 Friday, January 16, 2004 							 																						WHERE EVERY DROP COUNTS Sarthak Chowdhury																								Even today, the Indian government has not been able to ensure adequate water for all citizens. Thus the preservation of water sources is very important in a developing country like India. Agriculture being a dominant activity in India, proper management of water resources is also an important part of social transformation. 																								Indias water resources are vast and varied. But they are sadly inadequate in view of the needs of the countrys growing population, climatic conditions and development needs. With the advent of high-yielding varieties of wheat, paddy and other crops, which need timely and assured irrigation, use of ground water in agriculture has increased tremendously. According to official projections, Indias water requirements for irrigation will grow by more than 50 per cent in the next 50 years. Domestic and industrial demand would rise even faster.																								India is criss-crossed by as many as 115 rivers and thousands of their tributaries. However, the restricted flow of these rivers in the summer and winter months; soil-erosion which leads to heavy siltation, which in turn causes floods in the monsoon; and the unchecked flow of untreated municipal sewage and industrial effluents have caused many worries. One of these is solid wastes, fertilizers and pesticides running off crops and being deposited in lakes, dams and other water bodies, and flowing thence into the sea and ocean.																								In order to prevent the haphazard exploitation of our precious water resources and to encourage its optimum utilization, we need a new water vision urgently.  Water vision																								Ecology, not technology, must be the foundation of such a vision. Safe drinking water for humans and animals should get top-priority, followed by agriculture needs. Next in order are hydro-power generation and navigation along river channels and canals, depending on availability and seasonal fluctuations. 																								The vision should focus on the restoration and maintenance of natural habitats. It should emphasize a more equitable distribution of water, by servicing the needs of far-flung areas at low cost, and a careful and coordinated management of river basins. 																								Annual precipitation in our country is estimated at about 3,700,000 million cubic metres, of which a little less than a half is available on the surface. But only 39.17 per cent of this is utilized for irrigation purposes. 																								Thus, rainwater harvesting, which can greatly help conserve scarce water resources, should be an important component of the new water vision. A combination of groundwater recharging and community-based, small-scale rainwater harvesting can sate more than drinking water needs even in the worst droughts. 																								In recent years, the quality of water  its physical, chemical or biological composition  has come to be quite as important and necessary as quantity.  Optimal use																								Also the judicious use of water in irrigation is very important. The existence of supply-driven irrigation models are responsible for extensive water-logging and salinity. An irrigation project is generally appraised in terms of production, and not its net carrying capacity for households with adequate and secure livelihood. This imbalance should be addressed in the new water vision. With the use of large-scale lift technology, the livelihood of poor farmers can be increased by organizing them into water-sharing groups. 																								The utilization of water needs to be optimized first. This can be done by encouraging conservation of water through education, legislation, incentives, effective and timely monitoring, better management and undertaking a survey of available resources. Research into technology-policy interactions in the water market, pricing, quality assurance and dependability need to be also undertaken. On the face of it, this may seem tough to implement, but the failure to do this will have disastrous consequences.

		 Sunday, February 01, 2004 							 																						ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE H5N1 STRAIN				 	 PECK AT IT: Cook all poultry-based edibles thoroughly, till they are no longer pink. The virus is destroyed by heat THE DEADLY VIRUS It is just one among 15 types  of avian influenza, or bird flu, viruses. Some scientists  believe that ducks in mainland China may be reservoirs  of H5N1. The first human outbreak caused by the H5N1 virus  occurred in Hong Kong in 1997. Until then it was believed  that birds gave the virus to pigs and pigs gave it to humans.  The 1997 outbreak showed that birds can give influenza directly  to people.																					SOURCES OF HUMAN INFECTION The only way humans can contract  the H5N1 virus is through close contact with infected poultry.  Birds that have survived the infection continue to secrete  massive quantities of the virus in their faeces. People  who touch birds or inadvertently come into contact with  or ingest tiny and invisible faecal particles are at risk.  The H5N1 cannot be transmitted from person to person.																					DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMAN FLU AND AVIAN FLU Countless people around the world  may be infected with the predominant human influenza virus  named H3N2. It causes a mild flu, which can, in some cases,  become life-threatening. The illness caused by H5N1 in humans  is far more severe and early data suggests that mortality  may be as high as 60 per cent. So far, eight out of 10 people  infected with H5N1 in the current outbreak have died.																					DRUGS AGAINST H5N1 Antibiotics do not work against  viruses. The traditional, relatively inexpensive, anti-viral  drugs are amantidine and rimantidine. But early results  indicate that the H5N1 virus in this outbreak does not respond  to these drugs. However, another anti-viral drug called  oseltamivir is believed to work against this strain of H5N1,  but this drug is expensive and not available in many countries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 06, 2004 							 																						SIGNS OF LIFE																														Is Calcutta growing up at last, and learning to think and stir for itself? The latest bandh in Bengal seems to have met with a degree of indifference in Calcutta and the suburbs that might indicate a maturing of the citys democratic and professional spirit. The high court has given up trying to do anything about bandhs in West Bengal  We are helpless; we are mere spectators  but large sections of the ordinary, working people and their employers have made a special effort to not let the bandh disrupt their normal lives. Once the judiciary throws up its hands in despair, and the administration continues to be as politicized as it has always been, then there are only two ways of actively opposing the bandh culture. First, the Mumbai method. Citizens and NGOs can get together, file a public interest litigation and get the court to fine the offending political parties for public inconvenience and loss. The Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party had to pay a fine  Rs 40 lakh  which will become a fund for spending on public utility services.																														But Calcutta has also retaliated this time in its own way. The corporation, ports, the information technology sector, the railways, airports, many private companies and retailers have ensured augmented attendance on August 2, compared to the bandhs in February. This is largely because this time, the state-run public transport system has been on the road to a much greater extent in the city and suburbs. This, together with the autorickshaws, has helped people to go to work. Of course, behind this is the fact that the bandh was called by the opposition party. So it was not disinterested professionalism and public concern which made the state ensure that its buses ran, and the police were specially on alert. If this had been a Left Front bandh, then the picture would perhaps have been significantly different  as indeed it was on February 24. Citu, which had called that bandh, had refused to include the IT sector under the rubric of essential and emergency services not to be affected by the bandh. But most IT companies, like newspapers, organize their own transport these days to ensure attendance. The disruptive populism of politics can thus be countered by another kind of peoples initiative  active citizenship  the beginnings of which may be glimpsed now in Bengal. This is perhaps the only good thing to have come out of the bandhs.

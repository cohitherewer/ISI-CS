The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 26, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																For a neat profit				 																																																				Sir  If you believe you have caught the Bharatiya Janata Party in the act of eating its words, you are wrong (Plane for Advani, Feb 20). Yes, the party has stopped insisting that the deputy prime minister be allowed to use an Indian air force plane. It may even have admitted how radically it has changed its position from an earlier stance of questioning the very privilege to a Congress prime minister. But you cannot expect to have the saffronites turn a darker hue because it has gone against its principles. The BJP, in its present incarnation, is one of the truly bania parties India has ever had. Which is why it does not cringe at the use of wealth, mostly public but also private at times, if it can bring expected returns. See how unapologetic the party is about the money spent on the India Shining advertisements, or witness the fact that most private aircraft in the market have already been hired by the party for campaigning. Means obviously justify the end.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterji, Calcutta
				 																Power play				 																																																				Sir  The report, Sex abuse charge against public sector boss (Feb 14), made for strange reading. The charges pressed against Nalcos chairman cum managing director, C. Venkataramana, by one of the companys female employees was that of molestation. The charge entails arrest. Incidentally, it was the regional manager of the company who was arrested, although he was not alleged to have done the molestation. He apparently knew about the said crime. The victims description of events nowhere mentioned actual physical abuse or contact in any form. Accordingly, later reports have been referring to the case as one of sexual harassment. But that charge does not call for arrest. It can lead to penal action mostly in the form of fines or restitution of employees rights in case it is established that refusal to sexually oblige a superior has resulted in professional victimization. In fact the basic premises of sexual harassment are contingent upon this issue. For sexual harassment is not about sex, it is about abuse of power. A sexual advance per se does not constitute harassment. It has to be continuous, unwelcome and leading to professional victimization. In this case none of the factors apply. 				 																																																				Finally, it was interesting to read the ladys crusading comments on corporate ethics in Nalco lady steels battle resolve (Feb 20). A junior executive, who visits the head of the company at his hotel at night to talk about some urgent business, comes back and invokes corporate ethics, bolstered with her daughters poems on fighting for womans rights.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sandeep Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The charge against the Nalco chief is disturbing. The response of the officers association even more so. When charges of sexual misdemeanour were levelled against the American president, Bill Clinton, there were similar efforts to dismiss them as fabricated. Allegations brought by women against top male officials are automatically brushed away. This has to stop. It is appalling that top bosses feel they have every right to proposition any woman and get away with it.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Close on the heels of the sexual harassment episode involving Phaneesh Murthy, former director of Infosys some months ago, comes the Nalco controversy. But how can it be established that the Nalco chief actually misbehaved with the woman? It has become customary for women at workplaces to raise a hue and cry on the slightest pretext. Women have begun to take advantage of the laws which are weighed heavily in their favour. How many women have been proceeded against for misdemeanour? While sexual harassment of women is condemnable in the strongest possible terms and the most stringent punishment should be meted out to offenders, innocent male employees should be spared the trauma of being accused in such cases. The law-enforcement agencies should weigh all options, including subjecting the female victim to strict scrutiny and questioning, before framing charges. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Ram, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is unfortunate that Nalco is under the spotlight once again, especially now when the company is all set to start its second expansion successfully. In fact, it was due to the prudent and planned financial strategy of its chairman and managing director, C. Venkataramana, who was also the former director of finance of the company, that the giant public sector company was able to repay its loan fully to foreign creditors. It has also successfully carried out its first expansion, utilizing its own resources. The last three quarters financial results indicate that the company may end the year with a stupendous performance. However, as during the previous disinvestment meddle from which Nalco emerged successfully, this time also it is expected that the company will emerge victorious and put this pride of Orissa back on its track.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Lakshmi Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  The logic of the Nalco officers association that the victim in the sexual harassment case is tarnishing the image of the company when it is in a critical stage of expansion is childish. Why will the lady do such a thing, especially when she herself has been associated with the company for the last 15 years and continues to be working for it?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

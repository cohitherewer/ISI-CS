		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 							 																						THEY GO STRICTLY BY THE RULES N.J. Nanporia asks if Manmohan Singh will be able to reform a bureaucracy weighed down by its inheritance and lack of pragmatism				 	 Book-keeping																														I f one looks back into the past, one may be able to think up a long list of former parliamentarians, politicians and experts who have had their say in administrative reform. It is one of those things to which lip service is readily paid, given the added bonus of routine payment and a satisfying sense of a duty fulfilled. I.K. Gujral, former prime minister, was among the few who struck a note of discord when he declared: I dont have a magic wand that can get rid of all the bureaucrats. This is reality and we have to face it. Now we have the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, boldly entering the war against babudom, yet without a magic wand.																														Two reform units have been set up, one to examine the grievances of senior officials, and the other to consider how they are to be removed. Underlying these and other related reports is the facile assumption that the babus are a demoralized lot and they alone, not anyone else, are victims of a system that needs readjustment or fundamental change. Yet, surely, babudom is itself the system, and if it is believed that they are victims of a system they have created and continue to uphold, it is a tribute to their skills of projecting myth as reality.																														Consider, for example, the information bill. There was nothing in it to which the babus objected. It was put together in detailed consultations with the bureaucrats themselves. But there was considerable dragging of feet when a proposed amendment made babus accountable. Two things emerge from this. First, no reform worth the name is possible without the cooperation of the babus, who are the subject of the reform. Second, babudom is never so alert as when its interests, including its survival, are threatened. In the present context, there seems to be a near-decisive will to leave things alone, to go on tinkering around.																														Attention has been deflected to such riveting details as the 267 points on which Planning Commission files must obtain clearance before they are finally sanctified. On the other hand, a methodology has been introduced in the prime ministers office by which the wanderings of a file can be tracked. But if the number of clearance points is cut down, tracking will cease to be a problem. Senior bureaucrats have proposed brain-storming sessions in the PMO to replace the old arrangement of addressing complaints separately to the cabinet secretariat or the department of personnel. Nowhere in this hapless tinkering is any reference made to complaints or grievances other than those of the babus themselves. This is not to say that babus have no cause for discontent. But it is a discontent against the system that has been shaped by the babus and in which they have consolidated themselves in a position that is impregnable.																														Among these minor grievances or problems, magnified by the publicity given to them, not the least by the babus themselves, are transfers, the politician-babu nexus and appointments. All of these can be set right or partially remedied only at the cost of improving a system that has already been proved unsatisfactory. 																														Transfers first began as a trickle to which the establishment could turn a blind eye. Soon its volume ballooned till it acquired the status of a convention. It enabled governments new to office to organize massive displacements of officials, it allowed ministers to appoint babus of their choice and penalize others, and provided an opportunity to powerful outside influences to interfere in appointments and transfers in blatant violation of the rules. 																														No surprise that the babus resented this and have ever since agitated against the transfer policy, though in practice they have taken the easy way out by cultivating their political bosses. The theory that the role of independent civil servants is to provide ministers with expert and objective advice and opinion has remained just that  a theory that was inherited from the Indian civil service of yesteryear, oblivious of the fact that the ICSs primary responsibility was to serve the imperial interest. The last can now be read as national interest, but today it means nothing more than the ministers interest.																														Who can deny that in this climate the majority of babus have fallen back on the mutual back-scratching that now governs the babu-politician nexus. One cannot be certain who is more responsible for this unhealthy relationship  the babus or the politicians. But both have combined to preserve this nexus and it is this that is the source of Gujrals ire. 																														Does the citizen have a voice in all this? His encounters with the babus at all levels of the administration have become a legend so much so that the routine is now accepted without protest. Ironically, this is exactly what the steel frame of the ICS was designed to promote  to keep the citizen at a distance and deny him accessibility.																														That was the imperial idea. And an approximation of it is what the babus have inherited and have tried, much too successfully, to protect. The steel frame, once conceived as a device for holding the country together, became a way to distance the civil servant from the people. This was reinforced by a lack of accountability except within the brotherhood conditioned to protect its own interests, predictable salary increases and fixed tenures. Indira Gandhis idea of a committed bureaucracy was not an offshoot of these conditions but a bid, however misconceived, to reject them. 																														So what is the flaw that has to be addressed? The average Indian babu is as efficient, intelligent and dedicated as his counterpart in similar service anywhere in the world. But the scope for these qualities has been steadily reduced by the babu-politician nexus and the babus inherited attitude. Attitude cannot be changed by rules or structural adjustments or by fiat, particularly when both the babus and the politicians have a stake in maintaining the status quo. 																														A successful engineering firm that dated back to the pre-independence era and had become an institution once approached a journalist to write its history. The offer was accepted. In due course, the journalist was informed by the firms manager, rather apologetically, that someone from Delhi would arrive to vet the proposal. The panjandrum eventually arrived, polite, suave, self-assured  a quintessential member of babudom.																														In every detail of his manner it was communicated to the journalist that the latter was a supplicant who was merely seeking clearance for his project from the great man from Delhi. The infuriated journalist eventually walked out of the meeting.																														The rules no doubt required the official to go through the motions of examining the project, yet it was his attitude that had proved to be the spoiler  an attitude which regarded every proposal as suspicious, as something which someone wanted to push and it was the babus prerogative to prevent and deny. 																														In the administrative-cum-political jungle that is Delhi, with everyone watching everyone else in the hope of catching the other take the wrong step, it is infinitely safer to say no rather than yes. The offshoot of this is that a problem is either ignored or is kept pending or made the subject of an inquiry. The alternative of getting round the problem by subordinating the rules to the priorities of the proposal is routinely evaded. The pragmatism that makes this turnaround possible is unknown in babudom. 																														In an interview, not long before his death, Jawaharlal Nehru confessed that his failure to reform the civil servants was among his greatest regrets. That he even attempted anything of this sort will surprise many. Has Manmohan Singh then taken on a mission impossible? It would seem so though it is more than likely that he has scaled down his original ambition of reform to the more modest goal of making the best of babudom as it is.																														As foreign investments poured into China, doubts began to be aired about the limitations of the Chinese judicial system. Pragmatism was called into play and the judiciary was bypassed in favour of an efficient system of arbitration that suited the needs of modernity and of promoting the confidence of foreign investors. That is an attitude ruled out in babudom. In the long term, hopefully, some amount of pragmatism may seep into the bureaucracy along with the new blood which the prime minister is trying to infuse into the babudom. Till that happens, Indias bureaucracy, as the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy ruled, will rank as the worst in Asia.

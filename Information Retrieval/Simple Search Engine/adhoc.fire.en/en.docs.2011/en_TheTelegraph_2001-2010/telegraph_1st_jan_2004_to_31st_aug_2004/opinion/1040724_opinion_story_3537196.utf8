The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 24, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Its never their fault				 																																																				Sir  The sarpanchs in Madhya Pradesh, who are blaming their third child and consequent disqualification from office on the government, have a point (Child-surplus sarpanchs blame condoms, July 22). Why just the poor quality of condoms, isnt the government also to be blamed for their ignorance about other methods of contraception? Or the women sarpanchs inability to say no to their husbands, when it came to sex? It is no use blaming these sarpanchs  this is what will result every time the government wants to achieve social reform top-down, instead of creating the conditions for change at the grass roots.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Ranjan Basu, Calcutta 
				 																Under threat				 																																																				Sir  Jayeeta Ganguly and her family had every right to refuse to pay the hijras who visited their home to bless the newborn (I was showered with abuses, July 20). But do the vast majority of hijras get to enjoy even the most basic of rights that others take for granted? The writers hurt and sense of violation are justified. But does she know anything about the violence faced by the hijras all over the country on a daily basis? The gang-rape and assault last month by the police of Kokila, a hijra sex-worker in Bangalore, did not even make it to most newspapers. Neither has the mysterious death of Famila, a hijra activist in Bangalore, been reported in Calcutta newspapers. Are these instances of violation any less important than the writers experience? The writer could express her outrage in this newspaper. How many hijras can do the same? What avenues do most of them have to earn an income other than through extortion (in the name of tradition) or extremely exploitative sex work? How many of us really care to know the histories of hijra communities, why they live the way they do, what problems they face? Today, much of their lives has been documented in books and films, and Ganguly will be able to deal with her sense of hurt better if she put her own experience in the larger context. Those of us with more resources have to take the responsibility to build bridges with the less privileged. Or else we will have to pay up, one way or the other. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pawan Dhall, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Extortion by eunuchs on occasions like births and marriages, in long-distance trains, even on the roads, has become an organized racket which cannot flourish without patronage from influential quarters, including politicians. The polices so-called helplessness is beyond comprehension. Are they afraid of the hijras vulgar dance or of the drying up of their flow of money? Evidently, hospitals and nursing homes are also complicit, or how would the eunuchs reach their destinations on time? The administration must take steps to curb this menace and citizens must try to rid themselves of the superstition over the need for eunuchs to bless newborns. For now, eunuchs should be allowed only in nursing homes and a reasonable amount (not exceeding three figures) should be paid to them along with the bill of the nursing home.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The humiliation Jayeeta Ganguly refers to is something every new parent and their families have had to face over the years. Sympathetic to them, no one minded when the hijras earned their livelihood by blessing the newborn. But now they have gone from asking to extracting. The state should take steps to rehabilitate the hijras and enact laws to make society a better place for all.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Fellow star				 																																																				Sir  The Royal Society electing an India-born economist, Partha Sarathi Dasgupta, as its fellow is great news indeed. But the article, Economics in Royal company (July 6), somewhat disappointed me. While the names of eminent scientists who became fellows of the Royal Society have been mentioned, Srinivasan Ramanujans name, the first Indian to become an FRS, does not figure on the list. Considering India was part of the raj at the time and that Ramanujan was a poor clerk in far-off Madras, his achievement was glorious by every reckoning.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

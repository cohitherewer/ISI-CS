		 Monday, March 08, 2004 							 																						GET THE WHOLE PICTURE High forex reserves should not make India complacent about export competitiveness, quality assurance and better governance, writes S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve Bank of India Riding the highOne of the important components of the India Shining propaganda is the $100 billion reserves held by the Reserve Bank of India. In his budget speech, the finance minister, Jaswant Singh, had said that the present level of reserves has liberated us from the psychology of want. In economists jargon, it has rid the Indian economy of the constraint imposed by foreign exchange shortage. Controversy continues about whether this is to the credit of the present government or to the initiators of reforms. 																														The RBI has recently come out with a comprehensive analysis of the forex reserve and its contributors. It also gives the details of the disposition of reserves in terms of the type of securities. In his budget speech, Singh referred to the RBIs publication of its first ever report on forex reserves, but this is not a first for the RBI. It has given some of the information in its latest report on currency and finance as well as in the bi-annual monetary policy statements.																														From the analysis provided by the RBI, what emerges clearly is the significant contribution by capital receipts to the building of reserves, which in March 1991 stood at $5.8 billion. Capital receipts include foreign investments, both direct and portfolio ($55 billion), NRI deposits ($21.8 billion), external assistance ($11.8 billion), external commercial borrowing ($15.3 billion), other items in the capital account ($11.2 billion) offset by a negative figure of outflow on current account of $31 billion. That is to say, Indias exports of goods and services during this pre-reform period have not paid fully for its imports of goods and services. 																														The dependence on capital account means that Indias liabilities both in terms of debt and equity have increased over the years. In other words, the rise in reserves is primarily reflected by increase in liabilities rather than current earnings. Shall we say, the abundance of reserves reflects a sheen based on borrowed feathers rather than India earning? True, even this would have been impossible had India not inspired confidence in investors and depositors.																														The RBI report reflects a favourable turnaround in current account in the recent period. In the first half year of 2003-04, the current account has been more or less in balance. But, even in this period, the contribution to growth of reserves has been primarily due to borrowals and foreign investment. The RBIs report includes an interesting table on Indias global investment position. As on March 2003, the international assets of India, including reserves of $76 billion, totalled $94 billion. As against this, foreign direct investment in India came to $30 billion, portfolio investments $32 billion and other foreign investments $91 billion. The total foreign liabilities represented by these investments came to $154 billion, a hefty $60 billion in excess of assets. The result is that India owes money to the rest of the world rather than the reverse. 																														Much depends, however, on the accuracy of both sides of the balance sheet. Assets held by Indians abroad, but unreported to RBI due to the implications of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act, are variously reported to be in excess of $100 billion. It is also unclear how the RBI has included under other investments a figure of $91 billion, without proper details. In all, Indias investment position is not too shining. 																														The RBI report is not all gloom however. It does bring out the positives in forex management. While the returns earned by India on its forex reserves in the last year were around 2 per cent, these low returns primarily reflected the low interest regime in the world as a whole. The RBI report also cites an elaborate extract from the IMF document on global experience in forex reserve management. Inclusion of India as one of the countries in the IMF report is cited as a plaudit. While it is true that RBIs methods in forex reserve management has become sophisticated, they need to be audited by suitably qualified experts. 																														The security composition of forex reserves held by India has been disclosed by the report  31 per cent of the reserves are held in securities, 40 per cent as deposits with other central banks and the Bank of International Settlements, and 16 per cent with foreign commercial banks. Interestingly, foreign commercial banks, which give a measly return to the RBI, are lending to Indian corporates which approach them for external commercial borrowing as also for assisting NRIs to invest in deposits in India. It may not be entirely inappropriate for the RBI to consider placing some of its reserves with Indian banks abroad to help them lend to Indian entitles at reasonable rates of interest. This can improve the bottomline of both the RBI and Indian banks. True, sufficient care should be taken in this. But, we are all aware that the RBI itself is the regulator of banking operations and has the responsibility of ensuring that prudential norms and risk reduction procedures are observed. So the risk is minimal.																														The report notes that the current level of reserves more than satisfied various criteria of adequacy. By the conventional measure of import cover, we are in clover. At the end of September 2003, the cover had risen to over a years requirement. It must be significantly higher now. We had also about five years of debt servicing as at the end of March 2003. An important measure of adequacy is the ratio of short-term debt to reserves. It had declined to 6.1 per cent at the end of March 2003 as against the high of 46.3 per cent in March 1991.																														The RBI report addresses the frequently asked question as to what level of reserves can be considered adequate. The latest theory and practice are both cited in support of maintaining the current high level of reserves. Portfolio investment is specially volatile. The Rangarajan committee on balance of payments had suggested that attention should also be paid to repayment obligations. The Tarapore committee on capital account convertibility had suggested alternative measures of adequacy, which in addition to trade-based indicators also included money-based and debt-based indicators. In the recent period, assessment of reserve adequacy has been influenced by the addition of more sophisticated measures relevant to emerging market economies, like India.																														The RBI report on forex reserves is a credible document, although one wishes it could have been more current or updated. The report, however, leaves one with an uncomfortable feeling that the high level of reserves has been achieved by a rise in liabilities instead of through current inflows. 																														This shows that we should not rest on our oars on the forex front. It is a call of action to increase exports of both goods and services. We need a lot of sophistication on the part of both Indias exporters and the government to achieve and sustain a level of exports which can make us feel confident about out balance of payments. It will be unfortunate if the century mark in reserves makes our rulers and corporates complacent about the need for greater export competitiveness and quality assurance and better governance, especially in regard to taxation. The urgency is all the greater given the disturbing signals from our principal export destination, the United States of America with reference to our software exports, especially business process outsourcing. The RBI report reiterates eternal vigilance is the price of confidence and sustainability in our external position as it is in other economic aspects of our country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 11, 2004 							 																						THE YOUTH FACTOR				 	 BADGE OF RANK: A new voter flashes her election identity card Photo : Subhendu ChakiTO VOTE OR NOT TO VOTE?																					I do take interest in politics, and will give my vote. My name is on the voters list in my hometown in Behrampore. Exams are near but thats not going to stop me. In fact, Ill travel 180 kilometres just to cast my vote. Its not just about doing my duty. I also feel that even one vote matters.																					 Debarati Sengupta, 20, studies English at Jadavpur University Analysis: Reasons vary but a majority of first-timers do want to vote. For 21-year-old Calcutta student Mousumi Kar Chowdhury, casting a vote makes her feel powerful though she knows it is a false sense of power. A few like Calcuttas Debojoy Chanda will not vote because the choice is between black and black. But as Nayantara Roy, a first-year student from Bangalore says, If I want my aspirations and needs to be addressed, I need to vote first.																					Along with other like-minded students, she has formed a group called the United National Youth Campaign which encourages youngsters to vote. They distribute Form 6 (to get names included in the voters list) in pubs and discos and organise street plays in Kannada and English with a Please Vote message.																					Majority verdict: Willing to vote.																					YOUNG BLOOD OR OLD GUARD?																					We need a blend of youth and experience. Young leaders are quick and instinctive. India is on a sensitive wicket on many issues. So we also need experience to guide us through this period where we have economic growth on the one hand and fundamentalist pressure on the other. Shaleen Sharma, 21, a science student from St Stephens College, New Delhi Analysis: The common view is that infusion of young blood can help find solutions to nagging problems. But, for most, that excludes Rahul Gandhi. First-timers believe that the youth is more idealistic and wedded to its beliefs unlike veteran politicians who are too eager to compromise.																					Others like Mumbaikar Smita Kabra, 22, feel that the age of a politician does not matter. Only their work should be judged, she says. Delhis Mohammed Irfan is extremely specific. He should be experienced but not as old as Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Majority verdict: A remix of the young and old will do fine. But the young ones from the Gandhi family are best avoided.WHAT DO THE STARS FORETELL?																					Stars contesting elections is not a bad idea. But the way political parties are using them as crowd-pullers is not right. Not too many politicians can attract a crowd of more than 20,000. Thats why they want Hema Malini during elections. But we shouldnt pass judgments on them as yet. Congress MP Sunil Dutt started out as a star, but is now respected as a politician. If Govinda wins and does a good job, our judgment would be unfair. Kartik Balakrishnan, 22, studies chartered accountancy and lives in GoregaonAnalysis: Not everyone is as charitable as Kartik. Most echo Bangalores Malati Nayaks view that stars should stick to acting. Delhis Rajendra Singh tells you how Smriti Malhotra Irani didnt know the number of BJP-ruled states and Mousumi Kar Chowdhury makes fun of Dharmendras dialogue, Dharti ma ne boli, aur mai aa gaya. And Smita Kabra of Mumbai bluntly tells you these are attempts by has-been actors to make some easy money.Majority verdict: Yeh jo public hai, yeh sab jaanti hai.																					INDIA SHINING OR WHINING?																					I feel the India Shining campaign is a good idea, though it may not shine in every sphere. It is a good thing to market India as a brand. If nothing else, the campaign instills a sense of patriotism. India definitely needs to be proud of India. But, the misery of people still exists in everyday life. Ranbir Singh, 20, a second-year law college student in PuneAnalysis: Ranbirs is a minority view. Most first-time voters are critical of the politicians but have a hazy picture. There are few like Calcuttas Debarati who think it is a sham because though the economy is doing well and the GDP is at an all-time high, the benefits are only for a select few. Abhimanyu Singhi of St Stephens College, New Delhi is more direct. I cant see how India is shining when so many are still below the poverty level.																					Majority verdict: All that shines is not gold.						BY SATISH NANDGAONKAR IN MUMBAI, SATADRU OJHA IN CALCUTTA AND DIPTI NAIR IN BANGALORE

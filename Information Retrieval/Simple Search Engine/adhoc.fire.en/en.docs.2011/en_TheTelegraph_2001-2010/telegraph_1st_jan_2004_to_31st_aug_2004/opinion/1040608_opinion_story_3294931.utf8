The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 							 																						ABOUT THE TASKS AHEAD Barun De argues that the cultural struggle for the revival of a healthy secularist outlook has not ended with the ousting of the BJP, it has only just begun Combined forceMy generation grew up thinking of prime ministers as supreme representatives of the political groupings they led. This was how all British prime ministers, from Robert Walpole to Tony Blair, sought to behave. So the thought of a prime minister without a strong electoral base of his own, working in tandem with a party president who holds the electoral mandate, appeared disconcerting. Much criticism of the division of political power between sound party leadership and efficient actual governance that the Congress now seeks to innovate comes from our entrapment in the Euro-centric reliance on the British-Indian definition of parliamentary democracy.																														Some go to the extent of calling Jawaharlal Nehrus personal centralization of party and cabinet power, and grooming his daughter for party leadership, as Caesarist. The Italian communist, Antonio Gramsci, used this label to indicate the super-ordinate status of elected leaders, and their families, who take popular power into their own hands to rise above it. Dynastic Bonapartism  and Mussolini did this, copying imperial Rome in modern Europe.																														A few political experts presume that India now has a new form of Caesarism. There is nothing in history to prove that political power-sharing in party systems in modern democracy necessarily leads to Caesarism or Bonapartism. Enough evidence exists in modern India to suggest that party bosses can deal with strategy, while the executive leadership is allowed to change the character of governance towards qualitative improvements calling for new adjustments.																														One example is the Left Front in West Bengal. The relationship between the party and the ministers has not weakened its control over either political opinion or governmental action. There may be stultified creativity, old habits of work, and emphasis on agrarian profits feeding manufacturing industries which would impair real employment prospects. Yet in terms of stability and the clout of the dominant partner over allies in the ruling coalition, dual responsibility between party bosses and the ministerial head has not only not impeded, but may have strengthened the partys political structure and its relation with the masses. Such a strengthening of the Indian political system  without the crude authoritarianism of the Emergency or of the Bharatiya Janata Partys cultural policy (whether in Murli Manohar Joshis saffronization of education or the pogrom in Narendra Modis Gujarat) is required. What now needs to be proved is the new governments capacity to go ahead with generating social, economic and cultural creativity and the production principle. 																														Indian national politics is at the cusp of a transition from one-party or two-party domination (or retrograde attempts by the BJP to revive it), towards coalitional structures appropriate to multi-linguistic, multi-religious, multi-economic levels of class structure, and multi-ethnic polity  all of which still withstand external pressures and internal dissension. Nehruvian control need not be our only guiding metaphor. There was much in Nehruvian liberalism, which kept steadfast the faith of the people who voted out BJP chauvinism and obscurantism. Is the Congress itself aware of the providence that removed from power a whole variety of inauspicious forces? In its collective inner heart, does the United Progressive Alliance share our gratitude that it came to power only because the people rejected the BJP through a variety of regional alliances, and a loose diversity of requirements that were flouted by the previous government, bent on dragging the country towards predatory North Atlantic style, South Asian hegemonism?																														When the election campaign began, Ashok Mitra wrote in The Telegraph that the mood of the electorate foreshadowed a three-way split. The fractured shares would be split between coalitional alliances, led by the Congress, the National Democratic Alliance partners, and other scattered regional groupings representing varied local interests. He was not necessarily arguing for a third front, but rather for recognition of decentralization. Since his Kale lectures at Punes Gokhale Institute in the Seventies, he has been pleading for this. This position has had other illustrious proponents. The increase of seats not only for the left, but also the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Telegana Rashtra Samiti and the Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam in the Gangetic plains and in southeast India should make policy framers think.																														The common element in these regions is that manufacturing industry was once  in long-past colonial times  a leading sector. Changes in the dynamics of world industry led to obsolescence and the migration of productive capital, with grave social and political demoralization in the second half of the 20th century. Only emphasis on national investment and national employment without fear or favour to particular interests will not solve the agro-industrial problems of this eastern and southern hinterland tract and bring it in line with, say, Bangalore, Hyderabad or Baroda. A decentralizing vision, based on states and sub-state specificities as in Telangana  one which gives more power to panchayats, but also more funding for local project modes through Central packages, needs to be urged within the UPA as well as by its allies outside the coalition.																														It would be unwise if one of the main reasons for the rejection of the BJP  its cultural policy  gets to be ignored outside ministries such as human resource development, tourism and culture and youth affairs. One has full confidence that the UPA will carry out what is already being called detoxification without witch-hunting. The point is not just which careerists got themselves appointed to plum positions and lucrative assignments after Joshi cleaned out. Playing ins and outs can only lead to internecine strife of the DMK-All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam variety.																														Reflection must quickly be undertaken about the mood of the national intelligentsia, which reflects popular sentiments and emotions regarding traditions, cultural aspirations and needs of spiritual welfare. Sociologists such as T.N. Madan, J.P.S. Uberoi and Ashis Nandy have criticized the irrational element in the non-religious bias in the study of material culture that some of us indulge in. It is necessary to include their outlook in composite focus, welding the material and spiritual aspects of culture, emphasizing values and obligations as well as economic interest and rights, to decide what ideas and scholarship should be presented to the people.																														In the early Seventies, cultural policy shifted from markedly Hindu liberalism of the Sixties to latitudinarian emphasis on material socio-economic structure. The latter bias has been balanced, and that too not by Hindutva fanatics. Anyone concerned with cultural sanity, a prerequisite for a humane economic policy, based on the specificities of diversity in unity, must be aware that Hindutva proponents may be defeated but they have not yet thrown in the towel. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh will step up its propaganda from its shakhas, its primary schools and its gymnasia; the astrologers, vaastubadis and tantriks continue to spread their brand of non-science among all sections. In the higher echelons, religious sectarianism and casteism are more rampant than ever before. This cultural struggle for the revival of a healthy secularist outlook has not yet been won, it has just begun.

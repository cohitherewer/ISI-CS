		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 							 																						CURRYING PERSONAL FLAVOURS Gouri CHatterjee																					The way to a mans heart, it is said, lies through the stomach. That may or may not be true, but the way to the medias heart can take that route, going by the huge success of Sonia Gandhis dinner diplomacy with the countrys editors and other senior journalists.																					The much-maligned goongi guriya has spent the whole of February hosting rounds of lunches and dinners for not just Delhis media stars but also luminaries from the regional press at her usually out-of-bounds 10 Janpath Road home. On the menu were gilauti kebabs and Goan fish curry and a gently garrulous Gandhi. 																					To a man (they were mostly men), the hard-bitten, seasoned newshounds were bowled over by this close encounter with a leader whose USP had so far been enigma and mystery. 																					What made the difference was not her political acumen or understanding of India (may be one meeting is too short to gauge that) but the discovery of Sonia Gandhi the human.																					She is so natural, not standoffish or arrogant at all, gushes Anandabazar Patrika executive editor, Suman Chattopadhyay. What struck him most was her honesty, her forthrightness, adding, I want her to win though its the NDA which is expected to come back. 																					From all accounts, the effect has been no different on those who have a closer proximity to Delhis high and mighty. Reports are studded with adjectives like confident, smiling, gracious to describe the shadow prime ministers interaction with the media. 																					India Today editor Prabhu Chawla has even told friends, Theres no reason why she shouldnt be PM. It may not be possible this time because of the Vajpayee factor, but she has time on her side. 																					While Shekhar Gupta probed the foreigner issue with questions like, You never thought when you got married to Rajiv that you were marrying into a political family? and Then in Delhi you didnt get much pasta but now you do Sonia Gandhi walked this talk effortlessly.																					For the Congress president some things are working  at last. But impressing the masses (her roadshows too are evidently part of the same programme of making a virtue of the personal touch out of her poor oratorical skills) may not be as easy as impressing the media. The voters have a lot more to lose.																					Art sell																					Thomas L. Friedman, the foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times, has long been a friend of India. After 9/11, he waxed eloquent about Indias Muslims who, unlike those in Muslim-dominated countries, were not so anti-American, thanks entirely to democracy. 																					It is not surprising therefore that Friedman is spotting silver linings in Americas cloud of outsourcing. Such as, he wrote in a column from Bangalore last week, the way call centres here are creating jobs in America by buying their computers and airconditioners and even drinking water.																					But when Friedman discovers that the artists who draw the cartoons to make India such a huge outsourcing centre for the animation industry are the children of Hindu temple sculptors and painters, one has to draw the line.																					Was the COO of JadooWorks, a Bangalore-based animation company, who told Friedman about the artists ancestry, simply pulling his leg or making it easier for him to sell his story to his readers? 																					Green at the gills 																					Last week, Doordarshan was ready to spend $4 million (around Rs 18 crore) to acquire the terrestrial rights of the India-Pakistan cricket series.																					Instead, it might have to pay a mere $2,00,000 (around Rs 90 lakh), because that is the price of a one-hour daily highlights package, all that Ten Sports, which has the exclusive broadcast rights, is ready to offer. 																					If the government has to settle for the lesser sum, it will be seen as a big failure indeed. And the deputy prime minister will have yet another reason to wish the games well beyond the elections. Cricket is threatening to rob the country of the feel good factor even before the men in green have made a single move.

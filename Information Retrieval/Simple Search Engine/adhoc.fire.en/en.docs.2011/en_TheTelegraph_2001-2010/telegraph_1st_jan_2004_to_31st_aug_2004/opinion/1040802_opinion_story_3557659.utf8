The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 02, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The tyranny of a presence				 																																																				Sir  We couldnt possibly have a more self-righteous prime minister. He asks for his airplane ticket, pleads with his ministers to stop paying him obeisance and thinks of how lesser mortals will be affected by a traffic hold-up. But we also couldnt have a prime minister who is as hamstrung as Manmohan Singh. A day after Singh drew out his pen to discipline his men through a daring circular, hoping to set a precedent, his supreme benefactor was there at the airport with her men to prove Singhs directive isnt even worth the paper it was written on (Sonia leads party to PM send-off, July 30). Can anyone think of something like this happening to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, no matter how ineffectual he proved as a vote-catcher for his party? If the pictures on page 6 of the days paper (showing a Sonia Gandhi with mockery writ large on her face) were any proof, the Congress president has managed to make a complete fool of the prime minister of the nation. Is it the partys presence she wished to represent, or her own? Another thing. Is there any guarantee such presence will not be imposed on Singh the next time he goes on a foreign tour?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Sen, Calcutta

				 																Mothers Courage				 																																																				Sir  We, at the Nari Nirjatan Pratirodh Mancha, are trying to comprehend the extent of state repression that could have provoked 12 Manipuri women to protest, naked, at Kangla Fort on July 15. What is the depth of the rage and helplessness that pushes women to rush into the camp of their torturers? How monstrous has the Indian army become, equipped with the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, to cause five youths to burn themselves in front of the chief ministers residence? The act prevents civilians from complaining against any action taken by the armed forces. It allows the latter to loot and plunder as they wish. Evidence from Manipur suggests this is exactly what is happening. Even the Manipuri government has admitted that the military is abusing the act. 				 																																																				The result? Women are being raped, even killed, and then denied the legal recourse to complain. Thanglam Manorama was not the only woman to be arrested and murdered on the basis of sketchy evidence. In the face of such gratuitous abuse of power, one admires the bravery of those who put themselves at risk against the strongest arms of the state. Ones head hangs in shame to see the desperation of these women putting their own bodies on the line because nothing else works. How much more of this brutality can the people of Manipur, no, we, the Indian nation, stand? This sense of injustice cannot be relegated to a corner of the North-east. When India sends its army to suppress its people, the crimes committed there become a national shame, the injustice a national responsibility. 				 																																																				Undoubtedly, the Armed Forces act was passed to combat terrorism. But draconian laws like this do not address the real complaints. Nor does placing curfew from 4 pm to 4 am. They turn such areas into pressure cookers, ready to explode. When people lack legal recourse, when they are denied the right to assemble peacefully, they are left only with extra-legal and violent means. Regardless of whether the current string of protests turns into a violent uprising, the Armed Forces act must be repealed immediately. Enough people have spoken out against it, enough harm has been done by its implementation. No arm of the government should function without any checks and balances. That goes against the very nature of democracy. Those in the military responsible for the rapes, murders and numerous other crimes upon the people in Manipur must be found and brought to justice. To not do so goes against the very nature of civilization. We cannot allow this type of abuse to go on in our country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Susama Agarwala, Mira Roy, and nine others, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The step-motherly treatment meted out to the smaller northeastern states is born out of the realization that these states hardly have any power to affect the stability of the government at the Centre. It is a matter of shame that even after so many years of independence, these states are trying to assert their identities. In their eyes, their oppressors have merely changed in the colour of their skin  from white to brown. The Centre should stop boasting about its federal nature if it cannot pay heed to the grievances of these people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

				 																																																				Sir  The brutal killing of Thanglam Manorama confirms the counter-terror unleashed by the Assam Rifles in Manipur. Many precious lives have been eliminated by the security forces through similar such fake encounters. Many in the state remember how innocent lives were massacred at Malom and Heirangoithong. In Manoramas case, the Assam Rifles cannot justify their argument that she was shot dead while trying to flee. Manorama, who was in custody, must have been handcuffed and blind-folded. How could she attempt to escape then? Peace cannot be achieved until the security personnel are educated and disciplined by their superiors and begin to treat the people of the state as citizens of the country. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ranjit Singh, Thoubal, Manipur

				 																																																				Sir  In Why Manipur burns (July 26), Ashok Mitra takes up the question of struggling nationalities not only in the North-east but also in Europe. Mitra explains that the question is no longer of nation and nationalities, but of the centre, that is the dominant category, and the periphery, with its timid inhabitants. This is a global phenomenon. But is it because the recession of the imperialist force, under whose subjugation the nation had appeared as a single unit, has now uncovered a multipolar region? Was there complete harmony before? No group or political power can impose its ethnic, linguistic or religious supremacy on any other without resistance. People cannot forget their ethnic identities even after living in a distant land for centuries  look at the Jews or the Afro-Americans. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Naked anger at army (July 16) made me wonder why the women in Manipur had chosen this extreme form of protest against the Indian army. It is sad to think that women cannot make themselves heard without a display of skin. We talk about enforcing equality, reserving seats in the legislature, but what is the point of it all when they will never get the respect that is their due? Now that the army has been condemned and reason for protest seen, my question is, was it really worth all this?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mansie Shah, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Thanks to The Telegraph for throwing light on the women protesters in Manipur. The women who are called imas, literally meaning mothers, are the long-suffering, hard-workingwomen of the state who have long been victims of neglect and desertion by their menfolk. Even though they usually give a wide berth to party politics and are independent enough not to side with any political party, they have a strong social conscience and can act unitedly, as shown in the Kangla protest. When they take up a cause, the offender had better watch out. Drunkards know only too well what it is to be surrounded by angry baton-wielding imas. This social activism is an admirable example that should be followed by other women in the rest of India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Chatterjee, Santiniketan

				 																																																				Sir  While one certainly admires the courage of the Manipuri ladies who stripped in protest against the states murder of Manorama, one wonders what actual effect this will achieve. After all, even Irom Sharmila has not succeeded in getting the Armed Forces (Special Powers Act) revoked after years of hunger strike. The sad truth is that the average north Indian politician who decides the destiny of the country does not even know where Manipur is, and cares even less for what happens there.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Biswapriya Purkayastha, 

				 																																																				Shillong				 																																																				Sir  The womens protest has struck a chord and everyone will now demand the most stringent punishment for army personnel. But it must be kept in mind that terrorists in border states like Nagaland, Mizoram and others have various strategies to defame the government, the army and generate hatred among the people against the establishment. Their objective is to undermine peoples confidence and their cooperation with the army and police. A naked protest is unthinkable in India. There might be a deeper conspiracy behind it. The matter should be thoroughly investigated by the government and the army.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sudhir Bera, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Some armymen may be responsible for the death of Manorama, but the entire Indian army cannot be condemned for it. Taking to the streets has become fashionable. But turning up nude in the public raises questions of sanity. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapas Sarkar, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 							 																						SPIRIT IS WEAK																														There is many a slip between spirit and letter. That is the slippery zone in which the new chief election commissioner, Mr T.S. Krishnamurthy, has been trapped. Expressing his disapproval of the fusillade of government advertisements before the Lok Sabha elections, he has said that it is his personal view that taxpayers money should not be used to gain electoral advantage. But without the model code of conduct in operation, such disapproval remains technically confined to the area of personal opinion. The Election Commission is not empowered to do anything about it. As a matter of fact, the CEC may be asked whether he feels he can use the forum of the EC to make such a comment at all. Apart from anything else, it serves to point up the futility of the EC when faced with the deliberate manipulation of government machinery by the party or coalition in power. The model code of conduct begins to be effective only after the date of the elections is announced. There is really nothing to stop a government from announcing the date as late as possible and blocking newspaper pages and television screens with self-congratulatory messages and galleries of portraits until that very last moment.																														It is not just the Central government that is hard-selling the dream of a new India with a disconcerting contortion in the phrasing. State governments, whether in Orissa or Andhra Pradesh, have suddenly gone to town with showers of gifts for the people. The new buzzword, performance, denoting the phenomenon that, according to the Bharatiya Janata Party, brought it the triumphs in the recent assembly elections, has caught on. But performance no longer means planned, hard work, it means gimmicks. The CEC has appealed to all political parties, in governance and in opposition, to keep in mind the spirit of the model code of conduct. But he is asking for the impossible: honour among politicians. His spirit is well-taken, but ineffective. The whole point is the use of available resources to ensure the return of the parties in power. Democracy in India and elsewhere has always been an approximation to the ideal, in some places a poorer approximation than in others. Had politicians and parties been as full of rectitude about the publics money as not to use it for the purposes of electoral propaganda, democracy in India would have had a very different look. It is not as if the EC has not been trying, since the time of Mr T.N. Seshan, to evolve a transparent policy for electoral funding. As long as that is not in place, the practices Mr Krishnamurthy is lamenting will continue to thrive.

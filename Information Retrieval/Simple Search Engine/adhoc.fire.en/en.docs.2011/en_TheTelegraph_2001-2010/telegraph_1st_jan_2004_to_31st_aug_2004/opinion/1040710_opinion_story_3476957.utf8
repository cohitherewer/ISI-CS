				 																																	From graphic artist to political cartoonist to deputy editor to author. One would have stopped there. But Ravi Shankar Etteth decided to go further and try his hand at writing crime fiction. After the collection of stories, The Scream of the Dragonflies and his mystic novel Tiger by the River, the deputy editor of India Today, who started his career as a caricature artist, is all set to launch another book, called The Village of Widows. The spine-chilling thriller, published by Penguin India, is about a criminal psychologist and a police commissioner who are obsessed with trying to trace the killer of a Delhi diplomat. Their quest takes them to a haunted village inhabited by widows. Shankar has a predilection for the preternatural.Samira MakhmalbafAll of you who ooh-ed and aah-ed at Sofia Coppola  of Francis Ford fame  you aint heard nothin yet. Ladies and gentlemen, make way for Samira Makhmalbaf, daughter of the great Iranian filmmaker Mohsen and the youngest director ever to grace Cannes two years in a row. Samira, who became famous at 18 with her first feature film, The Apple, was also the proud recipient of the best film by an Asian director award at the International Film Festival of India held in Delhi last year, for her film, At Five In The Afternoon. But why are we talking about her now? Because shes coming to India again, with daddy dear. The Cinefan Festival of Asian Cinema is holding a Makhmalbaf retrospective this month, and father and daughter are the guests of honour. Roll out the Persian carpets, then!

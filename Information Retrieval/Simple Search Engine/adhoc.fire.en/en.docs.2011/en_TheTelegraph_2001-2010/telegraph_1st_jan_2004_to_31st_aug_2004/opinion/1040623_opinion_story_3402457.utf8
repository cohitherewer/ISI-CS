		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 							 																						VAT FOR TAX																														Several deadlines have already been missed for value added tax. Is the new deadline of April 1, 2005, believable? Some states have already begun to murmur, arguing that transition to VAT is contingent on all states moving to the new regime. Partial implementation by some states and not by others defeats the purpose of VAT. This is indeed a valid argument, although all states are not adequately prepared. In many states, draft VAT legislation is not even ready. This will require presidential assent. Subsequently, rules and administrative machinery will have to be put in place. That apart, certain ticklish issues still remain. First, what will happen to Central excise and Central sales taxes? Logically, they should be scrapped and integrated into VAT. Second, will the states agree to zero-rate inter-state sales? Third, the issue of zero-rating inter-state sales gets into the problematic area of states suffering from possible revenue losses. Since the Central VAT rate of 12.5 per cent is supposed to be revenue neutral, there ought to be no revenue loss. However, some states have argued for lower rates on selected products and if agreed to, this enhances the possibility of imagined (or real) revenue losses. The states will therefore ask for compensation, perhaps through enhanced service sector taxation. This is an incomplete VAT, since it only involves harmonization and standardization of state-level sales tax, without eliminating other indirect taxes. However, the utility of even the incomplete VAT is contingent on the states agreeing to give up the freedom to choose rates. 																														The indications are that the states are reluctant to give up this perceived assault on their fiscal autonomy. But if discretion and deviation are permitted, the proposed VAT will be no different from the historical sales tax regime. If the logic of standardization of rates is accepted, there ought to be no state-specific fiscal incentives. Yet, many states are reluctant to give up this privilege. Not a single one of these is a new issue. And these are issues that should have been sorted out in 2001, if not in 2003. That they have still not been sorted out suggests that the April 2005 deadline is premature, even though reform of the non-transparent and cost-cascading indirect tax structure is long overdue. With 16 states pushing for VAT and the remainder still opposing, the country as a whole is still not ready. Under the earlier government, there was a proposal to reward states that are fast movers, through higher compensation for possible revenue losses. That may be the only option.

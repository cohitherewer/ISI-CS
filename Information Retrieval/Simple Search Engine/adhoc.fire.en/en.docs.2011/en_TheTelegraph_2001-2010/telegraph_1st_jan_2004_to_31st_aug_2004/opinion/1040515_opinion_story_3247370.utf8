The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 							 																						WITH POWER, ABOVE POWERMs Gandhi has earned the right to Indias top job, but she could also claim high moral ground by renouncing itIn politics, as in life, success is the result of 90 per cent hard work and ten per cent genius. The resounding victory of the Congress in the elections is the culmination of the gruelling work put in by Ms Sonia Gandhi. She not only campaigned across the country but she also took steps to strengthen the party organization. She did not allow morale to fall after the defeats in the assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh last year. This work enabled the Congress to cash in on the anti-National Democratic Alliance sentiments that clearly drove the electorate. This is thus a victory for Ms Gandhi. It is her triumph in another way as well. The elections were pitched as a battle between Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Ms Gandhi. The election was also seen as a kind of referendum on Ms Gandhis foreign origins and her right to rule India. On all these issues, the electorate voted overwhelmingly in favour of Ms Gandhi. The people of India endorsed Ms Gandhi as the undisputed leader of the Congress and made her Italian origins completely irrelevant to her claims to lead India. The people of India have accepted Ms Gandhi as one of them. There is no other way to interpret the popular mandate. Only the mean and the prejudiced will deny that Ms Gandhi has earned all the laurels that she now wears on her head.																														After all this, it will be churlish to challenge, as Mr Sharad Pawar and his ilk are prone to do, Ms Gandhis right to be Indias prime minister. Such a challenge defies all logic and all conventions of democracy. Legally, she is an Indian citizen. She has got herself elected to the Lok Sabha. She led her partys election campaign and members of her party have no hesitation in accepting her as their leader. Thus, within and without the Congress, Ms Gandhi has won recognition for herself as an Indian and as a leader. Those who still continue to oppose her entitlement to be prime minister of India are only denying what the popular mandate has bestowed on Ms Gandhi. Her right to hold Indias top job is above any kind of controversy and political bargaining.																														Ms Gandhis right to be prime minister does not abide any question. But she could, if she so desired, renounce that right. Having earned the right to power, she could relinquish the power. By acting thus, she would be following in the footsteps of another Gandhi who in the first half of the 20th century never claimed for himself the power that was rightfully his. This earned him the accolade Mahatma. Ms Gandhi could ascend that high moral ground by refusing to be prime minister. As an effective leader of the Congress, untrammelled by administrative and other official responsibilities, she could push forward the cause and agenda that she advocates. She could reinvent the Congress as a party that is committed to economic liberalization without neglecting the social sector and the welfare of the poor. She could change the configuration of the party by bringing in young and new faces which are not tainted by greed and scandal. An act of renunciation would serve as the basis for making the Congress the only party capable and worthy of leading India. Ms Gandhi is unique as a political leader, an act of renunciation can only add to her uniqueness.

		 Monday, May 10, 2004 							 																						DOWN THE HILL																														The desperation to win an election can drive political parties to try dangerous gambles. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has clearly taken a dangerous line in reacting to Mr Subash Ghishings decision to support the Congress candidate for the Darjeeling parliamentary seat. It is easy to understand the partys despair at the decision. In the last two Lok Sabha elections, the CPI(M) won the seat easily by virtue of Mr Ghishings call to boycott the polls. The Marxists did not complain about this undemocratic interference with the peoples right to exercise their franchise because it benefited the party. Others could justifiably see this as an unholy entente between the Marxists and the maverick chief of the Gorkha National Liberation Front. There was enough reason to suspect that the CPI(M) connived at the alleged irregularities of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, of which Mr Ghishing is the chairman, because he helped the party win the Darjeeling seat. No one can deny that Mr Ghishing has every right to decide what stand his party takes on any election as long as it does not infringe on the peoples right to vote. It is not difficult, therefore, to see through the duplicity of the CPI(M)s reaction to his decision to support the Congress this time round. 																														But, far worse is the CPI(M)s dangerous game of giving Mr Ghishings move a completely unwarranted ethnic angle. The partys complaint that Mr Ghishings decision is a covert ploy to revive the call for a separate state of Gorkhaland in the Darjeeling hills is a cheap political stunt. It is aimed at inciting Bengali sentiments against a division of the state and thereby splitting the Darjeeling vote on ethnic lines. Since two-thirds of the electorate are in the plains, the bogey of Gorkhaland is, to the Marxists, a potentially successful means to whip up ethnic passions. Mr Ghishing may have his own ideas about reviving the demand for a Gorkhaland state. But to link it to his support to the Congress is the Marxists invention dictated by cynical gambles of electoral politics. It is a dangerous ploy that can sow fresh seeds of mistrust between the Nepalis of Darjeeling and the Bengalis of the plains. But the desire to win elections by fair or foul means can drive politicians to paranoia. It would be dangerous for Darjeelings fragile peace if the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, compounds his partys mistake by trying to settle scores with Mr Ghishing after the elections. If Darjeelings peace is sacrificed at the altar of crude electoral calculations, it would be an infinitely bigger loss for Bengal. If Darjeeling burns again, the Lok Sabha elections there would be irrelevant.

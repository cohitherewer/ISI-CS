The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 06, 2004 							 																						WHEN REALITY STRIKES GOURI CHATTERJEE																					The mid-day sun was beating down mercilessly on the thousands waiting expectantly at the barren Shamsi college ground, over 30 kilometres from the nearest town, Malda. On the podium, Deepa Das Munshi was being an exemplary wife, exhorting the crowd to vote for her husband Priya Ranjan, the Congress candidate and sitting MP from Raigunj constituency in north Bengal. Suddenly, there was a stir that Mrs Das Munshi tried valiantly to still. Soniaji is still some distance away. Please be a little patient, she pleaded. A roar went up in answer and candidate Das Munshi came to his wifes aid. Soniaji wont be here for another half hour when the drone of whirring wings cut him short.																					The people had spied Sonia Gandhis helicopters long before the netas were even aware that the Congress president had arrived well before the appointed hour. Villagers had long learnt to trust their senses rather than others words.																					Words are the currency of city slickers. For villagers, action speaks volumes. Action that is immediate and tangible, not abstract concepts like a stable Centre or rapid liberalization or even secularism. Media hype leaves them cold. Not just because they are blissfully unaware of it all (illiterate and without electricity, newspapers or television mean little to them), but more because they know perfectly well what really matters to them.																					Ill vote for whoever brings power to my village before election day, says a frail Mohammad Zakir Hussain, standing at the bus stand where Maldas CPI(M) candidate is just warming up to his theme song: How can Ghani Khan [the sitting Congress MP] do anything for Malda when he attended Parliament only 27 days in the last five years?																					Give and take or you end up with nothing  for village India the electoral equation is that simple. Das Munshi, a veteran of parliamentary elections since 1971, says the only national issues his voters have expressed any interest in this year are the rising price of kerosene, the falling price of government procurement and the possible scrapping of IMDT. All touch their lives directly.																					In other words, village India is up for grabs. Did the BJP know this? Is that the reason for its Shining India blitzkrieg  a desperate attempt to shore up its position in urban India? Or may be the BJP isnt all that clever and miscalculated the whole exercise.																					We can look forward to reams of insightful analyses explaining it all from the 13th onwards. But who will tell us why newspapers woke up to the real India only after TV exit polls? Surely news consumers have a right to know.																					Suddenly in demand																					The media may get rural India (and the elections) wrong, but this is also the time that correspondents here come into their own. Suddenly, senior journalists from the big cities swoop down on them for a day or two, court them for their local knowledge and connections, and district correspondents, lowly beings in the journalistic food chain, get a sense of being inside the loop. Only to be forgotten, like the voters, till the next election.																					Metro twins																					Same day (Friday, April 23, 2004), same headline (Sex and the city), same (almost) blurb (Calcutta Times kicks off a series on the infidelity rage thats set Kolkata on fire as against Bombay Times kicks off a series on the infidelity rage thats set Mumbai on fire). Thats where the similarities began. The text of the stories in both papers was identical  except for one difference. Calcutta Timess Raghav, a south Kolkata boy is Ryan, a south Mumbai boy in Bombay Times, Karan Sen is Karan Singh, Amit Datta Amit Patel, and so on. Whatever their names, the people in Calcutta and Mumbai were evidently separated at birth, they think, act, speak just like each other. May be, The Times of India believes what Calcutta thinks today, Bombay thinks the same day (or vice versa). Or it could be the other clich: whats in a name Or, it could be the business-savvy TOIs way of achieving economies of scale, journalism go hang.

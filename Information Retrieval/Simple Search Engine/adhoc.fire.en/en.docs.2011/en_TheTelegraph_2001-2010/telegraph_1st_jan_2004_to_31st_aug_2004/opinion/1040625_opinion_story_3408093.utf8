		 Friday, June 25, 2004 							 																						THE INSIDE STORY 							 - The Iraq war was anything but pre-ordained				 	 Trading secretsPLAN OF ATTACK By Bob Woodward, Simon amp; Schuster,  pound;18.99There were lingering doubts that Bob Woodward, Americas most celebrated political reporter, may have merged with Washingtons denizens while churning out ponderous divulgings with urgent titles  Veil, The Choice, The Agenda and Bush at War. But with the release of this engrossing new book, he has cleared the doubts and regained his cult status acquired post-Watergate.																														Based on interviews with 75 key participants and more than three-and-a-half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, Plan of Attack is presidential history live, leading us through the decisions made during the 16 critical months, prior to the actual attack on Iraq, revealing precise details of the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword, Polo Step. Woodwards formula to get people who count to talk is simple and down-to-earth. He offers a deal. If you talk, he will faithfully present your side of the story. If you do not, your rivals will. And they will end up looking good, often at your expense. 																														What emerge as a result are astonishingly intimate portraits of President Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room and in private conversation; vice-president Dick Cheney, focussed and driven to attack Iraq irrespective of world opinion and Hans Blixs doubts about the presence of weapons of mass destruction; defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat who is equally hawkish ; secretary of state Colin Powell, cautious and deeply conflicted; former CIA director, George Tenet, activist, willing to please the powers that matter; national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, trying to act as the referee but not aware of the full facts till late in the day, and of foreign leaders ranging from Tony Blair to Vladimir Putin.																														Woodwards style is not to present an overall analysis, still less a polemic, but simply to lay out the facts and viewpoints of the main actors. He rarely joins the dots, as those in the Bush administration might say. But it hardly matters, as the dots themselves are compelling enough.																														Bush, we learn, never asked Powell whether he thought it was right to go to war with Iraq, but also that Powell never offered his opinion. He would not intrude on that most private of presidential spaces  where a president made decisions of war and peace  unless he was invited.																														Even if he had, it is not likely that he would have made much difference. For what emerges most powerfully from this book is that the war was all but pre-ordained. Even before Bush was inaugurated, Cheney decided that the new presidents first national briefing should be about Iraq. On day 17 of the new administration, the principals met to discuss  Iraq. The axis of evil, we discover was always about Iraq: North Korea and Iran were afterthoughts, to make it look less obvious.																														As can be expected, all countervailing evidence was ignored. Defectors told the CIA that the Iraqi military was so ragged that Iraqi pilots were inventing illnesses on the days they were supposed to fly because they were terrified  (their) inadequately maintained planes would crash. In September 2002, at a meeting about possible targets, General Franks bluntly stated, Mr President, weve been looking for Scud missiles and other weapons of mass destruction for 10 years and havent found any yet. Powell, who was privy to such information was in the fridge and cold-shouldered by the inner circle lest he acted as an impediment to the inevitable war and he went so far as to tell Woodward that Cheney was terrified of the UN route lest it actually work and war was prevented.																														Some of the gripping passages take place far from Washington, as the CIA dispatches a covert military team to northern Iraq six months before the start of the war. This team in turn, recruited 87 Iranian spies, designated with the cryptonym, DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6000 men in Saddams personal security organization. In an amusing aside, as the CIA agents were paying off their informants in $100 bills, this hefty bill soon became the going rate for a cup of coffee.																														One of the more interesting conclusions drawn by Woodward is that the United States of Americas special relationship is not with Britain, but with Saudi Arabia. Prince Bandar, Saudi Arabias ambassador to Washington, emerges as someone with free access to the Oval Office and tellingly is the only person who talks back to the president, interrupting him and even taunting him. 																														That Bush does not seem to mind, as also Bandar is formally notified of the start of the war before Powell or Blair, should raise questions about the nature of the Saudi hold on the Bush administration. Woodward offers a tantalizing clue: The Saudis hoped to fine-tune oil prices  to prime the economy for 2004. What was key, Bandar knew, were the economic conditions before a presidential election, not at the moment of the election. In other words, the Saudis were favoured because they were going to rig the global economy to ensure Bush a second-term.																														All these add up to a volume as gripping as a John Grisham novel with the added advantage that it is all true. Make that a grave disadvantage. For this book confirms our worst fears, that the worlds only superpower is in the hands of a dangerous gang and as if to legitimize it, they have the British prime minister with them as well.

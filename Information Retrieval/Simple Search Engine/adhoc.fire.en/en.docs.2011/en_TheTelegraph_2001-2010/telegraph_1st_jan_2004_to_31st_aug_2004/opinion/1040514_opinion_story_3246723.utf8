		 Friday, May 14, 2004 							 																						THE ABCS OF PUBLISHING				 	 Read the small print																														Authors should know what some publishing terms mean if only to ensure that they deliver a typescript complete in all respects, one that would ensure a good quality of production which would, in turn, ensure better marketing and sales, and hence, royalties for the authors.																														Publishers have their own lingo and assume authors know it too. They dont, and this leads to misunderstandings. So, here is an irreverent guide to some publishing terms that authors ought to know, in theory and in practice.																														Acknowledgements  names of those an author wishes to thank for help in research or permission to quote. While authors should provide the list of who should be acknowledged, getting clearance should be the responsibility of publishers.																														Advance  money paid to the author on signature of the contract in anticipation of expected royalties. 																														Agent  the front man who arranges the publication of a book and charges 10-15 per cent of the authors earnings for services rendered. Most agents only handle works of fiction, while educational materials are often commissioned directly by the publisher.																														Backlist: Old books that continue to sell. Authors should try to get into the backlist because it ensures steady royalties for years to come.																														Bibliography: The list of sources, primary and secondary, used by the author. Authors should prepare this list themselves, providing the name of the author and publisher, year of publication and edition to ensure consistency in the presentation of the information.																														Blurb: Short and eye-catching summary of a book on its cover or in a catalogue. Publishers can jazz up the copy but the information should be provided by the author.																														Bulk is the thickness of the paper or the padding out of a book to make it look bigger than the sum total of the words. It is a trick often used by publishers.																														Commissioning editor is the one who commissions the author to write a book on a particular subject. The desk editor checks details like spellings and dates, consistency in the presentation of matter and so on.																														Copyright: The claim to ownership by the creator of a work and his heirs, or the publisher who invests in the production of the book. 																														Foreign rights: Translation and reproduction rights sold to foreign publishers. Rights are big business now, without which some of the huge advances that are given now would not have been possible.																														Gross sales are sales before returns, after making allowance for which the publisher is left with the net sales figure. Authors should heed this distinction because royalties are calculated on net sales.																														ISBN, or International Standard Book Number, is a numbering system used to identify titles. All books have ISBNs now.																														Moral right: The right of the author to be identified as the creator of the work.																														Remainders are titles that have ceased to sell in significant numbers and are shifted to the discount market. Many booksellers in India have made their fortunes on remainders.																														Returns are the proportion of a books print run that remains unsold with booksellers and are returned to the publisher to be remaindered and sold to wholesalers at huge discounts. About 15 per cent of hardback editions and 25 per cent of paperbacks are returned. 																														Royalties: The percentage of the price of the book paid to the author, usually on a yearly basis. Royalty is now fixed at 10 per cent, except in rare cases. But the question is whether royalty is paid on the full price of the book or on net returns. That is, for a book priced at Rs 100 would the royalty be paid on the listed price or on the discounted price which could be Rs 70? 																														There are other terms which writers can learn with time.						RAVI VYAS

		 Friday, April 23, 2004 							 																						TRACING THE CIRCUMFERENCE				 	 Tolkien: way with wordsThe Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary By Simon Winchester, Oxford, Rs.645The first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary  the OED, as it is known wherever English is spoken  James Murray, wrote in his famous Introduction that The circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible circumference. The circumference has expanded since the lines were penned in the high noon of Victorianism. The centre has also perhaps shifted. But this cannot take away from the breathtaking and magisterial scale of the OED when it was first conceived and executed without the aid of computers or even of typewriters. Simon Winchester, who revealed in The Surgeon of Crawthorne one of the most moving stories behind the making of the Dictionary, captures in this book the history of the Dictionary and of the struggle to get the great enterprise off the ground.																														The idea of such a Dictionary was first mooted in a meeting of the Philological Society in the London Library on Guy Fawkes Day by Richard Chenevix Trench, the Dean of Westminster. The Dean pleaded for a dictionary of the English language based on historical principles which would have illustrated meanings and biographies of every word. The Dean also put forward the classic definition of a dictionary of the kind he wanted: A dictionary is an historical monument, the history of a nation contemplated from one point of view. Such a dictionary, the Dean of Westminster explained, would contain the meanings of all known English words, and the meanings and the senses were to be found in a close reading of all of published English literature. How was this seemingly impossible project to be accomplished? It was here that Trench put forward his most brilliant idea which serves as the fountainhead of the Dictionary even today.																														He suggested that the English-speaking people themselves be asked and cajoled to send in lists of words and their meanings together with illustrative quotations. This would make the dictionary really of the people and thus truly democratic. Despite the spirit of democracy which was embedded in the project from its very conception, such a dictionary needed a leader in the person of an editor. Work on the Dictionary (it was then called The New English Dictionary) started in 1860 with Herbert Coleridge (grandson of the poet, Samuel Taylor) as the first editor.																														Coleridge was a Balliol man and he had taken a stunning double first in classics and mathematics. He was obsessed with philology, especially with Sanskrit, the languages of Norway and Finland and the dialects of Iceland. He organized the first army of volunteer readers. He also laid out the first guiding principles of the Dictionary: the discovery of as many historically recorded uses of the words destined for the Dictionary; from a comparison of these uses to find out how each word had been used over time and then to work out which meanings were which and to arrange the Dictionary accordingly. The assumption was that the greater the number of quotations, the more the shades of meaning of a word. But one year into the project, Coleridge died. He was only 31.																														His mantle fell on Frederick James Furnivall, an eccentric of the fullest flower who was an excellent sculler, and under him the project staggered and stalled and nearly died. Furnivall realized his own shortcomings and chose his own successor, James Murray. The choice was inspired. Murray was a lowland Scot, a drapers son who left school at 14 and never went to college because his family could not afford it. But he was omnivorous in his appetite for knowledge and very early in life he wrote on a flyleaf of a magazine he read, knowledge is power. He was a teacher in Mill Hill and a regular at the meetings of the Philological Society, in one of which he made his destiny by remarking to Furnivall, as a throwaway line, that he would like to have a go at the Dictionary.																														Murray was appointed editor and a deal struck with Oxford University Press to publish the Dictionary. Murray did not look behind after that despite the meddling of and opposition from as redoubtable a person as Benjamin Jowett, who was vice-chancellor in the initial period of Murrays editorship. Murray began his work in Mill Hill; he called his work place, a shed in his garden, the Scriptorium. In 1885, the entire enterprise moved to 78, Banbury Road in Oxford, where a second Scriptorium was built. The Royal Mail in a characteristic gesture erected a post box before the house for Murrays convenience.																														The work on the Dictionary became an intellectual marathon that Winchester follows in great detail, including in the process some telling anecdotal detours. Murray gathered on the way some loyal friends  Henry Hucks Gibbs, a philanthropic millionaire who saved the Dictionary when it threatened to go under because of a spat between Murray and Jowett; and invaluable colleagues  Henry Bradley, a remarkable linguist and lexicographer, who became the senior editor, and William Craigie, who finished the first edition in 1928.																														To Winchesters great credit, he spends some time delving into the lives of some of the unsung heroes  the ordinary men and women who wrote in to Murray with words and illustrative quotations. The Dictionary would not have been possible without their tireless efforts. The work carries on under other dedicated men and women.																														The OED stands, as Stanley Baldwin described it, as the greatest enterprise of its kind in history, but it also produced two great literary figures of our times. How many of us knew, before Winchesters research, that J.R.R. Tolkien and Julian Barnes, began their working lives with the great Dictionary?

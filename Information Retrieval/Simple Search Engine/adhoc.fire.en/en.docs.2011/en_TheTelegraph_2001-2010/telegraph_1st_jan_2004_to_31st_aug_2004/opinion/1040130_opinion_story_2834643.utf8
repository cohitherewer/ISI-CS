The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, January 30, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																A gasp is better than silence Death of a discipline (Seagull,  Rs 275) by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak a version  of her Wellek Library Lectures, 2000, is both the last  gasp of a dying discipline and an urgent cry for its resurrection  in a new form. The discipline in question is comparative  literature, and the crisis that Spivak analyses in these  lectures is outlined thus: Publishing conglomerates have  recognized a market for anthologies of world literature  in translation. Academics with large advances are busy putting  these together...Notes and introduction are provided by  a scholar from the area commissioned for the purpose by  the general editor, located in the United States. The market  is international ...Thus institutionalized, this global  education market will need teachers. Presumably, the graduate  discipline of comparative literature will train those teachers. Siege of Mithila (Orbit,   3.75) by Ashok K. Banker is the second book  of a retelling of The Ramayana fantasy fiction, with  bestial demon hordes, hidden dev-astras and the  Mahamantra-Gayatri. Readers have been asked to look  out for Demons of Chitrakut and Armies of Hanuman,  which will follow. He [Rama] thrashed, his naked torso  flayed by invisible lashes. Sweat beaded on his muscled  limbs, dripping through the crushed darbha blades on to  the mud floor of the hut, staining it the dark vermilion  hue of heart-blood.																												The way of the world (Rupa, Rs 295) by Nicolas Bouvier is Robyn Marsacks very readable translation (1992) of an oriental travelogue  somewhere between Rasselas and Sentimental Journey in its mood and tone  written by a charming and well-read Genevan. Travelling outgrows its motives. It soon proves sufficient in itself. You think you are making a trip, but soon it is making  or unmaking  you. Actors, pilgrims, kings and  gods: the Ramlila at Ramnagar (Seagull, Rs 375)  by Anuradha Kapur sets out to examine a particular  popular performance of the story of Rama (as told by the  Ramacharitamanasa) in Ramnagar, the fort town across  the Ganga from Benares. It also reflects on its own narrative  and methodology: I hope to be able to say something about  traditional Indian theatre, about our relation to it, and  about the act of writing about it. Kapur, a professor at  the National School of Drama, presents her study as a thick  description, of an essentially ephemeral communal event,  in the form of a field journal.

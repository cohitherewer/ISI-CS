		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 							 																						SICK TO THE CORE The government claims that the GTB-OBC mer- ger was in depositors interest. But has it served public interest? asks Jayanthi Iyengar				 	 Minus the trust																														The Reserve Bank of Indias resolution of the Global Trust Bank imbroglio  by merging it with the Oriental Bank of Commerce  has been described by some as a happy ending to a horror story. The banking community has heralded the move, depositors have heaved a sigh of relief, while the political leadership has been busy patting itself on the back for having solved the problem promptly. But nothing could be farther away from reality. By forcibly merging a chronically sick bank with a small, compact bank, the government and the RBI have brushed under the carpet some nagging problems of the Indian banking system.																														In a market-driven economy, competition dictates that only the fittest must survive. GTB was a weak bank. And even if half the allegations levelled against it are true, it was guilty of mismanagement, poor governance and fraud. Had GTB been allowed to function like any other enterprise, it would have gone under, instead of contaminating the whole system.																														The government claims that it has safeguarded depositors interest, but has public interest been truly served? The 8 lakh depositors, who hold about Rs 6,000 crore in deposits with GTB, certainly benefited, though their interests, in any case, would have been covered up to Rs 1 lakh through deposit insurance. 																														However, the government has not been able to safeguard the interests of the 16,000 investors in GTB as well as the OBC. Had the GTB-OBC merger been voluntary, GTBs investors would have been eligible for a share swap, which would have compensated them partially for their losses. In OBCs case, the shareholders plight is worse. Just because they chose to buy stock in a public sector bank, they must now face erosion in the value of their holdings. Yet, they cannot even question the merger, because the violator is the government, which has forced a potentially loss-making decision on them without so much as seeking their approval.																														Bankers today wax eloquent on how far the banking industry has come since liberalization. Prudential norms have been tightened, the regulatory framework made stronger, the quality of banking assets and efficiency have improved, and the approach to bank sector reforms has become liberal. Banks have been allowed to downsize and upgrade skills. Bank supervision is being improved and the Indian norms are being brought on par with international standards with the implementation of the Basel Convention. The government has even considered scaling down its holding in nationalized banks below 51 per cent, allowed the entry of private sector banks and permitted investments up to specified levels by foreign investors in the sector.																														However, in spite of this apparent relaxation, the banking sector continues to be throttled in terms of senior level appointments and investment decisions. This gives short shrift to commercial decision-making, the lifeblood of any enterprise.																														Take the OBC-GTB merger. OBC is a strong, north India-based nationalized bank. It would have liked to speed up its growth through the mergers-and-acquisitions route, instead of waiting for organic growth, to upscale its operations. But is unlikely that it would have looked to a sick bank to further its business consolidation. Besides, had it been free, it would never have signed on the dotted line before knowing the correct value of its acquisition. 																														So what does GTBs acquisition mean for OBC? On the positive side  a world-class computerized branch network in the south. On the negative side, it acquires 1,250 employees and related problems of absorbing them into an existing organization. Further, GTBs net losses in 2002-03 are pegged at Rs 272 crore, but off-the-cuff calculations place OBCs cost of acquisition at Rs 650 crore. These calculations assume GTBs total standard assets at Rs 450 crore, and its liabilities at Rs 600 crore. OBC would cover Rs 600 crore of its shortfall through a tax break  which of course, would be paid for by the taxpayers  but the bailout story does not end there. In case OBC is unable to cover the unbridged gap through recovery of GTBs non-performing assets, it would have to absorb the loss on its books.																														That could set the ball rolling for periodic sickness, with the bank being forced to turn to the finance ministry for recapitalization funds. The government could infuse capital when needed, but it would do so from the budget and not from its income such as dividend earnings and disinvestment proceeds. This means that in the long run, every taxpayer may end up paying further for the largesse being doled out to GTBs depositors. Another major beneficiary would be the political leadership, which would gain by enhancing its pro-depositor image.																														Significantly, GTBs merger with the American investment firm, New Bridge Capital, the other contender in the fray, could have changed the contours of the issue. New Bridge has global experience in turning around sick banks. Also, it has the deep pockets needed for such effort. Further, as a commercial operator, the US investor would have let GTB sink, had its efforts failed to yield results. 																														Unfortunately, the RBI has chosen to reject this application because it was not in the name of the principals and the bailout conditions were unacceptable under its guidelines. These are strange reasons. It is not uncommon to find Foreign Investment Promotion Board applications being made in the name of representatives of the foreign investor. Besides, the discounted price quoted by New Bridge is probably the true,commercial value of the ailing bank. 																														However, commercial decision-making is one luxury that is not yet available to Indian banks. In its absence, the stronger banks must grow weak for no fault of theirs, while the taxpayers must foot the bill for government largesse.

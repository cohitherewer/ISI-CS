		 Monday, May 03, 2004 							 																						OPINION MATTERS Uttam Sengupta witnesses a lively debate in the backwaters of Jharkhand and wonders if there could be a bigger proof of Indias throbbing democracy A closer look at politicsHe stood out with his chiselled features, flawless skin, white and even teeth and a bare body. He sat on the ground, holding an antiquated rifle, the trigger tied with a cotton yarn. If it was a lucky day, explained septugenarian Chandro Munda, he would be able to kill a wild boar or a rabbit and feed the family. Otherwise, it would have to be another day of eating wild berries collected by the women. The tiny hamlet on a ridge halfway up the hill to Ulihatu, the birthplace of Birsa Munda, had just five or six families living there. The nearest shop, school or doctor was available at Saiko, some twenty kilometres away at the foothill. 																														Remarkably, in that wilderness, the family not only had themselves photographed but also received the voters identity cards. They seemed confused about their utility but realized that the cards were something important and needed to be preserved. The nearest polling station, they indicated, was at Saiko and it took the better part of the day to reach and return. Was it really necessary to visit the booth, they asked earnestly, wondering if not casting their votes would invite any retaliation from the authorities. They were familiar with only one symbol, the nagara (a tribal drum), and would vote for whichever candidate had been allotted it. On the one hand, Jharkhand appears to have a large number of such marginalized people who neither comprehend nor seem to need a general election. On the other, we discovered that it has an equally large body of educated and aware tribals who take a lively interest in the elections. Both provide vignettes of a flawed but maturing democracy.																														By 9.30 pm, the small town of Lohardaga is generally fast asleep. A few young men lounging around in shorts and unusually quiet dogs apart, there is no sign of life at Lohardaga chowk, where the bypass joins the main road of the town. There is darkness everywhere, and the stillness of the night is punctuated by the drone of diesel generators. It is only Anant Sahs pan shop that seems to be doing brisk business. Sah himself is a bald and jovial character, ever-willing to get into a discussion. Visiting journalists immediately prompt the discussion to veer towards elections and, hold your breath, electoral reforms. One of the pan-chewing men declares that no improvement can be expected unless political parties are forced to name their prospective candidates five years in advance. Immediately after the general elections, he explains, each political party should by law be required to name a panel of three prospective candidates, one of whom would finally be fielded as its candidate in the next election. That, he adds, would put an end to uncertainty and horse-trading. It would provide the electorate a much longer time, five years to be precise, to watch the panelists at work and, finally, it would force all the panelists, including the winning candidate, to be on their toes at all times. 																														The man turned out to be a lawyer practising in the district court but was adamant at not disclosing his name. His name, he declared, did not matter but electoral reforms, he felt, were urgently required to make the imperfect elections more meaningful. Gyan Sahu, a bus conductor, enthusiastically endorsed the view and pointed out that the elected member of parliament from Lohardaga, Dukha Bhagat, had visited the constituency only occasionally during the previous four-and-a-half years. Had the Bharatiya Janata Party announced a panel in 1999, he felt, all the panelists would have remained busy in the constituency and competed with each other. The discussion was getting more animated when we had to leave the men and rush in search of Rameshwar Oraon, the additional director general of police who sought voluntary retirement in order to contest the elections from Lohardaga. 																														We were waiting for the former police officer in semi-darkness when we overheard someone declaring vehemently that he would never ever vote for Dukha Bhagat. The young man turned out to be Phoolchand Oraon, who proudly pointed out that he had represented Bihar in the national under-19 football tournament. He repeated the by-now-familiar charge against the outgoing MP but added a new dimension. Not only was the MP seldom seen in the constituency, he was conspicuous by his absence even on television, he asserted. He had watched the live telecast of proceedings in the Lok Sabha, he explained, but had never seen the Lohardaga MP on the screen, let alone see him raise questions or give speeches. City-slickers might find such transmission a bore but obviously there is a large and discerning viewership out in the countryside.																														We bounced the Lohardaga lawyers suggestion and used party workers as the sounding board. Not many, of course, understood the implications or responded, for that matter. But there were people who sounded enthusiastic and felt the suggestion worth pursuing. A middle-aged man, Jatra Oraon, also a lawyer, said it would not be enough to have the panel. The panel was a good idea, he hastened to add, which would enable the electorate to compare and judge the performance of the respective panels. But it would work, he felt, only if the panelists are paid a reasonable allowance every month. He suggested a payment of Rs 20,000 per month to each panelist for taking care of the family and Rs 10,000 more for travelling, besides free telephone calls. The political parties, he felt, should be made to cough up the money through the Election Commission. His logic was simple. Every parliamentary constituency, he pointed out, had on an average a million voters. Parties which wish to field candidates, he said, should be asked to demonstrate that they have the support of at least one hundred thousand people in the constituency, each willing to contribute one rupee every month. The collection should take care of the needs of the panelists, he felt. 																														But surely the democratic right of people and parties to contest elections cannot be restricted, we suggested. Oraon was not convinced. A system of checks and balances, he felt, had to be built in the system and candidates made more accountable. His off-the-cuff suggestion could of course be fine-tuned but people, he felt, must be involved and made to pay a token amount for the purpose. Under the present system, very often candidates are finalized just three weeks before the polling. Details of their wealth and court cases are let out even later, often not allowing more than a week or ten days for the media and the people to put them under a scanner. 																														A live panel, on the other hand, would help the electorate judge the conduct and performance of the candidates far more closely and for much longer. Whats more, Oraon pointed out, the current fashion of frenzied two-week campaigning will no longer be necessary. The candidates would already be fairly well-known and if political parties opt for a less popular or capable candidate in the panel, the party would merely be exposing itself. Expenses incurred on campaigning too will be greatly reduced.																														The voters clearly have definite views on elections and their representatives. How one wishes that the lawmakers too would share the peoples vision and passion for reforms.

		 Friday, June 25, 2004 							 																						SPREADING THE WORD THE RAMAYANA IN INDONESIA By Malini Saran and Vinod C. Khanna, Ravi Dayal, Rs 900There are many myths surrounding the legend of Rama in south and south-east Asia. Although it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when a particular story travelled to Indonesia, it is clear that the Ramayana spread to these areas over many centuries.																														In the opening chapter of this book, the authors, Malini Saran and Vinod C. Khanna, depict the journey of the epic to Indonesia from a historical perspective and its role in Indias cultural penetration into Indonesia, and talk about the many variations of the Ramayana in India itself. The influence of Indian culture epitomized by the art of writing, Sanskrit language and literature, religious philosophies, political organization and legal norms, architectural and sculptural techniques had left an indelible impact on Indonesia by the mid-nineteenth century. The stage was thus set for the unfolding of the magnificent Indonesian chapter in the story of the Ramayana.																														The very first telling of the Ramayana appeared in Central Java, in the language of stone. It was sculpted into the balustrades of two temples that stand in the innermost courtyard of a temple complex, locally known as Lara Jonggrang  a unique phenomenon which gives a complete pictorial representation of the epic.																														Although it originated in India, the Ramayana was remarkably popular in Indonesia. In fact, the epic was symptomatic of the diversity of Indian culture and its journey to Indonesia caused a watershed in the intellectual and religious churning of the country in a peaceful manner. Indonesians chose those elements of Indian culture that appealed to them and then went on to put on them the imprint of their own aesthetic and ethical values. What emerged was a social fabric enriched by both the local and imported cultural traits.																														Between the late tenth and the fifteenth centuries, the Ramayana continued to influence the literature and culture of east Java. The epic also adapted itself within Islamic stories in the country. In the twentieth century, technological innovations, political movements and the communication revolution brought about profound changes in Indonesia. Despite these changes, the Ramayana has maintained a distinctive hold on the cultural landscapes of Java and Bali. 																														Malini and Khanna argue that the epic has been perceived as a rich source of the principles of ethics and statecraft in Indonesia for centuries. These were foundational values, going beyond the dogmas of any particular religion and transcended the Hindu-Muslim divide.																														The chief characters in the Ramayana were so popular that they became role models. Rama was recognized as an enlightened and just ruler. And Hanumans popularity in Indonesia can only be matched by the gods fame in India. All these facts point to the timeless appeal of both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Fittingly enough, the tale of Rama has become inextricably linked with Indonesias dance and drama. In fact, the two epics remain a rich source for performing arts in both Java and Bali.

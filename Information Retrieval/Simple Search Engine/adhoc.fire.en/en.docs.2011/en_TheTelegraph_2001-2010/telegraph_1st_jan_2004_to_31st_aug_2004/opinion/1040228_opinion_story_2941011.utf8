The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, February 28, 2004 							 																						PENN																													AGAINST THE																													SWORD He didnt bother to show up the last three times he was nominated. If Sean Penn does so this Oscar night, it will only be to shoot down the Iraq war one more time 																														The bad-boy brat-packs original member is too cool to dust his tux for the Oscars. Sean Penn didnt bother showing up the last three times he was nominated so why should he stomp on the red carpet this time? Only to be told, he is too random/radical/ rough to caress that smoothie of a statue? Huh? (Cigarette dangling dangerously, meanwhile.) Its like, so stupid to flash breasts and buff in front of crazed paparazzi.																														So Irish of him to diss them every time. Never miss an opportunity to dump on the Academy. Capital A, remember. Narrow blue eyes, piercing, stabbing straight through the pomp and fakery, the designer orgies, the mega hype to speak the mind. Capital M, remember. Man, there is a war going on out there in Iraq and here is a bunch of pretty and empty, pretty empty mannequins getting ready to salute themselves in between trashy music  again pretty but no soul. 																														But THEY cant avoid nominating him  he gave them a double whammy with Mystic River and 21 Grams  roles that even the establishment press is raving about. One of the definitive pieces of screen acting in the last half-century, the New York Times critic gushed about Clint Eastwoods study of loyalty and revenge in Mystic River. Penn has already got the Golden Globe for it. He wasnt there to accept it though. Typical?																														He is pitched against two other bad boys  Bill Murray (Lost in Translation) and Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) for best actor.																														Breathless betting is on whether Penn will break the jinx. American critics are cheerleading for him but across the Atlantic, he strikes them as overrated. A British smarty wants him to face some kind of International Acting Crimes Tribunal for his hand-me-down De Niro schtick in Mystic River. Our Sean sure arouses strong feelings. Politics or acting, take your pick.																														Baghdad Sean is too weighed down by the contradictions of his governments Mad Max rampage through Iraq. Hey, he even put his money where his thin-lipped mouth is  paid $56,000 to take out a full-page ad in The Washington Post  yes, that rah-rah war broadsheet  to record his opposition to George Bush and his war. Paid more for an open letter in the New York Times, that other history-recording one. Then our man went to Baghdad to meet the people we were going to bomb. They too have kids like we do.																														The Academy didnt like that either. Too much politics, the wrong kind especially, will not make Sean a good boy. Last year he and two other Irish actors  Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin  were warned not to make political statements from that glittering podium. They would risk being kicked out of Hollywood. So he didnt attend. The actors top Hollywoods hush-hush hit list. The right-wing pantheon ruling America these days has its paws into every part of society. Suggestions have been made to deny Penn-like men the right to work. He lost his role in Why Men Shouldnt Marry because of his views on Iraq. He is suing the producer. 																														Want some Internet citizen reaction on Sean making the scene in Baghdad? Rich, spoiled, punk traitor, the illegitimate son of Jane Fonda  get the idea? Remember the Academy represents the masses. Duh! When someone asked Sean about his deficit in patriotism, the man, now matured into his own De Niro, said: The accusations about my lack of patriotism  I could smell that coming a mile away, way before I went to Iraq. You know ahead of time if youre being manipulated. My eyes were pretty well open. So why did he go?																														If there was a single mission I had, it was Okay, I know there are kids in Iraq just like my kids. I just need to see them before I confirm all of the things I feel weve been lied to about. Such as the absent connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein and Iraq sitting on nuclear weapons. But these days he is feeling pretty vindicated, now that Bush and Co. have modified original claims about the lurking stockpiles.																														He went back last December and wrote his impressions for the hometown paper, San Francisco Chronicle. It was 10,000 words about people he had met on his earlier trip to see how they were faring.																														Sean Penn, a journalist? An opinion- maker? Darn, get ready for another bout of body-slashing tirades on Fox News, the patriotic channel always out to spot betrayers like him. His father, Leo Penn, was on the notorious Hollywood blacklist of communist sympathisers way back in the Fifties and Sixties. Sean has the same genes. He even moved out of Hollywoods best real estate to plant his family in the more real San Francisco area. He has been married to Robyn Wright, an actress, since 1996 and has two kids. 																														At 43, Penns youthful scrawniness has given way to a taut masculinity. The former hellraiser is maturing well. Once he was even married to Madonna and there were allegations of physical assault. He has served 23 days in jail for hitting a man on the sets and breaking parole. But he has come a long way from his hey, dude launch in the 1982 Fast Times at Ridgemont High, a film that made the surfer boy, California cool mainstream. Then came Carlitos Way, Casualties of War, The Falcon, Dead Man Walking and I am Sam and fame. Capital F, remember. 																														If the Academy declines again to honour the rebel with a cause, will he wait for one of those kiss-and-make-up thingies at age 80? He might make it for lifetime achievement, or versatility, or commitment to the art motion picture (big music again).																														Now Sean, dont you go showing up in your tux for the big f****** night.

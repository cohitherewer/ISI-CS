		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 							 																						SING ALONG																														Mr Manmohan Singh is not even his own first choice as the prime minister of a Congress-led coalition government. This is not a comment either on his ability or on his stature. The paradox is only explained by the dizzying heights of popularity that Ms Sonia Gandhi has touched within the Congress. Mr Singhs sudden elevation to Indias top job is the outcome of Ms Gandhis dramatic act of renunciation. Mr Singh has been Ms Gandhis cup-bearer for a very long time, and it is entirely fitting that he should sit on the chair which was Ms Gandhis if she had wanted it. Mr Singhs credentials to be Indias prime minister are impeccable. He was a good student, an outstanding bureaucrat and without doubt the best finance minister India has ever had. Mr Singhs career has followed a remarkable path of self-improvement: at each important stage he has bettered his previous record. Thus, it will surprise no one if his tenure as prime minister brings to him fresh laurels. Mr Singh is too familiar with the corridors of power to be inhibited by what is said about him in hushed tones and behind closed doors. He knows, as does everybody save the wicked and the prejudiced, that his personal integrity is beyond question. This is a rare quality among Indian politicians and not all previous prime ministers were quite so unimpeachable. Mr Singhs personal qualities, it will be hoped, will raise the moral tone of the government he will make and lead.																														The job Mr Singh comes to will, however, demand more than certain personal qualities. He has to lead a motley coalition that will pull in different directions. His own party will tend to treat him as a regent rather than the real ruler. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the sangh parivar will inevitably be an unruly opposition within and without parliament. Apart from managing all this, Mr Singh has the task of pushing through economic reforms and of maintaining Indias global image. Economic reforms, of which Mr Singh is the father, have earned a bad name because they are perceived as being anti-poor. The previous dispensation has only strengthened this perception. Mr Singh has to overcome this and reinstate what he once called reforms with a human face. In 1991-92, as finance minister, Mr Singh held the destiny of India in his hands. Then expectations were spiralling downwards. Now, as prime minister, he has to refashion Indias destiny to meet rising expectations. India expects  what is more, even Mr Singh expects  that the new prime minister will over-fulfil the trust that has been reposed in him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, January 05, 2004 							 																						FUNNY BANDH																								It takes a special kind of humour to find bandhs funny. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was seized with a sense of the absurd when contemplating the latest form of political action being planned by his opponent, Ms Mamata Banerjee. The leader of the Trinamool Congress, according to the chief minister, has suddenly woken up one morning and called a Bangla bandh. The indomitable life of this local speciality has now become somewhat mythical in Bengal. Ms Banerjee is perhaps best suited to turning it now into a rather low joke. The Calcutta high court has tried, in vain, to lend the matter some seriousness, from a point of view that is purely civic, and hence above party-political wrangles. But both the Left Front and the Trinamool Congress have protested against such a curb on their rights of expression, no matter how it affects ordinary human lives. Now, Ms Banerjee has threatened another bout of disruptions because of a series of supposedly anti-people taxes. What Mr Bhattacharjee finds ridiculous about the whole thing is that these taxes have not even been officially levied yet. So Ms Banerjees bandh is nothing but the most comic shadow-boxing, on the basis of an old circular issued years ago. 																								Although projected as political protest, it is significant that this bandh has been egged on by the mayor of Calcutta  presumably to give Ms Banerjee and her cadre something to do and thereby win back her favour. The mayors brazen unconcern for the daily lives of Calcuttans, coupled with Ms Banerjees unhinged notions of protest, certainly prevents the nuisance levels in Bengals politics from flagging. Also kept up is the morale of the cadre, which must be engaged in dharnas, rallies, road-blocks and so on. The chief minister finds this particular bandh funny, but carefully does not say anything against bandhs per se. His answer to Ms Banerjee has nothing to do with principles or legality. A form of protest that amuses him today might suddenly become indispensable tomorrow.

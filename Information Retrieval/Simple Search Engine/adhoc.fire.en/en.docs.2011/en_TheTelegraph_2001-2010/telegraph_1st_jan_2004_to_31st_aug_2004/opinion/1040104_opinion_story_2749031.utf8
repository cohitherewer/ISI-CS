		 Sunday, January 04, 2004  FOG OVER THE CAPITAL
 							 - Planting rice in Punjab is like working against Nature Stuck at the airport? Be prepared for a long wait. And thank the greening of Delhi for your woes. G.S. Mudur reports Morning blues: A  train forced to halt due to heavy fog in Amritsar on  Thursday (PTI) 																								Its best seen from space and worst experienced on the ground. From its position 36,000 kilometres above the equator, Indias weather satellite, Kalpana, sees a milky-white shroud stretching from Punjab across the Gangetic plain to the eastern fringes of Bihar. Its the winter fog over northern India. 																								For air traffic controllers at Delhis international airport, the shroud is a stress-booster, causing misery to these anxious watchers as they stack Delhi-bound aircraft in the skies over the capital, each separated by 1,000 feet. One Boeing-747 flying in from a European city last week, controllers say, circled the capital for nearly four hours. When the fog shrinks visibility on the runway to less than 200 metres, there is nothing pilots can do but circle and wait, circle and wait, or fly their planes off to unintended destinations.																								In cities across the plains, the blinding fog produces traffic snarls and, elsewhere, superfast trains slow down as the billowing fog hugs railway tracks. The fog might be delaying countless appointments, pushing up the nations fuel bills and denying vital sunlight to winter crops. But it has also emerged as the most significant perceived weather change during winters across northern India in recent times. 																								With the fog persisting longer than before, scientists are scrambling to seek out clues to decipher this trend. But the answers that tumble out might be hard to digest.																								Weather scientists have been puzzled by the sharply growing number of days that dawn with dense fog during winter months in northern India in recent years. While pollution has long been blamed for the fog, there are now concerns that other human activities may also have had a hand in northern Indias ongoing winter fog woes. Specifically, Indias insatiable hunger for rice, and intensive campaigns to green pockets of northern India may also be key factors contributing to the growth and persistence of fog. Agricultural and meteorological scientists say that the decades-old changes in cultivation and irrigation patterns in northern India as well as efforts to plant trees and boost forest cover in the region may be hitherto unrecognised causes of the recent behaviour of fog.																								The growing persistence of fog might be an inadvertent, unforeseen consequence of human activity, says Uday Shankar De, former additional director general of research at the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune. At the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, Sukhdev Singh Hundal, professor of agricultural meteorology, believes that the fog trends are associated with increasing moisture in the atmosphere. Farming practices across Punjab, Haryana have altered the ecosystem by pumping in more moisture than there was earlier, says Hundal.																								It was IMDs De who sounded the alarm two years ago by conducting the first-ever nationwide investigation of trends in winter visibility over Indias airports. Until then, other IMD scientists had studied visibility trends only at a few airports. De picked 25 of the nations busiest airports and scanned decades-old meteorological records and discovered that for some reasons, visibility over most airports in western, northern and central India had steadily deteriorated over decades. Many northern Indian airports used to have just about seven days of poor visibility during the winter months of December, January and February during the 1970s. Des analysis revealed that in many of these airports, including Amritsar, Delhi, Varanasi, and Patna, the number of days with poor visibility had gone up to between 60 and 80 days during the winter season.																								The frequency and extent of fog have increased over the past five years or so, but there is no significant change in the weather, says Laxman Singh Rathore, advisor at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, New Delhi. Non-meteorological factors are probably contributing to the trends were observing, he says. Industrial and traffic emission containing tiny particles are one long-known factor. Water vapour in the atmosphere condenses on these tiny particles to produce fog. But extensive irrigation has pumped extra moisture into the atmosphere.																								Increasing vegetation and forest cover might also add moisture to the atmosphere that could end up as fog in the winter season. The latest state of Indias forest report indicates a substantial increase in the area under forests and tree cover across the northern plains. Delhis green cover has increased from 22 square kilometres in 1993 to 88 square kilometres in 1999. Delhis forest officials say that if trees along the citys roads are also taken into account, the area under tree cover goes up to nearly 150 square kilometres. In neighbouring Haryana too, the forest cover has gone up from 513 square kilometres to 964 square kilometres in the same period.																								There are two ways through which enhanced vegetation could contribute to fog. The roots of trees extract moisture from the soil and their leaves spew it into the air through a natural process called evapotranspiration. More trees means that more moisture will be thrown into the air, says Brij Bhushan, director of satellite meteorology at the IMD, New Delhi. Trees also serve as wind breakers and tend to keep wind speeds low, says De, the former IMD official. And very light winds, somewhere between 2 and 4 kilometres an hour, are required for fog formation.																								More trees may also increase pollen grains in the atmosphere upon which water vapour can condense to form fog. In support of the possible link between fog and vegetation, De also points out that Calcutta was one of four airports among the 25 he had studied where winter visibility has actually improved over the past several decades. The others were Hyderabad, Pune and Trivandrum. 																								In Calcutta, the area near the airport used to have lots of marshy land with dense vegetation. It has been cleared for construction and, with the marshland and vegetation gone, the moisture has also reduced, says De.																								Forest officials acknowledge a growth in forest cover, but deny that it has anything to do with fog. Forest and tree cover growth has been driven by artificial plantations of eucalyptus, poplar and shisham trees that have emerged as popular sources of timber for the wood industry, says Jagdish Rawat, director of the Forest Survey of India, Dehra Dun. In fact, more of the timber for industry now comes from commercial plantations than from forests. There is certainly an increase in forest cover, but it is not so drastic that it should affect local climate, says Rawat. Irrigated soil is a far greater contributor to surface moisture.																								Just how much moisture is being added by irrigation is becoming clear from the studies of Hundal at the PAU, Ludhiana, whos picked up new pieces of the puzzle by studying relative humidity, which essentially means the measure of moisture in the air. High moisture content and low temperatures are necessary for the formation of fog. By analysing patterns of relative humidity from 1962 through 2002, Hundal and his colleagues have found that the relative humidity in central Punjab has increased by 10 to 15 per cent over the decades. During the winter months, the relative humidity is above 90 per cent which is highly conducive to fog formation, says Hundal. The PAU researchers believe that the introduction of rice in Punjab during the 1970s and 1980s has contributed to the increasing moisture.																								Planting rice in Punjab is like working against Nature, says Hundal. Rice grows best in soils with heavy texture and in areas where there is plenty of water. But Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana, where rice cultivation has also increased significantly over the decades, have loose-textured soil and are relatively drier states than the traditional rice-growing areas such as Andhra Pradesh or West Bengal. 																								But, with favourable government policies, farmers beginning in the 1970s started to plant rice between April and October. In Punjab alone, the area under rice shot up from a few thousand hectares in the 1960s to 2.5 million hectares by the early 1990s. Since then, the area under rice has stagnated.																								But along with rice cultivation, the vast network of irrigation canals that has sprung up across the region might also serve as a source of moisture which condenses into fog during winter. Canal lengths have grown by tens of thousands of kilometres over the past several decades. In Uttar Pradesh alone, it is estimated that some 3,000 kilometres of canals were added between 1972 and 1986. The canals have also helped the spread of surface moisture to what where previously dry areas while extracting groundwater further adds to surface moisture.																								Scientists say that the growth in relative humidity could mean that fogs would persist in the years to come. But, as with other things in weather, we cant be certain about this, says Hundal. But efforts to reverse at least one factor that boosted moisture levels in northwestern India are already under way. At the PAU, agricultural experts are urging farmers to shift from rice to alternative crops that do not need as much water as does paddy. 																								Not because scientists are worried about fog, but because they are worried about the long-term consequences of squeezing out decreasing groundwater. Moving away from rice is a top priority for Punjab, says Govinder Singh Nanda, director of research at PAU. 																								At Delhi airport, air traffic controllers say theyve got used to fog. The instrument landing system, which allows pilots to land and take off during poor visibility, allows planes to land only when runway visibility is at least 200 metres, says Air Traffic Controllers Guild president Ramendra Singh. But 70 per cent of time during the fog, visibility is below 200 metres and planes can neither take off nor land, says Singh.																								 Airport authorities might as well take calls from companies vending zero-visibility landing systems.

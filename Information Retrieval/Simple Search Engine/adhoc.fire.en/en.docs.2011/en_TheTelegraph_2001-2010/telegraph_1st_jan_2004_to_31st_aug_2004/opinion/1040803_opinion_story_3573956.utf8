		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 							 																						EASTWARD HO																														The idea of economics driving other aspects of state policy is by no means a new one. The frost of age has not been able to remove the controversy that surrounds it. Most policy-makers, especially those mandarins who make foreign policy, fight shy of contaminating their noble aims and objectives by the touch of economics tar. These mandarins claim that their decisions are always driven by strategic considerations. This is one reason why Indias policy towards countries in the East has always floundered. Initially, the East suffered from salutary neglect as Indian foreign policy looked to Moscow to counter-balance the threat of the dragon and the ploys of Uncle Sam in south Asia. India awoke to the importance of the Far East only in the early Nineties. That this new interest surfaced only as India was taking its first steps towards a liberalized economic regime was no coincidence. Rather it was entirely logical. It is fitting therefore that an agreement between India and Thailand allowing for free trade in 82 items should be spearheaded by the pioneer of Indias economic reforms, the present prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh.																														In this context, the renaming of Bimstec as a Bay of Bengal community is of little or no relevance. This community, or whatever name is used to describe it, can work to Indias advantage only if it is driven by economic priorities. It cannot be successful if India sees it as a forum in which it will score points over Pakistan. Thus the thinly-veiled joy in Raisina Hill at having excluded Pakistan might prove to be short-lived. The phrase economic priorities should perhaps be explained. It is used to suggest further liberalization of the Indian economy, and at greater speed. It means a greater opening up to global economic trends. This will force India to look beyond the Bay of Bengal to the Pacific rim and bigger economic players in the global market. The Bay of Bengal community should be made to flourish not as a community based on geographical contiguity but as a community pursuing common economic goals based on the logic of free trade. India should provide leadership to this. The effectiveness of Indias leadership will depend on Indias own abilities to further liberalize its economic regime and to post a higher rate of economic growth. Economic success in the East will depend on success at home.

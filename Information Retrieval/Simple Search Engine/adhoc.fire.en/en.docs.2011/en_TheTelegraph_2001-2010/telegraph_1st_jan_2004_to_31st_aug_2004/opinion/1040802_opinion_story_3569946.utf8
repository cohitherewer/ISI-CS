The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 02, 2004 							 																						FIRST FLIGHT 																														The shows of loyalty at airports are symbolic of a political culture that has not yet rid itself of memories of kings and feudal lords. As a result, the head of the executive is vested with associations of the beneficent patron, whose smiles and frowns will determine the political fates of those around him. There is something particularly undignified about such shows, yet such is the inversion of values rendered traditional by use, that dignity is perceived to increase by the spectacle of government officials and ministers doing obeisance. These officious ceremonies have two functions. At one level, they are held as indicators of the power of the leader who is being seen off or welcomed. At another, it is a form of political game-playing. They provide the curious observer with material for speculation as to who is in and who is out  and who is about to trip up. Quite clearly, Mr Singh thought that he could well do without these trappings. A strict adherence to protocol would not only be sufficient, it might also suggest, however distantly, the presence of a lean, sensible and efficient government.																														The Congress chief did not seem to disagree, but it is equally clear that she did not fully agree either. Mr Singhs route had to be changed to accommodate the send-off that Ms Gandhi had planned for him. She must have had her reasons. Although her style is unfussy too, she must have felt the need of some ritual, even if it was for the prime ministers first trip. But whatever the signal and whomever she meant it for, it got a little crossed with the prime ministers communiqu. Mr Singhs own wishes, if carried out in the future, would be an immensely good thing for the political culture of the country. And if such an instruction leads to a few more, about the ceremonial presence of senior leaders at disaster spots, for example, or at the inauguration of what would normally have been routine development projects, politicians and local representatives may even begin to behave sensibly.

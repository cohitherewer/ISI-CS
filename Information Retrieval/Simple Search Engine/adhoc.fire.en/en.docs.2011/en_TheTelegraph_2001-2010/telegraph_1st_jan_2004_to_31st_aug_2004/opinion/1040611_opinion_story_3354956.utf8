				 	 Man of lettersAcross time and continents: A tribute to Victor G. Kiernan Edited by Prakash Karat, LeftWord, Rs 450Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Victor Kiernan, a lifelong communist and a Marxist historian, cried out at a seminar in Los Angeles that his entire life had been spent in vain. This lament was surprising and shocking because Kiernan is an imaginative historian with a wide range of interests. Obviously, he thought that the survival of the oppressive Soviet regime was more important than his work as a historian. Kiernans links with south Asia are very close. He taught in Lahore and is fluent in Urdu. He translated Faiz and Iqbal, and had many friends in India. In Britain, he was a part of the Historians Group of the Communist Party where, along with Christopher Hill, Rodney Hilton and Eric Hobsbawm, he initiated new approaches to the writing of British history. This volume brings together some of Kiernans writings. The tone of the introduction is a little short of worshipful. Kiernan had the rare gift of using literature to light up historical analyses. In fact, many of his friends believed that literature was his first love and he always wanted to write a book on Shakespeare. Many of the essays in this volume, especially those on Marx and India, appear dated now. Kiernan was a Marxist who could not get around to accepting the analysis of the Indian historians who were critical of the British rule in India.Infamous deadGenghis khan: Life, death and resurrection By John Man, Bantam, pound;8.50Genghis Khan probably ruled over the greatest empire in history, greatest in terms of the geographical area his suzerainty covered. He was, in his time, the most feared man in the world. He murdered millions, besides established a legal code in which having a bath was a capital offence. This narrative of his life traces his career from the time he was a fugitive teenager to the time he became an emperor. In a sense, he had a life beyond death. When he died in 1227, his successors kept his death a secret and since that time, mystery has never forsaken the great Khan. His grave still remains undiscovered, and it is said that he was buried along with the huge treasure he had accumulated. John Man brings to the biography a contemporary flavour. Man has travelled extensively in Mongolia and China and uses his experiences to illuminate Genghiss lasting influence on the people and society of these regions. Man claims that he is the first writer to have entered the valley in which his subject may have died and is among the handful of Westerners to have climbed the sacred mountain where he may have been buried. This is a wonderful historical biography, gripping and racy. Into a lost worldFrom Pluralism to Separatism: Qasbas in Colonial Awadh By Mushirul Hasan, Oxford, Rs 650This book uses the histories of families to illustrate and analyse a rich social and cultural context. This makes the book somewhat unique in Indian historiography. The chosen family is that of the Kidwais of Bara Banki. Hasan thus shifts the focus of analysis from Lucknow, the favourite of historians, to the small rurban settlements in the outskirts of the Awadhi capital and the centre of adabi culture. Hasan captures a vanishing culture which was nurtured through patronage and supported by extensive land-holding. The result is a most enlightening book.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 12, 2004 							 																						SAVAGE CITY																														It does not require a lurid imagination to think of Calcutta as a necropolis. An efficient machinery for killing people quickly and savagely runs on its streets with impunity. And this machinery is sustained by a network of individuals and civic bodies, which, in any other civilized city, exists to make life safer and more convenient. Two private buses, racing each other in defiance of traffic lights, killed Firoz Ahmed and Yasmeen Begum a few days ago. An average of 460 people die of such behaviour on the streets of Calcutta every year. More than thirty people have died last month. After almost every such incident, public rage with these buses and their drivers is given equally savage expression. But what is most outrageous about this phenomenon is that almost none of these killer drivers has been convicted in the last few years. Indian laws, the motor vehicles department, the bus owners and their syndicate, and the traffic police form a bizarre protective network that allows these drivers to get back behind the wheels almost immediately after each accident. There are drivers who have killed up to seven people still running private buses  with their brazen sense of their own immunity to punishment nurtured by the system they are part of.																														These drivers and their helpers have no proper salary. Their earnings depend on the number of passengers they pick up during the day; hence, the racing. The penal code makes their offence a bailable one, and the motor vehicles department can be bribed easily by bus owners to issue certificates of mechanical failure, which help to let the drivers off. Most of them have two or three licences, forged or with different addresses, none of which are sent to the police for verification by the motor vehicles department. So, if one licence is permanently confiscated, then they simply use another once they are out on bail. And so the killings continue. What is most terrifying is the casualness with which these drivers talk about bumping people off: it is part of their job, and that too a badly paid one, so it is perfectly all right to make sure that they make the most of it. Besides, it is easy to slip out of the bus and mingle with the crowd and throw a stone or two at their own bus in order to escape the violence of the mob after an accident. Upsetting of the traffic flow by new flyovers, narrower and badly maintained pavements, and inadequate policing all make the situation worse. But only a radical change in the attitude and behaviour of the drivers can make an actual difference. This is only possible if they feel less protected in their criminality and stop thinking of themselves as a deprived lot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 							 																						SMALL WORLD																														A political party becomes relevant only if it sees a role for itself in the society at large. A party that cannot see beyond its narrow, partisan interests is little better than an organization revelling in an esoteric cult. Even after receiving a bigger mandate in these elections, the left in general and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in particular have behaved like claustrophobic groups that are both unsure and uneasy about their place in society. The lefts decision to stay away from a Congress-led government at the Centre is flawed on the simplest political logic. These parties fought the elections which were to decide who would wield power in New Delhi. Even if the left could not hope to attain power on its own, it had promised to the people to play its role in the formation of a secular government. But now the left seems unable to cope with the unambiguous verdict that the people gave in favour of its role in such a government. This clearly is a betrayal of the public mandate and no amount of rhetoric can quite cover it. No matter how the likes of the CPI(M) politburo member, Mr Sitaram Yechuri, try to spin endless yarns of sophistry, there is no escaping from the public perception that the left is shirking the responsibility it had promised to shoulder. Worse, while it shies away from the responsibility, it wants to enjoy power through the backdoor. 																														It cannot be anyones case that it was an easy decision for the CPI(M) or other left parties, which have fought the Congress for decades and still have major differences with the latter, particularly on economic policies. Even the argument of possible differences with the Congress on economic issues is only a subterfuge. In Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has shown how far the party has moved away from its earlier anti-reform positions. And to argue that cohabiting with the Congress would undermine its bases in West Bengal, Kerala or Tripura is to abdicate a bigger role for the sake of partisan politics. The Marxists, who never tire of talking about managing contradictions, should have seen their opportunity in a coalition government led by the Congress. The fear of confronting a coalitions inevitable contradictions seemed enough to force them to retreat into their little world of rhetoric. There is a more fundamental point that the lefts decision raises. Its fear is actually a symptom of the lefts inability to live in a world other than its own. A democratic society survives on compromises and adjustments so that a hundred flowers may bloom. The left seems still at odds with democratic values.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 19, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Model does not fit				 																																																				Sir  Bharat Bhushans idea of the 2004 general elections as a test of managerial expertise for the parties will find many takers among the educated middle-class voters of the country (Just grab it, March 18). If political parties, be it the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party, were committed to a vision for India, elections would have been an entirely different affair. Bharat Bhushan cites the example of the BJP hiring market research agencies to devise custom-made strategies for each constituency in every state. The indication is towards India going the way of America, where image-consultants determine how many infants a candidate must cuddle. The question is not whether India should aspire to be like the United States of America, as it is perceived in the post-September 11 world. The question is whether, Indias poverty, illiteracy and lack of basic amenities remaining constant, it is correct to apply a first-world model to it, and expect the model to work.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,K.N. Ghoshal, Calcutta
				 																Reign of terror				 																																																				Sir  The alacrity with which the people of Spain dismissed Jos Maria Aznar and replaced him with the Socialist Partys Jos Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, proves that the people of those countries supporting the American intervention in Iraq have always suspected that the war was brought about by ruse and subterfuge (Lies dont win, March 17). The reason that inspired the regime change in Spain had also been responsible for prompting the terrorist strike  Spains decision to join George W. Bush and Tony Blair. 				 																																																				The United States of America is a past master at promoting violence and manipulating economics to achieve regime changes all over the world. What both Bush and Blair do not realize now is that as in Spain, they may also have to face the wrath of their disgruntled people who have been subjected to the worst form of deception. The loss of human life, be it in Spain and the US, or Afghanistan and Iraq is reprehensible. Violene has to be stopped, and at the earliest.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai

				 																																																				Sir  The electoral debacle in Spain is one of the first cases in recent times where international terrorism has played such an important role in directing the political outcome of a nation. There is no doubt that the timing of the attack, days before the national elections, was planned out precisely to influence the election results.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prashant Solomon, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The killing of innocent people to teach the Spanish government a lesson may not fetch the desired results for terrorist groups (US sees Qaida hand in Spain March 16). What if George W. Bush persuades the new government to retain its troops in Iraq?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R.Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The bomb blasts in Madrid were an act of desperation on the part of suspected Islamic fundamentalists against those they perceive as infidels. In Spains case, its participation in the occupation of Iraq was what had prompted the attack. As the editorial, State of terror (March 14), rightly pointed out, it is difficult to break the vicious cycle of terrorism and counter-insurgency, for Spain will now implement its own kind of war against insurgents within its borders. Yet the fanatics who perpetrated the crime against their own people are ordinary people with jobs and families. Spain, like the other countries battling the scourge of terrorism, must realize that the menace cannot be put down by counter-terror. Terrorism is rooted in social, economic and political inequalities. To prevent recurrence of such violence, the modern state has to ensure that the weaker sections of society do not feel discriminated against.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K. Basu, Calcutta

				 																Ways to function				 																																																				Sir  It is encouraging to note that senior bureaucrats like Kamal Pande are beginning to acknowledge that something is amiss in government offices (Something rotten in babuland, Feb 26). But malpractices have existed in the bureaucracy for a long time. So the present government alone should not come under fire. Bureaucrats should have long appreciated the wisdom in the adage, as you sow, so you reap. One can hope that some good comes of Pandes realization. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chandan Keshri, Barakar

				 																																																				Sir  Total disregard for merit has diluted the quality of work in government offices. Thankfully, the authorities are doing a rethink (Bid to boost babu morale, Feb 4). The proposal to prioritize merit over seniority and to make promotions more transparent are steps in the right direction. Biased confidential reports, political interference and nepotism have done irreparable harm to the civil services. Given the prevailing work ethics and the quality of workers, it is ridiculous to think of introducing modern management methods. The morale of the competent and talented among the bureaucrats can be boosted by a change in the system of performance appraisal and cleansing the recruiting agencies like the public service commissions and the central staff selection commission.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Indrajit Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																Class act				 																																																				Sir  Shane Warne made history when he became the first spinner to take 500 wickets in test cricket (Great effort by Shane: Walsh, March 14). The success, after the one-year ban, is not unexpected of a cricketer who has made a name for himself for his unconventional ways. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Leg-spin is now considered a dying art. It is good to have someone like Shane Warne to rekindle interest in it.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Atanu Haldar, Calcutta

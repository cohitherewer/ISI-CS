		 Sunday, August 22, 2004 							 																						VISION ON THE MOVE																														Historians are in conflict about how an individual should be judged: by his achievements or by his vision. The question becomes even more charged when the individual concerned did not live to complete the Biblical quota of years  three score and ten. Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in the prime of his life and his political career. Even his critics will agree that he had a vision for India. His achievements and his realization of that vision were often circumscribed by circumstances. He sometimes had to compromise his vision with the compulsions of politics. But on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, his vision, more than his achievements, seems to be more significant for the nation and for the Congress which is in the process of rejuvenating and refashioning itself. Despite the shadow that falls between Rajiv Gandhis vision and his achievements, there is one thing that he accomplished that is of lasting influence in Indian politics. He separated ideology from the politics of decision-making at the level of governance. For him, at all levels of public life what counted was merit, merit of an individual or the merit of a particular proposal. He did not allow ideological preoccupations to colour his judgment. Under him, for the first time in Indian public life, policies were adopted on the basis of their professional merit rather than of their ideological assumptions. The implication of this was far-reaching enough for even Mr L.K. Advani to admit that governance is about merit and not about ideology.																														Rajiv Gandhi was a prime minister with his eyes trained on the future. He was helped by the fact that many of the ideas he promulgated were already gaining global currency. Rajiv Gandhi carried India into the world of information technology. He recognized its importance and was far-sighted enough to see that India would be a perpetual laggard if it did not embrace the technology. When he became prime minister, the idea that an STD call was as easy as a local call was a pipe dream as was the world of email and internet. Today most villages have access to STD and even the smallest town boasts a cybercafe. The technological revolution is by no means complete in India, but India is not oustide its ambit.																														Rajiv Gandhis mind was above the petty bickerings of here and now. The Congress, leading the present government, carries his mantle. It should try to free itself from petty preoccupations and focus on the future. In politics, the present is always shoddy, the future carries the dreams. Mr Manmohan Singh must appreciate that he is the repository of many of the dreams of the late Rajiv Gandhi. It is in Rajiv Gandhis dreams that Mr Singhs responsibilities begin. This is the most important message for the prime minister on Rajiv Gandhis sixtieth birthday. The challenge and the responsibilities are not easy, but without them, politics would be useless.

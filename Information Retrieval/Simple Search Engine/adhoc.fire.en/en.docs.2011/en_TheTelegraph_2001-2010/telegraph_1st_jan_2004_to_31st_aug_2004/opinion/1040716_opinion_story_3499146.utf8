		 Friday, July 16, 2004 							 																						LOTS OF SAND																														It was a series of mistakes, but nobody in particular seems to have made them. So it must be everybodys fault. This is the astonishing conclusion of the Butler committee report on the use of intelligence by the British government before the Iraq war. This is the fourth inquiry of this kind in Britain after the war, and its remit was the widest. Lord Hutton was not allowed to look beyond David Kellys suicide. And Mr Blair was rather pleased to be told that Downing Street had not driven Kelly to his death. This time, too, Lord Butler has allowed Mr Blair to declare in parliament that no one had lied about those weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. (Lord Butler is also believed to have said that Iraqs a big place and theres lots of sand.) In the same breath, Mr Blair has taken personal responsibility for any errors made. Yet this is a cross the prime minister need not bear at all. The report clears him of all agency, and therefore of precisely that responsibility which he has so magnanimously taken upon himself. The transatlantic parallels are remarkable. The Senate intelligence committees critique of the CIA has done for Mr George W. Bush exactly what the Butler reports indictment of the joint intelligence committee has done for Mr Blair. 																														The Butler reports investigation of the evidence is meticulous. Indirect, ambiguous and, in one instance, downright mistaken intelligence was used to present the case for Britain going to war. A great deal was mysteriously lost in translation when the JICs assessments were translated into the September 2002 dossier persuading the nation about the menace of Mr Saddam Hussein. The usual warnings and caveats that accompany intelligence reports had all disappeared. The Butler committee is relentless in documenting all this. But who is to be held responsible? Mystifyingly, the prime minister as well as the current chairman of the JIC and prospective chief of MI6, Mr John Scarlett, have been absolved of all responsibility for these errors. The JIC was working under strain, hence the misjudgments; but this strain was not caused by Downing Streets pressures. The report invokes, instead, a vague notion of collective responsibility or groupthink. According to Lord Butler, this general failure of intelligence is not the same as the government deliberately attempting to mislead, but it reduces, nevertheless, the scope for informed collective political judgment. But, by an extraordinary sleight of hand, the prime minister is rescued from representing, or being accountable to, this collectivity, whatever it might be. Mr Blairs navet might even have begun to look positively charming had all this nothing to do with a messy war and its messier aftermath.

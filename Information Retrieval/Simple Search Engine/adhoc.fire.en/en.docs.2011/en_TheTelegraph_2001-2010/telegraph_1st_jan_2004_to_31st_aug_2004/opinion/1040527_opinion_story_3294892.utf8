		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 							 																						CRONY GOVERNORS																														The inherent ambiguity in the position and the role of the governor has been compounded by making the post a vehicle for distributing patronage. Occasionally, the governor is even made into a crucial player in politics. Hence the demand voiced by Mr Siddhartha Shankar Ray, a former governor of Punjab, that the governors who had been appointed by the National Democratic Alliance should resign. In theory, the governor of a state is appointed by the president of India and reports directly to the head of state. Like the role of the president, the role of the governor is largely to do with protocol and political ritual. Thus, from the ivory tower of theory, there is no need for governors to resign when a change of government takes place. There is no constitutional need for resignations nor is there any kind of moral compulsion. Political practice has, however, somewhat tarred the status of the governor. It is the government in power that recommends the appointment of governors. In the past, especially under Indira Gandhi, the governors post was used to destabilize governments in those states where the opposition was in power. Raj Bhawans became centres of intrigue. Politicians or loyal bureaucrats were made governors to carry out the design of destabilization drawn up in New Delhi. This lowered the dignity of the position of governor.																														This practice has not entirely disappeared but this particular use of the governor is no longer very common. More common has become the practice of rewarding selected people through governorships. Such people are hardly ever apolitical. Activists of the Bharatiya Janata Party and loyal workers of the sangh parivar are noticeable among the current crop of governors. Such persons only serve as outworks of the government in power in New Delhi. They may not always intrigue against a state government led by a rival political party, but they would not be averse to such intrigue if the occasion arose. The question of resignation is lodged somewhere in the interstices of this kind of questionable political practice. The examples cited here may be drawn from the BJP but no political party is quite free of all these. Thus, if following Mr Rays righteous injunction, the governors were to put in their papers, what would follow? The chances are that the United Progressive Alliance would appoint its own cronies. Individuals would change, but the practice would remain the same. Something more fundamental than token resignations is required to remove the ambiguities in the governors position.

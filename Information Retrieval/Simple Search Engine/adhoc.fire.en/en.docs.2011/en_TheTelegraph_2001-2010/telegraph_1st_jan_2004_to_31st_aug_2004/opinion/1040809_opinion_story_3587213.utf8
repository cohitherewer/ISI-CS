The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 09, 2004 							 																						READ THOSE COLOURS Gwynne Dyer																					Pick any warning of a domestic terrorist attack issued by the US homeland security department, and replace the word terrorist throughout with some other frightening word. It greatly enhances the entertainment value of the statement without substantially changing its credibility.																					Take secretary Tom Ridges recent warning that various iconic financial institutions on the US east coast would be on Orange Alert until, oh, probably well into November. Now do the substitution: Let me be clear: while we have raised the threat level for the financial services sector in the affected communities, the rest of the nation remains at an elevated, or Code Yellow, risk of vampire attack...The vampires should know (that) in this country, this kind of information, while startling, is not stifling. It will not weaken the American spirit.																					It works just as well if you substitute the word with werewolves or zombies. And the reason it works so well is because the terrorists being promoted by Ridge and his friends are not flesh-and-blood enemies with clear political goals and coherent (though violent) strategies for achieving them. Acknowledge that reality, and you could end up admitting that there is some connection between US policies, especially in West Asia, and the rage of the Islamist terrorists.																					False scare																					Its much more effective politically to portray them as faceless demons driven by a love of evil and an unmotivated hatred of Americans. When Basque ETA terrorists blow things up in Spain or Tamil Tiger suicide bombers do the same in Sri Lanka, the target population knows that its attackers are real people with specific and limited political objectives. The terrorists that the department of homeland security purports to be defending Americans against could easily be the baddies in an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.																					So the homeland security people run up the threat levels from Puce to Magenta to Crimson and back down to Vermilion, keeping ordinary Americans in a permanent state of anxiety, and most of the US media disseminate this nonsense as though it had some connection to reality. You would never know from the media coverage that the US is a country of almost 300 million people where not a single individual has been killed by terrorists in the past 35 months.																					Turn a blind eye																					You can put this down to the vigilance of the various US intelligence and security forces (though they have not caught any terrorists who were in the US and planning attacks). You could also conclude that al-Qaida and its friends dont have sleepers in the US who are able to carry out further attacks, or that the Bush administrations response to 9/11 so perfectly suited their plans that no further attacks have been necessary. What you should not be able to do is to portray terrorism as the greatest danger facing Americans today. They face a bigger risk of drowning in the bath and a far greater risk of dying by falling down the stairs. 																					If I were a senior al-Qaida planner, I would not be in any hurry to attack targets in the American homeland again. Even if I did want to destroy its freedoms, I wouldnt feel the need for another attack: when that loaded homeland word starts being used by official circles in any language, you can already hear the symbolic jackboots marching in the distance.																					Since we senior al-Qaida planners dont give a damn about how the Americans run their domestic affairs, I would instead wait until after the November election to see if Bush continues, or Kerry adopts, the current, highly satisfactory US foreign policy of invading Muslim countries and driving their populations into the arms of our Islamist allies. We certainly dont need to devote scarce resources to the task of scaring the American public when the homeland security department does it for us for free.

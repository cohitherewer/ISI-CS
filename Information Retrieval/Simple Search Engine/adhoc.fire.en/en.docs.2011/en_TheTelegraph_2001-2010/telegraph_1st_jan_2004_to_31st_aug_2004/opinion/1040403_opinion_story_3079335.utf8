		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 							 																						MS PANDITS BEAUTYShowbiz and suburbia, each brought to bear upon Ms Laxmi Pandit its own notions of how a woman ought to beIt is difficult to discuss beauty contests seriously, in India, without sounding like a dogmatic feminist or a saffron bigot. But the case of Ms Laxmi Pandit in Mumbai bears scrutiny. The doubleness of her fate in that city of beautiful people brings out the larger dichotomy in urban Indias perception of women  especially single, young women. What seems to be at stake here is not so much the aesthetic definition of a womans beauty, as the assumptions and fantasies, moral and sexual, that colour the eyes of her beholders. And the back-stage episode with her landlady places these assumptions in another kind of world altogether. The scenario keeps shifting between showbiz and suburbia. Ms Pandit has tried to inhabit both worlds  each with its own notions of how a woman ought to be. What makes her sexy? And what makes her moral?																														The gaze that looks at Ms Pandit as Miss India places her body in a specific relationship to marriage and motherhood. Here she is beautiful because she has remained unspoilt by either. The rules are stringent, stopping just short of a virginity test. Miss India is not or has not been married, and has never had a marriage annulled or never given birth to a child, is not now pregnant nor a parent. Are marriage and motherhood being protected here from the taint of a certain kind of gaze, or is the same gaze making sure that it gets the still unravishd bride, which it most enjoys? (Ms Chen Lili, a Chinese trans-sexual, was barred from the Miss Universe contest this year for being an artificial woman.)																														It is the same Ms Pandit, but a different story in the cooperative housing society at Malad West. Here the eligibility criteria are just the obverse of those for Miss India. If she moves in with a man, then they would have to be married. Thence follow the lies, and their subsequent discovery. Ms Pandit and her male friend (another aspiring model) find themselves  like many other Indians of their generation  in a moral universe designed to make adults live and feel like errant children. It is here that the agency of Ms Pandits landlady might appear to some as driven by a strange excess of moral fervour. Her aversion to lies is surely befitting a model Indian woman. Just as she would have been perfectly within her rights had she chosen to evict her lodgers for deceiving her. But puritan excess springs from inscrutable instincts. One could legitimately wonder what it was that made her landlady scupper this young womans victory in the contest. The formers action might even lend to the situation the vague sense of a somewhat gratuitous viciousness. Whatever be the springs of her action, it was legitimized by a collective disapproval of a man and a woman living together outside wedlock. 																														Yet the organizers of the pageant were willing to let the matter rest at Ms Pandits proven singleness  the most important criterion for their purposes. Presumably, the judges were willing to find her just as beautiful after her fall. However, it was Ms Pandit herself who gave up the crown because she felt too tarnished to represent India to the world. How India looks at Miss India is divided enough. But when this determines how Miss India looks at herself, then beauty pays a different kind of price for being beheld.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 							 																						A PERVERSE LOGIC Fear is not the only key to understanding the mind of the voter in Bihar, argues Uttam Sengupta				 	 Popular will																														Two polling teams in Bihar last month had almost an identical, though by no means unique, experience. One of the teams had been deputed to Danapur Diara, not very far from the state capital. The roads, however, were so bad that they had to board a tractor to cover a substantial part of the distance. Amused villagers told them that they would probably have to walk back because the tractor would be in no position to make the return journey. Little wonder that neither Election Commissions observers nor the media ever visited the booth. 																														Once the team arrived at the booth, they were greeted warmly but informed that since the entire village favoured one party, there was really no need for all of them to queue up and vote. A dozen people, the team was assured, had been deployed to look after the polling personnel and also to do the voting for the rest of the village. Polling personnel, speaking to The Telegraph on condition of anonymity, said that they perforce had to accept the conditions laid down. We just have the satisfaction that we killed enough time and created enough confusion to ensure that not more than 56 per cent of the votes were eventually polled, though the villagers wanted to push the percentage to 80 or even higher. 																														Another polling team, sent off to Nawada, reached the booth, to be greeted by an equally effusive reception. They were shown a canopy where elaborate arrangements had been made for them. Take rest, eat and sleep if you like, they were told. As for the polling, the villagers would take care of it. An incredulous Central government employee found the group of villagers so well-trained and so well-conversant with procedures that they even sealed the electronic voting machines themselves. A team member, he recalled, was infuriated at the sham and insisted on paying for the food. He was told that food in the village was not for sale and if he so wanted, he could walk eight kilometres to the national highway and search for food to buy. 																														The EC personnel at both the places were far too scared to even toy with the idea of reporting the incidents. Besides, as one put it, We realized that the political party did in fact enjoy overwhelming support among the people in the village. The mode of voting was perverse all right but it still remained an expression of popular will. 																														In both the villages, the beneficiary apparently was the Rashtriya Janata Dal. But lest readers get the mistaken idea that only one party in Bihar is guilty of twisting the electoral process, it is necessary to state that virtually all mainstream parties enjoy the privilege in their own pockets of influence. Even in a constituency like Chapra, where the Union civil aviation minister, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, produced video cassettes to show violence and vandalism, there is no reason to believe that the ministers supporters were all apostles of non-violence. Electoral violence in Bihar is rarely one-sided. 																														The television, of course, produced unrelenting pictures of horror and gloom. Newspaper reports reinforced the image by giving credence to statements made by vakils and barristers (allegedly names of dreaded criminals) who boasted that for a fees of just Rs 6 lakh, they could ensure 50,000 votes for the party that pays. Another television channel went to town with the interview of a young man, who failed to appear menacing. His voice was feminine and he looked more like a launda dancer (rustic men who put on saris and dance in public), popular in the Bihar countryside. He had obviously rehearsed his lines for the camera and dutifully boasted that soon his gang would graduate to the use of missiles (sic). 																														There is more to Bihar than such quixotic and unreal men, though the mainstream media would like people to believe otherwise. Had it been as simple or easy as the images would lead one to believe, politicians in Bihar would not have slogged in the sweltering heat. It is axiomatic though that all political parties in Bihar grab booths in areas where they enjoy majority support; they put up resistance where they are in a marginal minority; and they scrupulously skirt areas which they know are enemy territory. After one has taken into account all the distortions and perversions, one is still forced to acknowledge that, in most cases, the winners are candidates and parties which enjoy popular support on the ground. 																														Laloo Prasad Yadav, of course, had changed the rules of the game. Before he became the chief minister, thousands of government schools in the state were located in those corners of villages which were inhabited by the upper castes. Children of the backward castes and Dalits were seldom allowed to attend classes or cast their votes at election time. Laloo Yadav retaliated by getting almost all new school buildings constructed in areas dominated by other backward classes and Dalits. These new polling booths ensured that the upper caste men, usually hostile to him, would think twice before queuing up in Chamartoli. As for upper caste women, there was no question of them going out and standing with lower castes, which suited Laloo Yadav fine. It did provide him dividends in the short run. But even that does not explain fully why he continues to dominate the electoral scene. 																														Somewhat ironically, the strongman of Bihar last month campaigned over pot-holed roads, faced angry questions over non-existent electricity and listened to old women complain that they do not receive the promised old-age pension. And yet, he attracted people like a magnet. In a poignant and revealing report, a journalist reported how a ten-year-old Polio victim had crawled and positioned himself next to the car Laloo Yadav was travelling in. The boy managed to hold Laloo Yadavs legs while he was getting back into the car after having addressed a gathering. But the possibly tired politician did not spare the boy even a glance and securitymen dragged him away. Typically, the people took it all in their stride, barely noticing the plight of the boy while they watched the lion. 																														Such boorish behaviour would cost lesser politicians an election. But Laloo Yadav gets away with it because he has carefully cultivated an image of an imperious king. The king can make a beggar a millionaire overnight, or a banjo player can be nominated to the Rajya Sabha. In return all he demands is complete, unalloyed loyalty. That is why he remains the Pied Piper of Patna and his people continue to dream that one day they will be blessed by the king.																														The electoral process in Bihar was democratic enough to upset pre-poll calculations in both 1999 and 2000. In fact, editorial writers in 1999 went into a fit after the RJD won less than a quarter of the Lok Sabha seats from Bihar. The bubble, they wrote, had finally burst and the myth surrounding Laloo Yadavs invincibility lay shattered. An editorial writer commented that the triumph of image over reality had finally run its course. Most political observers shared this view and predicted that the puppet government headed by Rabri Devi would be routed in the next assembly election. 																														After the assembly elections, even the pollsters predicted a comfortable National Democratic Alliance victory. Laloo Yadav, describing pollsters as suit-clad coffee house jokers, had confidently declared that the RJD would again form the government. The result vindicated his stand. Thats why the man cannot be dismissed even when he appears to stand on shifting sand.

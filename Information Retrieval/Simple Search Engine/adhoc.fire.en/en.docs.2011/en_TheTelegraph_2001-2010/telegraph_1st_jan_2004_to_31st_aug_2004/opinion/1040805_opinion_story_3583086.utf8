		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 							 																						DANGEROUS DRIFT																														Manipur is on a dangerous drift. But New Delhi needs to be careful that the remedy does not turn out to be worse than the problem. For the large number of human rights and other social groups which stage daily protests in Imphal, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is at the heart of the states problem. No wonder that the political parties in the state have little choice but to echo these sentiments. Excesses by the army or any other wing of state power are repugnant to any civilized society. The latest protests in Imphal have been sparked by the death of a woman in the armys custody. This is not the first time that the army has been accused of excesses. There is thus a strong case for an impartial inquiry not only into this incident but also into the overall implementation of the act. But, given the alarming state of militancy in Manipur, the demand for revoking the act seems to be entirely ill-advised. There are as many as 19 militant outfits involved in violent activities in the state. The state government does not even pretend to be able to deal with the insurgents effectively. Revoking the act would render the army too powerless against the rebels. That would also mean an abdication of the states duty to uphold the rule of law.																														Unfortunately, the civil rights groups take a rather distorted view of the problem. To see Manipurs problem in its true perspective, these groups need to first understand why the act has been there for so long. There is no doubt that leaders of these groups wield considerable influence in shaping popular opinion in the state. They should use that influence to expose the rebels dubious ways. For too long the common people have had to pay heavily for the militants misadventures. Once the militant threat goes, there would be no need for keeping the army or giving it the special powers. The problem with most of these groups is that they stop short of denouncing the rebels in strong enough terms. It could be because of an inadequate understanding of the problem or simply because of the fear of the militants guns. Things become more complicated when local politicians are forced to fall in line with the campaigners against the army. The states problem is far too grave for narrow politics. The last thing that Manipur needs is worse chaos. But there is a need for better co-ordination between the army and the civil administration.

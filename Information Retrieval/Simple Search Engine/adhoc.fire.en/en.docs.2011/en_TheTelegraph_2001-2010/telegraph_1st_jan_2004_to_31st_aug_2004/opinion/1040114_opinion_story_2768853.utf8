 - The organization of power in Pakistan needs to be transformed  Pratap Bhanu Mehta The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University The current improvement in India-Pakistan  relations represents a major breakthrough. There is a palpable  sense, both in India and in Pakistan, that the shape of  this relationship will now change profoundly. A number of  things about this round of talks inspire confidence. Unlike  summits in the past, that were wrecked by a paradoxical  combination of high expectation, sentimentalism and intransigence,  the Islamabad declarations are founded on the bedrock of  realism. Neither India nor Pakistan has claimed victory  or called each other names. There is a better realization  that progress on a number of fronts  trade, civil society  relations, travel restrictions, sporting links  will be  necessary to create the right climate for handling the tougher  issues later on. Neither regime has given in to the temptation  to grandstand to its domestic audience. And what is significant  in Pakistans case is that the dialogue involves more protagonists  than Pervez Musharraf.  It included significant members  of parliament and the chief of Inter-Services Intelligence,  suggesting that this outcome represents a wider consensus  among Pakistans elites and is therefore likely to be more  enduring. The incentives of all parties are finally aligning:  Pakistan has realized that terrorism has extracted a bigger  price from Pakistan than it has from India; and India has  realized that engaging Pakistan rather than demonizing it  will pay dividends. There is great international pressure  to sort out this quagmire. If Musharraf acquires the ambition  to transform Pakistan, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee the ambition  to leave a statesmanlike legacy of peace, we can be confident  that enduring progress will result. So there is much to be optimistic  about. But the road ahead is still likely to be very tough  for both Pakistan and India. Let us assume that the dominant  sentiment in civil society in Pakistan and even in substantial  sections of the elite is in favour of better relations.  Let us assume further that Pakistan wants to genuinely emancipate  itself from its recent history and become a modern state,  not tethered to an assortment of military groups, mercenaries,  religious fundamentalists and permanently in the throes  of an identity crisis.  This assumption is not outlandish:  Pakistan recognizes the hole it has dug itself into. But  will this realization be enough? There are two overwhelming  difficulties. First, power in Pakistan is still institutionalized  with those who have a stake in violence. Pakistan can become  a stable modern state only if the domestic power and influence  of the military, the ISI and the violent groups they have  supported are considerably reduced. The raison dtre  of these institutions has come from a rivalry with India;  no rivalry, no power for them, no justification for the  dominant role they play inside Pakistan.  It is not easy for any institution  to liquidate its own long-term power. Even small groups,  entrenched in key positions, can block progress if they  see progress resulting in their own irrelevance. An enduring  peace will require not just the diminution of anti-India  sentiment, which will not be very difficult to achieve.  What it will require is a major transformation of the way  power is organized within Pakistan. Pakistani society may  be ready for such a transformation. The question is whether  those in power will give it up so easily. The second long-term challenge  comes from the fact that any regime is vulnerable to opposition  just for the sake of it. Musharraf has enough detractors  who would want to embarrass him. Even if Pakistan moves  to a more open political system, grandstanding against caving  in to India is not entirely ruled out. And the temptation  not to appear weak to a domestic constituency, whether real  or imagined, is a great inhibitor for any leader. This is  why it is extremely important that any settlement or progress  not be seen as a victory for India, because this will make  regimes within Pakistan that go for a settlement vulnerable.  The current round of talks represents  a victory of sorts for India: no mention was made of Kashmir,  there is a commitment to clamp down on terrorism, Pakistan  has agreed to Indias position that talks can proceed on  issues other than Kashmir, and the vision of an open South  Asian Association for Regional Cooperation economic zone  is more Indias than Pakistans. But India was careful not  to present it as such. But India has its task cut out for  it in the following sense: as far as anyone can tell, Pakistan  is not going to get a single major concession from India.  What can India give Musharraf that allows him to say that  the terms of any settlement contemplated were not tilted  entirely in favour of India? The issue is not whether Indias  claims are just, the issue is whether a settlement can be  made politically credible inside Pakistan. And as far as  one can tell, there is no clear answer to this question.  And this uncertainty could still haunt talks in the future. There are three related ways of  getting around this dilemma. The first option is to go very  slow. Stick to de-escalating tensions and a few easy issues,  continue talking, but give Pakistan enough time to come  to terms with its own institutional dilemmas, so that its  leaders are secure enough not to have to worry about caving  in. But this will require patience on both sides. The second  option is also long term. Present any settlement not just  as a bilateral settlement, but also as part of an attempt  to alter the terms of discourse in the region as a whole,  away from competitive nationalism. That is why the concept  of SAARC is not peripheral to this enterprise. If the ultimate goal of SAARC  is to dissolve the procrustean boundaries, then all kinds  of institutional possibilities open up. What would the terms  of discourse be like if the region had a greater commitment  to the freer movement of goods and people? It would render  conflicts born of artificial closure of identity irrelevant.  Most important, any settlement within a framework of SAARC  allows the possibility of thinking, not in terms of what  India and Pakistan can wrest from each other, but in terms  of the directions in which the region as a whole should  be heading. This is the framework under which all sides  can claim victory.  But for SAARC to succeed, there  will have to be a robust consensus, not just on the benefits  of trade, but on a basic set of values. If SAARC is to be  something akin to the European Union, an arrangement, not  just for trade but also for the pacification of violence,  there will have to be a common ideological commitment. No  regional agreement can succeed without a consensus about  the value of peace, human rights and a sense that no community  should be threatened for simply being who they are. This  last challenge is one that Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan  and in its own way, India, also face. The point of opening  up relations has to be to evolve a commitment to these core  values, the third prong in the strategy for long-term peace.  But these values, despite the optimism generated over the  last year or so, still remain fragile aspirations, and a  lot of political hard work, cultural transformation and  governmental diligence will have to go into making them  possible. As everyone knows, India-Pakistan  relations are not just about India-Pakistan relations; they  are premised upon a gamut of assumptions about national  identities, about the proper role of governments and have  often licensed a violation of human rights and constitutional  values on both sides of the border. If we are serious about  peace, we ought to be serious about transforming the political  culture of south Asia. Vajpayees transition from master  strategist to statesman, and Musharrafs from army commander  to peace-broker will depend upon this transformation. The  good news notwithstanding, the jury is still out on this  one.

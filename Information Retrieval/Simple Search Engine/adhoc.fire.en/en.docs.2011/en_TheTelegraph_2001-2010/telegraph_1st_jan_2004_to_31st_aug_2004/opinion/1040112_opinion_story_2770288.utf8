		 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 FIGHTING EVIL CAN BE FUN
 Gwynne Dyer																								Doing good may be noble, but fighting evil can be fun, wrote the billionaire financier, George Soros in 1989, and hes been at it ever since. He had considerable influence on events in eastern Europe during the fall of Communism in 1989-91, a bigger role in the overthrow of the Serbian dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, in 2000. Last Sunday, Soross candidate, Mikhail Saakashvili, won the Georgian presidency by a landslide. But did the Georgians really have a choice in the matter?																								The mass protests against Eduard Shevardnadze, the ex-Communist autocrat who had ruled Georgia since 1993, only began after he blatantly rigged parliamentary elections in November, but Soross Open Society Foundation was at work long before that. It flew Georgian opposition leaders to Belgrade almost a year ago to learn how the Serbs had made their revolution.																								When the November election came around, it all went according to the script, from the roses and the placards saying Enough carried by Saakashvilis National Movement supporters to the dramatic invasion of the parliament building as Shevardnadze was trying to swear in the newly elected members of parliament. All the demonstrators knew the tactics of the revolution in Belgrade by heart, the National Movement general secretary, Ivane Merabishvili, told the Washington Post in November. 																								So your inner cynic starts to tell you that this was a fake revolution  especially since the government of the United States of America recently started hedging its bet on Shevardnadze, whom it had hitherto backed as an anti-Russian leader. The questions multiply: was Soros just a pawn of the Bush administration? Was the rose revolution just part of the US strategy for dominating the countries through which a $3 billion pipeline will carry oil from the Caspian oilfields to the Turkish port of Ceyhan? Can it ever be legitimate for foreigners to train the citizens of a country in the techniques for overthrowing their own government? Bloodless revolution																								Washingtons support for Shevardnadzes overthrow had nothing to do with its love of democracy. For the Bush administration, the goal is to freeze Russia out of the new oil bonanza in the Caspian and Caucasus countries, all former Soviet fiefdoms, and Shevardnadzes crime was to be too accommodating to the Russians.																								On the other hand, most Georgians really did want to be rid of Shevardnadze. Under his corrupt and incompetent rule the country has descended into poverty and despair: about one-fifth of its five million people have gone abroad in the past decade, mostly to seek work in Russia. The November elections demonstrated that his gang could not be voted out by legal means. What recourse was left but revolution?																								What Soros supplied was instruction in a technique for removing Shevardnadze without bloodshed. Non-violent democratic revolutions have become a global phenomenon with great potential for good in the past two decades, from South Korea and East Germany to Indonesia and Serbia, but the autocrats are not stupid. They have learned that the best way to discredit these popular movements is to provoke them into violence, so protesters must be trained in the disciplines of non-violent protest if their democratic revolution is to succeed. That is what Soros provides.																								It is not illegitimate for outsiders to help, because the enterprise cannot succeed unless the local people are truly determined to claim their rights. And Soros is helping to fund the anti-Bush activist organization, Move On, in this electoral year in the US. As he wrote in Atlantic Monthly last November, The supremacist ideology of the Bush administration stands in opposition to the principles of an open society, which recognise that people have different views and that nobody is in possession of the ultimate truth.																								Its not clear whether his intervention in Georgia will succeed, for president-elect, Mikhail Saakashvili, faces enormous challenges: the country is broke, partitioned, and trapped between Washington and Moscow. But what has happened there so far is at least legitimate, and even a bit hopeful.

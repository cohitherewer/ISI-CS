		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 							 																						DEVELOP AND DESECRATE The dispute over two development projects in Santiniketan reveals a sordid tale of politics and institutionalized land-grabbing, writes Satrujit Banerjee				 	 Paradise lost																														A couple of public interest litigations against the Sriniketan Santiniketan Development Authority have been in the news lately. The first relates to the proposal to construct a housing complex on a barren tract distinctive to Birbhum, a site popularly known as khoai. When Rabindranath Tagore first visited Santiniketan with his father, this barren expanse, with creeks forming a natural erosion-induced drainage system, had deeply impressed him. But to build an ashram or tapovan there, it was necessary to undertake an extensive greening programme. This was done over the years, right upto the mid-Fifties, first by raising soil embankments which created small lakes, and then by bunding the Mayurakshi river and bringing a canal right into Santiniketan. The changes in the environment were dramatic. The barren khoai turned into a green belt and now boasts a forest of moderate size where deer graze in large numbers. 																														Opponents of the housing project say that the site on which it is proposed is the only reminder in Santiniketan of what the entire tract used to be like, and that the construction might adversely affect the natural drainage system built over the centuries. Moreover, they say, a modern housing complex will be an incongruity in the area and will clutter the only open area in Purvapalli, where it is located. 																														The second PIL relates to Lahabandh, an area measuring 24.32 acres, which includes a waterbody of 17.7 acres visited by migratory birds seasonally. An environment/entertainment park is proposed to be built here which will have a mela area, complete with rides, food stalls and souvenir stores. It will have two typical Bengali and Santhali villages: each village consisting of four huts, covered by clay coating. Local handicrafts, produced on site, will be sold in these huts. There will also be a food court offering different cuisines, an art gallery with souvenir shops which can be rented by artists, as well as a mini golf course and a rock-climbing facility. There is also a proposal to build an island in the middle of the lake, which will have a restaurant serving coastal food. The shores of the waterbody will be converted into a sandy beach to give it an ocean-like feel.																														Needless to say, the project, which seems inspired by a third-rate American amusement park, has angered local residents. Work on the project had already started, and the water of the lake had been drained. But there has been an apparent cease-work at the site, although the final verdict on the PIL is awaited.																														In order to trace the history of these disputes, one has to plumb the murky depths of politics and institutionalized land-grabbing. 																														In a note written to Mahatma Gandhi a few months before his death, Tagore had made a fervent appeal to the apostle of non-violence: Accept this institution under your protection, giving it an assurance of permanence if you consider it to be a national asset. Visva-Bharati is like a vessel which is carrying my lifes best treasure and I hope it may claim special care from my countrymen for its preservation.																														This is what Gandhi wrote in reply: Of course Vishva-Bharati [sic] is a national institution. It is undoubtedly also international. You may depend upon my doing all I can in the common endeavour to assure its permanence.																														True to his word, Gandhi passed on his assurance to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the first minister of education of independent India, and in due course, the Visva-Bharati Act, 1951, was passed in the parliament. The act commends the special and very valuable work done by the institution, particularly its effort to discover, preserve and transmit the vast elements of old Indian culture and the work with the surrounding villages; adding that the Constitution makes the Union government responsible for institutions declared by law to be of national importance. 																														To prevent any overlap of jurisdiction, the act specifies the area to be administered by Visva-Bharati  3,000 hectares, bound on the north by the Kopai River, on the west by a line running from Ballavpur and Benuria villages to Bandhgora, on the south by a line running from Bandhgora via Bolpur Dak Bungalow to the bridge over the Eastern Railway cutting and on the east by the Eastern Railway line. It goes on to state that the government of West Bengal agrees to the establishment of a unitary, teaching and residential University at Santiniketan by an act of Parliament.																														Thus, the two projects which have been held up by PILs fall within the jurisdiction of the above act, but they have been legitimized by the SSDA. Legal experts say that under this act, Visva-Bharati is the sole authority empowered to give the green signal to such projects and that the SSDA does not have any say in the matter. 																														How the SSDA came into existence and then usurped the powers conferred on Visva-Bharati is another story.																														The problem of unregulated construction in the Visva-Bharati area goes back a long way. At a meeting of the executive council held on August 25, 1986, the vice-chancellor at that time, Nemai Sadhan Bose, had expressed concern at the phenomenon. He informed the members that the state governments minister in charge of urban affairs would visit Santiniketan to see the problems arising out of unplanned growth, and to discuss possible remedies, including the declaration of Visva-Bharati as a Notified Area. The vice-chancellor obviously had misgivings about the future and observed that in the notified area committee, Visva-Bharati should have majority representation, [to] safeguard the special characteristics and heritage of Visva-Bharati. In his convocation address of 1987, Bose again emphasized that the need for a Visva-Bharati development authority, a majority of whose members would be nominated by the University and its ex-officio chairman should be the vice-chancellor.																														The demise of the then chancellor, Rajiv Gandhi, put these plans on hold. In the meantime, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government of West Bengal sensed an opportunity and moved in quickly and decisively. The SSDA was constituted in 1989 with the local member of parliament as chairperson, with various government officials and only two representatives of Visva-Bharati as members. To compound this irony, Somnath Chatterjee, the local MP, wrote a letter to Ashin Dasgupta, who was vice-chancellor then, with an appeal to nominate its [Visva-Bharatis] two representatives to the SSDA. 																														Having secured power, the SSDA made its presence felt by awarding the contract for building a housing complex at Purvapalli to a company of its choice. This group of houses is totally out of sync with the surroundings or the ambience of Santiniketan, but surprisingly, it drew no significant public protests at the time, either from the residents or from environmentalists.																														But in the case of the khoai and Lahabandh projects, Chatterjee has run into Mahasveta Devi, the eminent writer and activist, as also a number of well-known authors, artists and intellectuals, many of whom are leftists. Academicians are aghast that anyone could think of turning Santiniketan into a concrete jungle with a grotesque entertainment park, to fill the SSDA coffers.																														Had it not been for Mahasveta Devis protests, Chatterjee might have got away this time with believing that once elected to the parliament, he could do anything he wanted with his constituency.

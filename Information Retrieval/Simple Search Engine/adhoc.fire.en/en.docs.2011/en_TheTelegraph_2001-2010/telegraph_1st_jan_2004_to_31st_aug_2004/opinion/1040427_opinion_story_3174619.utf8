		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 							 																						PLAYING THE MEMORY GAME Narendra Modi will be left with the responsibility of keeping Gujarat alive while the Central leaders obfuscate the carnage in public memory, writes Chirosree Basu				 	 Forget me not																														The yards that still stick out after the clumsy burial of the sari episode in Lucknow brings to mind certain pictures that the Bharatiya Janata Party is now desperately trying to push into the realm of the subconscious  Gujarat. Why? Because the pattern of the partys behaviour is remarkably similar to that of the days that followed the carnage  first the surprise, then the grief and then the horrible subterfuge. In 2002, both Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani did not play Holi to mark their heartbreak over the killings; Vajpayee even cancelled his trip abroad. At Lucknow this time, there were no drums, no celebrations, as the prime minister filed his nominations in absolute sombreness. Lalji Tandon stood by his side, mute, as Narendra Modi had stood by Vajpayee at a relief camp in Ahmedabad while the prime minister shed copious tears in the event of his inability to comprehend how people could be burnt alive.																														Modi must have managed to explain the mechanics of burning bodies much better than Tandon could explain that of a birthday gone wrong. And anyway, burnt Muslims on election eve proved far more useful to the party than a heap of mangled women. Which is why Tandon could be unceremoniously dumped and Modi turned into a hero. But the process by which this was achieved was the same  turning legalities on their head. 																														In Lucknow, the party washed its hands of the episode, saying it could not be held responsible for the action of its workers and leaders in their individual capacity (presumably, Bangaru Laxman and Dilip Singh Judeo had accepted their bribes in individual capacity? Wonder why the party went all out to shield them?) and that since no demand had been made for votes, it could not be treated as a case of bribery (why then did the ruling party get so agitated when Ajit Jogi was spotted giving out schoolbags with his picture on them, or point fingers at Mulayam Singh when he felt kind enough to excuse minority children from school on Fridays? Besides, what about the just-unearthed pamphlets in Lucknow, handed out days before the fateful congregation, announcing the star presence of Vinay Katiyar and Kalyan Singh at the distribution bonanza?). 																														Quite obviously, the subterfuge that followed Modis action in Gujarat was of an entirely different magnitude. The mild unease over raped, maimed and burnt Muslims and the witnesses of these atrocities crammed in poorly-supplied rehabilitation camps had quickly turned into a giant Gujarat asmita as the prime minister and his deputy found the explanation of Modis culpability in the original sin at Godhra, and Vajpayee found enough reason at an executive meet at Goa in April 12, 2002 to suspect if Muslims could ever be trusted and if they could ever cohabit with others in peace. 																														It took talent to identify the mayhem in Gujarat as an occasion the party could cash in on, and there is no dearth of it in the sangh. So the state elections were announced in no time, and Modi went about, in his typical way, making yatras with the ashes of just-dead or long-dead Gujarat heroes, browbeating dissenting intellectuals, remorselessly wooing non-resident Indians and consolidating his own gains through a state machinery that would have put Nazis to shame.																														His political gurus did not rest meanwhile. When the conscience of the Union food minister, Shanta Kumar, pricked and made him confide to pressmen that he would have resigned in Modis place, he was shut up and forced to issue an apology. When less dispensable allies like the Samata Party and the Telugu Desam Party showed moral perturbation about Modi continuing in office, they were silenced in a ruthless manner. Samata was hit at its most vulnerable spot  George Fernandes procurement scandals  and a pliant party submitted tamely after having sacrificed its outspoken spokesman, Shambhu Srivastava. The TDPs dependence on the BJP at home ensured that it could not press its demand for Modis removal any further. The Gujarat chief ministers dadas at the Centre even went out to seek new friends in behenji and Ammaji so that Modi could be conserved and Gujarats gaurav left unshaken.																														Gujarat has paid its dividends. Modi has given the party an unprecedented victory in the state and an example for others to emulate, an experiment to replicate, both within the sangh parivar and beyond. At a campaign trail in Karnataka last week, Modi taunted S.M. Krishna for wanting to make a Gujarat out of Karnataka. He said it takes a 46-inch chest to do that, only a real mard could make/remake Gujarat. How would then Modi read the partys plea to forget Gujarat, especially at a time when he finds himself hemmed in by a revived public interest in him following the Supreme Courts ruling that orders the Best Bakery trial to be shifted outside the state and calls him and his political benefactors modern day Neros?																														Commonsense says he could not be very happy. Within Gujarat itself, the Hindutva factor has begun to wane, much to Modis discomfort. When the party went to polls on April 20, it had a massive anti-incumbency factor working against it. People across the state believe that the work done by the state government has been tardy. Jayaben Thakkar, member of parliament from Vadodara, reportedly returned half her development fund of Rs 10 crore for being unable to utilize it. When Modi toured his state on his kesariya yatra immediately before the elections, flaunting the governments development initiative, around 18 villages, consisting of some 60,000 voters had already decided to abstain from voting for the governments indifference to local issues ranging from water, roads and so on. Several of them were in north Gujarat, which is supposed to benefit from the much-touted Sujalam Sufalam project that promises to bring water to dry areas. 																														Unable to muster votes on Hindutva ground as in the earlier elections, the BJP had in fact fallen back on its old plank of mobilizing votes on caste and community grounds, much like the Congress. In the business areas of Himmatnagar, Khedbrahma, Visnagar, Mehsana and so on, the effort to play the Hindu card had even backfired as the funds collected from the community to help the accused in the riots had not brought their desired results. The apex court had rejected the bail applications for several, and the mood is going to get worse as an activist judiciary with uncompromising intellectuals and social activists in tow steps up its heat on the accused. The hike in power charges had angered farmers so much that the Gujarat Khedut Samaj had appealed to farmers to vote for the Congress. Modi had also been at loggerheads with the partys own farmers wing, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, over power tariffs, till Central leaders thought it wise to pitch in on his behalf again and drive a compromise. The mood, however, remains sullen. There is widespread resentment against the growing unemployment and privatization of education. 																														The Supreme Court rulings, coming only days before the Lok Sabha voting in the state, came too late in the day for Modi to change all that. Which is probably why Gujarat registered an all India low of 45 per cent to 50 per cent voter turnout. Without an emotive appeal, the urban educated in Gujarat, the BJP clientele, do not come out to vote. They stay indoors to escape the heat. The problem is that even if Modi has enough chances of flogging the Hindutva horse again in the coming days (and there will be plenty, given the line-up for Supreme Court hearings), he will find it difficult to translate them into immediate political bonuses. Assembly elections are far away, and the gurus at the Centre will do their best to see the judicial observations about connivance of the Modi administration during the carnage do not get translated into renewed pleas for Modis resignation. They may be hard-hearted enough to forget Gujarat in a while, but certainly not Modi, who is bound to give them at least 20 of the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state.																														Which means in the immediate future, Modi will have to conduct his subterfuge with the courts on his own for a while as his bigger brothers get busy conducting the same with the nation. It works out like this  Gujarat is dead, long live Gujarat. Unlike Ayodhya, Gujarat is not being kept in suspended animation. It will live and quietly rework its wonders in the state (and elsewhere) with Modis daring legal repartees, smothering of the courts with misleading, misrepresented data and obfuscation of truth. This is fundamental to his survival, not so much in the foremost rungs of the BJP leadership (that is a given) as in the heart of a Hindu Gujarat. But this will have to be done with less noise than usual. For at the national level, Gujarat has been ordained to be forgotten, willingly  Come, let us resolve not to allow Gujarat to happen anywhere else, as Vajpayee put it. 																														But mark the words. The weight of the resolve is, once again, put as much on Muslims as on Hindus  the us factor in its new incarnation. Earlier it was us against them  the ever shifty, suspicious people who could not cohabit with others in peace. How come they are being suddenly trusted to design the nature of governance?																														There is another undertone in Vajpayees most recent pronouncement. Remember, Praveen Togadia had once famously said that whenever and wherever Godhra occurs, Gujarat will have to happen. Could the prime minister have meant that Gujarat will be forgotten for only as long as Muslims resolve not allow a Godhra to happen? Is it then actually all a matter of Muslim resolve? But what will happen if Muslims now resolve (despite the cajoling of hired ulemas and minority intellectuals) that they will put their votes into any other kitty but the BJPs? 																														Nothing really. The BJP leaders are not so nave as to believe that Muslims will forget Gujarat with as much speed as they did and vote for the party. They know full well that the minority votes will go where they are destined to. The sudden feel good that the BJP is now giving to Muslims is to make things more comfortable for Mulayam Singh Yadav than for any miraculous gains to Vajpayee that will disprove the exit poll predictions for the National Democratic Alliance. Despite the unkind Samajwadi allegations that the the BJP is doing everything in its power to upset its apple-cart in Uttar Pradesh, the saffronites have not desisted from sparing a thought for its future ally. If the BJP is willing to forgive and forget, post-elections, the Samajwadi Party will have less problems allying with a mellowed saffron parivar than ever before. 																														The decision to forget Godhra (read Gujarat) is a bribe to both Muslims and a political party friendly to them, no less khule aam (open to all) than Tandons had been. Wonder why the Election Commission is doing nothing about it.

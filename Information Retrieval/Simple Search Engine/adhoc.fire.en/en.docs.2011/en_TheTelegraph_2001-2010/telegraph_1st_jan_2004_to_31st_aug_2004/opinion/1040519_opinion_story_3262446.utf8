The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 							 																						WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY The election results in the North-east clearly show a decline in the appeal of national parties like the Congress and the BJP, writes Amalendu Guha				 	 Kirip Chaliha celebrates after defeating Bhupen Hazarika																														The elections are over, the results are out. There is a happy smile on the face of the Congress chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, as well as on that of the opposition leader, Brindaban Goswami, whose Asom Gana Parishad has got three members of parliament this time as against its score of zero in 1999.																														The biggest loser in Assam is the Bharatiya Janata Party. It had expected to gain as many as 14 seats in the state  it has had to be satisfied with only two. It drew a blank in the Barak valley and the autonomous hill districts. Infighting has already started in the partys state unit. Bhupen Hazarika, whom the BJP leadership expected to be a star-campaigner, flopped. Now, people are wondering whether he will resign from the BJP. 																														It appears that in Assam, the anti-incumbency factor was directed entirely at the BJP-led government in New Delhi. The voters did not consider the performance of the state government at all. They thought the India Shining campaign was a joke. The peasants, the working and lower middle classes in the cities were concerned about the large-scale unemployment, the erosion of pensioners income and the rise in the prices of fuel, food, transportation and so on. They used the ballot to express their anger.																														Of the other parties, the Congress is happy because it has been able to retain nine of the 10 seats it won from Assam in the last general elections.																														The left and its non-Congress secular allies, which emerged as a vigorous third force at the all-India level, have done badly in Assam. They did not win a single seat from the state in the last parliamentary elections; this time too they have drawn a blank. 																														The Communist Party of India can at least take consolation from the fact that in Jorhat, first-time contestant Dhrupad Borgohain, a former member of the Rajya Sabha, received 172,332 votes, that is 25.3 per cent of the total votes  a recognition of his proper utilization of the MP quota fund. As against this, the Congress and the BJP have got 33.1 and 22.1 per cent votes, respectively. The AGP candidate even forfeited his deposit. No doubt the results will help the CPI grow in upper Assam in the coming years.																														In contrast, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which had sent an MP from Silchar several years ago and another from Barpeta some time later, has failed miserably. Noorul Huda, the long-standing CPI(M) candidate from Silchar, received only 20,020 votes, that is, only 3.29 per cent of the electorate in the constituency backed him. In comparison, the CPI(M) candidate from Barpeta, Manoranjan Talukdar, did better  he got 48,607 votes, or 6.37 per cent of votes in the constituency. It may be noted that in 1999, Uddhab Barman, the sitting CPI(M) MP from the constituency, polled 18.73 per cent of the votes (14,1272 votes) to emerge runners-up.																														Yet, despite their miserable performance, local left leaders are jubilant at the country-wide results. They seem hopeful of reorganizing, and even expanding, their base in the next five years, to regain the importance they had lost after the anti-foreigner movement in Assam led to the rise of regionalism and the birth of the United Liberation Front of Asom. The lefts support to the AGP during its second term did a lot of damage to its credibility among grassroots followers  a credibility which has not yet been fully restored.																														Of the other states in the North-east, Tripura is, as always, firmly in the grip of the left. The latter got 69 per cent of the votes in the state, as against the Congresss 14 per cent and the BJPs 16 per cent.																														In the plains of Manipur (Inner Manipur), the Congress polled 37 per cent votes to the CPIs 25 per cent. In Outer Manipur, it may be safely said that the results  when they emerge  will not favour the BJP or the Congress, because this constituency is dominated by tribal voters whose aspirations are basically separatist rather than pan-Indian.																														In Meghalaya, P.A. Sangma has retained his seat but the other seat has gone to the Congress. Sangma, who had plans of bringing all MPs from the North-east region under one umbrella for better lobbying purposes, is now terribly alone. Sangma is a member of Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress  a part of the National Democratic Alliance. But the two leaders differ in their stand on the Illegal Migrants (Detection by Tribunals) Act. Also, while Sangma is concerned about Sonia Gandhis foreign origins, Banerjee is not. But clearly, in Meghalaya, narrow regionalism is on the decline. 																														In Arunachal Pradesh (two seats), Nagaland (one seat) and Mizoram (one seat), the Congress has drawn a blank. But it means nothing. It is quite possible that soon the BJP in Arunachal Pradesh and the Nagaland Peoples Front may change colour wholesale without attracting the anti-defection law. Regional parties in the North-east generally switch allegiance to whoever rules in New Delhi.																														All said and done, what is the overall immediate trend? Compared to the last elections when the BJP polled 30 per cent of the votes in Assam, this times its share of votes has decreased to 27 per cent. Similarly, the Congresss vote-share has declined to 33 per cent against its previous 38 per cent.																														But the AGP has increased its share of total votes to 23 per cent from 15.23 per cent in 1999. This has infused confidence in the partys leadership which is now looking to consolidate its position and to avoid past mistakes so that it can capture power once more in the state and send more MPs to New Delhi.																														As for the left which contested in only three parliamentary constituencies, it has bagged 10 per cent of the votes in the state. Thus the lefts vote share or even that of the AGP is not comparable to the vote share of the two other bigger parties. It may be noted that even at the peak of their political influence, in terms of seats in the assembly, from 1978 to 1983, the left bagged no more than 11 per cent of the votes in Assam. If the AGP takes a firm stand against communal forces and revises its stand on the IMDT issue to the satisfaction of the minority community, then an alliance between it and the left will be possible once more.																														In sum, in the 14th general elections, the ruling Congress was in the lead in as many as 65 of the 126 assembly segments in Assam. Against this, the BJP was on top in 28 segments, the AGP in 18, Bodo leaders supported by the All Bodo Students Union in 9, the Autonomous State Demand Committee in 2, the CPI in 1 and independents in 3.																														But despite being ahead in so many assembly segments, the share of votes of both the Congress and the BJP has decline. Clearly, the appeal of the big parties is on the wane in Assam. The only party to see a 7.43 per cent rise in its popularity was the AGP. The AGP clearly then is on a comeback trail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 							 																						WRIGGLING OUT																														Putting the party above the law comes easily to Indian politicians, especially in times of elections. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that Assams chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, did so to save some members of the ruling Congress from criminal charges. But the way his government issued an order to withdraw the charges against his partymen, including two of his cabinet colleagues, makes a mockery of the law. Politically too, the move may cost Mr Gogoi dearly. He can blame only himself if the opposition parties make it an issue in the coming Lok Sabha polls. True, the opposition outcry forced Mr Gogoi to issue another order nullifying the previous one to withdraw the cases. It is doubtful, though, if he can salvage the situation with an inquiry into how the first order was issued at all. His attempts to wriggle out of the faux pas give away his predicament. It is not really important if the charges against his partymen were minor, as he put it, or not. It was for the law to decide that. And, assuming that they were minor charges, the chief minster still needs to explain how only the cases involving Congressmen were sought to be withdrawn. 																														The real issue, however, is bigger than the possible damage to the Congress or advantage for the opposition. The episode once again exposes a systemic malaise  the cynical practice of bending the law to suit partisan ends. Politicians may or may not reap temporary benefits by doing so, but the practice threatens both society and governance. The problem is that there is little to choose between the parties on this question. One has only to remember the recent storm over the Bharatiya Janata Party giving membership to Mr D.P. Yadav, the tainted Uttar Pradesh leader, and then disowning him. In West Bengal, the ruling Marxists have repeatedly been accused of sheltering criminals masquerading as party-workers. Mr Gogoi has only one option to assure not just the opposition parties but also the people of Assam of his faith in the rule of law. He must let the law take its own course, and also be seen doing so. Cynics might say, though, that this is asking too much of a politician  more so before the elections.

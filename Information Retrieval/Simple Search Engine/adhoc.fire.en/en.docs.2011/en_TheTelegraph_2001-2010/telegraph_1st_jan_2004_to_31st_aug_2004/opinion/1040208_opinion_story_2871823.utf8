				 																																																																														 A short memory can be very convenient in politics. In fact, the best politicians are those who make the most profound statements  and forget them immediately after. By that reckoning, however, Shahnawaz Hussain still has a long way to go. For he could be seen the other day, glancing sheepishly at Sonia Gandhi everytime she looked at him in the Lok Sabha. Probably, what was playing on his mind was a run-in with the Congress president during the Republic Day parade. The Bofors gun was being shown off, and Sonia had turned to Arun Jaitley to say that the guns were after all the best and definitely worth displaying by the government of a party that had been opposed to its purchase. Jaitley only smiled politely, but Shahnawaz, who was sitting next to him, couldnt pass up the chance to say something snide  Madame, the quality of the gun was never in doubt, it was something else... With the court exonerating Rajiv Gandhi of graft charges in the Bofors case, Shahnawaz didnt know how to face his widow in Parliament. He should have taken lessons from Jaipal Reddy. The day the court verdict came in, the AICC spokesperson could be seen accepting congratulations and shaking hands with everyone in apparent jubilation. He had clean forgotten his own opposition to Bofors!				 																																																																														 Indian politics is full of old men, older men and the very, very old. Thus, it is only natural that the old, or the comparatively young, like Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, should take care of the doddering old  K Karunakaran and ABA Ghani Khan Chowdhury. For the customary send-off photo session of Lok Sabha members, the two veteran Congressmen wanted front row seats. They couldnt climb the few steps to the wooden platform on which the MPs would pose, they said. So, Priyada landed up at 8 am, an hour before the scheduled time, to reserve seats for the two geriatrics, along with the PM, the deputy PM, leaders of parties and others with more claim to the front row. This may be their chance to sit in the front perhaps.				 																																																																														 Poor Priya really has no rest. He is the Congresss chief whip in the Lok Sabha, besides being in charge of Madhya Pradesh for the general elections. In addition, he will be contesting the polls from Raigunj. And then there are his duties as president of the national football federation. Little wonder then that Das Munshi is at his wits end. He tried sending off his wife to look after his constituency while he looked after matters in the capital, but that didnt help. His son, who is four years old, took ill and Das Munshis nights too were taken up caring for him. Thats what you call working full-time!				 																																																																														 These free market times are rather hard on politicians who want sops for their supporters. Ask Vijay Malhotra. The BJP MP from south Delhi wanted the FM to merge DA with basic pay for Central government employees. This class of the electorate, he pleaded, was angry with the party and needed appeasing. But Jaswant Singh stonewalled all his demands, citing economic logic  the Rs 4,000 crore tab, the effects on states, and so on. Until the night before the budget, when a desperate Malhotra applied to M Venkaiah Naidu, who immediately took him over to the prime ministers house. AB Vajpayee heard out Malhotra and then asked his advisers to do some numbers quickly. It was one of these babus who came up with the brilliant idea of merging half the DA with the salary. By the time they had finished working out the details, it was midnight. But there remained the vital task of including it in the budget. So a senior secretary in the PMO called up a senior secretary in the finance ministry, who said he would have to get his bosss approval. And so a call was put through to Singh in wee hours. Naturally, the PMs wish was the FMs command  and economics be hanged.				 																																																																														 India has been dragged far along the road to Westernization  our moralistic politicians protesting all the way. Which is why the ban on serving liquor in hotels during elections makes no sense. Hoteliers bodies wrote to the soon-to-retire JM Lyngdoh, asking him to lift the ban. But to no avail. Lyngdoh is known to have a partiality for the burra peg  so why the double standards?				 																																																																														 Never test an Indian politician on Hindi films  thats lesson no 104 for Sonia Gandhi. In her budget speech, Sonia was comparing AB Vajpayees double-speak and referred to Dev Anands Asli Naqli, saying you couldnt distinguish the real from counterfeit. Speaking immediately after her, the BJPs Kirit Somiayya picked on the metaphor and turned it around. Vajpayee, he said, was an evergreen hero like Dev Anand. The asli Gandhi, he elaborated on the theme, had struggled long and hard to free the country, which a naqli Gandhi now wanted to take over. There were loud approving thumps from the treasury benches, but all his rhetoric was wasted  the lady against whom it was directed had left the house.				 																																																																														 Vasundhara Raje Scindia seems to be thoroughly enjoying her job  however many doubts she might have had about it to start out. Keeping aside all thoughts of work and worries about the imminent Lok Sabha elections, Vasu headed to the theatres immediately after the state assembly was adjourned sine die. She also took along with all her states legislators to a special screening of the Amitabh Bachchan starrer, Khakee, in a swank multiplex in Jaipur. A feast followed the film. Vasu, who is perceived to belong to the Vajpayee camp in BJP circles, also took this opportunity to make conciliatory overtures to LK Advani. It was the deputy prime minister who had recommended Khakee, she told everyone. All the MLAs so loved the outing that Vasu was besieged with requests to make it a monthly affair. Another suggestion, why not invite the media as well? 				 																																													Organizing private screenings for AB Vajpayee and LK Advani, and now Vasu, was bad enough. Heaven help Bollywood, if the leaders now insist on bringing along half the world.

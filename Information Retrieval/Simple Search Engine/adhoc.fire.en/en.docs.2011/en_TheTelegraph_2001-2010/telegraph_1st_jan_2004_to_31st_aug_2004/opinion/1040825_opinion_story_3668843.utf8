The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 							 																						TALKING ON																														The ongoing composite dialogue between India and Pakistan has led to high-level interaction, in the last few weeks, between officials of the two sides. Relations between the countries, however, continue to be fragile, and require fresh political support to ensure that there is little chance of them being derailed again. The forthcoming meeting between the two foreign ministers provides precisely such an opportunity. Senior civil servants from New Delhi and Islamabad have spent considerable time this month addressing many of the irritants that affect the bilateral relationship. These included talks on demilitarizing the Siachen glacier. 																														The two sides, led by their defence secretaries, discussed modalities for disengagement and redeployment of troops, but do not seem to have arrived at a mutually acceptable resolution. India, which is occupying the heights, is willing to move down and demilitarize the glacier as long as Pakistan accepts the actual ground position line and commits itself not to move in when India vacates its position. Pakistan seems unwilling to do this because it feels that Indias occupation of the heights in the first place, in 1984, was illegal. The dispute stems, of course, from the non-demarcation of the line of control beyond the geographical point, NJ9842, in 1949. The Siachen glacier lies beyond this point. It is obvious that bureaucratic negotiations will not lead to a breakthrough, and the stalemate may continue if civil servants alone are given responsibility for the dialogue. Fortunately, both sides agreed to maintain the ceasefire that has been in effect since November 2003. 																														Similarly, the talks on the Sir Creek maritime boundary have not led to any firm conclusion. The joint statement, issued after the dialogue was over, said that the talks were held in a frank and friendly atmosphere, which reveals that little substantial progress seems to have been made. Sir Creek is a 60 mile-long estuary in the Rann of Kutch, which separates Gujarat from the Pakistani province of Sindh. Pakistan claims that the entire Sir Creek, with its eastern bank defined by a green line and represented on a 1914 map, belongs to it. However, India says that the green line is an indicative line and feels that the boundary should be defined by the mid-channel of the Creek as shown on a map dated 1925. The dispute over the maritime boundaries in the Sir Creek area has led to the internment of fishermen by the two sides, and it has prevented exploration of rich natural resources in the area. The talks on terrorism and drug trafficking too seemed to have had a disappointing outcome. While India and Pakistan reaffirmed their determination to combat terrorism, the definition of terrorism remained contentious. Dialogue has begun and should continue. The two foreign ministers, when they meet next month, should inject a healthy dose of political support into the proceedings.

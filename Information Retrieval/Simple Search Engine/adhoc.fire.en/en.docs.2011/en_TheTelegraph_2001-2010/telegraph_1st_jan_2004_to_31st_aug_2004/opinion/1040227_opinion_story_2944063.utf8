		 Friday, February 27, 2004 							 																						JOURNEYS ON AN INDIAN RIVER 																														THE GANGA TRAIL: FOREIGN ACCOUNTS AND SKETCHES OF THE RIVER SCENE (Indica, Rs 750) by Jagmohan Mahajan promises rich enjoyment through its compilation of pictorial and verbal impressions of life along the Ganga recorded by artists and travellers during the 18th and 19th centuries. Unfortunately, the reproductions of the drawings, watercolours, aquatints, lithographs and engravings do not always convey the vitality or clarity of the originals. The black-and white reproductions have suffered more than the coloured ones. This is a pity, because to have the Daniells, Zoffany, de Thevenot, Hodges or Prinsep on the same theme in the same volume is a rare pleasure. But the sense of wonder and insatiable curiosity of the long extracts from travellers accounts make up for this flaw. This picture by James Prinsep, titled, Eve of an Eclipse of the Moon, shows a scene by the river in Varanasi on November 25, 1825.

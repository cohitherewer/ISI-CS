The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 23, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Puzzling polls				 																																																				Sir  The results of the Junagadh municipal elections have left political analysts in a fix once again (Municipal win perks up Modi, July 21). The victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party, thus of Narendra Modi  coming less than three months after the Congress took the Junagadh Lok Sabha seat  will again be read against the pogrom of 2002, and the people called fickle for choosing a party for the Lok Sabha, and another for the local municipality. A lot of predictions have gone wrong owing to outdated assumptions about the Indian voter. The Indian voter, be it in Gujarat or in Nagaland, has matured while the experts were not watching. He has the confidence to choose different persons solely on their individual merit to represent him in different fora, and ignore killings in the next town or village which may have little influence on his life. The sooner our election experts reckon with this in their calculations, the closer they will get to the right numbers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sipra Bhattacharjee, Calcutta
				 																Unpardonable				 																																																				Sir  If the fire at the Saraswati English Medium School at Kumbakonam does not shake us out of our stupor, nothing ever will (School for burning, July 17). We need to ask why tragedies of this kind  for instance, the Srirangam marriage hall fire, the Uphaar cinema fire, the frequent rail accidents, construction-site deaths  engage the attention of the press for a few days, elicit a few ministerial tears, and then quietly disappear from public memory. Statutory changes must be made to bring to book those responsible for such manslaughter, be it an individual employer, proprietary concerns, partnerships, trusts, schools, hospitals, companies or the state. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Subramanyan, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph has in the past launched several effective campaigns, for instance, for a cleaner Maidan. The Kumbakonam tragedy should be used to start a campaign to make all schools in West Bengal, and India, aware of, and safe from, fire hazards. I would like to suggest that a compulsory fire-drill be introduced in the curriculum of every school, so that children learn to respond to a crisis. Schools in the United Kingdom and other countries have been following this practice for a long time. Till adequate facilities are made available and schools made safe, this training would enable the children to mentally prepare themselves, and prevent casualties .				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Gita Ramachandran, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The mishap at the Kumbakonam school throws up a number of questions. Why, even after the fire in January this year in a marriage hall at Srirangam killed 57 people, were no strict fire-safety measures adopted at the Saraswati English Medium School, only an hour away from Srirangam? The tragedy could have been averted had there been more than one exit and the cooking facility away from the school buildings. The fact that this is the third major fire this year in Tamil Nadu speaks volumes of the indifference and callousness of the government apparatus.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  I am sorry to hear about the death of 90 children in a fire in a school in Tamil Nadu. Schools should be a place of safety for children, not a deathtrap. The teachers who abandoned the children to save themselves should be punished. In my country, we have a saying when people have to flee a disaster: women and children first. Hadnt anyone heard of this in Kumbakonam?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chuck Mann, Greensboro, US 

				 																																																				Sir  The reports on the Kumbakonam fire have to be read along with the United Nations latest Human Development Report, with its damning verdict on India. According to the HDR, while public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP has only slightly increased over the past decade, spending on pre-primary and primary education has actually declined. The results of this neglect are more than evident in tragedies like the latest one.				 																																																				Any measures taken by the government to improve the situation must necessarily be accompanied by improved governance. Else, we will languish in the quagmire of lax government inspection and oversight fed by bureaucratic corruption that goes by the name of Indian democracy.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
K.R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

				 																																																				Sir  Like most things, the definition of teacher too seems to be changing with time. If the daily newspaper reports are to be believed, a teacher today is someone who abuses his students, and brings them physical harm on the pretext of punishment. After Kumbakonam, the word teacher will be used to describe a person who has no qualms about deserting his wards to be consumed by fire, while running for cover himself. There are still some who place the welfare of their students above all else. We just need to find them a new name. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It defies logic that a school of 900 students was allowed to function with a single exit and no proper ventilation. This points to an ugly connivance of the local administration and the education authorities. The government will consider its job done by making a few arrests and setting up an inquiry, but will that ensure such incidents do not happen in future?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Siddhartha Raj Guha, Jabalpur

				 																																																				Sir  No words can provide enough consolation to the grieving families of Thanjavur. However, the focus should not shift from the role of teachers in this incident. They have not only shown criminal neglect of the minors in their charge, but also abetted their entrapment and death. 				 																																																				Kindergarten students look upon their teachers as parents. So strong is their belief in their teachers that they form the most obedient lot during crises. Having been a teacher in a hill school in Uttaranchal facing occasional windstorms, downpours, blizzards and landslides, I have experienced this raw faith. The teachers of Saraswati English Medium School have breached this faith. They require exemplary punishment. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manoj Banerjee, Calcutta

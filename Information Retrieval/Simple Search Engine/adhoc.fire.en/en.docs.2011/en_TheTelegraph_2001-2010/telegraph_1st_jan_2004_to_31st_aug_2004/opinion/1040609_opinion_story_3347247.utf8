		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 							 																						COMMON FEARS																														The Commonwealth continues to dog Britain. There now seem to be two Commonwealths: an old one comprising Australians, New Zealanders and Canadians, and a new one to which belong countries like Nigeria, Sierra Leone, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It is the latter that is proving to be an embarrassment for Mr Tony Blair, his home secretary and immigration minister. A recently leaked memo from Downing Street revealed Mr Blairs concerns over abuse from the new Commonwealth countries. Britain had decided to be nice  or economically canny  by extending the working holiday maker scheme to the new Commonwealth countries, instead of letting just the old one to benefit from it. The scheme allows people under 30 to come to Britain and do casual work for two years  especially where there is a labour shortage, as in catering and hospitality. But since the scope of this scheme has been widened, there has been an unmanageable number of applicants from the subcontinent and Africa, and even some abuse of regulations. So the memo talks of a quota system for these countries, backed by tough new regulations. These quotas would require careful handling in order to pre-empt charges of discrimination. (After all, the old and new Commonwealths more or less divide white from black.) So the memo depicts the British government, in its all-encompassing niceness, as a victim of its own success in making the scheme more accessible to the new Commonwealth countries. 																														Is Mr Blair  once proud of his tikka masala democracy  coming round to accepting the fears of his opponents and of the British rightwing press? When the European Union expanded recently, Britain did seem to panic over the economically inactive eastern Europeans coming over in droves to enjoy its welfare benefits. Mr Blair had even conceded then that some of the British publics concern over immigration was genuine and not figments of the racist imagination. Together with Iraq, the governments policies on immigrants and asylum-seekers will remain crucial issues before the imminent elections in Britain. With globalization and the freer movement of labour, striking a balance between Fortress Britain and open-door Britain is likely to become increasingly difficult for Mr Blair, as it has been, in different ways, for Germany and the United States of America. Letting people come in and work when Britain needs more doctors and nurses, and then restricting the flow when Lord Tebbits cricket test begins to show the wrong results will be that much less easy to pull off now.

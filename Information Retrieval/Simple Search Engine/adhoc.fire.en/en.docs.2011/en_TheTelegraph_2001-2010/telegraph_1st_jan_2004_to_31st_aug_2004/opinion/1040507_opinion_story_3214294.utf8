		 Friday, May 07, 2004 							 																						SHADOWS IN THE GARDEN				 	 Mars: shock and disgustLizard Tails By Juan Mars eacute;, Harvill, pound; 6.60Every child has a world inside his head. A world of the imagination, to be sure, but one that is also tinged by  and tinges, in turn  reality. But there are times when the fantasy inside the head pops out into the real worldThat is the story of Lizard Tails. 																														The world inside the head of David Bartra, the protagonist of this novel, is not one of happiness untouchd by solemn thought that the Romantic poets had marvelled at. Davids world is that of a rundown suburb in Barcelona just after World War II, in a Spain riven by a bitter civil war. It is not the best of times for a child poised on adulthood. Especially so, if you have a father like Davids  an alcoholic on the run from the police for suspected subversive activities. A Republican sympathizer and a Resistance worker who helped pilots downed in occupied territory escape to safety, Victor Bartra has been driven to dissipation by the failure of his ideals. In the world of his dreams, David often runs into his absentee father, slouching about in the dry river bed at the back of their house, eyes dull, shoulders drooping, the ignominy of flight symbolized by the gaping wound on his buttocks, the blood from which he tries ineffectually to staunch with a piece of cloth. 																														The only stable influence in Davids life is his mother, the attractive red head Rosa. Strong yet vulnerable, she has coped uncomplainingly with poverty and loneliness, retaining her romantic daydreams and a restless sexuality to which her pubescent son responds by being intensely protective. He is jealous of Inspector Galvn, whom he suspects of having a romantic interest in her. He is even resentful of his unborn brother in his mothers womb, into which he can see with his powerful radioactive megarat eyes. Pregnant and ill, Rosa works herself to the bone on the sewing machine, making clothes for girls and dolls, clothes that David occasionally helps himself to when he wants to escape the oppressive squalor of their dingy two-room home. 																														But there is a separate cast of characters who inhabit the 15-year-olds fantasy world, no less real for not being flesh and blood  an RAF pilot, Captain OFlynn, whose photograph adorns his bedroom wall (the counterpoise to his father), his dead older brother, Juan, besides his yet-to-be-born brother and absent father. Then there are the characters from the films he sees in the local cinema and even a larger-than-life picture of a larger-than-life ear, with its various parts indicated in red text, a legacy of the ENT surgeon whose consulting room has become Davids bedroom. 																														David is what psychologists today would refer to as a problem child. Thrown out of school, he is a loner with a propensity to get into what his mother euphemistically calls messes. He lies compulsively, plays truant from the photographers studio where he has been apprenticed, and cross-dresses. But by far his most favourite pastime is to scout the gully behind his house for lizards with his friend Paulino. The boys believe that a brew made of lizards tails will cure Paulinos piles and the abcesses caused by regular beatings and sexual abuse by his uncle. For Juan Mars, the dismembered lizard tails the boys collect become a metaphor  so valuable for their ability to shock and disgust that he names the book after it  for their existence, spliced apart as they are from their origins and yet having a life of their own. 																														But the attribute that sets David apart is his artists soul, which most often manifests itself in a highly fantastic embroidery of the truth. But David does not lie merely to conceal the truth, he does it, as his fathers alter-ego recognizes, to do the exact opposite. Thus in Marss evocation of Davids imaginary world, the real and the imagined are so tightly interwoven that it is impossible to tell them apart. For example, does David seriously believe that Inspector Galvn has shot his old, ailing and blind dog, Chispa, or does he merely allow his jealousy to get the better of him? And is there any truth in his perceptions of the inspectors innate cruelty? Does he ever really witness the inspector pushing a man off the tram and to his death, or does he invent the whole thing? Lying then becomes a narrative strategy, quite like the game children play of wishing for something so hard that that they actually will it to happen. In a sense then, David, like the author, is also the agent who alters something in the process of imagining it. And then events blow up in his face  Rosa dies in childbirth, alone and unattended, and Davids brother is born premature and deformed. But then a childs imagination is only fallible.						GARGI GUPTA

							 																						FAMILY REUNION
 The Congress is still trying to 
 gain leverage from the Nehru-Gandhi legacy, although dynastic 
 rule assails the basis of democracy
 It is rare to witness a situation 
 in which the main strength of a political party is also 
 its principal weakness. The name and the legacy of the Nehru-Gandhi 
 dynasty is the most important asset of the Congress. It 
 is this name alone which made Rajiv Gandhi prime minister 
 after his mothers assassination. The same name made Congressmen 
 accept Ms Sonia Gandhi as the legitimate president of the 
 party even though, at that point of time, she had no exposure 
 to politics, let alone experience. Many Congressmen see 
 Ms Sonia Gandhi as indispensable to, and inseparable from, 
 the Congress. The leadership is assumed to be hers if not 
 by birth then at least by marriage. Now comes the announcement 
 that Ms Priyanka Gandhi and Mr Rahul Gandhi are both primary 
 members of the Congress. It will not be an unjustfied speculation 
 to see the primary membership as the launching pad for a 
 bigger political role in party and national affairs. Will 
 they, wont they  these are the two most frequently asked 
 questions about the Gandhi siblings and their decision to 
 join politics. The timing of the announcement is significant. 
 (It will be nave to conclude that the news was inadvertently 
 blurted out.) The entry of Ms Sonia Gandhis children into 
 the Congress, like her own introduction to the party, is 
 dependent on their belonging to a particular family. This 
 dependence is not entirely baseless, since it has been proved 
 that the Nehru-Gandhi name is still a crowd-puller in India. 
 Ms Sonia Gandhi and her children may not be able to bring 
 the Congress to power, but they remain the only people who 
 command mass popularity, if the crowds are an index.
																														The drawback lies in the complete incompatibility that exists between democracy and dynasty, between republic and royalty. The Gandhi familys hold on the popular imagination has a touch of feudalism to it. Neither Rajiv Gandhi nor his widow became leaders after winning their political spurs. They were catapulted into leadership because of their relationship with Indira Gandhi and thereby with Jawaharlal Nehru. It is significant that under pressure, Ms Sonia Gandhi always refers to the sacrifices her family has made for the nation. Similarly, if and when her children contest the polls, their only asset will be their family name. To the subaltern imagination, the Nehru-Gandhi family is the closest approximation to royalty in republican India. This situation makes Ms Sonia Gandhi, her children and the Congress sitting targets since they are seen as perpetuators of dynastic rule and loyalty. In a democracy, there can be no bigger sin than this.
																														There is another way of looking at the same set of issues. The real battle in Indian politics is between chemistry and arithmetic, between the appeal of charisma and the fruits of genuine organizational networking across the electorate. Ms Sonia Gandhis popularity is the product of a unique chemistry and charisma. The Congress is trying to leverage this further by bringing in the Gandhi children. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee also depends on charisma but his party is also becoming adept at the art of election-management. In a queer way it is also a battle between feudal and modern modes of politics.

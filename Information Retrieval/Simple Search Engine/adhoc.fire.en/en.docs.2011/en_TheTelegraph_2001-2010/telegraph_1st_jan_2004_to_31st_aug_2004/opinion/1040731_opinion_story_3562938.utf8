The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 							 																						SIGN OF THE TIMES																														The analysis of an isolated incident leads to conclusions that are narrow. Placed in a broader context, that same incident acquires a different salience, and even serves to prise open aspects of society. Thus, the decision of the National Democratic Alliance to boycott all parliamentary committees might appear to be the act of a political formation that is miffed because it has lost power. The NDA wants the entire democratic process to grind to a halt because of its boycott. This decision may be criticized and should be criticized as an attempt to bring the process of democratic discussion and government to a standstill. This can be read as a sign of the innate anti-democratic ethos of the Bharatiya Janata Party which leads the NDA. But such a criticism would be facile and meaningless since other political parties, including those opposed to the BJP, have similarly disrupted parliament and other institutions of government. The issue has wider ramifications related to civilized codes of behaviour and to the maintenance of the dignity of institutions and office. No political partys report card is free from red marks on this score.																														When it was in power, the Congress used its position to attach the names of its leaders to any number of public places and government-sponsored finance schemes. The BJP, in its turn, when it was in power, used the names of its own leaders and heroes for schemes and places. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has been doing the same in Calcutta for a number of years. It was a clear case of abuse of power on the part of whoever was in power. This time round, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government has taken this a step further by scrapping a drinking water mission named after a sangh parivar icon, Deen Dayal Upadhaya. This has the potential of setting in motion a dangerous precedent. The BJP, if and when it returns to power, could pay back the Congress in its own coins and rename Rajiv Chowk (Connaught Circus still to most sensible people) Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chakra. Things could thus descend to the level of the ridiculous. Examples apart, there is a growing tendency among people in power to abuse their position and debase the office they hold.																														The real threat to democracy in India lies precisely here. Democracy is enshrined not only in certain institutions. It is also inscribed within certain codes of behaviour. There is no punishment in a democracy for those who transgress those codes for it is assumed that those who enter politics in a democracy know the value of those codes and the dangers inherent in subverting them. But in India, such an assumption is increasingly coming under threat. It would be convenient to say that this threat is coming from a class of people who are ignorant about the ethos and practices of democracy. But, alas, that is not the case. Even persons well-versed in democratic practice have been known to behave in a manner that can only be described as disgraceful. The tussle to name places cited in the previous paragraph has the involvement of many senior politicians who have earned their democratic spurs many moons ago. There is a collective decline in good taste and good manners and this is a bad omen for democracy.

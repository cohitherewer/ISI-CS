The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 29, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																State of despair				 																																																				Sir Lightning never strikes the same place twice unless you are in Bihar. The gruesome murders of social activists, Sarita and Mahesh Kant, while the murder of Satyendra Dubey is still painfully fresh in the memory, is a chilling reminder that the gun is mightier than everything else in Laloo rajya (Gaya couple gunned down, Jan 25). All three shared the desire to remove crime and corruption and to empower the common man. Their killing indicates that the culture of violence has been institutionalized in Bihar and acts of violence are like any other job, except that they pay more. It needs no repeating that lack of employment and an abysmally low literacy rate are factors behind the youth going astray. Political patronage to criminals and a toothless police force have taken things to the very pits. Attempts to upset this nexus between politicians and criminals can invite no other fate but death. Can the people of Bihar break out of this vicious cycle? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Asit Banerjee, Calcutta
				 																Different readings				 																																																				Sir One agrees with Aveek Sen that the communal angle has been used as an excuse to ban Taslima Nasreens latest book, Dwikhandita (The allure of being contrary, Jan 26). And it is revolting to watch the impunity with which religious leaders in India are issuing fatwas against people like Nasreen and Salman Rushdie. The Sambhaji Brigades rampage in Punes Bhandarkar Institute must have been driven by the same intolerance. Such people and outfits are getting away with cognizable offences while civil society stands by and watches indifferently. 				 																																																				Sen also hits the nail on the head in saying that middle Bengal is caught in a time warp when it comes to sexual expressions, particularly in women, as Nasreens case illustrates. (Till the other day, she was the Bengali cultural-intellectual establishments favourite). But it is equally true that Nasreen and her kind of feminists have played a significant role in perpetuating gender and sexual stereotypes. Why must they always portray sex as an ordeal enforced by men on defenceless women, who are, of course, always the unwilling objects of lust? 				 																																																				Nasreen has played into the hands of the Marxist bhadralok puritanism in Bengal. As a result, when such feminists are found to actually enjoy their sexual freedom, then the sudden change in the paradigm of the good and bad is not well-received. Finally, would feminists tell us honestly how they would have reacted if a male writer had gone to town with his sexual liaisons, naming and describing his partners without caring to seek their consent? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sandeep Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Aveek Sens The allure of being contrary is among the best pieces I have read in recent times. But I am not as convinced of Virginia Woolfs understanding of the business of writing as Sen is. I think Sens essay succeeds so well mainly because he has not quite discarded the crumpled skin of the day as Woolf recommends in her Modernist enthusiasm. I hope The Telegraph will continue to have space for such contrary points of view in future as well.

				 																A shy at peace				 																																																				Sir  For once, the annual summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation has been more than a meaningless political and bureaucratic jamboree. Thanks to the leaders of India and Pakistan, this SAARC summit will be remembered for the two countries promising to commence a dialogue for the peaceful settlement of bilateral problems including Jammu and Kashmir. Apart from this, a number of positive declarations were made by the member countries. Atal Bihari Vajpayees proposal of a common currency for all south Asian nations, if implemented, could change the face of business in the region. This chance for peace and stability in south Asia  India and Pakistan being the two largest nations of SAARC  should not be frittered away, as it might prove terribly costly. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sanjit Kr. Ghosh, Guwahati

				 																																																				Sir  The time is ripe now for Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf to display the kind of statesmanship expected from both of them by the people of their respective countries. Both have ahead of them the tough task of undoing the mistakes of their predecessors during the Partition. A reunion of minds and hearts of followers of as many as eight religions and the ancient ethos of non-violence can make the subcontinent rise above all other countries in the world. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Holy dread				 																																																				Sir  On a recent trip to Puri, I was taken aback by the way we were treated by the purohits of the temples. As soon as we entered a temple, the purohits would put a tilak on our heads, sprinkle sacred water and start chanting mantras. Then they would produce a paper packet containing prasad or sacred ash and charge a price for it, without caring about whether the visitor wanted it. Worse, they showered curses on people who refused to take it. This left a bitter taste in the mouth. Those who plan to visit Puri should avoid these unholy individuals even if it means praying from a distance.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

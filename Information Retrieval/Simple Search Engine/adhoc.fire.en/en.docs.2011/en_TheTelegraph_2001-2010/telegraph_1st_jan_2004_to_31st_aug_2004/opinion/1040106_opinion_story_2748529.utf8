		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004  FORCE OF CORRUPTION 
 In a matter of a few decades, corruption  has taken deep roots among the police, mainly owing to political  interference, argues Sankar Sen Fallen on bad times  The resignation of Chhagan Bhujbal  as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra adds one more  twist to the unfolding drama of stamp-paper scam. Earlier,  some of the senior officers of Mumbai police, including  its chief, R.S. Sharma, had to bite the dust and face arrest  and criminal prosecution. The special investigation team  is also quizzing the former director-general of Maharashtra  police, S.C. Malhotra, for his direct or indirect involvement  in the scam. Taint is thus spreading from the top cop to  the former deputy chief minister. The scam exposing the  nexus between the venal police officers, corrupt politicians  and notorious criminals confirms public perception of the  prevalence of corruption in all ranks of the police administration. However, corruption in the force  is not an isolated phenomenon; it has to be viewed against  the backdrop of corruption in all spheres of national life.  India has become one of the most corrupt countries of the  world. Transparency Internationals corruption perception  index for 2002 placed India in the 71st position in a list  of 102 countries. Indias score of 2.7 on a 10-point scale  shows hardly any improvement from its past score of 2.9  in 1999 and 2.8 in 2000.  A recent empirical study of corruption  in India done by Transparency Internationals India chapter  shows that many citizens view the police as the most corrupt  sector of the government, though the impact of corruption  is on a much larger scale in sectors like health, education  and power, which involve a larger number of people. Corruption  among the men in uniform tends to get highlighted because  in most of the other departments, corruption is essentially  of the collusive type and there is seldom an aggrieved party  to lodge a complaint. But the people, quite justifiably,  feel more concerned about the high incidence of corruption  among the custodians of law and order. Though Indians readily associate  dishonesty with the police, the integrity of the police  is suspect in many other countries too. The Royal Commission  on the Police in Great Britain in 1962 found that 43 per  cent of the respondents thought that there was some truth  in the suggestion that the police sometimes take bribes  while most of the rest thought it unlikely, and only 1.2  per cent thought that they took bribes too often. A national  survey done for the Presidents Commission for Law Enforcement  and Criminal Justice in the United States of America found  that 58 per cent of the population thought that the police  were almost all honest, 30 per cent thought most were honest  and only 3 per cent thought almost all were corrupt. The  depth of suspicion against the police is thus much greater  in India than in the United Kingdom or the US.  Incidence of corruption in the  police has been highlighted by different police commissions.  Referring to severe stricture against the police by the  police commission in 1902-03, the Uttar Pradesh police commission  of 1960 observed corruption to be rampant among the non-gazetted  ranks of the police, but not as having assumed serious shape  among the higher ranks, namely the gazetted officers. The fact of the matter remains  that the police are constantly subjected to temptation.  Their job keeps bringing them in touch with the dregs of  the society. Even the lowest-ranked police officer has enormous  power. When greed, poor pay and power to harass are combined,  corruption is the inevitable result. But the disturbing  phenomenon of corruption among the senior officers acting  in concert with the political masters was not in evidence  even three decades ago. In the early Sixties, when I joined  the police service, the number of corrupt officers in the  all-India services could be counted on ones fingers, and  interference by the local politicians in day-to-day police  administration was limited. The authority of the inspector-general  of police and the chief secretary has not been seriously  eroded. But during the last three decades, political interference  in the functioning of the police, particularly in the transfer  and posting of officers, has become more pronounced. Most  of the senior officers are posted in sensitive posts on  considerations other than of merit, and they toe the line  of the political masters. Upright officers are marginalized,  as they are not easily amenable to pressures. Corruption among senior officers  has devastating consequences. Once it starts, it spreads  like cancer through all levels of the organization. It also  has a pre-emptive quality. It prevents the seniors from  exercising control over their subordinates and makes corruption  systemic and organized. For the citizens, it becomes obviously  futile to refer complaints to the higher officer, who is  profiting from the practices about which complaints have  been filed and who, because of his own complicity, dares  not crack down upon other forms of wrong-doing. Where corruption  pervades, complaints about it are used by corrupt supervisors  as a means to identify leaks in the system. (This is precisely  what happened in the case of the Mumbai police.) Police corruption cannot be contained  unless effective institutional mechanisms are put in place  to insulate the force from external pressures and influence.  The structural reforms recommended by the national police  commission  giving a fixed tenure to the police chief after  careful selection and setting up a state security commission  to act as a forum for police officers subjected to illegal  pressures in carrying out their duties  are necessary to  depoliticize the police and allow it to function according  to rules and laws. Unfortunately, both the Central  and state governments are totally unwilling to implement  the core recommendations of the national police commission.  The present home minister of Maharashtra has reportedly  said that he will decentralize the posting of police officers  and not allow political interference in the placement of  officers in police stations and other sensitive posts. However,  it is doubtful whether he will be able to restrain local  party members, who have got used to misusing the police  to serve their partisan ends. The chief minister of Kerala,  A.K. Antony, in sincerely trying to insulate the police  from political pressures and giving it a certain amount  of autonomy, has landed himself in a great deal of trouble. Normally, posting of officers  incharge of police stations should be left solely to the  district superintendents and likewise, the police chief  should have the exclusive responsibility of selecting superintendents  in charge of the districts. For this, statutory provisions  have to be built into the police acts, conferring powers  of transfer and suspension of personnel to authorities within  the department itself, so that orders from outside have  no effect. For obvious reasons, political leaders across  parties are dead against this kind of change. Besides insulating the police  against external pressures, some in-house measures are necessary  to contain and reduce corruption in the police. First, disciplinary  action against corrupt police personnel has to be swift  and severe. At present, disciplinary proceedings initiated  against police officers involved in corruption cases drag  interminably and reinforce the belief that one can get away  with corruption one way or another. The Santanam committee  in its report strongly recommended a simplification of departmental  proceedings and held that protection given to the services  in India is greater than that available in the more advanced  countries. The committee called such protection one of  the major factors behind the growth of corruption. Second, the provision of service  rules advising compulsory retirement after completion of  20 years of service should be resorted immediately to weed  out officers with a history of corruption. Right now, this  is not the case at all. Third, action against corrupt  officers can be taken by utilizing Article 311(2)(c) of  the Constitution. Clause (c) should be amended as recommended  by national police commission, to permit action against  corrupt officers in the interest not only of national security  but also for maintaining the integrity of the public services.  Fourth, there is urgent need for a law to offer protection  to police officers who dare to complain about their colleagues  or superiors, ignoring official channels if they consider  the matter to be of overriding importance. At present, those  who dare to expose malpractices within the organization  risk retributive action by senior officers and ostracization  within the force. Fifth, the public must be encouraged to  report any attempt by the members of the force to solicit  bribes or any other instances of corruption. But the people  must also be prepared to withstand harassment by the police  for the sake of probity in public life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 11, 2004 							 																						FAITH IN PEACE																														Poll promises are one thing, governance is quite another. As it prepares to hold peace-talks with the Naxalites, the new Andhra Pradesh government would do well to keep the distinction in mind. Irrespective of their political preferences, the people of the state would like to see an end to the decades-long Maoist menace that has held peace and development to ransom in large areas. But the chief minister, Mr Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy, can no longer afford to approach the issue the way his party, the Congress, made it a campaign point against his predecessor, Mr N. Chandrababu Naidu, during the elections. If the peace initiative is used to score political points, it may not achieve much. By agreeing to hold the peace-talks, Mr Reddy has moved just a step towards redeeming his poll pledge. It is now crucial that he takes it up as primarily an issue of governance. A ceasefire may help create the right conditions for the dialogue. But the government cannot abdicate its responsibility to maintain law and order, and to protect the lives and property of the common people. That remains the foremost constitutional obligation of any government, irrespective of its political colour. And any attempt by the rebels to blackmail the government on this score must be rebuffed summarily. The government must be convinced of the sincerity of the rebels desire for peace before it lifts the ban on the Peoples War of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and its allied outfits.																														It is generally agreed that acute economic deprivations in large parts of the state have much to do with the lure of the rebels. It is true that the problem of political extremism will not go away until the economic issues are addressed. The seemingly unstoppable suicides by farmers in Andhra Pradesh are a grim testimony to their abject poverty and exploitation by vested interests. But Mr Reddy cannot be unaware that economic packages alone are not the answer. In Andhra Pradesh as in other parts of India, development funds for villages and financial support to the farmers are too often hijacked by greedy politicians and other middlemen. It is obviously a failure of the administrative system that leads to such miscarriages of social and economic justice. And it is such failures that any subversive group exploits in order to recruit poor people to its ranks. Economic reliefs can be a legitimate part of the peace dialogue. Mr Reddys real test, however, is to get the administration back on track and thereby restore the peoples faith in the system.

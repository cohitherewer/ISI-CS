		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 							 																						WORKING OUT CAUSE AND EFFECT						DOCUMENT From Compromising Our Children: a WWF-UK Chemicals and Health Campaign Briefing, June 2004 For no fault of theirs 																														Serious impacts: Man-made chemicals are affecting our childrens intelligence and behaviour, compromising their ability to make sense of the world and affecting their movement skills. Much of the existing evidence of chemical impacts on people focuses on ubiquitous pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls. Researchers are reliant on epidemiological studies that by their nature can only be conducted after a number of years when sufficient data is available. Data is available for older chemicals, but for many newer ones, it is non-existent. We are therefore faced with an incomplete picture of the total impact of man-made chemicals on intelligence and behaviour.																														This does not mean that all man-made chemicals currently in use are harmless. What follows is a summary of the existing evidence.																														Decreased intelligence and altered movement skills: Effects on brain development associated with PCBs first came to light about 20 years ago when scientists began to see impacts on children born near Lake Michigan in North America...Their mothers had eaten fish contaminated by PCBs and this had affected the brain development of their children.																														Effects on visual recognition were seen in babies exposed to higher levels of PCBs in the womb and later tests showed that at four years of age these children did less well in short-term verbal memory tests predictive of learning ability. Studies elsewhere in the Great Lakes region backed up this data and found that PCBs were affecting childrens mental development and intelligence...PCBs have been shown many times to adversely affect neurological development. Studies in Michigan and New York, and in the Faeroe Islands, Germany, the Netherlands and Taiwan, have all shown negative associations between prenatal PCB exposure and cognitive function in infancy or childhood...																														While PCB exposure has been associated with effects on thyroid hormone levels in animals and humans, it is still not clear whether neurological symptoms associated with such exposures are a direct result of thyroid disruption or some other mechanism. 																														There is also evidence to suggest that dioxins might contribute to several adverse effects in people, including endometriosis, developmental neurobehavioural (cognitive) effects, developmental reproductive effects (sperm counts, female urogenital malformations) and immunotoxicity. The World Health Organization recommends a tolerable daily intake for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of 1-4 picograms WHO-TEQ (toxic equivalent quotient) per kilogram body weight per day. People consuming relatively modest amounts of highly-contaminated foods can certainly exceed these TDIs.																														PCBs and dioxins may not be the only man-made chemicals implicated in the dumbing down of our children. Poly-brominated diphenyl ethers, one class of brominated flame retardants, are another group of chemicals that have been reported to cause behavioural effects or learning deficits in animals. They all appear to have some effect on thyroid hormone or the thyroid gland, and to affect brain development. For example, several rodent studies indicate that commercially obtained penta-BDE (and pure tetra-BDE) can exert effects on thyroid hormones. Similarly, octa-BDE can interfere with the thyroid hormone system...While these effects are found at levels much higher than those to which humans are generally exposed, workers exposed to deca-BDE along with other brominated flame retardants exhibited a higher than normal prevalence of hypothyroidism.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 05, 2004 							 																						SAVING OUR LITTLE ONES Saheli Mitra																					Even as thousands of children across India were administered polio drops under the Pulse Polio vaccination programme on February 22, there were many who boycotted the campaign after news spread that some children had contracted the deadly disease after taking the vaccine. Whether the reports are true is a matter of dispute, but one thing is clear. Despite the report of the World Health Organization that India is one of the few countries where children still contract polio  West Bengal, in fact, has recorded fresh polio cases  the Pulse Polio campaign has failed to get overwhelming public support. Mere cooperation of the masses is not enough to eradicate a disease like polio. Proper knowledge of the disease is vital.																					Advertisements which have filmstars and ministers advocating the programme can attract publicity, but they can also mislead people into believing that only Pulse Polio drops can save a child from contracting polio. Whether a child gets Pulse Polio drops or not, he should certainly be given polio drops according to the normal immunization schedule. The schedule handed down by the Indian Medical Council clearly states that a child should get polio drops five times in the first year after birth, a booster dose the next year and another booster at four-and-a-half years, irrespective of the Pulse Polio drops. If a child fails to get these drops, Pulse Polio or not, he still runs the risk of getting infected with the virus.																					Villagers logic																					Uneducated villagers have so far been blamed for non-cooperation. Reports from the districts stated how irate villagers had mobbed health workers and refused to participate in the Pulse Polio programme. What was not mentioned are instances where villagers visiting local or district healthcare centres were often denied the scheduled polio drops because of non-availability of the vaccine at most health centres. 																					The aim of the Pulse Polio campaign was to administer to all children below five years the attenuated form of the virus on the same day and within a certain time, so that the antibodies that would circulate either through excretion or respiration would override the wild polio virus. Pulse Polio campaign hence aims at a social cause, not an individual one. Unless all children are individually immunized, the disease can never be eradicated. But fear of lack of hygiene, improper storage and wrong doses prevent even urbanites from participating in the programme.																					Oral cure																					The polio vaccine when given in small doses to a child, triggers the immune system to create antibodies. Theoretically, a child cannot contract polio after getting the vaccine. But if the dosage is not properly followed, then the child risks contracting polio if ever exposed to the virus. The Pulse Polio campaign insists that all children keep getting the two drops every time the programme is held till he is five.There is no evidence to suggest that if a child gets more doses of the vaccine, the vaccine will work better. 																					There is no doubt that preservation of the vaccine here is often improper. The vaccine is heat-sensitive and should be preserved at sub-zero temperature. In a warm country like India, where health workers have to travel to remote places to administer the drops, care must be taken to maintain the temperature so that the vaccine does not become useless. But officials checking the vaccines have often found that the requisite temperature was not maintained. There have been cases where children developed diarrhoea after taking the vaccine, probably because of lack of hygiene. A child even died after being administered the ink used to mark children instead of the vaccine.																					The other controversial issue is the effectiveness of the oral form of the vaccine. Some believe that injections would be better, though the oral form has successfully eradicated polio in even less developed countries like Bangladesh. Whatever the form of the vaccine, unless all children follow the usual immunization rules, India will still feature as a country where polio stalks.

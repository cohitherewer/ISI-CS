		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 							 																						ORGANIZING A PARTY Indias misfortune is that it has no political parties, says Sarmila Bose, and the only grouping which resem- bles one cannot look beyond its narrow ideology				 	 Mean street																														Among the myths about Indias democracy is the idea that it is a contest among political parties. To be sure, there are plenty of organizations commonly referred to, and officially recognized as, political parties. A well-worn joke about Bengalis is that if you have one Bengali you have a poet, if you have two Bengalis you have a political party and if you have three Bengalis, you have two political parties. By the term political party one usually means a grouping of people based on their politics  a common ideology, basic agreement on how the world works, some shared notions of governance and policy.																														While India has plenty of politics and politicians, it does not appear to have any real political parties. The only probable exception among major players is the Bharatiya Janata Party, which, unfortunately for India, chooses to represent religious sectarianism and obscurantism.																														Confusion about what political parties actually stand for is not unique to India. In Britain, New Labour turned so conservative that the Conservatives were left without space. In the United States of America, the Democratic and Republican parties are so alike that Ian Shapiro argued in The State of Democratic Theory that, logically, bipartisan collusion by this duopoly should prompt political anti-trust measures to bring about a more competitive political environment. India, however, is in a different league altogether.																														Let us start with the leader of the ruling coalition, the Congress, which dates its founding to 1885. The Congress is not, and never was, a political party. It started as a congress, meaning gathering, became a political movement, and came to be considered a party. Before Indias independence, the Congress was a broad umbrella organization whose members held a diverse range of views on important social, economic and political issues.																														At the time of independence, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi had recommended that the Congress be dissolved. So many ideas of his, thought odd or even bizarre at the time, have turned out to be words of wisdom with the benefit of hindsight! Whatever the Congress was, Indira Gandhi put paid to any chance it had of becoming a real political party. As she went about demolishing practically every institutional pillar of the still young state of India, Indira Gandhi succeeded in turning the Congress into a family property, based on personal loyalty and patronage. She opted for open family dictatorship in 1975, but was thwarted by her own miscalculation of calling an election in 1977. For a brief while in the early Nineties, it looked like the Congress might have a chance to emerge as a party, but it lost it. At present, it is a private family retainership masquerading as a political party.																														The Congress has no consistent ideology or policy vision. It used the rhetoric of socialism  like most of the rest of the country  but started the economic reform programme in 1991. However, reform was introduced under duress, as a major international financial crisis was staring the country in the face, and many in the party did not support it. Once out of power, the Congress appeared to oppose itself, by criticizing the BJPs continuation of the reforms it had started.																														Communists would normally be thought of as ideology-based political parties, but Indian communist parties are communist only in name, paying lip-service to their supposed ideology through a pro-poor rhetoric. After decades in power, the ruling communists in Bengal are corrupt and oppressive. The cadre indulge in religion, superstition and criminality. The party now woos private capital and disapproves of strikes. There are breakaway extremist groups that are more ideological, but of course they dont believe in participatory parliamentary democracy. 																														Many other parties are groups based on caste, linguistic, ethnic or regional identities which are by their very nature exclusionist, as opposed to ideas or policies that might attract anyone who believed in them. The Samajwadi Party is a regional fiefdom of Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh, based on caste identities. The Bahujan Samaj Party also offers belonging based on caste identity to the lower, most oppressed end. It is now run by Mayavati, who legitimizes her succession on the basis of her relationship to its ailing supremo, Kanshi Ram.																														Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar presents personal family rule under the label of a party. He too has a caste-based following. The now virtually extinct Trinamool Congress was the personal creation of Mamata Banerjee, who then never allowed it to become a political party. Various fragments of the Janata Party seem to be small clusters around a few individuals.																														Regional parties are based on ethnic or linguistic identity which, by definition, excludes all others. To this was added the element of caste, such as the non-Brahmin emphasis of the Dravida movement, or the Reddy versus Kamma divisions between the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra. Then there are the personality cults and family rule.																														In Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was identified with film-star/politician M.G. Ramachandran and the battle for claiming his legacy was fought between his wife and J. Jayalalithaa in terms of their relationship with him. The other regional party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, has been led for decades by M. Karunanidhi. In Andhra Pradesh there was another case of inherited legacy in Telugu Desam, the party founded by movie star turned politician N.T. Rama Rao, in which his son-in-law, N. Chandrababu Naidu, fought off the claim of NTRs widow. The irony is that Naidu is very different in terms of policy from his late father-in-law, and his policies and vision could form the basis for a real political party. Yet, during the elections TDP posters had NTRs image on them and Naidu started his daily TV appearances after paying respects to NTRs bust, prominently displayed in the background.																														Only the BJP appears to be a real political party among major players on the Indian political scene. It has an ideology. It is cadre-based. It is not led by one family. It is theoretically open at least to all castes among Hindus, though its brand of cultural nationalism via narrow religious sectarianism makes for dubious appeal to non-Hindus. It has widened its political constituency in recent years on the basis of ideology or policies.																														Not that there arent problems with this characterization  the BJP after all is not an independent political entity. It is the political arm of a bigger family  the sangh parivar  and by no means its core or defining part, which remains the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Still, it has a number of the trappings of a political party, in contrast to the family, caste or regional identity based groups.																														Voted out of power, the BJP is now wondering whether it should stand for good governance  not exactly a distinctive political ideology  or revert to the extremist religious agenda of Hindutva. Whether it decides to practice its ideology in moderate or extreme form, unfortunately for India the only party that actually resembles a political party seems unable to look beyond an ideology based on a narrow interpretation of religion, obscurantism and hatred of a contrived other.

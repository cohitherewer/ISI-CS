The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 30, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Together, well overcome				 																																																				Sir  The report, Enter union, in call centres (July 26), is quite encouraging to all of us who work in such organizations. It is the norm in call centres to work for 9 to 11 hours, night-in and night-out, for 6 days a week. A leave due to stress or illness, and you will have your salary cut. A minor mistake and you are asked to put in your papers. In addition, there is forced overtime. The situation is worse in Calcutta, where opportunities are few, and people working in call centres have hardly anywhere to move. As a child, and even as a college student, I hated politics and thought workers unions were useless. But I have found that in workplaces, especially in the unregulated areas like the call centres, exploitation is still of Dickensian proportions. We are an educated lot. We value entrepreneurship. We value work. We value profits and profitability. We understand the meaning of responsibilities. But we also need some solidarity, some kind of forum, some kind of protection. I hope the entry of unions will be good for this sunrise industry.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Kanika Mazumder, Calcutta
				 																Tax token				 																																																				Sir  Whether it is P. Chidambarams so-called concessions or Vijay Kelkars suggested reforms, tax laws continue to illustrate the adage the more things change, the more they remain the same (Kelkar salutes seniors in tax rejig, July 24). This is true especially for income-tax. It must be clear to everybody that the latest trick of making annual income upto Rs 1 lakh tax free is a fraud: those below have never been affected anyway, and it wont affect those above a whit! 				 																																																				The real reforms will begin when both the government and the public decide to become a little more honest. Why should the lowest income tax rate be as high as 20 per cent for those with gross annual incomes between Rs 1 and Rs 1.5 lakh? The answer is clear: the great majority of those who pay income tax  that is, those who can be forced to  belong to this category, being salaried people in government and organized sectors, or the self-employed and very small-scale businessmen who are hard put to keep their heads above water. The big fish have all along resisted attempts to tax them seriously. If anything is to change it will only come about after another crisis, as in 1991. 				 																																																				Which is strange, considering that a few measures, implemented stringently, is all it will take to mend matters. First, make the tax rules the same for everybody, regardless of profession. Next, make it impossible to hide large incomes (by, say, making it mandatory that all transactions above Rs 5,000 be made by cheque or credit card and all transactions above Rs 50,000 include PAN notification). Third, make tax prosecution swift and simple, and impose very heavy fines on deliberate and regular defaulters. Fourth, debar habitual defaulters from public office, and make it impossible for them and their relations to get government contracts and jobs. Fifth, monitor and rein in the global hawala racket. Sixth, lower the tax rates, beginning with a low 5 per cent for people earning upto Rs 2 lakh a year, 10 per cent for those earning upto Rs 3 lakh, rising to 30 per cent for those who earn above Rs 12 lakh a year. Finally, remove all concessions (except maybe those on life and medical insurance and provident fund savings, at least for all who earn less than Rs 6 lakh a year).				 																																																				Implementation of these will alleviate most of our current fiscal problems. Compliance is bound to rise when the public perceive the taxes to be reasonable, collected uniformly, and visibly spent for public good. But whether this solution will be resorted to is another matter. The Indian elite is nothing if not distinguished by selfishness and myopia.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur 

				 																																																				Sir  It is surprising that there has been no protest against the unreasonable and discriminatory tax structure presented in this budget, whereby those earning Rs 1 lakh will pay zero tax while those earning even a rupee more will have to pay Rs 9,180. The finance minister would have done better to take up Vijay Kelkars suggestion of doing away with all such slabs and extending the exemption of Rs 1 lakh to all taxpayers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.K. Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The rollback of the turnover tax is disappointing. Stockbrokers and the media have always advocated that the revenue deficit be reduced by cutting social spending, dismantling the public distribution system  everything except taxing them. That is, the poorest should bear the burden of cutbacks, but speculative and unproductive stock profits should never be touched. Financial market speculation has no positive effects and triggers instability but all that the stock markets have to do is make a noise and even the tiniest steps to tax them are withdrawn. There is always swift criticism of social schemes as pandering to vote banks. Where are these committed reformers when the finance minister panders to the moneybags?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shankar Gopalakrishnan, London 

				 																																																				Sir  The Kelkar report has a proposal to tax provident fund and pension plans at current rates at the time of encashment. As per section 88 of the Income Tax Act, all those who earn more than Rs 5 lakh do not get any tax rebate on their annual savings. For these people, would not the above proposal amount to double taxation, once at the time of earning and again, at the time of encashing? As for those who earn less than Rs 5 lakh, they may save 15-20 per cent tax a year for now, but will have to pay 30 per cent tax at the time of encashment.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.G. Shah, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The 2 per cent education cess on all taxes is the governments way of accepting that it has misused what it collects from us as taxes. In the circumstances, what is the guarantee that the funds collected through this cess will also not be wasted?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Vikram Basu, Calcutta

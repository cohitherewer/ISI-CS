		 Friday, May 07, 2004 							 																						ALL LIFE ENDS BADLY				 	 Surprise in storeTHE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT By Anita Brookner, Viking,  pound; 10.99
You know that another year has well and truly passed when another Anita Brookner novel arrives on the bookshelf. For the past two decades, Brookner has been writing her novels at the rate of roughly one a year, and The Rules of Engagement is her 22nd. Locating her stories in London, often with flashbacks to time spent in Paris, one would imagine that she had exhausted the possibilities of these cities and these characters. Yet she continues to surprise us with her stylish, subtle writing. 																					Brookners novels are not upbeat. Her stories have been getting sadder, and her protagonists more lonely with the years  but her prose, incredibly, gets lovelier every time. Listen to the cool elegance of the first paragraph: We met, and became friends of a sort, by virtue of the fact that we started school on the same day. Because we had the same Christian name it was decreed that she should choose an alternative. For some reason she decided to be known as Betsy. When we met up again, several years later, she was Betsy de Saint-Jorre. Not bad for a girl initially registered as Elizabeth Newton. 																					I especially like that opening qualifying phrase: not just friends, but friends of a sort (which also tells us that the rest of the book will preoccupy itself with unfolding the complex nature of this friendship). And I like that sly remark at the end of the paragraph. But our narrator, the other Elizabeth, has already noticed it herself, and moves in smoothly to repair the damage: How much nicer children were in those days than the adults they have become! she exclaims. Good manners, after all, are so important in a Brookner novel. 																					From a description of that uneasy friendship between schoolgirls, the narrative moves into the early days of Elizabeths married life, and it is not long before we hear, inevitably, the refrain of almost every Brookner heroine: But I had no friends. Elizabeth is lonely, not only within her marriage but also within her clandestine affair. I knew very little about him, she says about the lover whom she meets nearly every evening in a rented flat.																					And what does she know, then, about anything else: what does life teach her? Nothing very cheering, as one might suspect. If I had learned anything it was that the highest virtue  honour, dignity  can be subverted or negated in an instant, given the right stimulus, she tells us bleakly. As if that is not enough, she adds: I also learned that nature,that great benefactor, exacts its punishment for all the bounties hitherto enjoyed, without a thought or entitlement, and that all life ends badly.																					While Elizabeth cheats on her husband, her lover Edmund cheats on his wife (who is, incidentally, called Constance); but then Edmund discovers Betsy soon enough. And,even as Elizabeth quickly withdraws from the scene,the emotional Betsy is drawn into a vortex that will eventually consume her. 																					So far, so unsurprising  even if flawlessly narrated. It is what happens thereafter that makes this novel memorable. Brookners flat and deliberate narration has, all along, told us that whatever happens is destined to happen, and that choice has nothing to do with it. Yet, when Elizabeth finds herself alone again, our narrator decides to find something to do. Even if it is only a walk for foreign students, led by a rather dull do-gooder. At the end of the story, Elizabeth does find herself having to choose between two very different ways of spending her life. She does something very surprising: she makes the choice. The friendship of a sort turns into a very real friendship. 																					This is the intriguing thing about Brookners novels: that they seem to be set in the same places, tell us about the same or similar isolated people  and that, nevertheless, they still take us by surprise. The Rules of Engagement is an elegant, intelligent work from a master.						UMA MAHADEVAN-DASGUPTA

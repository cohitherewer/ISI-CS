		 Friday, March 12, 2004 							 																						A HEAD FOR BUSINESS Neha Sahay																					The wheels come full circle  legally acquired private property will soon be protected by the constitution of this former bastion of Marxist-Leninist thought. And why not? Given the innate business sense of the Chinese, it might have made sense for Chairman Mao to allow it full play, of course with suitable welfare restrictions.																					The Chinese seem to be born with a head for business. How else would you explain a 13-year-olds refusal to lend any of the money she had received for the Chinese new year, to her harried mother for household expenses? Her reasoning would have put Indias bankers to shame  the borrower had defaulted on the previous years loan.																					Local newspapers regularly profile successful businessmen, most of these are rags-to-riches stories. Perhaps the most remarkable was the one about the first gas-delivery man in Shenzen. Now one of the three most advanced cities in china, Shenzen was, 25 years back, a fishing village. Its strategic location  next door to Hong Kong  made it the perfect choice for a change into an urban centre, where foreigners could invest, under Deng Xiaopings new economic reform policy. City historians looking for the first landmarks of Shenzens transition, hunted high and low for the bicycle on which gas was first delivered to residents. They finally traced the delivery mans phone number from ID cards of that period. When he came to meet them, he was dressed in a business suit, driving his own Mercedes.																					Service charges																					Even our business communities would be hard put to beat the myriad ways the Chinese devise to make money, most of them totally aboveboard. Almost every restaurant in South Chinas flourishing Guangdong province offers a VIP card, which entitles the customer to a 10 per cent discount. You dont even need to be a regular to get it  on the contrary, the card ensures that you become a regular. If its not offered on the very first visit, you can ask for it and if your bill is a respectable 100-plus yuan, you are sure to get it.																					Food is cheap, but restaurants make money on small but indispensable items. In India, not even the most hard-boiled Udipi manager would object to you taking a fistful of (mini) paper napkins as you leave the restaurant. In China, the soft, often perfumed tissues come neatly wrapped in a small colourful envelope discreetly placed on the table right at the start. The envelope bears the restaurants name and a map pin-pointing its exact location in the city  the perfect calling card. Chinese food is such that you need to wipe your mouth more than once during the meal. It is only when you check the bill that you realize youve paid for that gesture. That is also when it strikes you that the mild tea poured into small cups as soon as you sit down, which you automatically raise to your lips (water isnt served unless ask for), didnt come free.																					However, some restaurants overdo this. A 19th floor sea-facing restaurant in a five-star hotel, actually charges three yuan for every chair occupied by the customer. Since you discover this at the end of the meal, it is impossible to protest that you havent used the service.																					But even here, its the Indian restaurant that takes the cake. Its hot towels are for free, but it charges for every glass of water, a decidedly un-Indian practice. And though its a place most patronized by Indians, they have to literally fight for a VIP card.																					Face lift																					In China, the desire to strike a bargain makes even beauty salons willing to lower their prices. One such salon has come up with a mind-boggling retail-services-at wholesale-prices scheme. You go in for a 50 yuan facial and are presented a 350 yuan bill. You fill in a form and discover why  the 350 yuan covers the price of 10 facials over the next 12 months.																					At 35 yuan a facial instead of 50, it looks like a great bargain, till you realize that the laughs on you. You just have to make time for those facials  if the salon remains in business, that is. Small shops often disappear in Chinas new cities, and collecting a years payment in advance is the best way to wind up a losing business.

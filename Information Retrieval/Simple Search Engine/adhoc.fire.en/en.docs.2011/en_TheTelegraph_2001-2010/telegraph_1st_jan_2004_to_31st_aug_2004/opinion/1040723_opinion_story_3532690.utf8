		 Friday, July 23, 2004 Paperback PickingsHidden in the seed, you are secureEVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Kavita Daswani is a sharply written and readable novel about a traditional Indian woman, married to an NRI in Los Angeles, going out to work for the first time in her life. In its literary pitch, it hovers, fairly skilfully, somewhere between Bharati Mukherjee and Cosmo, but is not quite Jhumpa Lahiri. Daswani was born in Hong Kong to Indian emigrant parents, worked in London and Paris, and became fashion editor of the South China Morning Post. Daswanis Priya moves from Delhi to LA and settles into obedient wifehood, when her mother-in-law pitches her into the world of a showbiz reporter in Hollywood.WRITING SUCCESSFUL TEXTBOOKS (Unistar, Rs 160) by Anthony Haynes is a surprisingly entertaining and instructive guide to producing a well-written textbook. How easy it appears to translate notes into whole chapters and thence into a complete book with a consistent style and rhythm. But it is not an easy task. It is a part of series that teaches one to write erotica, thrillers, romances, plays, scripts, travelogues and just about everything else.THE ALCHEMY OF YOGA (Fusion, Rs 150) by Osho are transcribed talks on the yoga sutras of Patanjali. They lead from the Seeds of Misery through the Existentialist Cul-de-Sac to the Alchemy of Celebration. Life is a great adventure. In the seed, hidden in the seed you are secure, protected...How can you be killed if you are not alive?GALLOPER JACK: A GRANDSONS SEARCH FOR A FORGOTTEN HERO (Pan,  5) by Brough Scott is a Channel-Four racing pundits biographical tribute to his forgotten hero of a grandfather, Jack Seely. Seely sailed to the Antipodes, fought the Boer War, was elected a Conservative MP back in England, to cross over  like his close friend, Winston Churchill  to the Liberal Party, where he became a member of Asquiths War Council. His downfall came with the Carragh mutiny, when he was forced to resign and sent to the Western Front. His insistence that there should never be another Great War led him to embrace appeasement without questioning the Nazi regime  a decision that would haunt the rest of his life. Much of this book may read like fiction but only occasionally is it a product of pure imagination rather than fact. The joy, the challenge, and, sometimes, the despair of writing about Jack Seely is that you absolutely could not make him up.

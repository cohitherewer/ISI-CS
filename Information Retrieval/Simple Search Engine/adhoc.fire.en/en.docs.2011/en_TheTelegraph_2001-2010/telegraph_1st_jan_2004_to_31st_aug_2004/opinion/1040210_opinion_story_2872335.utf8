		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 							 																						UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Effective measures																														There is a mounting body of evidence regarding the positive association between health and economic growth, indicating that a healthy population is as much a precondition for growth as a product of it. The response to HIV/AIDS, including HIV treatments, needs to be at the core of public policy, poverty reduction strategies, action for sustainable development and the preservation of human security. 																														Providing anti-retroviral treatment in resource-limited settings is possible once the right capacities are built up. A strong generics drugs industry provides much-needed competition to branded products and is a key element in ensuring affordable access to medicines...In 2001, one such attempt was made with discussions between the Pakistani and Indian pharmaceutical industry on transfer of technology, machinery and plant equipment from India to Pakistan for production of generic drugs.																														Countries like Bhutan and Maldives which do not provide the economies of scale for mass production and depend entirely on imports, must collaborate with generic drug producers in the region to source their requirements...Countries that require import of ingredients also need to ensure that their laws are in compliance with international agreements and, at the same time, allow imports from generic producers without violating these agreements.																														Issues of quality control also need to be addressed. The World Health Organisation, together with UNICEF took an important step in this direction in March 2002, when it released the first list of HIV/AIDS drugs and suppliers. The list, which is being regularly updated, includes both generic and research-based companies, anti-retrovirals and drugs for opportunistic infectionsThe WHO list highlighted the importance of quality control being an integral part of the technical capacity building exercise to set up a competitive generic industry.																														Issues relating to drug quality and effectiveness of ARV in resource-limited settings have been addressed in several studies by the WHO and independent medical researchers. The WHO, which estimates that ART can be extended to three million people by 2005, has documented treatment regimens that are designed specifically for resource-poor settings and set out guidelines for such treatments. These guidelines outline when to start ART and describe recommended first-line and second-line ARV regimens for specific subgroups of patients. The guidelines also recommend the setting up of a parallel HIV drug resistance sentinel surveillance system and innovative strategies for enhancing adherence to ART 																														Along with care and prevention, access is an essential part of the battle against HIV/AIDS. The implications of international trade treaties such as trade-related intellectual property rights and technological capabilities underscore the need for a multi-pronged approach to tackle the disease. The elements of such an approach are: ensuring prevention... and care programmes work in tandem and not in an isolated manner; studying the feasibility of providing highly active anti-retroviral therapy...and applying it where it is found to be successful; encouraging technical cooperation among countries in the region to make ARV drugs available; encouraging public-private partnerships to offer ARV drugs at reasonable prices; encouraging pharmaceutical companies to take up differential pricing for developing countries to make the drugs more affordable; adopting a larger public health approach and strengthening the general health infrastructure; and placing HIV/AIDS at the centre of development strategies and public policy.

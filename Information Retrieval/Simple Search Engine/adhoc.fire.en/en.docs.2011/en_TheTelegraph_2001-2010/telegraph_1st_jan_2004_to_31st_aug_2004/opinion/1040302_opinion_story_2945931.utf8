		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 							 																						SHIFTING SANDS The lies and deceptions of the coalition forces cannot hide the vulnerability of their position in Iraq, writes N.J. Nanporia Lets face itDuring the early stages of the latest intervention in Iraq, the running theme in all the statements made by the Bush-Blair duo and their allies was their belief that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was ready to use them. The statements were flatly made, without the slightest hint of a qualification. President George W. Bush had no doubts, nor did Dick Cheney or Colin Powell. The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, in fact, had massive evidence of Saddams clandestine activities. And now the doubts and qualifications, once non-existent or suppressed, have begun to surface.																														Tony Blair now says he doesnt know whether the elusive WMDs will be unearthed, and insists that at the time of war, he was personally unaware that Saddam Hussein did not have the ability to fire long-range chemical and biological weapons. He was also unaware, by his own admission, that the 45 minute claim in the governments September, 2002 dossier referred only to tactical battlefield weapons, and had, in fact, misunderstood a key part of the dossier. 																														As for Bush, it is apparently beneath his dignity to allow any doubts to intrude. However, in keeping with his style, he has shifted from his no doubt position to now claim that he believed that Saddam had actively pursued dangerous weapons programmes. Thus an alleged programme or intention is duplicitously equated with the actual possession of WMDs and an imminent threat to the United States of America and the world. Powell, still to recover from the embarrassment he suffered over the Algerian business at the security council, seems to be torn between his commitment to the Bush administration and his reservations about the Iraq project which he has discreetly hinted time and again. In his futile bid to keep these doubts under cover, Powell has argued that the war was justified because Saddam had refused to answer the USs questions on the WMD issue. He even over-emphatically concluded that the verdict of history would ultimately be that attacking Iraq was the right thing to do. 																														Have we here a case of someone protesting too much? Powell is asking his doubts to go away. Yet they are there for all to see. The long journey between previous conviction, real or simulated, and present doubt has been made at the cost of many thousands of lives, acute suffering, severe regional instability and global repercussions. Additionally, many complex and damaging rivalries have been let loose which the coalition or the governing council has neither the will nor the ability to contain or resolve.																														Hovering over this mess are a number of questions of which Bush and Blair are conveniently unaware. If Saddam had WMDs, why didnt he use them in a war in which his own survival was at stake? If he didnt have them, how do you explain his refusal to open the door fully for an unhindered inspection by the United Nations of his weaponry? The only conceivable answer is that Saddams status among his own people and in the Arab world rested in large part on his supposed possession of WMDs. Any admission or confirmation of his WMD innocence would have involved an extremely damaging loss of face. He therefore opted for mock resistance in the first stage and subsequently for guerrilla warfare. And it is at this point that a key question raises its head: did the Bush-Blair leadership know from day one that there were no WMDs and so tried all the harder to establish the opposite? Would the coalition have exposed its troops to a devastating Iraqi WMD backlash if there had been the remotest possibility of this happening? The assurance that there wasnt, probably enabled it not only to attack but to make confident assertions of a victory. For its own reasons and despite evidence to the contrary, the coalition emphasized Saddams WMD guilt, and for his own reasons, Saddam accepted the assertion and its consequences. Both parties read each others motives and interests pretty well  with Bush-Blair understanding Saddams vulnerability and Saddam realizing that whatever he did or didnt do, an attack was bound to come.																														The over confidence this generated in the Bush-Blair leadership explains its failure to plan for post-war nation-building and to anticipate the intensity of the guerrilla-type insurgency it now faces. Saddam, earlier labelled the demon of the day, has been displaced by an unknown number of demons. Al Qaida, of which there was hardly any trace in Iraq, is now an active force in that country. 																														Even more serious is the predicament of the American occupation forces. It had first pushed for an assembly and then focussed on the insurgents shift of targets. Its first plan is in a bind, caught between Ayatollah Ali al-Sistanis demand for an early direct election and fears that a Shia electoral dominance would reinforce Iraqs links with the Shias in Iran. There is more than a suspicion that America has turned a blind eye to hardline clerics in Iran bringing pressure on Natami reformers with the hope that Tehran will reciprocate by persuading Sistani to cooperate in Iraq. But if such a thing happens, the Americans will have to pay the price by going easy on Irans nuclear issue and leaving the Iranian reformists to their fate.																														Meanwhile the UN has endorsed Sistanis insistence on direct elections, although it agrees with the Paul Bremer administration that these cannot be held before the so-called handover of governmental authority to the Iraqis in June. This formula allows for Sistanis placation, though it also means going by the administrations intent of delaying it. Yet all this is a delicate and treacherous give-and-take enterprise, made all the more difficult for Bush in an election year. Grand visions of bringing democracy to Iraq and the Arab world and of earning the gratitude of the people whom the US and its allies have attacked have been reduced to a rather sordid bargaining with the Shias in Iraq and Iran.																														As regards the soft targets issue, it is an index of the desperation with which the coalition is trying to persuade itself that all is going well. Of course it isnt. Plans for an American military withdrawal from Baghdad and the transfer of responsibility to the US-trained Iraqi Police and army recruits can be seen for the farce they clearly are. The consensus among experts is that Baghdad will descend into immediate chaos if the handover is anything more than symbolic, and Americas failure to protect its recruits is compounded by a hasty and irresponsible withdrawal from the city.																														The attacks are designed to cripple the occupation, and Americas recognition of this is confirmed by its tactic of foisting the law and order responsibility on Iraqis who have no stomach for the task. So, as with much of the American engineered Irani scene, the distinction between soft and hard targets is misleading. The replacement of no doubts by multiple doubts has given a new transparency to Americas frustrations in Iraq.

		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 TWO ROOTS, AND LITTLE ELSE
 A three-day gala is not enough. India needs to be more proactive in using the resources and expertise of NRIs and PIOs, argues Arkadev Chatterjea		 All smiles for nowIndia may have been lax in this area, but South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Singapore have long been exploiting their expatriates for mutual benefit. A Wall Street Journal report, as long ago as April 18, 1989, talked of how the reverse brain drain helps Asia but robs US of scarce talent, and how Korea in particular benefits as scientists, engineers return to take top jobs. The article goes on to say that Asian scientists and engineers who studied in the US in the early days were eager to stay and work rather than return to underdeveloped and often despotic nations. But as democracy and development progressed, more and more highly qualified foreigners...are being lured back to help mark Asias economic miracles. 																								By contrast, the earlier generation of Indians who went to study abroad returned home, but most stay back these days. 																								The big players in Koreas booming semiconductor industry today Samsung, Goldstar and Hyundai  are all headed by defectors from Intel Corp, Honeywell Inc, and Digital Equipment Corp. No wonder, the Korean heavyweights sell a wide variety of world-class products in the global market; no Indian brand even comes close to them. The Korean science ministry estimates that some 1,200 expatriates have returned to government laboratories and universities since 1968, most of them since 1982. The ministrys target  bring back some 6,000 Korean scientists and engineers still in the US. Do Indian-policymakers have such targets? 																								Impatient with the governments foot-dragging, the Pohang Iron amp; Steel Co spent $ 200 million to establish the Pohang Institute of Science and Technology in 1986. It hired its 140 member faculty in 18 months, 120 of them from American universities and laboratories. Our former brain drain has become a blessing, said the institutes president, Kim Hogil, formerly of the University of California at Berkeley. 																								Except for the rare Birla institute, Indian companies have not built such educational institutes.																								The returning technocrat can expect no huge salaries or cushy life-styles  Korean scientists in Korea earned less than half their US colleagues. The recruiters thus seek to counter this by inducing homesickness and preaching patriotism. For example, there is opportunity to do great science in Korea, they say. 																								Of course, returning Indians get even less between one-fifth and one-tenth of their salary in the US. 																								According to one Korean who came back, Korea has basic engineering skills in abundance, but it lacks people who can manage those resources. In the US I learned how to manage the process of technological development. India makes no efforts to bring back talented managers  if so, it would be famous for more than its computer experts.																								Young Koreans who intend to study in the US, want to bring back their know-how to the country. But do the Indian youth have similar pride and dreams of self-reliance for their country?																								Long tormented by China and subjugated for four decades by Japan, Korea was devastated by the Korean war in which some 40 lakh people were injured or killed. Talented Koreans deserted the country in droves. South Korea was often run by dictators like Park Chung Hee, who suppressed civil liberties and political freedom, and ruled the country with an iron fist. Interestingly, Parks 18-year rule, from 1961 to 1979, brought about enormous economic expansion  it was also the time when political and business leaders started wooing Korean scientists and engineers settled abroad and tried to bring them back home. And thus began the reverse brain drain. 																								By contrast, India is only belatedly realizing that it may be beneficial to reach out to the NRIs and PIOs. It had seemed to believe that talented and trained people would leave and not come back. Consequently, India has many more talented and trained people abroad than Korea. But the Indian record of reaching out to them has been miserable so far. They only contact us when they need foreign exchange, feels a Harvard educated, India-based PIO. 																								Most NRIs and PIOs feel they are like a quadratic equation  two roots, and no more. They may be paid highly abroad, but in India they are worthless. Consider the case of a doctor, a member of the United Kingdoms Royal College of Psychiatry, who came back to stay with her parents. She has job offers from British hospitals and goes to England every year to work as a locum consultant for a few months, for a hefty paycheck. But the Indian government will not touch her. Since the late Seventies, India does not recognize medical qualifications acquired in the UK or the US because they dont recognize ours. This patriotism argument may appeal to many, but a little introspection will show that its sole purpose is to protect the interests of Indian doctors by thwarting competition. And India pays the price.																								Yes, there may be a Chittaranjan Ranawat, who successfully operated on the prime minister, and does a few operations in Mumbai every year. He was even awarded the Padma Bhushan in recognition. But is there a system to steadily bring back NRI and PIO doctors to help the millions of ordinary patients back home, who lose out because there arent enough doctors to treat them? And what about the future doctors who lose out because there arent enough professors to train them? 																								It is the same with academics. A PIO who did post-doctoral research in the United States of America and returned to live with her family in India, had a harrowing time trying to get permission from the Central government to teach or do research work  you must be an Indian citizen to get jobs in government colleges, universities, and institutes. She lost out to candidates backed by political parties. 																								The UK and US have no such hang-ups  professors like Amartya Sen and Sugata Bose of Harvard University; Shyam Sunder of Yale, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak of Columbia, Mukul Majumdar and Tapan Mitra of Cornell, and many other renowned scholars have retained their Indian citizenships. They pay a price for this they have to get visas when attending international conferences because many countries exempt US citizens but require visas from Indian nationals. And as Indian citizens, it is unclear whether they are eligible for social security payments although the US government routinely deducts money from their paycheck while they work in that country. It is for them especially that India should start granting dual citizenship, along with full voting rights  does it make sense for people to forgo other citizenships and sacrifice self-interest? 																								Emotions aside, what are the real pluses and minuses? As one retired bureaucrat, himself a PhD from an Ivy League university asked, why should we treat one million people specially when there are one billion to be taken care of? 																								Of course, NRIs and PIOs are no kings. And when reaching out, one has to keep two issues in mind. The first, concerns the emotional appeal to bring back all the sons of India, stoking a desire akin to what the Jews feel for returning to the Promised Land. The second issue is practical. Obviously, India should first reach out to those who are likely to be most useful and then work down the priority list. India desperately needs to build top-notch hospitals for the sick, excellent businesses to find employment for people and world class universities to educate the youth. 																								But who among the PIOs and NRIs would be interested in India? There are many successful middle-aged Indians settled abroad, who have built a nest egg, educated the kids and now yearn to do something for the motherland. There are many second generation Indians interested in teaching or researching at an Indian university or serving in a hospital, who would like to spend a year in India with the spouse, discovering the ancestral land and exploring roots. Many Jewish academics make such trips to Israel, which further strengthens the outstanding Israeli universities. There are many fresh graduates who would like to stay with their parents and work in India, without sacrificing too much of the economic rewards such a life would bring. So why is India still reluctant?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 							 																						LARGE, BUT NOT MATURE Gouri Chatterjee																					Barely two months to go and what do we know of the issues that will shape the 14th Lok Sabha? Only what the ruling party would like us to know. 																					Vajpayee, Vajpayee, Vajpayee, development, development, development, India, India, India, as put by the BJP president, M. Venkaiah Naidu. And Sonia Gandhis foreign origin on the side.																					But are these the issues that are foremost in the voters mind? 																					We dont know. 																					The BJP wont tell us, the Congress is probably clueless and the media are simply not bothered.																					I suppose thats the difference between a mature democracy and a large democracy. 																					More than nine months to go and the American presidential race is already throwing up issues that are nowhere near George Bushs war-on-terror agenda. Thorny issues that all politicians would rather avoid on election eve. They cant, because the media there dont hesitate to voice the concerns of ordinary Americans. Even those who are at the bottom of the heap, as those affected by outsourcing are.																					The Indian media are far more choosy. They are delighted to pick up the gauntlet for the IIMs but can only sneer at concerns about the Supreme Court judgment on strikes or WTO rules on the import of foodgrains. So it may be only after the elections that well find out what the Indian voter truly wants.																					It is quite appropriate that the deputy prime minister had the feel good brainwave at an Economic Times function. Selling feel-good (and not social responsibility) is the Times groups undying contribution to the nations media. 																					Second in the list																					It may be honesty and not mere modesty that prevented the India Today editor from including his name in his magazines power list of 2004. News magazines as a genre are no longer that hot; India Today in particular has been on a losing pitch for some years now.																					It was still an impressive show of will-power though. It couldnt have been easy to be missing from a list that puts media as the second most powerful group that guides the countrys destiny and its dreams, only a step behind businessmen/industrialists. Even Bollywoods dream merchants are not found to be as influential as the media czars. 																					Almost a quarter of the individuals singled out for their standing in their own field and the importance of that activity are from the media. Evidently, the India Today editor suffers from no false notions of modesty about the role of his profession in society. 																					Of course, it is easy to feel important in a list that keeps out the truly powerful, those who are powerful because of the office they hold like the prime minister, ministers, bureaucrats and their kith and kin. 																					Still, what would we call politicians who ranked themselves higher than artists or writers: honest or self-serving?																					Tough choice																					For journalists, moral dilemmas come with the territory. Still, this question doing the rounds on the Net is a real tough one.																					Imagine youre in Florida. In Miami, to be exact. There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe flood. There are huge masses of water all over you. Houses and people float all around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destructive power and is ripping everything away with it. 																					You are an Associated Press photographer sent to record this great disaster. 																					Suddenly you see a man in the water who looks vaguely familiar. He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. 																					You move closer. Then, you know who it is  its George W. Bush! 																					You have two options. You can save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot what will certainly be a Pulitzer-Prize-winning photo. A unique photo displaying the death of one of the worlds most powerful men. 																					And heres the question. Please give an honest answer: 																					Would you select colour film, or go with the simplicity of classic black-and-white?

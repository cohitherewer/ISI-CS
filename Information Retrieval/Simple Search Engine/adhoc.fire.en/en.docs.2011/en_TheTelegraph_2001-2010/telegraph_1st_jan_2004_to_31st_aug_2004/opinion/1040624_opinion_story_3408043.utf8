		 Thursday, June 24, 2004  HOW TO PERFORM THE BALANCING ACT 
India will be lucky to get a budget that sticks to the straight and narrow path of fiscal stability without too much taxation and populism, writes S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve Bank of India Miracle man P. Chidambarams budget, due on July 8, 2004, is being eagerly awaited by the public. The general expectation seems to be that Chidambaram will produce the same miracle as he did in his last effort at budget-making. Perhaps, it is too much to expect a repeat performance from Chidambaram, constrained as he is by the contradictory demands of various coalition partners as well as by his own fiscal compulsions.The budget exercise that Chidambaram is to make on July 8 will be an essay in constrained optimization. Definitely, he cannot please all. It will be a miracle if he manages to please the majority of sensitive stakeholders. Chidambaram has set himself an ambitious target of fiscal balance directed at reducing revenue deficit, cutting it to zero by 2010. Obviously, he is caught between a rock and a hard place  the constraints of reduction in revenue deficit conflicting with the demand for higher outlays to stimulate the economy. But Chidambaram is known to be one of the few ministers who are able to overcome such hurdles. He has done so before. So the people and the markets naturally expect a miracle once again.Will Chidambaram be able to produce a budget that pleases most economic agendas and yet meets the goals of fiscal stability? It is, indeed, a happy circumstance that the latest accounts show that the fisc is behaving better than it was earlier. The latest accounts of the government of India as elected from the tables in the Reserve Bank of India bulletin of May 2004, show that the actual tax revenue for 2003-04 was almost as high as expected in the revised estimates (Rs 187,339 crore in revised estimates matched by provisional actuals of Rs 186,932 crore). The revenue deficit in 2003-04 was Rs 98,308 crore as against the revised estimate of Rs 99,860. The fiscal deficit of 2003-04 was almost the same as predicted in the revised estimates.The budget estimates produced by Jaswant Singh for 2004-05, which were based on the revised estimates of 2003-04, have, therefore, a reasonable chance of being realized  provided, of course, that the proceeds from privatization are as expected. This last element is a factor which Chidambaram will find difficult to accommodate. But he may be able to bridge the gap, thanks to the expected profits which may be made by public sector oil majors due to the bonanza of crude oil price increases. Higher dividends would have to be squeezed from the public sector units, especially in the oil sector as also the RBI, in order to make up for the threatened loss of privatization proceeds. But, all in all, it is the good fortune of Chidambaram that corporate organizations in India, in both the public and private sector, have been generally on a roll recently. Tax collections, therefore, seem to be more on track than expected earlier. The prospects of Chidambaram at least reaching the targets of fiscal deficit as indicated by his predecessor are bright  given the cooperation of the PSUs and the RBI.In this context, the United Progressive Alliance government has to be complimented for taking up the challenge posed by the petroleum products pricing mess left by the National Democratic Alliance government. Apparently, the NDA had postponed passing on the global price rise of crude oil to domestic consumers in the hope that the polls would go in their favour as a result of such inaction. The Central Election Commission came dangerously close to hauling the previous government over the coals for this lollipop. Anyway, the Manmohan Singh government has been realistic in not burdening the budget with subsidies to correct global rises in prices of petrol, diesel and LPG. The consumer learns to pay what the oil companies have to pay to procure and distribute petroleum products.Of course, there remains the vexed question of kerosene, which is still being subsidized. Subsidized kerosene strikes a sympathetic chord, particularly in leftist ears, as cheaper kerosene is supposed to benefit the poor. But while cheap kerosene helps the poor, it primarily benefits the transport operators who use such kerosene to mix with diesel. This adulteration harms the poor even more than it benefits them. In fact, the supply of kerosene at a lower price increases the temptation of transport operators to dilute the costlier diesel. Besides, it encourages smuggling of kerosene to neighbouring countries. In both cases, the poor of India stand deprived. Which means, the Central budget has to find resources through additional taxes to pay for the kerosene subsidy. It is earnestly hoped that Chidambaram is able to lay the ghosts of cheap kerosene well before the budget or at least as part of it.The agenda before the finance minister is a challenging one. He has to find funds for the new schemes that the common minimum programme includes. In particular, he has to find resources for the employment guarantee programme, the scheme of mid-day meals, the programme of higher expenditure on primary education  and all this within the constraints of a reduced deficit. While the CMP has abjured divestment of profit-making PSUs, it has committed itself to a substantially higher investment on infrastructure, particularly in the rural sector.One possible solution to this problem  not much loved by the monetary purists  is for Chidambaram to use the abundant liquidity in the banking system through public-private partnerships for infrastructure investments. The establishment of the Infrastructure Development Corporation was one of the bold initiatives of Chidambaram in his last term as finance minister. That institution still offers great hope for the revival of much-needed investment in infrastructure. It needs to be rescued from the self-inflicted injury  an ill-timed and inappropriate move to merge it with the State Bank of India. Chidambaram will need to give the IDC all the support he can.W ith regard to the rural sector, Chidambaram had initiated the idea of a Rural Infrastructure Fund to which banks contributed. As it turned out, the RIF has been reduced to a shadow of its original idea. The finance minister needs to breathe fresh life into RIF. Rural irrigation systems can also get fresh support from bank funds through dedicated state government irrigation improvement debentures. Such bonds have to be repaid in time. This means a corresponding obligation for levy and collection of user-charges, including betterment taxes from beneficiaries who gain as a result of irrigation improvements. Recent experience with irrigation debentures in Maharashtra has, however, been disappointing. The finance minister has to guard against states raising funds and playing truant on user-charges.When the finance minister makes the budget, he necessarily has to keep in mind the sentiments of investors in the stock market. While market sentiment cannot be the sole determinant of budget policy, the investors in the markets do have a role to play. The stock markets have an important place in our financial system. The finance minister has to balance his fiscal concerns with concerns that keep in mind stock market reactions. His last budget was, however, a magic wand that stimulated the bourses. This has whetted the appetite for more of the same. Will Chidambaram be able to repeat his feat?On the whole, I feel that for this reason Chidambaram will not resort to too high a measure of additional taxation. The best he can do is follow the prescriptions of Vijay Kelkar. He has to tread warily because he may be in danger of upsetting too many stakeholders. But, by and large, the Kelkar task force provides a good roadmap for tax reform. It has got political acceptance from many quarters  barring, of course, the proposal to levy taxes on farm incomes. I doubt whether Chidambaram will venture to touch this proposal with a bargepole.As for value added tax, he has just received Asim Dasguptas report on a consensus reached by the state finance ministers. But the practical problems faced by state governments earlier in introducing VAT should be an object lesson for Chidambaram. The coming budget cannot be one expected to set the bourses on fire. We will be lucky to get a budget that sticks to the straight and narrow path of fiscal stability without too much additional taxation and too many populist giveaways. The markets will have reason to cheer if Chidambaram refrains from populist measures but increases investment outlays. The people at large will have cause to be happy if the budget proposes measures to stimulate investment and job growth, both in the farm and non-farm sectors. We cannot find a better person than Chidambaram  functioning as he does under the enlightened leadership of Manmohan Singh  to perform this balancing task with finesse and dignity.

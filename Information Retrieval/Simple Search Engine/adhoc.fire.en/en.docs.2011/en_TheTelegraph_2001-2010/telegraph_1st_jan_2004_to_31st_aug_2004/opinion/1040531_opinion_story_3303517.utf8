		 Monday, May 31, 2004 							 																						NUCLEAR WITH A CAUSEGwynne Dyer																					Lovelock is an independent scientist who grew wealthy by inventing equipment to measure the presence of chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals used in spray cans and refrigerators that were destroying the ozone layer before they were banned. But his real claim to fame, was his insight that the Earth is a living system.																					Not enough																					He often regrets having named that system Gaia (after the Greek goddess of the Earth), because the Green movement and various New Agers started using it as a beautiful metaphor, and delayed its acceptance as a valid scientific observation. But it is finally being accepted by the scientific community worldwide: last December the scientific journal Nature gave Lovelock two pages to summarize recent developments in the field.																					Lovelock has always been worried about radical climate change, because the essence of the Gaia hypothesis is that the current composition of the Earths air and seas  the global temperature regime, the salinity of the oceans, even the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere  has been shaped by the activity of living things. Our planet would be radically different, he argues, if living things did not actively maintain the status quo that is so hospitable to life.																					Recent evidence, including last summers unprecedented heat wave in Europe and new data on the speed at which the Greenland ice-cap is melting, has persuaded Lovelock that global warming is now moving far faster than most studies anticipated, and will have calamitous effects on key support systems of human civilization like food production in decades rather than centuries. He doesnt believe that current efforts to reduce the output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases through the Kyoto accord (which has still to be ratified, in any case) and the encouragement of power generation by wind, wave and solar power can possibly cut carbon emissions enough in time.																					Only option																					So the man says that there should be a massive expansion of nuclear power, which produces hardly any carbon, to deal with the inevitable growth of demand for power without toppling the world into climate change so abrupt and extreme that it would cause a massive human die-off. The problems of radioactive waste and the danger of nuclear accidents are minuscule by comparison, and there is no third alternative.																					Only France and Japan among the developed countries get most of their electrical power from nuclear energy. No new nuclear power plants have been built in the United States of America or Britain for over 20 years: the fear factor linked to the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl killed the market. But those were local disasters that caused limited damage, not massive and irreversible changes for the worse in the whole planetary environment, and with better design and more attention to safety they might have been avoided.																					Would we be on the brink of massive climate change now if the nuclear power industry had continued to replace fossil-fuel-burning plants at the rate we expected in the late Fifties and early Sixties? Almost certainly not. Wed have a much smaller problem, and more time to deal with it. Lovelock has done us all a favour: this debate is long overdue.

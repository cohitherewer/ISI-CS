		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 							 																						ROAD TO REVENGE																														The war on terror has its armoury of images. The latest is that of a 67-year-old man, virtually blind and quadriplegic, being wheeled out from his morning prayers to be hit by three Hellfire missiles fired from a remote-controlled Apache helicopter. The assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Islamist group, Hamas, in Gaza City had been authorized by the prime minister of Israel, Mr Ariel Sharon. In the long territorial dispute between the state of Israel or the Jewish settlers and the local Arabs over the Gaza Strip and West Bank, this latest piece of action by Mr Sharon starts a new and grimmer phase. Between 1967 (when the conflict took on its modern contours) and now, this dispute over land has grown into a nationalist struggle, to be taken up eventually into the global war on terror. According to this expanded vision of things, the two antagonists, locked in what has begun to look like a deadly embrace, are no less than Islam and Zionism. On the other hand, there are the realities of power and the lived histories of the Jews and Arabs in this region. These have become part of a network of political and economic relations largely commanded by the United States of America, but also involving the rest of Asia and the other Western nations, some of which are part of the United Nations. India, duly appalled by Yassins assassination, is also part of this matrix that is increasingly defined by its shared investment in the eradication of terror.																														This terror seems to have been given a new articulation by Mr Sharons decision to kill Yassin  described by Yassins successor within Hamas as a man in a nation, and a nation in a man. Or could this be, bizarrely, a milestone in the road to peace? And how is that road to be charted now, when an entire edifice of negotiations, accords and settlements have been swept aside by the endlessly bipolar logic of revenge? Even President George W. Bushs road-map for a two-state solution  living side by side in peace and security  sounds pass now, although that too had been more a plan for pacification than for peace. Yassin may have been the godfather of the suicide bombers. But he understood the limits of violence and the strategic importance of these limits, unlike his successors now, whose manner of undermining the relative moderation of the Palestine Authority and its Fatah faction is likely to be far more extreme. The vocabulary has changed now, quite irrevocably. Mr Sharon wants to wipe out the entire Hamas leadership before withdrawing from Gaza. And Hamas replies that the war now is open.

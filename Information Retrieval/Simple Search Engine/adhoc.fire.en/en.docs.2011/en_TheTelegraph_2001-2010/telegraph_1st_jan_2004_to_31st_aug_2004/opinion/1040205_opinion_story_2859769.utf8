		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 							 																						LEARNING TO LOSE																														In politics, as in sport, bad losers walk out of the game. Assams former chief minister, Mr Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, has to prove that he can take defeat in his stride. The easiest thing he can do is to walk out of the party, following his defeat in the elections for the post of president of the Asom Gana Parishad. But given the experience of former fellow-travellers who went that way, this may not be the wisest option before Mr Mahanta. In fact, the election of Mr Brindaban Goswami as the new AGP president shows that a leader can come up from behind and win the party race. Mr Goswami too had taken the easy route, in 1990, of quitting the party and forming a breakaway group, only to return to the AGP two years later. Instead of sulking as the leader of a party caucus, Mr Mahanta may help himself with some self-introspection. He would do well to ask himself why and how he lost the support of a party which he had founded and led for 16 long years. Honest answers to the question could help his own and the partys cause. 																														What Mr Mahanta eventually does could be crucial not only to the AGP but also to its place in the regional politics of the North-east. The AGP is the only major party in the region that has kept away from Mr P.A. Sangmas newly-formed forum of north-eastern parties. Much of the tussle between Mr Mahanta and Mr Goswami had to do with the partys troubled alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Murmurs of another split in the AGP will obviously be music to the ears of Congressmen in Assam because that would further weaken the prospects of the AGP-BJP alliance for the coming Lok Sabha elections. But what Mr Goswami does with his convincing victory will also largely determine the shape of things for the party. It would be a sure recipe for disaster if he uses his election to settle old scores and removes Mr Mahantas men from key party positions. The problem is that parties in India, particularly the small ones, are often just ego-trips for their leaders, who have little love lost for genuinely democratic values.

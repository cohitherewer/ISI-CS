The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Dark side of the shine				 																																																				Sir  Given the delicate state of the prime ministers knees, it is possible that he could not stand the idea of doling out more sops. Or did he simply run out of promises? Whatever it may be, citing the Election Commissions model code of conduct as the reason for stalling the announcement of farm-sops is not likely to go down too well with the voters (Sop-less Vajpayee disappoints farmers, March 19). Apart from a few promises here and there, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government has done precious little for the Indian farmer. Starvation deaths, suicides and natural disasters continue to ravage this community across the country. The real villains of the story, of course, are government apathy, poor infrastructure and increasing competition from global products. None of these issues are ever addressed. For Vajpayees ilk, farmers represent nothing more than a vote bank, one which can be easily conned with empty promises and ad hoc pre-election sops.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Brototi Sen, Calcutta
				 																Up for grabs				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitra has done Indians a great service by exposing the political conspiracy behind the giving away of one of Indias most prized assets to a foreign company (Slippery surface, March 19). The selling of the underpriced shares of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission to an American investment tycoon, without any consideration for market realities, indicates that the American entrepreneurial invasion of India has begun in earnest. The government must shoulder the blame, since the public sector undertakings are its responsibility. To contain the damage that began with the sale of the Centaur hotel, a change of guard is necessary. The silent acquiescence of the Congress in this sordid affair, as Mitra correctly states, is disappointing. Local investors, who were not permitted to buy shares worth more than Rs 50,000, were in the dark about the foreign hand. The government should introduce an investors education programme to protect the local investors from being conned. The involvement of the same minister in both the Centaur hotel and ONGC deals, Mitra correctly infers, points to murkier happenings if the ministers party comes back to power. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Ashok Mitras accusation that the ONGC shares were sold below their floor price betrays his lack of knowledge about the way the price of a share is ascertained. Share prices in the stock market hardly reflect the net worth of a company. Mitras argument that Warren Buffet is likely to sell his holdings to American oil conglomerates such as Exxon, Mobil and Chevron is no more than a palmists prediction. Why should American oil companies buy shares from a broker and not bid directly? Also, will Mitra kindly explain what prevented Indian companies like Reliance or the Unit Trust of India from bidding for these shares which were up for throw-away prices?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

				 																																																				Sir  The oil infrastructure of India was painstakingly developed with the goal of making the country self-reliant. PSUs like the ONGC were part of this plan. They were certainly not meant to be sold half a century later to the capitalists for some easy money. It is surprising to see a government, which has been so thoroughly incapable of reviving the economy, generating employment, pumping finances into the social sectors and establishing financial discipline, resort to selling its most valuable assets to foreign buyers. Should we make it easy for the new breed of colonizers?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Phani Bhushan Saha, Balurghat

				 																Hollow praise				 																																																				Sir  So the Shiv Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, needed a cricketers words to prove his secular credentials (Zaheer bowls over Tiger, March 17). No wonder he considers Zaheer Khan a real Hindustani Muslim. After all, the Indian cricketer recently told Pakistani journalists that the minority community in India had no problems with Thackeray. There is nothing wrong if Khan nurtures a personal fondness for Thackeray. But Khan cannot speak for all Indian Muslims, who will find it difficult to forget so easily Thackerays role during the Mumbai riots of 1992-93. Thackeray is also on record saying that all Indian Muslims should be deported to Pakistan. 				 																																																				No amount of praise from a Muslim cricketer can absolve the Shiv Sena chief of his past sins. Thankfully, it is not required that Indian Muslims owe allegiance to communal individuals like Thackeray. One can be against his divisive policies and still be a loyal citizen of India.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Serajuddin Khurram, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Too much importance is being given to Zaheer Khans comments about Bal Thackeray. Maybe it should be seen as an Indians defense of a fellow countryman on foreign soil, and left at that. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashutosh Pandey, Ranchi 

				 																																																				Sir  Will Zaheer Khan pause to think why his favourite Indian, Bal Thackeray, does not have to use terms like patriotic Hindus or a real Hindustani Hindu? The cricketer cannot be so nave as not to realize that in Thackerays world-view, all Hindus are necessarily patriotic Indians, which only a few Muslims are. It is understandable that as a new celebrity settler in Mumbai, Khan needs Thackerays blessings. But perhaps there were other ways of obtaining it than going over the top while facing Pakistani journalists.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Zaheer Khans effusive praise of the Shiv Sena chief indicates that the minority communitys attitude towards Bal Thackeray has undergone a significant change.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																Give back the list				 																																																				Sir  The new-look Etc is a visual delight. But the omission of the weeks film-movie schedule is difficult to accept. Thousands of readers like myself wait for the Friday Telegraph to have a look at this schedule. It should be brought back in its original form.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunita Prasad, Kankinara, 

				 																																																				North 24 Parganas				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph has taken an extremely ill-advised decision in discontinuing the weekly television guide in Etc. Since the number of pages has remained the same, there is no reason why the silly filmi gossip cannot be cut down to accommodate the TV listings. The newspaper will lose several subscribers if this is not done soon.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anand Kumar Sinha, Calcutta

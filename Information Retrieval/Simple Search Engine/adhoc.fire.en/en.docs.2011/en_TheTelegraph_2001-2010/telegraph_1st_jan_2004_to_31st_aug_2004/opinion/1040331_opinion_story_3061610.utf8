		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 							 																						CITIES OF HISTORIES Shobita PunjaOne of the unique features of Indian cities is that most of them have been around for a long time. Delhi traces its antiquity to the period of the Mahabharata or the last few centuries before the Christian era. Calcutta is now over 400 hundred years old. There is an old and a new city of Madras, and the same is the case with Cochin, Patna and many others.																					The character of the old city within the contemporary city is singular, typical of that region and gives a sense of history to the present. The old city has an organic feel about it, suggesting that it has grown with human beings rather than being made by them artificially, on the draft board. The streets are narrow, the shops are designed in a way so as not to be far from the living area, and sometimes the living quarters are on the first floor above. The houses and buildings in the old area have a typical architectural style of the region or its colonial past. 																					The old part of the town has grown under the pressures of history, politics and economic necessities. The old city of Kanchipuram has areas that were exclusively for workshops and traders. Benaras was famous for its weaving crafts and the old town reflects that ancient tradition. The town of Jaipur was designed by Sawai Jai Singh in 1725 and still carries the splendid processional paths for royal festivities, the bazaars in one quarter of the town and the palace in another, each interconnected and yet distinct.																					The towns grew with additions in each phase of its history, reflecting its own preoccupations and personality. Many areas of Delhi were caravan serais or places where caravans would stop on their days journey to other parts of the city. So we still have Yusuf serai and Mughal serai and places that speak of traders and armies halting beside gardens and baghs, with tents where they could rest awhile.																					Most tourists who come to our cities always make it a point to see the old city because they know that that is where the real India lives. The cities are different from the ones they are familiar with in the West, but not so dissimilar from the old towns of west Asia like Istanbul or Damascus, where souks and vernacular architecture can still be seen.																					Old and new																					How we can train our town planners to sensitively understand the character of these old quarters? These areas of distinct style need to be maintained, yet must be given modern amenities. Facilities need to be introduced for the residents of water, sanitization and proper electricity.																					How do we integrate the development of the entire city while preserving the form and beauty, the character and personality of the old town?																					In cities like Padua and Florence in Italy, people have made a brave attempt to do just that. The facades of the buildings are maintained; the streetscapes preserved, but within, the homes and shops of these amazing structures are fitted with all the modern facilities needed today. This is not done by stringing electricity wires from one side of the road to the other, or putting water taps on the street that drip and stain the walls of an old building, but are designed with care and aesthetic sensibility so that utilities dont stand out like a sore thumb against the old fabric of the city. One can walk through the streets of Florence and not be horrified by the blatant lack of infrastructure, filth, poor municipal planning and town management.																					The joy of walking into the past and seeing layers of history, a Mughal structure and then what the British added and how the town lived in each period is the distinct pleasure of our towns. The pleasurable experience of food and flavours, scents and sounds and special crafts makes for a genuine case for sensible integrated conservation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 							 																						SERVANT PROBLEM																														Identity cards and uniform  domestic service in some housing estates in Calcutta is becoming new age. Avant-garde policing and Middle Calcutta have at last seen eye to eye on one issue. What unites them is fear. Servants are becoming a security problem, and so they have to be brought within some sort of strict vigilance. There will be registration forms, with essential information fed into a police database. The police are impressed with the ready cooperation from most residents. Sixty-one cards have been issued, and some uniforms. The scheme might revolutionize the policing of servants in the city. And this is possibly the only revolution that domestic servitude will earn for itself in India in the foreseeable future. 																														A medieval combination of slavery, bonded labour, child labour, selective untouchability and benevolent feudalism marks the lives of servants in most urban Indian households. Miserably underpaid, wretchedly overworked, lacking the most basic employment benefits (leave, medicals, social security) and denied the basic human rights, domestic servitude thrives in globalized India as slavery did in republican Rome or Enlightenment Europe and America. New thinking on the unorganized sector, labour law reforms, activism against child labour and sexual harassment at work  all these have managed to make very little difference to the working lives of those who come in to cook and clean for Middle India. The country has taught itself to laud the professionalization of sex-work, but there is a gut-level resistance to domestic servants organizing themselves in any form to demand certain basic entitlements. Every day, hundreds of thousands of women come into the city from the villages and suburbs to do thika work in its homes. It occurs to very few of their employers that they might need to go to the toilet or keep their children in some sort of a creche if they cannot manage to leave them with anybody at home. City NGOs attempting to organize these facilities for part-time maidservants working in co-operative housing estates invariably meet with the sharpest opposition from the residents  a response that is the exact obverse of the ready co-operation which the police got from the residents when the issue happened to be one of their own security. Would the police tackle the problems of child labour and physical or sexual abuse with the same alacrity and concern if the domestics started reporting against their masters? To criminalize domestic servants without addressing what is fundamentally wrong with the entire system is to make sure that the attitudes of their masters remain where they have been for the last 300 years.

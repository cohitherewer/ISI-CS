The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A fathers crusade				 																																																				Sir  Vitthalbhai Pandyas crusade to get justice for his slain son might queer the pitch for the Bharatiya Janata Party in Gandhinagar (Pandya father readies to take on Advani, March 29). But it will not bring him victory, the only thing that matters. Some voters may be swayed by the old mans charges of a politically-motivated botch-up of the investigations into Haren Pandyas murder. But they will be in a minority and will not be able to stand up to the resources  in terms of men, organizational machinery and money  that L.K. Advani will be able to mobilize. Sadly, the Indian voter may be browbeaten, bribed or fooled into voting in favour of one politician, but he will not be moved by injustice into not voting for another. Or how does one explain criminals getting elected from the area where they have been active? Instead of going to the people, Pandya would have been better off appealing to the judiciary, which has a better record of redressing wrongs, especially in Gujarat.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Moyna Sen, Calcutta
				 																Unfair cut				 																																																				Sir  Murli Manohar Joshis insistence on cutting fees at the Indian Institutes of Management is a populist measure meant to woo middle-class voters before the general elections. A 10-15 per cent drop would have been understandable, but not the drastic cut from Rs 150,000 to Rs 30,000. If Joshi has only noble intentions of helping poor students, why has his ministry of human resource development refused to give the undertaking to preserve the IIMs autonomy, as desired by the Supreme Court (Govt plays hardball, SC reopens IIM case, March 20)? The minister has said that the IIMs were established by the government and hence it can interfere. But besides founding them, what has the government done to make the IIMs the elite centres for management education that they are today? Joshis intervention was not needed for there has not been a single case of a student who did not join an IIM for lack of funds, after having cleared the entrance test. Such students have a number of scholarships and loans available to them. Also, the minister has made allegations of financial irregularities in the IIMs without giving any evidence. Let the accounts be audited and if any discrepancies are found, the guilty must be punished. 				 																																																				If Joshi has his way, the IIMs could go the way of government colleges, with their appalling infrastructure and educational standards, missing lecturers and student politics. In this regard, Joshis disparaging comments about N.R. Narayana Murthy in a recent interview were in very poor taste. The Infosys chief is a globally-acclaimed technocrat, who has created more millionaires than Joshi has created literates. Instead of toying with the IIMs, Joshi should turn his attention to the management schools which are making capital of the craze for management education and duping students with their inflated fees and inferior education. 				 																																																				Perhaps Joshi is gearing up for his next crusade  rechristening the IIMs as the MVMs or Management Vidya Mandirs.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ullas Pradhan, Cuttack 

				 																																																				Sir  Instead of lowering the IIM fees, Murli Manohar Joshi can create a fund to assist needy students. This will help the minister achieve his stated objective of aiding poor students, without disturbing the current fee structure. It would also help the government conserve resources, since it would mean that those who can pay for their IIM education are not subsidized. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Garib Nath Sah, Danapur

				 																																																				Sir The decision over the fee-cut should be left to the IIMs and the students. After all, the business concerns them directly. The HRD ministry should concentrate instead on strengthening primary education.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avinash Gupta, Bandel 

				 																																																				Sir  Most institutions in India suffer from state neglect. But the IIMs have the misfortune of falling prey to an activist minister. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sunil Garodia, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Thus far, Murli Manohar Joshi has proved to be a better strategist than the management gurus at the IIMs. My respect for our politicians has increased.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
P. Thomas Rajan, Durgapur

				 																																																				Sir  I have a suggestion for M.M. Joshi. Instead of reducing course fees, the government should ensure poor students at the IIMs get loans at low interest rates and so that besides paying for their education, they can also contribute to the family coffers. The loan may be given against a mortgage of their future degree certificate. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is good that industrialists and members of the IIM boards like N.R. Narayana Murthy and M.S.Banga, are fighting the government over its proposed fee cut (IIM battle in peoples court, Feb 26). After all, as Narayana Murthy rightly said, poor students can scarcely afford Rs 30,000 if they are unable to pay Rs 150,000. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rimli Datta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  M.S. Banga, N.R. Narayana Murthy and their ilk are making it seem as if they are the only ones to care about the IIMs and management education in India. So why dont they make up the shortfall caused as a result of M.M. Joshis fee cut? After it, it is the corporate bodies run by them that benefit the most from the IIMs. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  There is a lot of unnecessary hoopla over the IIMs and IITs, which may be good, but are certainly not the best. Moreover, the products of these institutions are available neither to the nation nor to Indian industry since most of them go abroad and serve foreign companies. We must realize that the IITs and IIMs are not intelligence chambers to inject intelligence into students. Students of these institutions are good because only the best are taken in after rigorous screening. We must also realize that nature has distributed talent, creativity, intelligence and competence uniformly. These qualities are quite common and certainly no institute can claim proprietorship on them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
N.V.S.N Murthy, Secunderabad

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 							 																						WELCOME ORDER																														Compared to generating new capital, increasing the efficiency of usage of existing capital has not received much attention in India. This includes locked up capital in sick enterprises. Exit is as integral to commercial relationships as entry is. However, exit problems are not only faced by small-scale industry, they also plague organized industry  the historical Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction and Sick Industrial Corporation Act system having failed to deliver. An estimated Rs 100,000 crore is locked up in banks and financial institutions, primarily in the public sector. While this is a sad commentary on the quality of lending by public sector banks and financial institutions, and on political pressures exerted on such lending, such high non-performing assets also underline several instances of wilful default. If freed up, this additional capital can be put to productive use. This does not mean that all the Rs 100,000 crore is backed up by collateral. Actual asset values of collateral are probably more like Rs 40,000 crore. But even that is not insignificant. In 2003, the government promulgated an ordinance on the securitization of financial assets. The sustained print and electronic media campaign no doubt contributed to parliament enacting the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act as a permanent piece of legislation. Understandably, but perversely, with many of their prominent members as defaulters, chambers opposed the statute.																														Not that the legislation was expected to lead to changes overnight. A market for defaulter assets had to develop and prices discounted, which of course was better than outright bad loans. However, the legislative threat did lead to several instances of loan payment. But the constitutional validity of the statute was still challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Courts order is welcome on two grounds. First, realizing the importance of the issue, this case was disposed of on an almost fast-track basis. Second, instead of being preoccupied with borrowers rights, a possibility that could not have been precluded a priori, the court has underlined lenders rights by upholding the statutes constitutional validity. The only caveat is in striking down a section that required 75 per cent of claimed dues to be deposited in case of appeals. The rationale for this action is that defaulters are unlikely to have such large sums if they have defaulted. This proposition has doubtful validity and appeals will add at least two years to the foreclosure process. Nevertheless, the courts order needs to be applauded. With exit of capital financed through debt made easier, the attention now needs to shift to that financed by equity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 06, 2004  Paperback Pickings				 																What can you do for happiness? For tibet with love: a beginners guide to changing the world (Bloomsbury,  5.60) by Isabel Losada is a funny and warm-hearted book about doing good to the world, starting with the Tibetans. As the dalai lama explains to her, The preservation of Tibetan culture is not only interest for six million Tibetan people but also to make happy human beings. That is something really worthwhile, to make happy human beings. She suggests books and videos on China and Tibet, and there is a chapter at the end called What Can I Do? Losada has written The Battersea Park Road to Enlightenment which is also an exploration of happiness, and New Habits about why a woman would want to become a nun.The bone collector (Coronet,  6.99) by Jeffery Deaver is a psychological thriller with an extremely clever double-double-take final. It introduces Lincoln Rhyme, quadriplegic and paralysed from the neck down, and also one of the worlds foremost forensic experts. The birds head swiveled, a fast, jerky movement that the falcon nevertheless made elegant. Rhyme observed that its talons were bloody. A piece of yellow flesh dangled from the black nutshell beak...Im looking, Rhyme thought, at the only living creature in New York City with no predator. Except maybe God Himself.Being committed (William Heinemann,  5.80) by Anna Maxted is a delightfully inconsequential Bridget-Jonesian best-seller about Hannah, the commitment-phobe, and her long-suffering boyfriend of five years, Jason. Maxteds opening sentence: Every woman likes to be proposed to, even if she means to refuse. When Jason proposes, Hannah doesnt think twice about turning him down. Still, she is a little shaken when, a month later, the man has the nerve to get engaged to someone else. Is she not up to settling down? Her family are convinced that she blew her one chance of hooking a permanent man, and perhaps theres something in Jasons theory that being committed means first coming to terms with your past. One problem with Jason: his use of clichs. Ready-made language for people too lazy to bother with original thought. Still, he took similar offence at my use of ready-made meals.

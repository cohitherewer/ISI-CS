The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Tinsel friendship				 																																																				Sir  Ram Gopal Vermas new found love for Pakistan is unlikely to make Amitabh Bachchans spirits soar. While Sunny Deol laughed all the way to the bank with Gadar  the film which made Pakistan-bashing fashionable in Bollywood  Verma has scrapped Ek, featuring Bachchan, saying it badmouths the country (Atal talks peace, Bollywood drops hot potatoes, May 9). The shelving of Vermas project reflects the lack of professionalism in Hindi film industry. A film is often scrapped purely on the whims of a producer, especially if he happens to work for a large banner. Never mind the hard work put in by actors like Bachchan. It is time the stars got together to form a union to protect them from such high-handedness. Also, Vermas sudden political correctness is driven by commercial interests. By releasing his future films in Pakistan minus the xenophobic excesses  Verma hopes to increase his profit margins and minimize censure on both sides of the border. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sanjay Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																The right choice?				 																																																				Sir  The Congress, led by Sonia Gandhi, is reaping the rewards of opening up to the idea of alliances (Sonia draws out PM suspense, May 14). But this new-found openness must not be lost. Also, the Congress must not hijack the victory of the secular parties and the defeat of the Hindutva forces. It should recognize that India has changed a lot from the time when it first ruled the country for 40 years. Let Sonia show that if Atal Bihari Vajpayee can last a full term by managing 20 alliance partners, so can she. 				 																																																				The Congress will have to transform itself into a party geared to serve the people of India, not one that is only interested in milking the government machinery for the good of a few hangers-on. The economic reforms of the earlier government had focussed on the upper echelons of Indian society at the cost of the lower-income groups and the rural population  the bulk of the electorate. Sonia will have to set this balance right without damaging the momentum of the reforms. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ghulam Muhammed, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir The ruckus Sushma Swaraj and her husband, Swaraj Kaushal, have kicked up by threatening to resign from the Rajya Sabha when Sonia Gandhi becomes prime minister shows that they hold the verdict of the electorate in utter contempt and have no faith in the Indian Constitution. At least Sonia has won every election she has fought. A look at Swarajs record shows that she was defeated in the Delhi assembly elections, defeated in Bellary parliamentary constituency after challenging Sonia Gandhi in 1999 on the slogan, swadeshi bahu vs videshi bahu. This time she was so scared that she did not even contest the elections. Then Swaraj entered parliament through the back door to become a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. As for her husband, Swaraj Kaushal, his record is better not discussed! 				 																																																				In fact, the sooner these people resign and stay away from Indias political scene the better it will be for the country. Someone should tell the Bharatiya Janata Party that the way they are behaving after losing the elections is a disgrace and that they have no hope of returning to power in the near future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  People who make much of Sonia Gandhis being a foreigner must be careful. By that argument the Dravidians in south India can claim that no north Indian can legitimately rule the country since they are all foreigners, being descendants of the Aryan invaders.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Roshan, Liverpool, UK

				 																																																				Sir  The thought that a person of foreign origin will occupy the highest seat of power in India bothers me a lot. I have not experienced the British raj. And I understand that comparing it to Sonia Gandhis becoming prime minister is unfair. But it is amazing that a billion plus population cannot produce an able leader. History will never forget and forgive those who are responsible  actively or passively  for bringing about this state of affairs.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sayan Sarkar, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Experience gives confidence, they say. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was an old hand who ran a 22-party coalition. Sonia Gandhi, on the other hand, does not have the experience of running a coalition government, and the knowledge of her inexperience does not help boost her confidence. This bodes ill for democracy in India since a leader without confidence demoralizes her entire team.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shardul Vikram Singh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  What are we going to do with a prime minister who cannot speak Hindi properly? How is she going to communicate with Indian villagers? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Soham Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  As the initial euphoria dies down, Sonia Gandhi may find it difficult to deal with the demands of her allies  the left as well as Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Laloo Prasad Yadav. These leaders will do their best to arm-twist Sonia since neither she nor the Congress will be willing to give up power at the Centre. Sonia is a novice in dealing with Indian politicians and the latter will use this to force her to agree to their terms.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Geraldine H., Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir The support of the Rashtriya Janata Dal to the Congress-led government does not bode well, especially in Bihar. Sonia Gandhi would do better to be careful of the RJD which is trying to garner a national image to hide the fodder scam and the sordid reality of its political life. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tarun Mukherjee, Patna 

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhi will be the next prime minister of India. The National Democratic Alliance will see this jersey cow lead the nation. Her life has been one long struggle  adjusting to a new country, being all the things countrymen expected a Gandhi to be. It was especially difficult after the loss of her husband, but she carried on. Best of luck to her.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rashmi Kumari, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  In a country of more than a billion, cant the Congress find a person of Indian origin to lead it? Indians like me who work outside India are now taunted by non-Indian colleagues with comments like, So it takes an European (read white) lady to save the country? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nabendu Pal, Louisiana, US

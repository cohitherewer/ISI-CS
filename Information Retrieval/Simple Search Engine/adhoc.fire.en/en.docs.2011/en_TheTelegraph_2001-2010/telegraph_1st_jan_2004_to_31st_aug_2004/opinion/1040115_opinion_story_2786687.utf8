The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 							 																						PLAY IT AGAIN SAM																								Few things are more exciting than watching the blossoming of a new friendship. Watchers of the New Delhi-Washington axis will recognize the feeling. The significant decision by the United States of America to expand ties with India in nuclear, space and high technology-related issues has far reaching implications for the relationship. Not for the last three decades has such an advance been made to foster cooperation in these critical areas of concern. The importance of the decision was highlighted by the fact that the US president, Mr George W. Bush, himself made the announcement from Mexico, where he is attending a summit of the Americas. Mr Bush stated that cooperation in these areas between India and the US would not just deepen the ties of commerce and friendship between the two countries but also increase stability in Asia and beyond. He also asserted that the vision of a US-India strategic partnership was on the way to becoming a reality.																								It may be recalled that the foundations of Indias technology infrastructure, including in the nuclear and space sector, owed much to US assistance in the Fifties and Sixties. The situation, however, changed after the nuclear non-proliferation treaty came into force in the Seventies. As a non-signatory to the NPT, India was denied access to high technology, especially in the nuclear area. The bilateral relationship worsened considerably after Indias first nuclear test in 1974. Meanwhile, pressure on India to abandon its nuclear and space programme was accelerated. The 1998 nuclear tests by India, while leading to a further short-term dip in bilateral relations, did, however, create a realization in Washington that New Delhi was unlikely to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons programme. The subsequent dialogue between the former Indian foreign minister, Mr Jaswant Singh, and the US deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, helped to narrow down differences, but there was no real breakthrough. The US clearly wanted India to sign the nuclear comprehensive test ban treaty before it could consider doing a deal on these sensitive issues. 																								The Republican administration, under Mr Bush, has, however, taken a more long-term view of the bilateral relationship, and views India as an ally in a turbulent continent. India will benefit significantly from Washingtons decision. The new bilateral engagement on nuclear regulatory and safety issues will provide great momentum to Indias civil nuclear energy programme. Similarly, enhanced cooperation in peaceful uses of space technology, and high-tech commerce will give a boost to Indias scientific infrastructure. Mr Bush has, of course, articulated only a vision statement. Real cooperation will be dependent on working out the details through a series of bilateral agreements. These will have to encounter, not just the conservative Washington bureaucracy, but also several legislative hurdles. It is clear, however, that Mr Bushs announcement prefaces a new chapter in the Indo-US engagement.

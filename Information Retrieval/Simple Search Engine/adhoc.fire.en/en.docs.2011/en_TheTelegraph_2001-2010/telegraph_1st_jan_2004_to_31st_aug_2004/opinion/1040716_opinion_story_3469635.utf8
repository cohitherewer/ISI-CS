		 Friday, July 16, 2004 							 																						MARRIED TO A STRANGERMadras on Rainy Days By Samina Ali, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Rs 250Madras on Rainy Days attempts to explore the effect of cultural mingling on the inner spaces of those caught in the crossfire. The segregation of men and women in Muslim society in India and the harsh judgments it passes on sexual misconduct are at the core of this novel.																														Set in Hyderabad during what appears to be the late Eighties (when the film, Chandni, and its star, Sridevi, were the rage), this is a time before the West had pervaded Indian popular culture. A time when pizza was still foreign food, jeans a rarity, and the IT and media revolutions had not shrunk the world.																														The protagonist of the novel is 19-year-old Layla, whose growing up has been divided between the US and India in an attempt to inhabit America without being inhabited by it. Laylas father, a doctor, used to beat her since she was two years old. He divorced Laylas mother, Amme, and abandoned her when Layla was just 10 years old. To save face, Amme kept this fact hidden from her family and friends in Hyderabad.																														When she grows up, Layla is pressured to fulfil her mothers dream of getting her daughter married to a nice Muslim boy  a doctor or engineer  from back home. But in a desperate bid to break free, Layla spends a night with a friend. She gets pregnant, and later has an abortion. The attempt to discover sexuality on her own, before it is forced upon her leaves Layla bleeding  physically and emotionally. Her family in Hyderabad comes to know of this and drags her to shady mystics to drive the shaitan out of her.																														However, as her wedding day approaches, Layla is anxious to be accepted by the family of her husband-to-be, Sameer. On the wedding night, she discovers that Sameer had known of her pre-marital affair. Surprisingly, he does not reject her but refuses to consummate the marriage. Despite this, a kind of closeness develops between the couple, although there are hurdles from the past which widen the rift between them.																														Layla has never been allowed to take charge of her body or her destiny. Daughter of an abandoned woman and an abusive father, she is handed over to her husbands family, as its property and responsibility. Sameer, too, carries a load of expectations on his shoulders. Both, Layla and Sameer, have been forced into a marriage and thus there are areas in their personalities and sexual identities that they have never faced or explored fully. 																														But if the sexual dynamics of Muslim India is the theme of Alis novel, she does not reflect on it with any depth. Ultimately, Madras on Rainy Days has little new to offer. Alis tale lacks insight, and she tells it without any poetry or lyricism. She also does not flesh out her characters  Layla comes across as simply confused. Alis dialogue is stilted, her narration disjointed. In sum, Ali does not even scratch the surface of the cultures Layla straddles.						MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYA

 							 - Undone not by the cold but by the thaw Supriya Chaudhuri				 	 Yesterdays man																								Absolute Friends By John le Carr, Hodder amp; Stoughton,  2.50																								It is arguable that John le Carrs real subject, all those years when we supposed him to be writing the classic espionage novel, was not politics but love. Love ran like a crack, a fissure undermining the most solid of ideological foundations, through the labyrinthine plots of his Cold War fiction, threatening the elaborate edifice of political intrigue with imminent collapse. Like deceit, the staple of a secret life, love too resulted in betrayal and loss; indeed it was so close to deceit that it might well be mistaken for it. Nevertheless, Le Carrs heroes, men like Smiley and Karla no less than the men they controlled, agents in the field such as Alec Leamas in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold or Jerry Westerby in The Honourable Schoolboy, were nave and sentimental lovers to a man. The phrase supplied the title for Le Carrs only straight novel.																								Smiley, who read his Schiller, might have noted the impossibility of being both nave and sentimental, but his creator appeared blind to any inconsistency. Unlike Graham Greene, who hated and feared love because it was so inextricably bound up with pity, Le Carr locates his characters humanity in their capacity to love the most unexpected of objects, such as dishonest fathers, unfaithful wives, fat schoolboys, mongrel dogs, prostitutes, librarians, terrorists. A kind of love binds even Smiley and Karla, long-term Cold War opponents, just as a despairing attachment draws one to his unfaithful wife and the other to his delinquent daughter.																								Absolute Friends recapitulates many of the themes of Le Carrs Cold War fiction, though it is at the same time so contemporary as to be post-Iraq, arraigning Bush and Blair as the arch-villains of modern unipolar militarism. Le Carrs own political position would be best described as Radical Tory, an unpopular ideology at the best of times (though espoused by many greater writers), and one that has drawn savage attack from the British press. Daniel Johnson, writing in The Daily Telegraph, recently dismissed him as a post-Cold War absurdity, desperately substituting the new treachery of the Atlantic alliance for the old perfidy of the Eastern Bloc. The substitution may seem more convincing to readers here, and indeed Johnsons attempted hatchet job on one of the Establishments old favourites may end in winning him new supporters. But at the same time, Absolute Friends is rooted in a self-deprecating, frustrated colonial nostalgia, a counter to the exuberant postcolonial fantasy of a Salman Rushdie.																								Ted Mundy, one of the friends of Le Carrs title, is a belated midnights child born on the morning of Pakistans independence somewhere in the mountain-ranges of the Hindukush. Between his mothers going into labour and his birth, British India had become independent Pakistan, and his father, a drink-sodden major in an old colonial regiment, had lost his bearings. This is Le Carrs version of Rushdies postmodernist fable of nativity, and given the publicly reported enmity between these two writers, it is probably intended as something of a riposte. All his life, Mundy carries with him a hopeless, Kiplingesque love for the sun-baked hillsides and the Pakistani companions of his childhood, though it is scarcely backed by anything like Kiplings espousal of raj ideology.																								This novel is also a contemporary re-telling of Le Carrs fictional biography of his father, a minor swindler and social fraud, in A Perfect Spy. Shambling through adolescence, caring for an increasingly incapacitated father, surviving boarding school by the display of obviously sub-continental cricket skills and making his way to Oxford on the strength of German tuition from a refugee schoolmaster, Mundy is disposed to form attachments. At Oxford he is seduced by a Hungarian anarchist who packs him off to post-war Berlin, where he meets his absolute friend and physical opposite, Sasha, the radical son of a German Lutheran pastor. Mundy takes part in every student movement that comes his way, driven apparently by a hopeless desire to belong, and is ultimately beaten up by the West German police and expelled from Berlin.																								With this pedigree, is it surprising that Mundy should in time come to rest in a British Council job, the perfect cover for an aspiring spy? It is Sasha who seduces him this time, offering himself, from his current position as East German ideologue and Party functionary, as a double agent for the West. For years Mundy carries out the task of running Sasha and others like him, reporting all the while to his own London control, not George Smiley but a suave colleague. And even after the end of the Cold War, when Mundys occupation appears to be gone and he is down and nearly out in a Munich ghetto of Turkish immigrants and Kurdish refugees, we are reminded that old spymasters never die, they only fade away.																								This last lap of Mundys career, set off by renewed contact with Sasha, is Le Carrs angry, intransigent contribution to contemporary political debate. Like Greene and unlike Rushdie, Le Carr is stubbornly anti-American in a world dominated by Uncle Sams shadow. Mundy and Sasha are both ultimately victims, trumped-up casualties in the global war on terror: their careers as Cold Warriors end in the fiasco of nave belief, betrayal and forgery. It is this section of the novel that has enraged Blairites in Britain and Bushrangers in America, dismissing Le Carr as a writer who has woken up today to discover he is yesterdays man, just as Mundy, all too tragically, discovers he is yesterdays spy. Memorial tributes are indeed paid to him, but only by renegade ex-operatives of the British secret service and the sceptical French; the Germans and Russians end by choosing American contracts.																								Delighted though I am by Le Carrs decision to carry the war decisively to the Anglo-American alliance, I must confess that this is a weaker and more chaotic novel than his last masterpiece, The Constant Gardener. It bears all the marks of Le Carrs fictional world; the Byzantine plotting, the burdens of liberal ideology, public-school trauma and hopeless attachment to the underdog which characters carry like a cross on their backs, their loopy and overwrought stylistic mannerisms, and their longing, above all, for love. Looking back, we may see this longing as having distinguished the human plots of his fiction from its inception.																								It is true enough that Le Carr has spent the past ten years and more looking for a subject that might replace the Cold War angst of his classic fiction. The results have been patchy but, as in The Constant Gardener, occasionally brilliant. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to see a decisive break between the earlier and later novels, a break signalled by the death of the spy who is undone not by the cold but by the thaw. What is most characteristic of Le Carrs fiction, even its greatest strength, is not its real setting, but its capacity to imagine an intricate world of fantasy, in which individuals driven by friendship, desire, good intentions or loyalty are increasingly caught up in elaborate patterns of deceit.																								Deceit is the climate of this twilight world, built on an insistently over-determined plot, and plagued by a fatal love-sickness which afflicts characters like original sin. God does not play dice with Le Carrs heroes, not even with the accident-prone Ted Mundy. Cold War or no Cold War, Le Carr is still faithful to the principles of his clandestine universe, which taught him that nothing that happens is by chance. If Greene was a Catholic, there is little doubt that Le Carr is a Calvinist: a brooding, dark, but salutary figure on our political and intellectual horizons.						SUPRIYA CHAUDHURI

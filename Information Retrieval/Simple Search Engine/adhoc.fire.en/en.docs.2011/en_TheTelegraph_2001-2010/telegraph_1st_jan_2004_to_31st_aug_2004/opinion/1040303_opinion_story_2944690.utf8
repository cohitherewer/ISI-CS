The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Old and expendable				 																																																				Sir  Callcentres are increasingly turning to older people, but is it cause for cheer, as the report, Old strikes gold in the job market (Feb 29), seems to think? Businessmen only look to profits; they will not recruit older employees unless it suits their interests. And one doesnt have to look far to realize that call centre firms werent getting anywhere with the brat pack, which was bored out of its mind, having to mouth inanities ad infinitum in a foreign accent  however much they were paid for it. Naturally, the younger lot left to do more interesting things. The older people, on the other hand, have come to the callcentres because they have few options left. Excellent work atmosphere and salaries set to go up are all very good, but it does not compensate for the far lower pay packet now, the late hours, the ignominy of having to report to seniors half your age and, not to forget, the threat of retrenchment given the current outcry against outsourcing.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, R. Chinappa, Mumbai
				 																																																				Campaign mode				 																																																				Sir  Mani Shankar Aiyars column is more election campaign than a piece of discursive writing, as can be seen from his parting shot in Peculiarly idiotic (Feb 25)  In view of above, it will be surprising if the voters dont vote for the Congress-led alliance in the coming elections. The column starts on a positive note, though, with Aiyar lamenting a Union ministers terming the actions of the comptroller and auditor general of India, idiotic. But then Aiyar goes on to give examples of the idiotic and peculiar actions of members of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance, carefully avoiding examples from his own party  the Congress. If The Telegraph is giving a Congressman the opportunity to campaign for the forthcoming elections under the guise of his columns, then I guess Atal Bihari Vajpayee should also be allowed to write some poems for the paper. 				 																																																				When there are so many important events to write about, it was idiotic of Aiyar to write such articles and peculiar of The Telegraph to print them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nilin Bhaduri, Durgapur

				 																																																				Sir  It is peculiar of Mani Shankar Aiyar to use his column for pro-Congress and anti-BJP propaganda; and idiotic of him to think that readers believe whatever he writes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Partha Sarathi Bhuyan, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Mani Shankar Aiyars columns have become unabashedly political. His recent ones have been devoted to attacking the National Democratic Alliance and its policies. Ironically, Aiyar is using the print media to attack his opponents for using the media to propagate their achievements. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avinash Gupta, Bandel

				 																																																				Sir  Perhaps Mani Shankar Aiyar needs to be told that it is peculiar to throw sermons on how to run the country at the opposition; it is idiotic not to have done anything despite having been in power for more than 50 years. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vishwa Nath Jaiswal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Mani Shankar Aiyar and Ashok Mitra present the party angles of the Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist) respectively. Thus it is only fair that someone from the Bharatiya Janata Party should be given a chance to present his views. He might refute Iyer and Mitra and let readers form their own opinion.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amit Mitra, Calcutta

				 																Crime in uniform				 																																																				Sir  I had an experience similar to Abhijit Bhattacharyyas over an article I had written on the Indian Ocean (Now for an open secret, Feb 17). There is a method in the madness though. Treating defence as sacrosanct protects the establishment from uncomfortable queries on graft from arms deals. Given our threat perceptions, we do not need to import anything for our military. The catch is, indigenous procurement does not leave scope for much bribes. Take the case of Admiral Gorshkov, the aircraft carrier we are buying from Russia. It is a piece of derelict hardware. Besides, new developments in weaponry, like precision-guided munitions, make a fleet air arm of doubtful use. So why have we agreed to buy the ship? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I do not support the American invasion of Iraq. Therefore I couldnt agree more with Ashok Mitras I kill, therefore I am (Feb 6). But I couldnt help drawing a parallel with the situation in Nagaland. Mitra says that if the Americans are allowed to continue with the first-sentence-to-death-then-search-for-evidence principle, a time will come when Not facts, but suspicion, will rule the roost. But does he know that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958 gives the army in India such a licence to kill, and that it has been in force in the North-east for several decades? Worse, the act does not even provide scope for redressal of any injustices that might result from such sweeping powers except with the previous sanction of the Central Government. Till date, the Centre has not sanctioned legal proceedings in any of the cases of human rights violations committed by the armed forces against the peoples of the North-east. What has Mitra to say about that?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Temsu Ao, Dimapur

				 																Unfortunate coincidence				 																																																				Sir  The state-level joint entrance examination for computer applications and the all-India common entrance test for MCA will both be held on June 6, 2004. Since, the dates of the AIMCET were announced earlier, the JECA organizers should have been careful since it is the students who will lose out as a result of this coinciding of the dates. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

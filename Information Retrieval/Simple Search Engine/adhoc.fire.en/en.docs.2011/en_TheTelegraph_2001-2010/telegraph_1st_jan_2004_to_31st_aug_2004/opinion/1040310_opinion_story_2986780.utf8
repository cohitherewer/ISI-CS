		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 							 																						PLUGGING THE LOOPHOLES 															- Document Excerpts from Sexuality, abortion and the media: a review of adolescent concerns by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Reaching out 																														Schools and colleges: Educational institutions in the Delhi area have some part of the curriculum that is devoted to what can broadly be called life skills education... Life skills deal more with communication tools, how to negotiate on matters related to sexuality and career counselling as well. There are no norms for life skills education. Each school, private and government, do more or less their own thing.																														Government Agencies: The National Council of Educational Research and Training is the apex body responsible for school curriculum design, implementation and evaluation...Under the Population Project in 2002, NCERT experimented with a pilot project in skill building in adolescence education...The objective of these programmes in schools is to make adolescents aware about reproductive and sexual health issues, develop positive attitudes towards them, equip them with the necessary skills to manage the reproductive and sexual health and related concerns to help them to take rational and responsible decisions...																														For those not in schools or who have no access to organizations there is the Indira Gandhi National Open University...																														The National AIDS Control Programme has also targeted adolescents as a special group within its work. Its draft frame-work on Condom Promotion Strategy has a strong focus on adolescents.

Challenges and unmet needs:..individuals and agencies have been frank to admit the challenges they face and the enormous unmet need...speaking publicly about sex, and in the context of adolescents, premarital sex...																														Developing material for sex education has also been a challenge. While there are examples from the United States of America and European countries, some of this could be adapted for the Indian situation. The material and programmes had to be culture and area specific and available in regional languages...For the last 15 years, this material has been used to dispel myths  that girls must not enter the kitchen, pray or have a bath during menstruation  and have dealt with one of the causes of great anxiety in India...																														Staff and counsellors at TARSHI and PSS confirm that there is a great unmet need for sources of information and services, as well as spaces to discuss the issues of sexuality. To cater to the school population, these two and other NGOs have been approaching school authority to do consciousness-raising about sexuality... 																														NGOs say that parents and teachers need a great deal of consciousness raising before adolescents can be reached. They are the gatekeepers and have the power to stop information reaching adolescents. Therefore almost all NGOs in the field of adolescent reproductive health are now joining hands with other NGOs or governments programmes and agencies. TO BE CONCLUDED

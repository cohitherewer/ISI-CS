The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 							 																						HARD TO BELIEVE																														Thanks to elections and the Election Commission, finance ministers are under restraint. This is true of state-level finance ministers, as well as the Central one. A budget exercise, therefore, has limited degrees of freedom because changes in tax rates are not possible. The Asim Dasgupta problem has not changed in budget estimates for 2004-05. How does one slash the deficit, in particular the revenue deficit, and ensure that the government spends on social and physical infrastructure, as opposed to salaries and pensions for government employees? Like producing a rabbit from a hat, West Bengals finance minister has projected slashing of the revenue deficit by 20 per cent in 2004-05, compared to figures for 2003-04. Were this to be believable, applause would be in order. However, finance ministers are not known for their fiscal marksmanship. The Reserve Bank of Indias studies comment on significant deviations between revised estimates and budget estimates, and the subsequent actual figures. And unfortunately, finance ministers are not taken to task for such slippage. The RBI studies also confirm that in the Nineties, fiscal marksmanship has been particularly bad in West Bengal. The figures for 2003-04 illustrate the point. Mr Dasgupta estimated that, compared to 2002-03, the revenue deficit in 2003-04 would increase by around Rs 150 crore. The actual increase was around Rs 700 crore. If this is the finance ministers track record, what credence can be attached to his estimates for 2004-05?																														With the manufacturing sector and the economy recovering, revenue projections are believable, and revenue did increase by a similar magnitude in 2003-04, compared to 2002-03. The legerdemain concerns expenditure. Expenditure increased by Rs 4,500 crore in 2003-04. Without a credible plan for downsizing expenditure, expectations that such increases will be limited to only Rs 1,000 crore are not believable. While electoral restraints may have prevented any increase in fresh populist expenditure, downsizing existing expenditure also treads into the realm of populism. The feasible solutions are reducing salary expenditure by slashing the number of future government employees, privatizing loss-making public sector units and eliminating subsidies and imposing appropriate user charges. On none of these does the budget speech propose concrete action. Therefore, citizens have every right to question budget figures. And when it comes to the budget speech for 2005-06, one will again discover significant variations between revised and budget estimates for 2004-05. In any private-sector organization, such a chief executive officer would have been sacked.

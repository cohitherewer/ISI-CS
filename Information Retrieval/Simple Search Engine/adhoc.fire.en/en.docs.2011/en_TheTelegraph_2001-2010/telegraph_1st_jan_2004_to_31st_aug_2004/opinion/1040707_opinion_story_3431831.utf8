The rush to withdraw the NCERT history textbooks is a move which may prove to be politically ill-conceived and academically disastrous, argues Janaki Nair The author is senior fellow in history, Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta Repeat story For the past five years, we have seen the concerted effort of the Hindu right to transform many institutional spaces by filling them with its hand-picked people. This is a well-worn method. One need not go as far back as the days of the Congress hegemony to recall how shifts in political power brought new faces to the capital. H.D. Deve Gowdas brief tenure as prime minister brought S. Shettar to the Indian Council of Historical Research, D.M. Nanjundappa to Indian Council of Social Science and Research and Rame Gowda to All India Council for Technical Education. They were worthy men no doubt, but, like the Kashmiri Brahmins who hogged the limelight during Nehru, they were all sons of the Karnataka soil. Such textbooks indeed require revision. The recommendation that NCERT desists from producing a single book and instead lists possible books for reading is also a step in the right direction. But the rush to withdraw the books is politically ill-conceived and academically disastrous. There is the problem of confusing teachers nationwide by allowing them to consult recommended books. We are told that in this exercise they will be aided by the formation of a question bank which will direct their studies. The difficulties of obtaining NCERT texts away from the capital are already well known; making new texts available on a nationwide scale will produce insurmountable problems. More important, the question bank will drive history-teaching in ways that will be dull and anti-intellectual.Most important, the focus on the textbook ignores the processes by which the Indian social structure has been ripped apart of late. We were repeatedly told over the last decade that teachers in schools and colleges nationwide have been among the new converts to the ideology of the Hindu right. Can they be trusted to craft a course that faithfully follows the ministrys new diktat? Should not the shameless manipulations of the previous government be taken as a moment for reflection on ways of depoliticizing the syllabus-writing and textbook-writing process? By what criteria will the books to be listed be chosen? Will this not lead to a diffusion of the problem? Should not the earlier mode of producing textbooks  by committees consisting of scholars, teachers and administrators through a process of debate and discussion  be revived?These are questions that require careful deliberation and nationwide debate. For the time being, this could have involved the more clumsy alternative of issuing a list of corrections and deletions. This would have exposed large sections of the public to the history debates that are a staple of our times, and the relevance of facts in this discourse. Through this, the panel could have become more sensitive to the silences and mistakes not just of right-wing texts but also the less obvious ones about the Indian past that have caused discomfort among secular-national historians. The apex court judgment, which lifted the stay on the new curriculum and textbooks in September 2002, pointed to a blind spot in the secular-national consciousness that always looked at religion and faith as subordinated to political and economic interests. The surge in popular religious practices in India today  which has nothing to do with the BJPs rise, and may even go against the politically unifying aspirations of Hindutva  points to the urgency of understanding the role played by religions from a historical perspective.History, we are increasingly told, is too crucial a field to be left to professional historians alone. Yet jostling for attention within the field of education are a number of different problems. I would view with as much alarm the trend of parents and students being compelled to prematurely confront questions of career rather than the development of intelligence. Corporate elites are increasingly being asked to endorse or shape our national educational policies. The textbooks of such a regime would perhaps be free of factual error, and even tendentious interpretation, but this would do little to disguise the goals of such a policy. Mukesh Ambani and Kumaramangalam Birla, both of whom served on the committee to frame a new educational policy, could do great damage to the national curriculum without waving a saffron flag.The single-minded rush to correct the BJP textbooks should not obscure historical complicities. Nothing will prevent the BJP, should it return to power, to begin another round of revisions and revivals. In this it will only be following the path it has been shown by its predecessors in power. The challenge of the present regime will be to escape this vicious cycle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, May 27, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Its posh to forget				 																																																				Sir  Getting away with adultery is a cakewalk, if one happens to be married to Victoria Beckham (My David never cheated: Posh, May 25). All that her husband David Beckham has to do is to watch gardening shows on TV in bed with his wife, profess his love for home-making, and pretend not to be interested in porn. And suddenly, evidence of his little affair on the side, including text messages on his lovers mobile phone, appears to have slipped out of his wifes mind. Victorias turnaround, from her former sullen self, only reflects her acute business sense. The Beckham brand is one of the most lucrative in the celebrity market. The separation of Victoria and David would have spelt disaster for their sponsors who have invested heavily on them. Consequently, it would also have meant a sizeable income reduction for the husband and wife team. With Victorias albums not doing too well, and Davids forgettable season at Bernabeu, the Beckhams have all the more reason to hold on to each other in these hard times.

				 																Bad losers 				 																																																				Sir  It is bad enough that the Bharatiya Janata Party has taken its defeat in the elections in such bad grace. Its apologists too have not succeeded in giving a gloss to their rancour, witness Swapan Dasguptas Election in flight (May 21). According to Dasgupta, the BJP lost only because of bad campaign management and, possibly, arrogance. Surely there is more to it. I would have been happy if it is conceded  at least now  that most of the pundits got it wrong. The election results have been a humbling experience for all, including die-hard Congress supporters who had thought that the party was dead and buried. Sonia Gandhi was perhaps the only one who believed in herself in the face of a relentless campaign by the BJP whizkids in the media. India Shining indeed! The shrill hysteria of Sushma Swaraj and her friends was well backed by the silence of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani. The likes of Dasgupta provide the intellectual support to such low-level public discourse. What a contrast the dignified behaviour of Gandhi presents to these. One hopes that the BJP and its media supporters will learn now to move beyond the mandir and Gandhis foreign origins. That is not likely to happen though.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  What are these achievements that the National Democratic Alliance is so proud of? 				 																																																				The NDA persecuted the Tehelka team instead of fighting corruption. Its failure to secure the line of control resulted in the capture of the Kargil hills. The coalition handled the hijacking of IC-814 in a cowardly fashion, placing the lives of the passengers above those of the soldiers who died in an attempt to capture the militants in Kashmir. A year later, it pushed thousands of jawans to the border and then pulled them back in an exercise that yielded nothing. Thus the NDA lacked both backbone and vision. 				 																																																				The Unit Trust of India saw an erosion of worth about Rs 14,000 crore, but the NDA did not take any action against the culprits. It also did nothing to prosecute criminals like Abdul Karim Telgi, Amarmani Tripathi or Mohammad Shahabuddin, or nab the killers of Satyendra Dubey, and Mahesh and Sarita. 				 																																																				The NDA failed to introduce a uniform civil code and was thus no different from the other pseudo-secular parties. At a time primary education is in a shambles, it wanted universities to introduce astrology and started meddling with management education. The NDA had been selling the assets built by previous Congress governments. Thus its claims that it has done in 5 years what the Congress could not do in 50, is not convincing. The NDA was, at best, a conglomerate of convenience. Being in power for 5 years is no achievement. The only real achievement it can claim is the Golden Quadrilateral project. But that one success is overshadowed by many failures. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Height of bad form (May 22), criticizes the BJP for its [we] know best attitude arising from its inability to accept the peoples verdict in favour of Sonia Gandhi. But, in fact, they do know better than the masses. A good leader is one who takes the people not where they want to be, but where they ought to be, and that is exactly what the BJP tries to do. People like Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti are neither to be blamed nor praised for their acts. They were merely expressing their personal opinion in a strong and perfectly appropriate manner.

				 																																																				Sir  A look back at the BJPs career shows that it is indeed a party with a difference. Its first step on the ladder to power was the apolitical movement to liberate the Ram Janmabhoomi. Its second was the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. The BJP leaders were happy to discover, in all the bloodshed of the worst communal riots post-Partition, a shortcut to the throne in Delhi. 				 																																																				But now the BJP cannot swallow the fact that it has been dumped by the electorate, that all the hype over India Shining and the larger-than-life image of Atal Bihari Vajpayee has failed. This is evident from the absence of almost all BJP leaders, except Vajpayee and L.K. Advani, from the swearing-in ceremony on May 22 of a prime minister of Indian origin.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tridib Roy, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhi and the Congress say that the people voted against the communalism of the Hindutva-torchbearers. If Ashok Singhal and Praveen Togadia are to be believed, the cold-shouldering of Hindutva was what sent the BJP to its doom. Both are wrong.				 																																																				The BJP used Hindutva, where it should not have and didnt where it should have. Take Gujarat. The state had had an overdoze of saffron and needed a break, but Narendra Modi did not agree. Tamil Nadu is traditionally allergic to saffron. Thus ammas me-too-saffron adventurism cost the party dear. In Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP had high hopes, voters, living in dingy caste ghettos, were not enthused by the exhortations to Ram and Ayodhya.				 																																																				Hindutva would have been applied to better purpose in Kerala and West Bengal where the people, for long under the iron-fist of the left, could have been ready for some elementary lessons in Hindutva. But the BJP did apply these principles because its laptop-punching spin docs lived in a world of their own. Thus the BJP killed itself by the sword of Hindutva, using which it had thrived in the past.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

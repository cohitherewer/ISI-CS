Metcalf, Oxford, Rs 595After the September 11 attacks, there has been a spurt of interest in Islam and its followers in America as well as in Europe. Not all the books written about Islam in recent times take a sympathetic view, many are born of the fear about Muslims following violence all over the world. Barbara Metcalfs book tries to allay such unfounded fears and holds up a balanced picture of Islam and Muslims in the subcontinent. 																														Islamic Contestations is a collection of essays written, as the flap cover informs, over a period of 25 years. The authors emphasis is on the pre-independence period. Her thorough probe into the past makes the demanding reader expect more insight about the Muslims of the present day, which is lacking. Amidst the worldwide trend of linking Muslims with terrorist activities, Metcalf draws the picture of their constructive activities, including moral and spiritual education of the youth. 																														Since much hue and cry have been raised about madrasahs, the author chooses this as her entry point. Beginning with religious education imparted to Muslims in different madrasas down the ages, she tries to dispel the misconceptions about these seats of learning. This is not the only point she tries to correct in this book. Metcalf explodes many a myth regarding Islam and the Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. For example, she considers the madrasah at Deoband a model of modern education for Muslims in India. 																														Perhaps irked by the questions raised about the secular credentials of Indias erstwhile Muslim rulers, she examines some of them and concludes that they were less bothered about religion than several leaders of todays democracy. Her examination also reveals that even the women in certain families were granted a considerable amount of freedom. 																														The ease with which the author writes about her subject evidently springs from her learning and research. Though the essays are of academic interest, the language is transparent enough to attract the lay reader. There are informative essays on the traditional Islamic religious activities like those of the Deoband, Tablighis, and the Talib groups. An essay on the creation of and conditions in contemporary Pakistan provides an excellent comparison of Muslims living on both sides of the border. Two essays on the great practitioner of Unani medicine, Hakim Ajmal Khan, should revive interest in this forgotten figure. Metacalfs accounts of Haj is interesting, but it is unclear what made the author include an essay about a Mughal empress and a French nawab.																														Metcalf has remained faithful to her mission of drawing the true picture of Islam and its adherents in the subcontinent. She takes pains to emphasize that the Islamic commoner and ruler alike prioritized democracy and secularism over religion as the basis for their politics. The only flaw in the work is its focus on the past rather than on the present, more so because it is unlikely to go down well with a generation that is fast losing interest in the days gone by. Nonetheless, Islamic Contestations remains an important addition to the corpus of works on the Muslims in the subcontinent.						SHAMS AFIF SIDDIQI

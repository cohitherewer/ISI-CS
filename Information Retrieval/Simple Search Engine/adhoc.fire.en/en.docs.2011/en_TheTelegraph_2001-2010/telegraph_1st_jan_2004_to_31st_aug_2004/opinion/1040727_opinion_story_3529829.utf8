The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																With a little more training				 																																																				Sir  Would Neeraj Kumar have been pushed out of the ladies compartment of the Howrah-bound Katwa local if his fare had included fancy hair-clips, ribbons, nail colours and earrings (Boy pushed out of women bogie, July 23)? Anyone who has had any experience of suburban trains around Calcutta  particularly its ladies compartments  will vouch for the fact that these exclusive compartments are turned into crowded marketplaces by passengers who shamelessly jostle with fellow women to sample and buy novelties, jhal muri and other articles from vendors. And some of these vendors, indeed, are men. Their trick is that they trade in things that appeal to womens sense of vanity. Poor Neeraj Kumar had not done his homework on the average woman passengers psychology. He almost paid for it with his life. Future Neeraj Kumars should beware: the ladies of the train do not like being offered healthy, harmless food like corn-on-the-cob.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Snehangshu Mandal, Howrah
				 																Saving the hide				 																																																				Sir  All Indians should hang their heads in shame because we have proclaimed offenders like Shibu Soren as cabinet ministers. To play on the meaning of proclaimed offender, as the home minister, Shivraj Patil, has done is to make a mockery of our intelligence. A proclaimed offender is not one who is absconding but one who is declared public. To say that Soren is not absconding but moving about makes it worse. Just because Manmohan Singh has been able to rid his cabinet of Soren does not absolve him of the blame of including him in the first place. And let us not hear again that there were offenders in the National Democratic Alliance cabinet as well. Did the United Progressive Alliance not promise to be different?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Hilda Raja, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  Shibu Soren has given the Indian judicial system a slip for almost three decades now (Case bomb still ticks on Soren, July 18). Justice has surely been denied when a crime committed 29 years ago is still pending in court. Even more deplorable is the fact that political pressure can make criminal records disappear from the lower courts in India. Are we supposed to believe that while the records of most of the people indicted in the same arson case remained intact, only those of a few primary suspects, including Soren, disappeared? It has also been reported that the warrant of arrest against Soren was never delivered. So strings must have been pulled within the police too. 				 																																																				Uttam Sengupta may be right in pointing out that the Bharatiya Janata Partys enthusiasm about the case in 2004 is in sharp contrast to its silence when charges were filed against Soren for the first time (The twists in the tale, July 26). This merely shows that most criminal cases in India are tied to political fortunes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

				 																																																				Sir  Look at the facts of Shibu Sorens case, and you will see why even the proverbial long arm of the law cannot grab our politicians. The just-resigned Union coal minister, Shibu Soren, and nine others were issued arrest warrants in connection with the 1975 Chirudih massacre case by a court in Jamtara. Soren, however, used his political clout to secure bail in 1979. The Jharkhand advocate general, A.K. Sinha, claims that his bail was cancelled in 1986 by a sessions court as he failed to appear in court for hearings. This made the court issue another warrant against Soren. But it was never delivered, and the reasons are not difficult to guess. Had the BJP not felt a sudden surge of interest in the case, its confidence bolstered by having a BJP chief minister in the state, Soren would no doubt have been living happily ever after.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The former coal minister has misused his parliamentary privileges by absconding. Why did Somnath Chatterjee, the Lok Sabha speaker, a veteran parliamentarian and a lawyer himself, have to sound defensive and say that he was not in parliament to help the police. As Indian citizens, each of us has a duty to help the police.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  The Chirudih case is not the only taint against Shibu Sorens name, the dirty game between the Congress and Soren has been going on for a long time. During the 1993 no-confidence motion against the Congress government of P.V. Narasimha Rao, Soren, along with two other colleagues, is alleged to have accepted lakhs of rupees as bribe. They escaped conviction by the skin of their teeth, and that too because they happened to be members of the Lok Sabha. Corruption has always been the Congresss fort, and it is no less guilty of giving bribes than Soren is of accepting them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Proloy Bagchi, Bhopal

				 																																																				Sir  The BJP is playing a dirty game with a tribal leader, taking advantage of his political navt. It is clear that the BJP has not been able to come to terms with the drubbing it received at the hustings during the last general elections. It is trying to settle some old scores with Shibu Soren, after having its attempts at creating problems for the UPA government in the Lok Sabha thwarted every time.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																Firestruck				 																																																				Sir  Media reports have proved that the Saraswati English medium school school lacked basic fire-fighting provisions. In spite of that, the children could have been saved had it not been for the criminal negligence and callousness of the teachers. Over a week has passed since the mishap. What measures have been taken to make sure that such a fire does not repeat itself in any school of the country? Most school authorities (including in West Bengal) are lackadaisical about overhauling the existing (or non-existent) fire-safety measures. Knowing full well that public memory is short, they seem to be waiting for the media to lose interest in the incident, so that they can go back to their old, careless and dangerous ways. In any Western country, the teachers would be serving jail terms by now for culpable homicide. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhobrata Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Did the Congress have to play politics with a tragedy of the order of the Kumbakonam fire that killed 90 children? Why was the family whose children were named Priyanka, Indira Sonia and Rahul (Sonia at dead Sonia door, July 19) more important than the rest? Was its loss any more than that of the others which lost their children? The sympathy visits of political leaders after accidents and natural calamities should be stopped by making a new law if necessary.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Sunanda Sarkar, Calcutta

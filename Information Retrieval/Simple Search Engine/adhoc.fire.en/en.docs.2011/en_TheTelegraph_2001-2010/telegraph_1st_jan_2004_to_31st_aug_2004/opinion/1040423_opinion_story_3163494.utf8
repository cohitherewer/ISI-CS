		 Friday, April 23, 2004 							 																						THE MAKING OF A LEGEND In RAJMATAGAYATRI DEVI...ENDURING GRACE (Roli, Rs 495) Dharmendar Kanwar tries to live down the glass doll image of the Queen Mother of Jaipur, give more substance to her royal persona, present her as a joyful girl, glamorous wife, caring mother and above all, a dutiful queen. Maharaja Gajsingh in his foreword is as persuasive as Kanwar, There was much more to her beyond her grace, charm and elegance: there was a rare spirit and courage befitting a Rajput Maharani...Aunty Ayesha is truly A Princess to be Remembered . Really, they should not have laboured so hard. The breathtaking pictures of Gayatri Devi, gallivanting in England, Switzerland, frolicking with Jacqueline Kennedy, playing polo or tennis, or in a more serious mode as the rani, hostess to British royalty or the Swantantra Party MP or visitor to her many schools in Jaipur do that difficult job more convincingly. Kanwars pithy chapters on her childhood, marriage, politics fill up the spaces in between the fabulous black-and-white spread. In this series, we see her waltzing with her Maharaja, playing with her son and relaxing in tranquil Srinagar. Life is not as glamorous and exciting as it used to be, says the rani. We believe her entirely.

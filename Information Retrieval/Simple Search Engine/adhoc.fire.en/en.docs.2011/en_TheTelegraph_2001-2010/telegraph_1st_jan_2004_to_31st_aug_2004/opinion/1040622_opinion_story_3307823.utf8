		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 							 																						FORCE NEVER DID ANY GOOD Arshi Khan																					Military take-over of civilian administration has always been detrimental to nation-building. Even when the armed forces have overthrown the civilian government of their own country, they have either failed to further democracy or have interrupted the democratization process. What distinguishes Iraq is that the foreign armed forces which have occupied it have systematically destroyed all existing ruling institutions, spread lawlessness and targeted civilians  all in the name of reconstruction and democracy.																					The military occupation of Iraq is being legitimized by the United Nations security council through the transfer of power to the Iraqis on June 30. But the UN is silent over compensation to the Iraqis for the damages to their defence installations, cultural treasures, parliament, constitution and political parties. In 1991, the UN had passed many resolutions against Iraq in order to pay compensations to the Kuwaitis and the Kurds. 																					But after the latest Iraq war, the majority of Iraqis have not been allowed to participate in the economic and political reconstruction of the country on the pretext of insecurity and instability. The Iraqis now accuse the occupying forces of creating chaos in the country. They feel neither liberated nor are able to enjoy their basic rights.																					Free for all																					The American and British governments are managing Iraq just as they like. The security council has also bowed to the directives of the occupying powers. The Westerners have set the agenda of reconstruction in the economic and political spheres, which has led to an increase in protests and violence, and massive bombings in Falluja, Amara, Al Anbar and Baghdad. The large-scale killings of Iraqis, mostly civilians, in Karbala, Kufa and Najaf, the raids, unlawful detentions, unimaginable brutality on Iraqis in American-British custody expose the repression of Iraqi resistance. Neither Western humanitarian agencies nor Arab human rights groups, not even their relatives, are allowed to meet the detainees. 																					Middle-class Iraqis, who earlier formed the backbone of the nation, are now kept out of the reconstruction project in Iraq. The Iraqis now believe that the purpose of the attack was not to remove Saddam Hussein. 																					The US is building a huge concrete wall around the oil fields in Iraq. The occupying forces have also turned hotels and state buildings into military barracks which are inaccessible to even prominent Iraqi civilians. Thus the occupiers have concentrated only on their need to stay safe and long in that country. Also, media are not free to use their own discretion while reporting from Iraq.																					For the interim																					The presence of smaller east European states like Poland and Bulgaria in Najaf, Karbala and Baghdad are a further cause of humiliation. They are already victims of a 12-year-old debilitating economic blockade. Iraqi Arabs (Shia and Sunni) also resent the preference shown by the US and Britain to the Kurds since1991. Kurds now enjoy a degree of autonomy after the US imposed no-fly zones and safe-haven measures. The Kurd-dominated northern areas also became a major centre of anti-Iraq operations.																					Given the circumstances, will the American-sponsored interim constitution and transfer of power bring democracy to Iraq? 																					The purpose of democracy is to enable Iraqis to achieve justice and welfare. The interim constitution calls for federalism without identifying its pre-requisites, like rule of law. Military occupation, as is evident from the provisions of the constitution, violates all attempts at nation-building. How does the interim constitutions provisions for individual rights sit with the universal human rights which are violated in Iraq every day? Sovereignty is the basis of justice and national reconstruction  the interim constitution is silent on this. Nation-building and democracy are the prerogatives of the Iraqis. Any military or foreign design would be detrimental to the project.

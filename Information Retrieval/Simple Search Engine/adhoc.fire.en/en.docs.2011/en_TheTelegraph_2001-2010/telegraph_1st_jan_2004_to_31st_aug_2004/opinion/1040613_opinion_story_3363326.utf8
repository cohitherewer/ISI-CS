The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 13, 2004  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Farewells inevitably tend to be sentimental occasions and the recent farewell for outgoing Rajya Sabha members was no exception. There may have been no misty eyes around, but it was one of those rare occasions when no one was speaking ill of anyone. The outgoing deputy chairperson, Najma Heptullah, was greeted with a round of warm applause, with Ghulam Nabi Azad showering lavish praise on her. To some people, it would seem quite natural  after all, Azad and Najma have been party-mates for decades, until her recent defection to the BJP. But Ambika Soni is not just some people, and Ambika Soni was not pleased. The matter duly made it to madams ear and Azad had to explain how, as parliamentary affairs minister, he had little option but to praise her. The Delhi grapevine being what it is, the report of Azads little interview soon made its way to Najma. Now Najma nurses a fond wish  now that she had made it to the Rajya Sabha for a record-breaking fifth term, she would also like another shot at the deputy chairpersonship. And with the numbers in the upper house being evenly balanced, her wish could well be a reality. But for the ruling coalition headed by the Congress, which would do anything to prevent such an eventuality. And it has convention on its side, which says that since the chairman of the Rajya Sabha, vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, is from the BJP, the deputy chair should be from the opposing side. In fact, the Congress has already sent feelers to the BJP about how it should honour this convention. And guess who is playing messenger? Azad, of course. Najma must be shattered to know. 				 																																																																														 Power remains the best elixir of youth. Sunil Dutt used to be a lost and lonely figure in New Delhis political circles, though he had proved his credentials by winning the Mumbai Northwest constituency for a record five times. Then they made him minister  and whoever chose to give the sports and youth affairs portfolio to the septuagenarian star of Fifties and Sixties Bollywood blockbusters like Mother India and Waqt, must have had a robust sense of humour. Dutt saab  as he is fondly called  is a changed man these days. The stick he used to make his way around parliament on the rare occasions he showed up  the legacy of an airplane crash a few years ago  has been discarded, and he no longer sits in a forlorn corner, unnoticed by the others. The ministerial status seems to have worked wonders  overnight, Dutt seems to have grown in confidence as he interacts with his colleagues. At this rate, Dutt may soon make his maiden speech in parliament. 				 																																																																														 The BJP and George Fernandes cant stop talking about how the UPA is like Humpty Dumpty  ready to fall. But what they never talk about is the threat to the NDA. VP Singh and Ram Vilas Paswan are already in talks with Nitish Kumar, N Chandrababu Naidu, Mamata Banerjee, Om Prakash Chautala, et al, telling them that their parties did badly because of their association with the BJP. That this was the time for them to dump the saffron party, and prevent it from stealing the thunder as the main opposition. That this was their chance to emerge as the alternative to the UPA. That this could lead to realignments in the states  like Paswan and Nitish joining hands in Bihar, for example. Wonder what the Congress thinks of that.				 																																																																														 Renunciation is becoming a habit with Sonia Gandhi. After her now legion abdication of the prime ministers post, the Congress president seems to be getting ready for another sacrifice  the pardoning of V Prabhakaran. The DMK and MDMK have convinced Sonia to let bygones be bygones and drop the long-standing demand for the extradition of the mastermind of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination. If they called her a devi after May 18, perhaps now they will start building temples to her. 				 																																																																														 Ever wondered why a politician never changed his profession? One reason could be the addiction to security guards, bullet-proof cars, red lights. So compelling can it be that many will go to any lengths to retain them. Like Balbir Punj, the BJP member of the Rajya Sabha, whose security was withdrawn after the regime change at the Centre. This was an intolerable social come-down, one that Punj lobbied hard to reverse. It was. Punj now has security cover  one lone cop against the car-load earlier. How life changes!				 																																																																														 Jagdish Tytler, Union minister of non-resident affairs, has nothing to do but twiddle his thumbs. He has no office and no one knows what he is supposed to do. Could he open an office in New York, he suggested  hopefully, or just sarcastically? But even that idea was shot down.				 																																																																														 Laloo Prasad Yadav did not invent the kulhad, though the way the newspapers are going on, it would seem as if he had. It was actually George Fernandes, way back in 1977 and in his socialist avatar, who had ordered that tea should be served in the earthen cups in railway canteens. 				 																																													Laloos kulhad order, however, has had an unexpected fallout  the canteen in Parliament House, which is run by the railways, has started serving all beverages  even chicken soup  in earthen cups. And, it is rumoured, the cups are not thrown away, they are recycled. The consternation among the caste-conscious ministers and MPs can well be imagined. The only way to get away from the ubiquitous kulhads is if you drink coffee, which seems to be beyond the culinary capabilities of the railway canteen. Coffee comes from the coffee board run by the commerce ministry under Kamal Nath  who thankfully does not have as green an imagination as Laloo Yadav  in fine Bone China. So now perhaps all those who drink tea will turn to coffee? Is this some kind of a Dravidian conspiracy?

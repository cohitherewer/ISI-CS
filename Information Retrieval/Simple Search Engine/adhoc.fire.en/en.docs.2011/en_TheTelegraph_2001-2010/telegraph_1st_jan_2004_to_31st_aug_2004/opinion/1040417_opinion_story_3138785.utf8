	(This is an edited excerpt of the messages exchanged.)																														There might yet be an Indian angle to the David Beckham-Rebecca Loos affair. It was after they had enjoyed a few drinks at a nightclub called Ananda in Madrid on September 18 last year that the couple ended up in bed together for the first time at the exclusive Santa Mauro hotel where the England football captain was staying.																														At one level, the scandal can be disregarded as trivial sleaze. A 28-year-old footballer, who is married to a pop singer, aged 30, has a brief fling with his pretty 26-year-old personal assistant, who subsequently sells her kiss-and-tell account to a tabloid newspaper. This kind of bad behaviour is expected of footballers.																														 What lifts this saga out of the ordinary is that Beckham was almost deified as a model husband and father, one of the reasons why Gurinder Chadhas Bend It Like Beckham was able to cash in on the sporting stars worldwide appeal.																														If Beckham has strayed  and there are not too many people who now believe he didnt  he has already been forgiven by the British public on the grounds boys will be boys. 																														The blame is pinned squarely on his wife, Victoria, formerly Posh from the Spice Girls, for selfishly pursuing her career and not going to live in Madrid when her husband transferred to Real Madrid from Manchester United last July.																														Perhaps the most fascinating character in the whole drama is Rebecca Loos, who has made 350,000 by selling her story to the News of the World and another 150,000 by giving an interview to Sky One Television, both of which are owned by Rupert Murdoch.																														Since she was being paid 25,000 a year as a PR girl helping Beckham to settle in Madrid, she hasnt done too badly in earning 20 years money in a couple of weeks. 																														Looked at coldly, since she had sex with Beckham on four occasions, that works out at 125,000 a session, which isnt a bad rate, either. Since Beckhams love-making was explosive, generous and made sure she was satisfied, the sex must count as a bonus. 																														The morning after they first had sex, he fed her strawberries in bed. Really, what more could a girl want? The second time it was even better, and the third time deliciously kinky.																														For half a million pounds, a girl will demonstrate remarkable powers of recall. When she took a shower, she used one of his wifes hairclips. Beckham told her he didnt fancy his wife anymore since she was stick-thin and obsessed with dieting. He liked a real woman with curves  like Loos.																														A fortnight ago, most people had not even heard of Rebecca Loos. But her tale is that of a modern young woman of today, who is not at all shy about grabbing sexual fulfilment wherever she can.																														There are many photographs of her  in a sultry cigarette ad, looking playful with a smudge of cream on her smiling face, in a bikini, sprawled alluringly on a bed, hugging a woman friend, wearing an apron covering only part of her breasts, and playfully striking a body-building pose by the beach. 																														Looking cool on TV in her smart-casual green waistcoat, she confirmed reports of lesbian affairs: Im a woman, Im single and Im bisexual.																														One newspaper condemned her as Loos by name, loose by nature, and dubbed her a man-eater, into whose trap the naive Beckham fell, but there has been admiration for her as well. This is partly because she is seen in class-conscious Britain as being rather more genuinely posh than the decidedly working class Posh.																														Loos went to Runnymede College, a private school in Madrid, where she performed well academically by gaining 11 GCSEs and three A-levels. She spoke five languages and drifted into PR. That is how she met Beckham last year when the firm for which she worked, SFX, an agency which manages sports stars, assigned her to interpret for the Englishman, help him find a house in and ease his way into a new life.																														Loos (nickname Keki), who grew up in a seven-bedroom house in Madrid, still lives with her parents. Her mother, Elizabeth, is Anglo-Spanish, her Dutch-origin father, Leendert, works for the Canadian embassy in Madrid. Her home life suggests both domesticity and a certain level of culture.																														On one occasion when Beckham was sending sexually explicit text messages to her, she was baking biscuits at home. On another occasion, she was visiting a museum with her parents. We would probably have text sex on average about twice a week and that involves a lot of text messages, she said.																														She first understood how his mind was working after she had sent a message that she was cuddling her beloved dog Boo Boo in bed. Beckhams text response was: Lucky Boo Boo!																														Looss parents had the Beckhams round to dinner, along with his mother, Sandra, and Victorias allegedly loutish and abrasive parents, Tony and Jackie Adams. The Beckham children, Brooklyn, five, and Romeo, 19 months, were often looked after by Looss parents. Her mother corrected Brooklyns working class grammar when the boy said: I want one of them apples.																														Victoria Beckham calls Loos a cow, a working class term of disapproval. The Beckham brand has been tarnished but Loos will reckon that sleeping with him was the best career move she has made. 																														In her TV interview, Loos feigned a certain delicacy by declining to go into how many times and in what position  the papers would have loved a Becks scored seven times in one night headline  but she said she had learnt something intimate about his private parts. 																														Since Beckham has Victoria tattooed in Hindi on his forearm, Loos may yet reveal that Devnagri has boldly gone where the ancient script has never gone before.

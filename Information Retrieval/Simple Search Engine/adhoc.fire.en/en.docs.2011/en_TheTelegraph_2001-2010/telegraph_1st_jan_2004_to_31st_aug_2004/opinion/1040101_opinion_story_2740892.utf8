		 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 RULES RATHER THAN EXCEPTIONS
 															- Document Extracts from the UNDP report on HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Attitude is everything																								There are promising signs of change inattitude, with examples of how judicial, legislative or policy action can readily mitigate stigma and discrimination. There have been several instances where the courts have ruled in favour of reinstating HIV-affected people in jobs in India. In other countries, there are statutes or injunctions against dismissal solely for being HIV-positive. In Iran, for example, the health ministry appears to have banned the expulsion of people suffering from AIDS. However, it is extremely likely that these cases are more the exception than the rule. Since stigma and discrimination are deeply rooted in societal attitudes, legislative and judicial sanctions alone will not be sufficient. Bharat (1999) documents a number of cases where individuals resigned from their jobs where they feared the reaction of other employees if found to be HIV-positive...																								The HIV/AIDS epidemic also perpetuates poverty across generations, by reducing the economic, social and educational opportunities available to children in affected households. It also increases the burden on the elderly, many of whom become responsible for orphaned grandchildren and other dependent relatives. This burden is now significantly altering social arrangements in sub-Saharan Africa. While this impact of the epidemic has not yet been documented in the south Asian context, as the epidemic spreads, extended social networks will certainly have to bear the burden of care. High levels of ignorance leading to stigma and discrimination could further strain these networks, leading to possible breakdowns in community ties and social capital as infected people and their families face rejection and isolation.																								Human capabilities: Apart from affecting income, the epidemic significantly affects both existing capabilities of People Living With HIV/AIDS and the opportunities available to them and their family members to further enhance these capabilities. There is some evidence to suggest that members of households affected by HIV/AIDS, especially children, would have lower educational and health levels. This can happen if children have to prematurely leave school to care for the sick, or if the family can no longer afford to educate them after the death of a breadwinner. Within the region, studies indicate the difficulties that children of HIV-positive persons face at school, owing to stigma. Further, high rates of HIV/AIDS can also indirectly reduce education levels, if people are unwilling to invest in education if there is little expectation of children living long enough to benefit substantially from it.																								Spending on HIV treatment also crowds out spending on nutritional intake and other health inputs, especially as household resources become increasingly limited. HIV also affects the average productivity levels of PLWHA, as well as communities and firms. At the workplace, individual morale and productivity levels are affected by the economic environment in which they operate.																								HIV/AIDS also limits the access of PLWHA to health services, other public services and financial and social resources. All this affects their capabilities to develop themselves. In an intensive study of two cities in India, Mumbai and Bangalore, Bharat (1999) documented cases where PLWHA had difficulty in accessing healthcare and support, even from family caregivers who simply abandoned them, while in others, hospitals and medical care personnel actively discriminated against them...The study also noted the inability of medical personnel to preserve the confidentiality of PLWHA. As a result, some patients chose to voluntarily discharge themselves rather than allow their HIV status to be widely disclosed. TO BE CONCLUDED

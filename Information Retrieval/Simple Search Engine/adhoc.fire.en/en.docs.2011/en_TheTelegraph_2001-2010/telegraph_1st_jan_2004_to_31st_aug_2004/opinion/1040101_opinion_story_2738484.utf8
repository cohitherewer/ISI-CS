		 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 STEPPING OUT
																								Ideology, or even unease in partnership, can no longer be accepted as a convincing reason for exiting a power alliance. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has offered the second for leaving the National Democratic Alliance and giving it issue-based support from outside. Ideologically, the DMK had nothing in common with the Bharatiya Janata Party, its alliance was more strategic than moral. The resounding success of Ms J. Jayalalithaas All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the Tamil Nadu assembly elections of 2001 was enough to destabilize the logic of the DMK-NDA partnership. The list of grouses the DMK has produced to explain its decision to leave the NDA has to be seen against this background. One is that the BJP has been rather sweet on Ms Jayalalithaa. This political flirtation has not gone unnoticed, maybe because it was not meant to. The BJP has found it good strategy to forget Ms Jayalalithaas role in the pulling down of the first NDA government in 1999. Without denying the DMKs allegation, the BJP has accused it of affectionately nuzzling the Congress. The DMK has other grouses. One is the Centres refusal to take another look at the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Tamil Nadu. The fact that Mr Vaiko, the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader, has remained in custody after being arrested under POTA for speaking publicly in favour of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has become a contentious issue. It is not surprising that the MDMK has followed the DMKs suit and walked out of the NDA too. Apart from these, the DMK has complained that the BJP has not reviewed the issue of the banning of strikes. Nor has the BJP appreciated the DMKs good work. 																								When listed, these sound puerile. The decisive moment came when the BJP chief, Mr M. Venkaiah Naidu, said that it was not healthy when a coalition partner agitated against the BJP in the state and remained with it at the Centre. The point, however, is that the DMK has done this. Its prompt decision suggests that it was just waiting for provocation. The DMK seems to be carefully working out for itself a position with options. Local politics being the real arena of the rivalry between the AIADMK and the DMK, the latter is not willing to grant the former either the luxury of a choice of support or the safety of an opposition split between the Congress and the NDA. It is a risk the DMK has thought worth taking  early days mean a longer time for pre-poll negotiations. As the BJP has pointed out, the DMK and the MDMKs departures will mean nothing to the NDA. That is now. Perhaps the DMK is looking a little further into the future.

		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 							 																						ADVANIS SECOND YATRAMani Talk Mani / Shankar Aiyar Hate expressHis first yatra was tragedy. This time round, it is pure farce. Till but last week, Lal Krishna Advani was trying to inveigle the Election Commission into recognizing him as the ersatz PM so that he could fly the field. The EC said, nothing doing. At which, as is usual in the Bharatiya Janata Party, the ever-present and ever-odious Pramod Mahajan rushed to the rescue. He refurbished the coach in which caught-on-the-camera bribe-taker Dilip Singh Judeo (a BJP favourite, as are all camera-caught bribe-takers) has been tearing around Chhattisgarh terrorizing innocent Christian tribals into converting to Hinduism. (Not re-converting, as they were never Hindus in the first place  but let that pass). There is an aching symbolism in this. Try as he might to deny that his is a Hindutva rath, Advani will be sitting in the same seat from which, in violation of Supreme Court directives regarding the non-use of threat and cajolery to secure religious conversions, Judeo has been wreaking vengeance on Christian missionaries these last several decades. The difference is that while Judeo wants to make tribals into Hindus, Advani aims at Hinduizing the entire nation.																														Why then does this recent convert from fancy aircraft and nifty helicopters to humble (if poshed-up) coaches want to travel by road the distance he intended covering by plane? Many reasons  each more ignoble than the other. First off, the 1990 Toyota rath was his moment of glory (and the nations moment of shame). It may have led to the death and maiming and burning and slashing of thousands of innocents but it undoubtedly brought the Bharatiya Janata Party to the centre-stage of our polity. Naturally, Advani feels miffed that instead of the credit for the carnage going to him, the BJP has preferred to crown the guy who sat out the outrage at Ayodhya in distant London.																														Moreover, the coach yatra will spell out in symbols of one syllable how fit young Advani is in comparison to the aging crock the BJP is projecting as its next prime minister. While the latter sags at the knees, the sprightly Advani leaps on to buses and traverses the length and breadth of the country. So, whos for PM?																														Third, even if it is to be Vajpayee Mark IV, Advani wants to ensure that some dark horse does not pip him at the post subsequently. He knows that the change at the top cannot be long delayed. When that contingency arises, Advani will be about as old as Vajpayee was in 1999. Sniffing at his ankles are the likes of Mahajan, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj  the so-called second line leadership. Any one of them could give Advani a run for his money if he does not establish himself pronto as numero duo going on numero uno. (Mahajan himself must entertain the delightful thought that the strain of bussing it all the way from Kanyakumari to Srinagar just might pave the way to the Mahajan era). So the Judeo yatra is to Advani not only a question of pushing Atal Bihari Vajpayee out of the race but also of keeping his juniors from overtaking him in the last lap. Adolf Hitler had his Night of the Long Knives. Advani has his Judeo Yatra.																														Then there are the deeper ideological issues. Vajpayee has remained a BJP PM for six long years by the simple expedient of repudiating everything the BJP stands for. Of course, nothing better can be expected from an unprincipled opportunist whose sole contribution to the freedom movement was pleading in a colonial court in the 1942 Quit India movement, Maine to kuch nuksan nahin kiya. This at a time when Gandhiji was urging his countrymen, Karenge ya Marenge. Advanis non-contribution to the freedom movement was more principled. As a follower of Guruji Golwalkar, Advani was too busy fighting the Islamic demons of his perfervid imagination to target the amiable Brits. And, as a follower of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, future founder of the Jana Sangh but at the time president of the Bengal province Hindu Mahasabha, he was too busy admiring Mookerjees cross-communal alliance with Fazul Haq of the Muslim League (and mover of the 1940 Pakistan resolution at Lahore) to find the energy to combat the British. Especially as his great hero, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the president of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha, was concentrating not on telling the British to Quit India but on sneaking into the Muslim League ministry in Advanis home province of Sind, as the Hindu Mahasabha had infiltrated Hyat Khans Unionist ministry in Punjab and was attempting to do likewise (if unsuccessfully) in the North West Frontier Province.																														Thus, what distinguishes Vajpayee from Advani is that while Vajpayee is the master of unprincipled opportunism, a rudderless voyager to any available seat of power, Advani is as faithful to his principles as Hitler was to his.																														Unlike the bogus Hindutva of Vajpayee, Advanis is a sincere commitment to a vicious cause. It is what makes him at once an object of veneration (for those who share his ideology) and an object of derision (for those, like me, who do not). Much of the sangh parivar, of course, identifies itself far more with the Advani line of principled hate than with the Vajpayee line of promiscuous political philandering. Vajpayee has made history by showing that laying aside principle is the high road to power. Pleased as they are at this demonstration of pragmatism over principle, the sangh parivar nevertheless asks: Power for what purpose?																														An inconvenient question because for Vajpayee, power is the purpose. He knows that the ideology he allegedly espouses is an ideology that three-fourths of the Hindus and four-fifths of the country find repugnant. So, he disguises his intent and raises double-speak to statesmanship. Advani is both more sincere and less subtle. He thinks there must be a purpose higher than mere power to seek power. That purpose, for him, is the making of a Hindu rashtra. He needs to say nothing to project himself as the prophet of Hindutva. His acolytes know him to be just that. (Just as Uma Bharti can jabber on all she wishes about bijli, sadak, pani: everyone knows she is at heart a masjid-wrecker). 																														So, while the ostensible reason for Advanis second yatra is binding together a nation that has been bound together for the last five thousand years, his real aim is to divide the nation between those who wish to preserve our inclusive secular heritage and those who wish to rescue themselves from one thousand years of bondage so that the Hindu might inherit Hindusthan.																														My speech-writer guru, H.Y. Sharada Prasad, once told me that a good speech is one which reverberates long after it has been delivered. Advani knows that his present yatra reverberates with the sounds of his last one. He knows that whatever he says or does not say, every passing spectator will remember his last yatra as they watch the passage of this one. He hopes that this will stir the same cauldron of emotions, unleash the same sentiments of atavistic paranoia, and uncork the same genie of hate and revenge which fuelled his last chariot of fire. Hence his protestations that Somnath is behind him and a re-invented Advani is hitting the road. Many are guilty of fooling some of the people some of the time; the BJP alone is capable of fooling itself all of the time.

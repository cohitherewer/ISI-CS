The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The name game				 																																																				Sir  Changing names comes easily to the Indian politician who is always eager to go one up in the race to be seen as being more patriotic than his rival. Thus, it is no surprise that Mulayam Singh Yadav should promise to change Indias name to Bharat if he is voted to power (Mulayam offers Bharat over India, April 10). Yadavs call however confirms his closeness to the Bharatiya Janata Party, a suspicion he has done nothing to dispel, either in action or in words. The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has traded his concerns for the minority community for the sake of remaining in power in the state. Yadav is proof of the deep fault line running through contemporary Indian politics; a division between the proponents of a Hindu rashtra and the secularists who believe India is and should be a melting pot. But if so-called secular leaders like Yadav change their spots, the writing seems to be on the wall, as far as the crusaders of pluralism are concerned.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Mohammed Iqbal, Calcutta
				 																Today is another day				 																																																				Sir  The third test match against Pakistan, which begins in Rawalpindi today, should turn out to be a close contest. India goes into the match with a strong batting lineup, but victory will depend on how well the Indian bowlers perform. The inclusion of both Ashish Nehra and Laxmipathy Balaji makes for a longer tail. But Nehra has been in and out of the team in recent times and it would have been wiser to include Ajit Agarkar, who is a better batsman. Nehra, of course, can be deadly, but his lack of experience in tests means he is a little rusty. None of the medium-pace bowlers have the potential to worry the Pakistani batsmen, but they must use the conditions well and bowl to a disciplined line and length. The question of who will open must be sorted out once and for all. 				 																																																				In spite of the fact that Akash Chopra did well opening in the first two tests, Yuvraj Singh is far too talented to be left out in Rawalpindi. While Chopra has an average of 28, Singh already has a century to his name. If Singh opens, it will take some of the pressure to score off Virender Sehwags shoulders. Also, Indians must not let the controversial lbw decisions against Chopra and Sachin Tendulkar affect their morale. They should learn from the Australians in this regard. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Nikhil Shah, via email

				 																																																				Sir  Sourav Ganguly does not deserve to be in the team that takes the field at Rawalpindi because of his recent listless form with the bat. But the irony is that as captain, it is Ganguly who makes crucial decisions on team selection while on tour. And he has decided to axe Akash Chopra, who has failed only once in the present tour  the first innings of the Lahore test (in the second innings, he fell to a dubious lbw decision). This is very unfair. In comparison, Ganguly has failed on numerous occasions. Chopra has also done a great job fielding at forward short leg. 				 																																																				But if Chopra must go, the least Ganguly can do is open the innings. It will be remembered that Ganguly was once so keen on opening the innings in one-day matches that he had displaced Sachin Tendulkar from the openers slot and then failed miserably, again and again. It was only when everyone protested that he was compelled to reinstate Tendulkar, who went on to become the top scorer at the last world cup, batting on this slot.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arun Tulshan, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sourav Ganguly retains his position in the team only because he is captain, otherwise there was no need to disturb the team, even if it did lose the last game. It is wrong to drop Akash Chopra, who has been a victim of bad umpiring. Batsmen lower down the order have done well because Chopra took the shine off the ball. He deserves a chance.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Indias defeat in the second test at Lahore can be attributed to two factors  inept batting and poor umpiring (Pakistan snuff out Indias faint hopes, April 9). While the Pakistani batsmen, especially Inzamam-ul Haq and Yousuf Youhana, benefited from dubious decisions by the neutral umpires  Steve Bucknor of West Indies and Simon Taufel of Australia  Indian players like Akash Chopra and Sachin Tendulkar were the victims. The third umpire, Nadeem Ghauri, too kept up the poor standards by wrongly adjudging Anil Kumble stumped out in Indias second innings. These incidents clearly show how poor umpiring can change the course of a match. Umpires should take recourse to television replays before deciding on a close call. Players should also have the right to appeal to the match referee against an umpires decision . While the International Cricket Council punishes players for showing dissent against umpires, erring umpires go scot-free. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Didnt Steve Bucknors admission that turning down Anil Kumbles appeal against Omar Gul was a mistake, come a little late in the day?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhojit Roy, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Would Steve Bucknor be on the ICCs panel of umpires had Australia or England been at the receiving end of these dubious decisions? It is especially unfair that India continues to suffer from bad umpiring, even though this is the country that brings in most of the sponsorship money.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shovon Chakraborty, Guwahati

				 																																																				Sir  The clich umpires are only human beings cannot excuse Steve Bucknors incompetence. While match referees monitor the players, no one evaluates the performance of match officials. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 							 																						PEACE IS A DISTANT DREAM Nishit Dholabhai																					Politics is a game, S.C. Jamir, the longest-serving chief minister of Nagaland, has often been heard telling aides and journalists. The game has, on four occasions, brought him within inches of death. But Jamir survives.																					And so does the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). For several years now, a war of words, bullets and ballots has ensued between them. But with a Congress-led government taking over in New Delhi, the scales have again tipped in favour of Jamir, though he is no longer chief minister.																					The NSCN (I-M), says Jamir, has fooled people in Nagaland for a long time with lop-sided policies and gone against the aspirations of the Nagas. In retaliation, Jamir accuses the NSCN(I-M) of not representing the aspirations of the Nagas. Jamir is a self-proclaimed Indian nationalist, who boldly tries to tackle the perceived distinction of Nagas and India at public fora. 																					The NSCN (I-M), meanwhile, continues to harp on the Naga peoples aspirations of sovereignty and integration. With or without popular support, the outfit has sustained its battle against the security forces and the rival NSCN (Khaplang) group since 1988. It is now poised at a juncture where the contradictions of politics may impel it to change track. We are not against the Congress, says a functionary.																					When the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland took over the reins of governance with the help of the National Democratic Alliance, little did the NSCN (I-M), or the chief minister, Neiphiu Rio, imagine that things would go so terribly wrong. But now the Congress is back and presumably, so is Jamir insofar as the Naga issue is concerned.																					The interlocutor																					Functionaries of the NSCN (I-M) indicate that they are preparing to brave the weather that is to come. They have no problems with K. Padmanabhaiah as chief interlocutor, they insist, even though many people say that the negotiations have reached a state where the presence of a senior politician has become necessary. 																					That senior politician may well be Jamir. The veteran Congressman has already said that a retired bureaucrat will not do and that a senior politician, well versed in the Naga problem, was needed as a new interlocutor. From Bangkok and Amsterdam to New Delhi, it looks all set to be a personality battle of sorts; notwithstanding Jamir reiterating that all sections of Naga society would be involved in bringing about an honourable and acceptable solution to the oldest insurgency in the country. 																					But the NSCN (I-M) rejects the claims of the other groups to represent Naga aspirations and claims that NGOs have been involved in the peace process, which it says is transparent. Among these other groups is the Federal Government of Nagaland, which has ambitions of holding fresh talks with New Delhi. A.Z. Phizos daughter, Adino, heads the group from London and has recently criticized the NSCN(I-M) in a message. 																					Nationalist debate																					The state government, on its part, has claimed that it is a facilitator in the peace process. But Nagaland seems to be in a transitional phase as it decides how to reconcile the dichotomy of having a state government for the purposes of day-to-day governance and getting resources from the Centre with the rebel groups negotiating with the Centre for fulfilment of their aspirations.																					No one has spoken yet of dissolving the legislative assembly for gaining independence nor is it likely to be pressed by either the people or the legislators. Thus it seems that it will be a personality battle between the Indian nationalists and Naga nationalists which will decide the course of history for Nagaland. Whether the personalities in question will be a part of these historical changes, will be seen in the days to come when the collective leadership  Isak Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah  visit New Delhi for the second time in 17 months.																					The Nagas, in the meantime, will try their best to prevent the hard-earned peace from slipping away even as they are experiencing the first signs of development.

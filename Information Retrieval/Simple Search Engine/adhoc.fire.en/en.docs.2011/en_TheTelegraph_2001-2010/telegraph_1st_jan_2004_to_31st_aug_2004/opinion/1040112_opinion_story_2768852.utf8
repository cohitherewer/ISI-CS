		 Monday, January 12, 2004  BEYOND THE PARTY LINE
 - How does one explain the CPI(M)s popularity in rural Bengal?  Kaushik Basu The author is professor of economics  and director of the programme on comparative economic development  at Cornell University Dating back to over a hundred  and fifty years, with heavy wooden doors, ceilings reaching  into the skies, a sprawling verandah overlooking a yard  with ancient banyan trees, the Circuit House in Bankura  is a curious mixture of the raj and independent India.  The latter adorns the wall in the form of portraits of artists  like Ramkinkar Baij and Jamini Roy, and the bookshelves,  where tomes left behind unwittingly by visiting bureaucrats  (Do-it-Yourself Plumbing and Heating, The Economic  Development of India by Brian Davey) rub shoulders with  books that may not be there quite as purposelessly, for,  read carefully, they could just win the Communist Party  of India (Marxist) a few more adherents among the vulnerable:  Das Kapital, three volumes, and the collected works  of V. I. Lenin. My visit to Bankura and, just  before that, to the Sunderbans, had nothing to do with tourism.  It was driven by curiosity. On most indices of development,  Bengal is trailing. Its rank, on Indias inter-state scorecard,  has slid, not just in terms of per capita income, but even  on social indices such as literacy, morbidity and the progress  of higher education. Talk to a random person in Calcutta  and he will tell you the disaster that the CPI(M) government  has been for the state. How then does one explain the CPI(M)s  electoral popularity and unwavering rural support? It is  this conundrum that compelled me to cut into my Calcutta  vacation and travel. Bankuras terracotta horses,  elephants and other artefacts are known the world over.  But hardly anyone knows of Panchmura, one of the primary  villages in which these are crafted. After spending a while  talking to the artisans who produce these works, we drove  to the village of Taldangra. Here we spent a long time talking  to villagers and, in particular, to the pradhan,  Sagar Goswami, the upa-pradhan, Sandhya Mondal, and  several members of the gram panchayat. During this  conversation, and also from talking to various people in  the BDOs office in Dhokra, one thing that became clear  was the Left Front governments policy of inclusiveness  in rural areas. The attempt has been to reach out to all  communities and caste groups. Ordinary Muslims, poor Hindus,  the scheduled castes and adivasis that we spoke to  told us how panchayat members came to their homes, ate with  them, visited them during their festivities and rarely discriminated  on grounds of religion and caste.  One of the panchayat members we  talked to, Ajit Basuli, was a peasant farmer. Well-versed  in global politics, he argued with me about intellectual  property rights and international labour laws. While he  clearly took the party line on most matters, it was impossible  not to be impressed by his personal simplicity and his commitment  to the poor, irrespective of their religion or caste. He  has learned the language of the Santhals, written a play  in that language, and spoke passionately about the importance  of mankinds common human identity. A part of this may well  be politics, but I also know that not all politicians speak  like this. This kind of behaviour must have helped keep  the winds of fascism away from the state.  It has been remarked, and I am  sure that there is truth to this, that there is discrimination  against those who are not members of the CPI(M). This is  deplorable of course, but not as bad as discrimination against  people for some innate characteristic of theirs, such as  race or religion. Faced with a party-based discrimination,  people can at least pretend to be sympathetic to the party.  Indeed this is happening in rural Bengal; far more people  claim to be communists than are communists or have a clue  about what communism is. One notable quality of the Left  Front administration that I could see in the Sunderbans  and in Bankura district is its commitment to the poor and  its relatively open decision-making process. The commitment  to the poor one would expect from a left-wing party. What  is surprising is the democratic openness, especially since  the worlds most important communist nations failed so miserably  in this regard. Here people seem to have a voice in what  projects are undertaken. And further, this is what has curbed  runaway corruption and helped prop up support for the left  front. The Left Fronts symbols are visible  in rural Bengal in a way that is un- imaginable in Calcutta.  The CPI(M)s official newspaper, Ganashakti, is easier  to get hold of than Ananda Bazar Patrika. Its pages  are pasted on public boards for people to read. The symbols  and slogans of the party leave little space on mud walls  for locally favourite films like Boumaar Bono- baash.  This propaganda blitz is also testimony to the organization  and reach of the party and the panchayat. No other party  in India has this kind of rural organization. This is what makes Bengals overall  poor performance a tragedy. With such well-developed grassroots  organization, and so many committed party workers, why has  the state failed economically? The answer is simple: just  commitment is not good enough. A group of people  whether  they be social workers or political activists  genuinely  interested in helping the poor can do some good, true, but  in overall effect they cannot match up to the benefits that  can come from a bunch of entrepreneurs and industrialists  who may have no interest in poverty removal, but set up  factories and firms to maximize their profits. The heightened  demand for labour that comes from a vibrant industry, and  the consequent (unintended but inevitable) increase in the  bargaining power of labourers, can rarely be matched by  merely providing direct financial and rhetorical support  to the workers, no matter how earnest the support. It is the failure to understand  this principle that explains Bengals trailing economy;  and this is what distinguishes Indias and Chinas communists.  The Chinese figured out this principle in the Seventies.  They realized that the laws of economics are like the laws  of nature. These have to be understood from the observation  of facts and the use of reason. Ideology may help shape  our values and objectives, but has absolutely no role in  understanding the link between policies and their effects.  In the world as it stands today, if one particular country  or region wants to prosper, it needs to attract industrialists,  multinationals and entrepreneurs. This realization cannot come too  easily to a political party, left or right, that is moored  in a fixed ideology. Such moorings usually lead to a reflexive  tendency to defend a position rather than to check it out  against facts. This comes out clearly from Eric Hobsbawms  recent autobiography, which is also a magisterial, if personal,  history of 20th century communism. Writing about his fellow-communist,  the charismatic Rajni Palme Dutt, he observes, [The] night  he spent in my house in Cambridgehad left me with a lasting  admiration for his acute mind and a lasting conviction that  he was not interested in truth, but used his intellect exclusively  to justify and explicate the line of the moment. I believe  that Chinas adaptation of communism came from its good  fortune of having a few creative leaders who realized the  truth and had the gumption to carry the cadre with them. I do not know if there are such  leaders here. But, given the organizational advantage that  the Left Front government in West Bengal currently has,  and the relatively greater honesty of its leaders, if it  can break away from the ideological shackles and change  its industrial policy, it can, I have no doubt, be one of  the fastest growing regions of the world.

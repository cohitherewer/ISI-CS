The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 							 																						MOODY PARTY																														Borrowing time is more expensive than borrowing money. The interest-rate on time is neither known nor calculable. The parliamentary board of the Bharatiya Janata Party put Mr Narendra Modi, the infamous chief minister of Gujarat, on borrowed time. The former prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and by any reckoning the BJPs numero uno, had raised the issue of Mr Modis removal from the chief ministership. All reports suggested that Mr Vajpayee was keen to oust Mr Modi. But the BJPs parliamentary board rather upset Mr Vajpayees apple-cart. This can be described as nothing other than a setback for Mr Vajpayee, the veteran of many inner-party battles. It could be argued, of course, that one setback does not make for defeat. Mr Vajpayee sees victory in a war of manoeuvre as a cold dish  much in the way the godfather, in the famous novel of the same name, saw revenge. Mr Modis political longevity has probably been extended to a few months till the BJPs session of introspection in August.																														Mr Modi has been granted this extra time because sections of the BJP and other wings of the sangh parivar do not want him to depart on the grounds that he prompted the anti-Muslim violence. This would be a trifle unpalatable to those who uphold the core Hindutva ideology of the sangh parivar. They would rather have Mr Modi shown the door marked exit on some other pretext. It is evident that Mr Modi has become a major source of embarrassment for the BJP after the Supreme Court described him as a modern-day Nero. Mr Vajpayee has added to the general disapproval by suggesting that the failure to remove Mr Modi after the Gujarat violence was one of the reasons for the BJPs debacle in the general elections. Mr Vajpayee atoned for this mistake by making Mr Modi step down now. The party demurred, not at Mr Modis removal but at the timing. The BJP would like Mr Modi to relinquish office at a time of its own choosing and not when Mr Vajpayee wants him to go. Mr Vajpayee will thus emerge as the eventual winner, but the setback indicates that his position within the BJP is not as unassailable as it once was. Any party is in flux in the aftermath of an election defeat, especially a defeat as unexpected as the one BJP suffered. The tussle between the individual and the party, as exemplified in laffaire Modi, is a part of the churning going on within a political party still struggling to come to terms with the loss of political power. Mr Vajpayee too is beginning to accept that instead of statesmanship occupying his mind and time, it will be inner-party politicking.

		 Friday, July 23, 2004 							 																						IN PRINCETON, ONE EASTER				 	 Thick descriptionThe Rule of Four By Ian Caldwell amp; Dustin Thomason, Westland, Rs 500The name of the book invokes a famous Sherlock Holmes novel. This helps in the initial placing of the book within a particular genre. But this novel, like the only book to which it can be compared, Name of the Rose, is impossible to contain within a genre. It is at the surface a thriller; it is also a deep exploration into one of the great mysteries of the Italian Renaissance; it is also a campus novel; those who are fond of codes and puzzles will find in it enough to make their hair stand on end. The sheer inventiveness of the two young writers is breathtaking.																														One location of the novel is Princeton. All the Ivy League universities in the US, because they are pale imitations of Oxbridge, have their own arcane rituals, protocol and clubs. The novel is a wry and somewhat backhanded celebration of this aspect of undergraduate life in Princeton. One aspect of Princeton plays a very crucial part in the unfolding of the novel and its denouement. Princeton, if the authors are to be believed, has a maze of steam tunnels below campus. Down there, they write, rats are more common than lightbulbs, the temperature hits three digits in the dead of winter, and the terrain is so dangerous that even the campus police are forbidden to give chase. To go down into the tunnels is an old Princeton game, or so the writers make out. It sounds too close to the tale of T.E. Lawrence discovering an underwater passage below the Isis in Oxford.																														The other location of the novel is quattrocento Florence. Florence, in the second half of the 15th century, was haunted by Girolamo Savonarola, who was briefly the citys religious leader. He saw himself as a spiritual reformer trying to end what he saw as excesses. His reform agenda involved the burning of numerous paintings, sculptures and manuscripts. At the heart of this novels mystery is a manuscript, Hypnerotomachia, whose unknown author tried to save works of art from Savonarolas bonfire of vanities.																														Four friends dominate the narrative, with one of them acting as the narrator. The four are Paul, Tom, Charlie and Gil. They are all different from each other in character and in background. For Tom, Hypnerotomachia has strong and sad family links. His father worked on the manuscript. For Paul, the manuscript is the subject of his senior year thesis. The bonding of the four undergraduates makes the first rule of four.																														Patrick Sullivan, Toms father, Richard Curry, a Princeton alumni and a dealer in rare books, Vincent Taft, a fellow of Princetons Institute of Advanced Study, a bitter and frustrated man who sees in the manuscript his last chance to leap into academic fame, and Bill Stein, another scholar interested in the manuscript  these form the second rule of four.																														As the events unfold, over one Easter, blustery and snowy, two of the second four are dead, probably murdered. One of the first four, seriously injured in a near brush with death, and another, disappeared without trace in the underground tunnels of the university, presumed dead.																														Behind these incidents lies the 15th century manuscript which provides  if Pauls reading of it is correct  a map to the biggest treasure of Renaissance art, saved from Savonarolas fury by one Francesco Colonna or his Venetian namesake.																														In an echo of Ecos masterpiece and of Savonarolas bonfires, there is a fire at the end. But does it devour Pauls secret as well as the secret of the great manuscript?

Bhaskar Ghose argues that in India the recipients of the kind of consideration that was shown to Peter Bleach have been almost invariably white The author is former secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting Colour plusPeter Bleach has left India, the remission of his remaining period of imprisonment by the president having, no doubt, improved the good relations between Britain and India. The fact is, of course, that Bleach was kept imprisoned when the others found guilty in the case, the Latvians, who were the crew of the aircraft that dropped the arms over Purulia, had been released some years ago; that act must also have helped improve the cordial relations India has with Latvia.These are not the first acts of their kind. In the past, too, persons found guilty by a court in this country and sentenced to prison have had their sentences remitted, no doubt to improve our relations with whichever country they came from. The recipients of this kind of consideration have been almost invariably white. Oh yes, there have been releases of other prisoners, just look at the way we released those Pakistanis, including the two boys; but the boys had merely lost their way and strayed into India, and the others were people who had served out their sentences. They were being kept imprisoned, would you believe it, because Pakistan was not releasing Indians who had similarly completed their sentences in Pakistani jails. In their effort to continue their silly tit-for-tat game, the officials in the home ministry obviously forgot that to keep anyone confined, one needs an order passed under a law, and the Supreme Court very rightly ordered that these Pakistanis be returned forthwith as there was no law under which they were being held.Its odd how we always seek to improve relations with various Western countries by releasing nationals of those countries who have committed a crime in India. They dont seem to bother to do the same thing. Not very long ago, a senior civil servant was arrested in London on a charge of shoplifting  a charge she vehemently denied  but she was charged nonetheless and sentenced. If one remembers correctly, she even spent a day or two in jail, or paid a fine, before she was made to leave the country. And she wasnt dropping arms over Cornwall or any other part of the United Kingdom.Its not that our diplomats dont try to help. The British are far better and more persistent at doing that, it is true, and they do it irrespective of the nature of the charge against the person. Theyve just managed to have a British national, who had come to the North-east to fight for the freedom of that region, released. Its just that our diplomats are more selective. Fishermen inevitably stray into the waters of Sri Lanka; its not, Im sure, deliberately done, but they are more often than not kept confined for months, if not longer. One can accept that Pakistan will keep Indian fishermen locked up for years  but then relations with that country havent exactly been cordial for a long, long time. And one has misgivings about how long the present smiles will last on the faces of the diplomats of both countries.But then, we ourselves appear not only to accept that white prisoners will be treated differently, we go one step further, as a rule, to ensure that differently coloured people are treated differently. Some years ago, I was coming back to Delhi from Chandigarh and was in a queue of persons checking in at the airport for the flight. This was in those wonderful days for Indian Airlines when they were the only airline in the country. A tall young black, possibly from Nigeria or Kenya, went to the check-in counter to ask when the flight was about to leave; he was, we learnt later, one of the students at the university in Chandigarh.You get back in line! the Indian Airlines official screamed at him. Dont come here again till I call you!The young man quietly went back to his place in the queue. Some of us protested and told the Indian Airlines clerk that he ought to have been more polite.None of you understand, he said to us viciously, Theyre all like that. They need to be spoken to like that. They understand that kind of language.Surely not, we said, shocked at the mans coarse behaviour and attitude.Then you come and work here, the man shouted, You can say all this because youre all going away to Delhi. Come here and you will see what these people are like.Some of us went to the young man and apologized, and assured him not everyone was as much of a boor as the Indian Airlines clerk.Its all right, he said with a rueful smile, Please dont draw attention to me now. Otherwise hell cancel my ticket.Now, it may just have been that that particular clerk was a twisted, vicious man; but a good many of us on the flight felt he was able to behave the way he did because there were others who did the same thing. There is, lets face it, a very marked racial prejudice running through a great many people in this country, even though many of us have complexions that are charcoal black.There is, then, the other side to it, the fawning on white people. During the last general elections I visited Khan Market, a market very popular with diplomats for some reason. I noticed a commotion going on a little way down and went to see what the matter was. To my horror, I found that at the centre of it was my daughter, with her son, then about three- years-old. She had been struck by a white woman who was enraged at my daughter having parked her car in front of her own glitzy limousine.Get out, she had told my daughter, which my daughter pointed out she was unable to do, the child on her lap making it difficult for her to look back and reverse. She asked the white woman to back her car out; as soon as she said that the woman came up to her and struck her across the face. A crowd gathered around my daughter and this woman, who kept saying Diplomat, diplomat. Someone had called the police and the station house officer, (the Delhi designation for OC) a woman, arrived. And this was when I saw the white person syndrome at work. She refused to register a case, saying that she was a diplomat and had immunity. I pointed out to her that she had committed a crime by physically assaulting someone, and her job as a police officer was to enforce the law and take action. If she had immunity, I told her, that would be something that would be taken up by her embassy. (She turned out to be Algerian.) But no. Nothing would make her register a case. She kept saying she was a diplomat, how could she register a case against a diplomat. I couldnt help feeling, as did many others there, that the woman being white  she looked white, fair skin, brown hair and light coloured eyes  had a great deal to do with the SHOs attitude. If she had been black, the SHO would have behaved differently.Its finally a set of prejudices we all share. Forget our predilections for those with fair skins when it comes to selecting brides; its an attitude across the board among many which shows up in the extra care taken with those who are European or American, and that distinct coldness when we deal with those who are brown or black, particularly black. With the former we are eager to improve relations with the countries concerned; with the latter we dont really care. The Latvians, and now, Peter Bleach have gone; and the case remains, a weird business if there ever was one. Someone comes and drops a large amount of weaponry over the country, and all thats left is a dust-covered mouldering AN-32 parked in one corner of Mumbai airport. Now well have to wait for the next lot who want to drop some arms over the country, and if theyre white, well get yet another chance of improving relations with the countries from which they come.

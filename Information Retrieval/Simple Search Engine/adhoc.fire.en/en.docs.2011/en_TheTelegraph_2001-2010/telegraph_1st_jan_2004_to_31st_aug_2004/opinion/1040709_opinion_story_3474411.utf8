The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 09, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Watered down				 																																																				Sir  The queen of England may be right in noting that a statue would not have done justice to Diana  especially given that a pre-bulimia appearance would be just as contentious as one ravaged by the eating disorder (Di memorial mellows monarch, July 8). But is the fountain all that the dead princess deserved from her husbands family? Couldnt the royalty have started a fund after her? Perhaps, her own family and Prince Charless could not think beyond a water-fount because her memory has ceased to matter to them. Look at how easily the Earl of Spencer now mingles with the Windsors.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Distress signal				 																																																				Sir  The medieval medical practices in West Bengal that the report, Pregnant woman slapped to induce labour in government hospital (July 6), brought to light once again underscores the pitiable state of healthcare in the state. The surprise expressed by the director of health services, Prabhakar Chatterjee, and the Indian Medical Association secretary, Moloy Patra, is sheer hypocrisy on their part (Merchants of pain, not relief, July 7). They cannot be entirely unfamiliar with the inhuman practices resorted to by doctors. Treating a patient with vocal anaesthesia for the lack of proper anaesthesia or tying up patients because of a shortage of staff is unimaginable in any civilized country. There can be no doubt that such cruel treatment violates ethical boundaries. If doctors still get away, it is because regulatory bodies like the medical council and the IMA are reluctant to find faults with them. As long as heads of such institutions and regulatory bodies continue with their hypocritical role, patients will face the savagery of doctors.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

				 																																																				Sir  Hitting a pregnant woman, especially when she is already in immense pain, is brutality at its peak. Not only should the doctor in question be given severe punishment, action should also be taken against the superintendent of the hospital since as manager he is equally responsible for the violation.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Vikash Goenka, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Marxist government which till recently believed uplift of the rural poor was its sole motto, now seems preoccupied with giving its urban population multiplexes and shopping malls for entertainment. Meanwhile, the rural poor continue to starve to death, as in Amlashol. Since the state governments coffers are empty, it is suggested that a legislation be passed that requires each promoter setting up multiplexes or housing projects in the state to pay 10 per cent of the cost of setting up rural healthcare centres in and around Calcutta. This will reduce the pressure on hospitals in the city and also better the nursing staff-patient ratio from the present 1:70 in some hospitals. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Incidents like the one which happened to Sandhya Mondol may adversely affect the unborn child in any pregnant woman. That Mondols son is in the incubator is probably one effect of this altercation. Will the hospital authorities be ready to shoulder the responsibility in all such cases?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Sen, Calcutta

				 																Role call				 																																																				Sir  There was a time when viewers could watch meaningful serials like Humlog and Nukkad. These depicted the problems of the common man. The trend has changed. Today, serials like Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Kesar and Kasauti Zindagi Ki give an unreal picture of society and do not deal with the lives of common people. Most of the characters in these serials have extra-marital affairs and live a lavish life. The storyline in these soaps change with the availability of the stars playing the roles. For example, Smriti Irani was sent to Hardwar in the serial because her political campaign demanded so. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Shadab Ahsan, Gaya

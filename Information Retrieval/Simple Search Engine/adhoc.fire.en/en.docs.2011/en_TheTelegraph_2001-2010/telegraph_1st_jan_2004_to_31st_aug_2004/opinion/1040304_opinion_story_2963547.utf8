		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 							 																						WAR AGAINST BUSH																														Change is coming to America. This is the core of the message delivered to his supporters by the self-declared harbinger of this change, Mr John Kerry. Mr Kerry  Massachussetts senator and New England patrician  has driven out his sole rival from the Democratic nomination race. Having won nine out of ten primaries across the United States of America, he will be the one to fight Mr George W. Bush at the general election in November. Mr Bush will be kicking off this eight-month-long spirited race by launching today a series of television advertisements in 17 battleground states. This is his first dip into the campaign-war chest of more than a hundred million dollars. Mr Kerry has already drawn attention to his Republican opponents trail of broken promises. The context of this statement is significant. Mr Kerry was criticizing the presidents stand on, of all things, gay weddings. Mr Kerry supports same-sex civil unions and opposes marriage. But his critique of the president is founded on a federalist point: marriage laws should be left to the states. 																														From the Vietnam war to the drug wars, Mr Kerrys vision of things is more complicated than Mr Bushs. This is what marks him out against Republican muscularities and also takes his politics beyond the usual Democratic obsessions with health insurance schemes, education and domestic issues. Although more jobs, better healthcare, a cleaner environment and a safer world remain his professed causes, his special strength lies in his mastery of foreign affairs and military policy, in both of which he has challenged Mr Bushs stewardship. He voted against the Kuwait War in 1991, but has supported military action against Iraq in the years since. He has taken the liberal critique of American unilateralism to a sort of muscular multilateralism, based on active engagement with west Asia, less pompous rhetoric, diplomatic consultation and the building of direct relationships with local intelligence and police agencies. His famous one-liner  No American son or daughter should ever again be sent abroad to die for oil  delivers a complicated message about foreign policy, militarism as well as energy conservation. Mr Kerry has also consistently opposed Mr Bushs wrecking of the Kyoto protocol. A leader of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War in the Seventies, a supporter of gun control and abortion rights and an opposer of the death penalty, Mr Kerry favours free trade, voted in favour of Mr Bill Clintons cost-cutting welfare reform bill and has promised to lead an international coalition against tax havens. Republicans allege that he would be the most anti-business president of modern times.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, March 05, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Generosity never pays				 																																																				Sir  Charity, like the quality of mercy, should not be strained. The report, Police wives protest charity (March 3), is proof of the justness of this principle. Indeed, as the policemen who have been directed to donate a part of their salary to the families of their colleagues killed in a recent mine blast say, they are sympathetic. After all, they know that they could well have been the ones killed. But why should they part with a portion of their salary? Isnt it the job of the government to pay compensation to citizens? The government, at least its political face, is very prompt in announcing generous compensations for soldiers and policemen killed on duty, victims of natural calamities and such like. But how much, if anything, ever reaches the families of the dead? What is doubly unfair is that it is largely because of the governments selfish and short-sighted policies that policemen continue to get blown up by mines and jawans die on our borders.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ritika Ghosh, Calcutta
				 																Dirty minds 				 																																																				Sir  Twenty-three years of teaching has convinced me that teachers in West Bengal  though they may subscribe to the official line of the progressive party in power  are some of the most prudish, unsympathetic and unthinking people around (Teachers cry down school sex syllabus, March 2). Unless they are retrained (which is next to impossible), sex education will never be possible in our schools, no matter how imperative doctors, sociologists and policemen feel it has become. 				 																																																				Sex, they are convinced, is unnatural, shameful and evil. The hallmark of a good man is not that he is not a liar, cheat, thief or a sadist, but that he never talks about sex. It is probably best never to have sex, but every vice is permissible so long as it is restricted to the right circles. Absurd as this may sound, I have known a male colleague weep when it was formally announced in the family that his wife was pregnant, because that made him a bad boy after all in the eyes of his parents, and a female colleague once declared proudly that she was convinced her teenage boy was not interested in sex, because he has never talked to me about it! 				 																																																				These teachers do not care that unprotected sex results in 60,000 babies a day, many of them unwanted, often for economic reasons, besides causing AIDS to spread to near epidemic proportions. For them, talking about sex is encouraging pornography, and sex education will lead to an instant collapse of civilization. It doesnt occur to them that perhaps it is the lack of proper sex education (which will lead to a discussion of its mental and cultural aspects rather than its physical ones  even dogs and cats dont need sex education to procreate) that is responsible for all the vulgarity, promiscuity, insecurity and avoidable suffering that we see around us today, especially among the youth. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur 

				 																																																				Sir  There is a general impression that Cartoon Network provides clean and wholesome entertainment for children. But many of the shows have very adult themes and plots. Besides, the portrayal of female characters in these cartoons would even make Pamela Anderson blush. Children who watch these cartoons are unknowingly absorbing these values. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Lalita Agarwal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  If it is uniquely American to sell sex in workshops, hotels and retreats, as Asra Nomani asserts in Tantra is the Mantra (Feb 29), then her experience proves that it is uniquely Indian to sell sex packaged in the mumbo-jumbo of religion to the West. Nomani is merely trying to con everyone by promoting our revered ancient cults as no better than pornography.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mrinmoy Goswami, Nagaon

				 																Noon break				 																																																				Sir  Mulayam Singh Yadavs order  now withdrawn  to close down schools after 12 noon on Fridays so that Muslim students could offer namaaz was merely a gambit to attract Muslim votes (Mulayam prays for Friday dividend, Feb 20). It is such gestures that accentuate the communal divide. It may be recalled that the Shiv Sena had started maha aarti on Mumbai roads to counter namaaz being offered on roads. There are already demands that Tuesday, the day on which many Hindus fast, be declared a holiday. Yadavs appeasement may prove counter-productive as it may stop many non-Muslims from voting for his party.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  The elections have exposed the communal face of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Muslims should see through his communal game. To their credit, many Muslim organizations and the Muslim personal law board member, Kamal Farooqi, have already condemned the decision, pleading for constructive actions instead of such communal gestures. Yadavs action makes one wonder at the so-called secular leaders commitment to secularism.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  I wonder if even madrasas close down for Friday prayers. Indias problem is that its politicians are still languishing in the medieval ages while its citizens have moved on to the 21st century. Worse, these leaders have a tendency to tamper with the functioning of every institution that comes under their purview. Students all over the country should launch a nationwide movement for education to be freed from the clutches of politicians. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

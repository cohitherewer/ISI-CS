		 Friday, August 20, 2004 							 																						TERROR IN SLEEPY SOUTH THE LAST JUROR By John Grisham,  Doubleday, pound; 27.95 The Last Juror, John Grishams  latest book, is set in a sleepy Mississippi town called  Clanton  where the most sensational crime is, perhaps,  a redneck taking a shot at a neighbour or perhaps his wife.  The Ford County Times, the local newspaper, is owned by  an eccentric old man who floods it with obituaries. After  the paper goes bankrupt, it is taken up by William Traynor,  a twenty-three year old Yankee-educated interloper from  Memphis. This causes considerable excitement in a town where  change is painful and slow. 																														When a young widow, Rhoda Kassellaw, is brutally raped and murdered by Danny Padgitt, a member of the notorious Padgitt family, Traynor grabs the opportunity and reports the case in all its sensational details.This leads to a rapid improvement in the papers sales. After a dramatic trial, the murderer, Padgitt, is sentenced to life imprisonment. Nine years later he returns and members of the jury start getting murdered putting the town in the grip of terror.																														The Last Juror, like Grishams other novels, is an intense and gripping courtroom drama. What makes it different from run-of-the-mill thrillers is Grishams understanding of human nature, his engaging narrative interspersed with wry humour. 																														Grisham fleshes out his characters well so that they come across as individuals. For example, Willies transformation from a smart-ass from up North with long hair and a little imported sports car to a respected inhabitant of the town  renovating an old house, sporting a bow tie, beloved on both sides of the colour line, and the only person to have attended each of the towns 88 churches at least once is well crafted. So is his relationship with the novels last juror, Miss Callie Ruffin, an elderly black woman who takes pity on him. The character of Baggy, and those of the inquisitive twin septuagenarian spinsters, Wilma and Gilma, are also drawn with care.																														Grishams forte is the legal thriller.But in this novel, he also manages to criticize yellow journalism, the nuances of small town politics and the differences between life in the South and the North. Though the book is hardly an on-the-edge-of-the-seat thriller, its leisurely pace is intriguing. But Grishams latest book is a must read for all his fans and all those who are new to this genre. 						JHELUM BISWAS

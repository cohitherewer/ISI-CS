		 Thursday, January 08, 2004  DOCUMENT WOMEN HAVE THE WORST DEAL  - Document  Extracts from the UNDP report HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003 Unconscious victims  The low economic and social position  of women in the south Asian region has profound implications  on the HIV epidemic. Women typically have limited access  to reproductive health services and are often ignorant about  HIV, the ways in which it can spread and prevention options.  Social and cultural norms often prevent them from insisting  on prevention methods such as use of condoms in their relations  with their husbands. The congruence between indicators of  womens poor status and their vulnerability to HIV demonstrates  the close link between patriarchy and HIV in south Asia.  The lack of decision-making is reflected in the increasingly  high rates of infection among what are traditionally considered  low risk population groups. The vulnerability of women is  evident in the high rates of unwanted pregnancies and high  prevalence of sexuality transmitted diseases. Women are  thrown out of their homes or deserted by their husbands  and are forced into situations where they are sexuality  exploited, whether for work or food security. Employers  and recruiters of women working outside their home country  often withhold passports and earnings. In Sri Lanka, girls  left in the care of friends and relatives, when their mothers  have gone abroad as maids, are often vulnerable to sexual  abuse. The impact of HIV is also more  severely felt by the women in the family. Positive and affected  women end up fending for the family, repaying debts, and  meeting hospital costs of the spouse. A study of their clients  by Lawyers Collective, an NGO in Mumbai, India, found that  out of the 67 positive women respondents, at least 60 per  cent were economically dependent and unemployed and 56 per  cent were widows. In several cases, it is the natal  family that provides more support to the positive person  than the marital family. This seems an extension of the  dowry demands made on the wifes family. As such, the economic  costs of the natal family tend to be invisible. A study conducted by UNICEF indicates  that most HIV-positive women became aware of their status  only after their husbands are diagnosed to be HIV-positive  or even as late as the death of their husbands. Such female-headed  households are unable to afford even basic medicines to  treat opportunistic infections. A women experiences dual  stigmatizationas a widow and especially a widow of a positive  man. Discriminatory access to property rights, shelter and  care facilities are some issues with which single and widowed  women are confronted. If the child is also diagnosed as  HIV positive (a likelihood, given the increase in mother  to child transmission), the burden on the mother increases. Studies indicate that the level  of education in women is linked to the information they  access about HIV/AIDS. A study analysing HIV/AIDS awareness  and prevention amongst women in India from the Second National  Family Health Survey found that only 18 per cent of non-literate  women had heard of HIV while 54 per cent of women with a  primary level of education had heard of it. Even here there  are regional variations. Women in states such as Tamil Nadu  and Kerala with higher rates of female literacy reported  higher awareness as compared to states like Bihar. Unequal access to resources: The  dualistic pattern of development in south Asia has meant  an incomplete epidemiological transition, with the simultaneous  prevalence of diseases of poverty (caused due to poor living  conditions and poor nutrition) along with diseases induced  by affluent lifestyles. This is reflected in the skewed  development of health infrastructure and facilities in these  countries. Thus, the rich in south Asia access the relatively  better equipped private hospitals while the poor rely to  a greater extent on public hospitals.  To be concluded

		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 							 																						A SILENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAR						A DAY IN THE LIFE OF The stillness on a bandh day in Calcutta lays bare an archaeology of noise																					Waking up on the morning of a bandh can be a strange experience. It feels as if one has gone back to the city of ones childhood. The old noises are suddenly heard again, and with them returns a certain forgotten quality of silence. The neighbours antique water-pump quivers awake, a bucket under the roadside tap fills up slowly, clothes are beaten clean on stone, a chabiwala passes by jangling his old keys, the bread-mans cycle brakes in front of the house, the boys play cricket, and there can be heard the resonant dredging up of phlegm that is an indispensable part of Indian personal hygiene. And all this suspended in a matrix of delicate birdsong. 																					Normally, only the crows manage to make themselves heard above the roar of traffic and the revving of cars getting ready for the working day, reversing shrilly, but tunefully, out of the garage. But the other is a web of more intimate noises that suddenly turns a jungle of houses, streets, pavements, people, animals, birds and trees into a neighbourhood. This rare, wide quietness on a bandh day is accompanied with the return of another vanished medium  fresh air. The light falls sharper and clearer on the empty roads, for there is suddenly no poison-filter.																					For those who have known riots, a silent, empty city might feel desolate and ominous. But driving through Calcutta yesterday morning, I remembered Wordsworths lines about the touching strangeness of a city in arrest, as he looks at London from a bridge on the Thames, early one morning in 1802: This city now doth like a garment wear/ The beauty of the morning: silent, bare,/ Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie/ Open unto the fields, and to the sky, / All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. To Wordsworth, the very houses seem asleep, and the city seems suspended in something graver and deeper than mere sleep: And all that mighty heart is lying still! Is this then the ghost of a dead city, fleetingly glimpsed by the poet, a city caught in an unnatural, yet surreally beautiful, parenthesis in time?																					There is something dead too at the heart of Calcuttas quietness on the day of a bandh. The city is serene, healthy, almost beautiful, inviting one to breathe, look and listen  but only after it has been rendered dysfunctional. And to savour this beauty is as perverse as allowing oneself to be captivated by the stillness of a man in coma. It is a serenity that is illicit, a sabbath kept on the ruins of the law.																					Yet this moribund stillness lays bare in the city an archaeology of noise. Buried noises rise up and fill the air from a seemingly dead layer of the citys history, startling us with a fleeting sense of the co-presence of other forms of life and nature around us. And this feels like going backwards in time  in every sense, the opposite of progress, but with an oddly touching, fragile and ephemeral quality to it.																					George Eliot had imagined, in the rapidly industrializing England of the 1870s, a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life. It would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrels heart beat, and, she added, we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. But there is a silence on the other side of a modern citys roar. And it requires a kind of death to get to it.						AVEEK SEN

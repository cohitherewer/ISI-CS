		 Friday, July 02, 2004 							 																						GET THE TEXT RIGHT FIRST				 	 Building blocks																														When one looks at the success stories of school textbooks, two features stand out in all of them. The text has been written for the average student with an eye on the kind of questions that would be asked in examinations. It is not for the above-average students who would know how to use more than one book to make their way to success.																														Second, every concept  be it for the sciences, mathematics or the social sciences  is explained repeatedly and from different points of view. This is followed by a series of exercises to drive the concept home. Repetition and intensive drills form the key to the books acceptance by students. Price can be a constraining factor but is not of overwhelming importance if the book meets the requirements of the vast majority of students. Also, for the social-science texts, partisan ideological views, of the right or the left, do not make for long-term success. 																														But when an author or a team of authors gets down to writing the text, the crucial question that it faces is what defines or describes an average student. There is a tremendous unevenness of standards even when the prescribed syllabus is the same for all schools. Given the daily pressures of teaching, school-teachers get walled in and hardly interact with others as far as the specifics of language, style and a general approach to the subject matter are concerned.																														Writing textbooks is not just about the contents of a book. It is about writing the text in a language and style that are comprehensible and interesting to the average student. The limits of language have to be defined: a vocabulary range of about 3,000 words (the old classics, Michael Wests General Service List of English Words and The International Readers Dictionary are still very relevant for our needs) and simple sentences. Language is the key to acceptance. 																														The present lot of NCERT texts is out. For the time being they are to be replaced not by the pre-saffronized textbooks but what is available in the market. There arent many and whatever there is, is based on the saffronized syllabus that has been rejected. So, students will have to depend mainly on class notes prepared by the history teachers. There will be a huge disparity in standards because not all school-teachers are of the same calibre and not all are equally dedicated or have kept up with the latest literature.																														NCERT teachers, or those who are commissioned to write the new texts, will have to work overtime to get them out before the next academic term in July 2005. This wont be easy for the simple reason that there are not many who can combine full-time teaching with writing the textbooks. NCERT will have to fall back on college and university teachers and an editorial team drawn from various schools across the country to examine the editorial content and its suitability for school students.																														The flaw lies here. College and university teachers cannot, as a general rule, write for schools as they operate on a different intellectual plane altogether. To get over the problem, NCERT will have to organize an editorial team with proper language skills and give them the authority to make changes in style and presentation without tampering with the subject matter. This is a combination not easy to come by.						RAVI VYAS

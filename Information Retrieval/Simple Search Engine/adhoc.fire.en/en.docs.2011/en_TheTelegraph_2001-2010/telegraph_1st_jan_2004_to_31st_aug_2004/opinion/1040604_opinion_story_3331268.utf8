The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 04, 2004 							 																						IN PICTURES, THROUGH PICTURES Over the years, Bollywood has gone from something approaching embarrassment for its sentimental, escapist, over-the-top fare to a near-triumphal vindication, as Hindi films catch on among the audiences in Europe and the US. No wonder then that in recent times there has been a rash of books on the subject. INDIAN CINEMA: THE BOLLYWOOD SAGA (Roli, Rs 1,950) by Dinesh Raheja and Jitendra Kothari is typical of these productions  pseudo-scholarly, high on pictures, low on text. To be fair though, perhaps the best way to tell the story of the pictures is through pictures  glamour down the ages from the sultry Nimmi to the swim-suited Sharmila. The focus in such books, inevitably, is on contemporary films and stars, while the more interesting silent and B amp;W eras get short shrift. But while there may not be anything path-breaking or specially illuminating in this book, it is helpful if all one is looking for is an overview.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, April 29, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																The fallen hero				 																																																				Sir  As a former football player and coach, P.K. Banerjees concern for the ailing Diego Maradona is understandable. But calling him the prince of the poor is taking things a bit too far (Indias pride rests on EB shoulders, April 28). Maradona was never one for charity, far from it; he is the quintessential bad boy of international soccer. English supporters may still recall how his infamous hand of god  which defied all notions of fair play  did them in at Mexico. During his heady years in Napoli, Maradona made all the wrong moves  hobnobbing with the Mafiosi, picking up the addiction to cocaine which eventually ruined his career, and cheating on his wife. He also suffered the ignominy of being booted out of the world cup after failing to clear a drug test. These facts prove that discipline  not talent  is the key to being the best in the business. Perhaps a dose of Banerjees famed vocal tonic would have prevented the likes of Maradona from going astray.

				 																Minority report 				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Changing to govern (April 25), is a little too optimistic in its assessment that, By wooing Muslims, the BJP is trying not just to win elections but also to reinvent itself as the natural party of governance. All the Bharatiya Janata Party cares about is coming to power; once it achieves that goal, all its promises to the Muslims will be forgotten. If the BJP were indeed serious about shedding its communal image and reinventing itself, it would have long ago severed ties with the sangh parivar, the Shiv Sena and other right-wing bodies whose leaders openly spew venom at the minority community. The party would have prevented the genocide of Muslims in Gujarat, made amends for demolishing the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya by giving up all plans to build the Ram temple there and also stopped insisting on a uniform civil code. But look at what the BJP has done instead. It has hailed Narendra Modi as the hero of Gujarat and allowed him to pursue his agenda unopposed in the state; and it has made the construction of the Ram temple a part of its election manifesto. Given all this, the prime minister is mistaken in thinking that he can secure Muslim votes so easily. A few Muslim leaders have joined the BJP, but they hardly command a following in the community. Besides, Atal Bihari Vajpayees efforts to distance the BJP from the sangh parivar will not bear fruit because many in the party still hold the saffron ideology close to their hearts and will not allow the party to change. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Serajuddin Khurram, via email

				 																																																				Sir  Unnerved by the exit poll forecasts of a hung parliament, the BJP has begun wooing the Muslims. That is understandable. But what is not is the BJPs use of pictures of Atal Bihari Vajpayee shaking hands with Pervez Musharraf on its Himayat Caravan, in order to appease Muslim voters (BJP caravan ride for minority votes, April 22). The renewal of the peace process between India and Pakistan must be welcome to all Indians  not just Muslims. When will our politicians realize that Muslims in India are Indians, and not Pakistanis? This realization needs to be driven home so that communal relations, which were damaged by the Gujarat riots, may improve. Instead, such moves by the BJP will further widen the differences between the two communities.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Reshma Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The BJPs bakwaas purush, M. Venkaiah Naidu, has been boasting that the party will win 300 seats. So can he explain why Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been so stricken by panic that he is going around with a begging bowl to every important Muslim leader, asking for Muslim votes? Does it not amuse the sangh parivar and the conscience-keepers of Hindus  Ashok Singhal, Vishnu Hari Dalmia, Praveen Togadia, Narendra Modi, Bal Thackeray  to see Vajpayees desperation to be prime minister again? Has the BJPs Hindutva lost its shine that it is unable to attract the votes of a majority of Hindus? 				 																																																				Perhaps, Vajpayee will now ask Pervez Musharraf to issue an appeal to all Indian Muslims to vote for the BJP. After all, if the Shahi Imam of Delhis Jama Masjid, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, can issue such an appeal, so can Musharraf, who has Indian roots. Has not Vajpayee helped him look good in the West with his offer of peace talks and stabilize his rule with the cricket series? After all, what will the octogenarian Vajpayee do if the BJP does poorly in these elections and he is forced to retire, rendering him unemployed like millions of others in the country? The nation should stop worrying about all its problems and help Vajpayee.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The news report, Another Muslim catch (April 12), about Rashid Alvi joining the Congress reveals the medias obsession with the minority community. A politician joins a party  and if he is Muslim, the media immediately gives it communal colour. When Smriti Irani joined the BJP, was her Parsi identity emphasized? Why are Muslims considered a separate class  and not just Indians? If this is not communalism, what is? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asoke C. Banerjee, Cambridge, US

				 																																																				Sir  By appealing to the Muslims, the BJP is losing its claim to being a party with a difference. There is really nothing to set it apart from the pseudo-secular Congress any longer. What if this costs the saffron party its core constituency  the Hindus?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
J. Sengupta, Calcutta

				 																Waste end				 																																																				Sir  After the Biomedical Waste Rules, 1998, was promulgated, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had been collecting biomedical waste from various hospitals and dumping them in a secured landfill in the Dhapa disposal ground. Eight to ten closed vehicles were used to collect the waste, and the average daily collection never exceeded 2-3 metric tonnes per day. 				 																																																				Calcutta generates about 15 MT of biomedical waste everyday. By a notification, the CMC stopped collection of the waste from April 1, 2004, which is now the responsibility of the pollution control board and its joint venture partner. The private partner set up a plant consisting of an incinerator with 250 kilograms/hour capacity and 2 baby autoclaves. It has 2 three-wheeler vans and one CMC-like closed vehicle. The rate charged to hospitals and nursing homes  Rs 2.70 per day per bed  is very high. Hospitals in Calcutta and Howrah have about 40,000 beds and the above equipment cannot take care of the proper collection and disposal of the hazardous waste generated. There is also no plan for the effective movement of the vehicles without accident or spillage. The authorities have also not consulted citizens forums before selecting the site of the central facility. 				 																																																				Within 7 days of CMCs stopping its collection of biomedical waste, Calcutta has been thrown on the verge of an epidemic by a section of the policy-makers. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Anita Mukherjee, Calcutta

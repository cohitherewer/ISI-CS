The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 04, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Leading from behind				 																																																				Sir  Sonia on line to Mayavati (Jan 2), shows that no matter how honest an appearance Sonia Gandhi may want to put on of burying the hatchet of the leadership question, the prime ministerial candidacy still remains a moot point in alliance-formation for the Congress. It is not without reason that Mulayam Singh Yadav cold-shouldered Sonia, who was promptly online with Mayavati. And remember, the Dalit queen has no problem accepting Sonias leadership. Her target is getting back at Yadav and the saffronites and she will do it anyhow. Each to his (or her) own, isnt it?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Charu Sil, Calcutta
				 																Target practice				 																																																				Sir  Several theories are doing the rounds with regard to the second attempt to kill the Pakistani general, Pervez Musharraf. The report, Attack after attack on Musharraf (Dec 26), shows how the terrorists are fearlessly at large in Rawalpindi. According to observers, extremist groups dislike the concessions being offered to India on peace talks. We must not forget the audiotape recorded by the deputy leader of al Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahari, who urged Pakistanis to overthrow Musharraf for supporting the United States of America and for indulging in anti-Islamic activities. Having befriended the US, and being forced to concede to India on American demands, it will be impossible for Musharraf to backtrack now. Besides, he had himself nurtured the terrorists to hit back at India. Now he is reaping the fruits of that policy. 				 																																																				Musharraf has survived three attempts already. The fourth time he may not be so lucky because the terrorists have probably succeeded in infiltrating his own security staff. Without a security lapse it is impossible to thus target the president repeatedly and that too, within a distance of only 200 yards from the place of the earlier attack.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  The successive attacks on the Pakistan president has once again proved that unscrupulous elements are out to vitiate the peace initiative between the two neighbours. Pakistan should rise to the occasion and ensure full security to the leaders and intellectuals who will be attending the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. For these men will try to scuttle any good that may come of the meeting. Besides, if the presidents life in Pakistan is so at risk, the ordinary people of the country must be even more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manzar Imam, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Does Pervez Musharraf realize what a ridiculous position the multiple assassination attempts have put him in? Here is a president of a nation fighting a global war against terrorism, and yet he has no control over his own house. Or is he getting only what he deserves?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																Wrong picture				 																																																				Sir  There has lately been a lot of hullabaloo about the results of the National Readership Survey concerning which national daily has replaced which at the number one position in the Delhi market. While circulation means copies sold, readership connotes the number of people who actually read the newspaper. And this readership is sometimes decided by the management which dictates policy. Contents of a newspaper are carefully packaged so as to suit the mood and tastes of a growing number of consumers. Abundance of page-three material is just one indicator of how this change is happening. 				 																																																				For old-timers whose number, admittedly, is shrinking, the quality of a newspaper rests elsewhere. Authenticity of news, unbiased reporting, independent and balanced views in editorial columns, quality print and photographs are some of the criteria. Judged by these parameters, I wonder whether there has been any survey to shortlist the national dailies. If not, shouldnt there be a sincere endeavour from some organization of repute, whether governmental or non-governmental, or from a panel formed of former distinguished editors or eminent journalists to set the record straight?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Debaki Nandal Mandal, Calcutta

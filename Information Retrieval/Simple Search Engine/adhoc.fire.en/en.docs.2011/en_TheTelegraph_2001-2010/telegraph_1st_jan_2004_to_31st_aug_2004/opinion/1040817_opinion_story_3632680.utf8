The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 							 																						BRIDGE OF HOPE																														There is an obvious, but all too often neglected, difference between the making of promises and the keeping of them. Mr Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, emphasized the need to keep promises in his maiden Independence Day speech. Beyond the ritual of a prime ministerial address to the nation from the Red Fort on August 15, Mr Singh introduced a new tone into an occasion, which in the past has been marked more by rhetorical flourishes than by substance. Mr Singh is not prone to rhetoric, and his speech reflected his own personality: sincerity and dignity articulated with a quiet confidence. He did not, however, shy away from addressing some of the key issues that face his prime ministership. One key issue Mr Singh raised was the sharing of water resources which has suddenly emerged as a divisive matter. He spoke for a national and holistic approach to managing the nations water resources. The rivers belong to the nation  this seemed to be the underlying message from the prime minister. But how the states are going to access this massive natural resource in a riverine country like India is a question to which there is no simple answer.																														If water management appealed to the realist in Mr Singh, health and education inspired the idealist. He spoke of removing the shackles of ideology and bureaucracy from education. He identified his main challenge as being the rejuvenation of the government, and identified this as the principal aim of economic reforms. The path to rejuvenation lay through the creation of a new code of ethics which will have the engagement and the participation of all political parties. Mr Singh admitted that public life in India had experienced a steep decline. He suggested that this problem could not be solved by taking a partisan position on the matter. Mr Singh thus announced no new schemes of welfare from the Red Fort. The spirit of his speech was rededication. Mr Singh painted the big picture for the nation and indicated the direction the ship of state would take under his helmsmanship. He identified seven pillars  agriculture, water, education, health, employment, urban renewal and infrastructure  which stand for what he called the bridge of development. The building of this bridge will not be easy, but Mr Singh put before the nation the only way to cross the troubled waters.

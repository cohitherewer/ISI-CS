		 Monday, March 22, 2004 							 																						INVASION FROM THE NORTH Gwynne Dyer																					Samuel P. Huntington, chairman of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies and co-founder of Foreign Policy magazine, is like a dog that has only one trick: weve all seen it before, but he wont stop doing it. Were going to have to stop giving him biscuits.																					Huntingtons trick is to identify some alleged new threat to security in the United States of America, dress it up in academic language, and inflate it to bursting point. He did it in 1993 with his essay, The coming clash of civilizations, which warned Americans that the Islamic hordes were coming from the east while the Chinese hordes were growing to the west. It did very well in US national security circles, where people whose jobs were endangered by the end of the Cold War were urgently looking for some new threat to justify their pay-cheques.																					He recycled the article as a best-seller in 1996, and the book enjoyed a second life after 9/11, but now its time for a new threat. This time its the Mexican hordes coming from the south. In the most recent issue of Foreign Policy, he poses the question: Will the US remain a country with a single national language and a core Anglo-Protestant culture? (Or will) Americans acquiesce to their eventual transformation into two peoples with two cultures (Anglo and Hispanic) and two languages (English and Spanish)?																					The new threat																					Dont confuse Huntington with the foul-mouthed bigots who usually rant about the Mexican peril. But his article, The Hispanic challenge, is a trailer for his new book, Who Are We? The Challenges to Americas National Identity, and one suspects that his definition of We does not include African-Americans, Muslim Americans, or Mexican-Americans. In fact, it doesnt really even include Catholic Americans.																					Huntington is not predicting that Mexican-Americans will grow into a permanent Spanish-speaking minority as important as the French-Canadians in Canada, a culture that diverges from the traditional white, Protestant culture of the US, and the political clout to impose bilingualism nationwide. Hes just warning about it, thats all (hes too cunning to court charges of extremism by suggesting specific policies).																					It would be a waste of time to go through his arguments piecemeal, a couple of examples will suffice. He admits that the share of Mexican immigrants in current US immigration is lower than that of Irish immigrants in 1820-1860 or of German immigrants in 1850-1870, but insists that the danger is greater now because Mexicans wont assimilate.																					Then he quotes a study showing that over 90 per cent of second-generation Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles speak fluent English and that over 60 per cent of them speak either no Spanish or worse Spanish than English. 																					Happy neighbours																					But he frets that with the rapid expansion of the Mexican immigrant community, people of Mexican origin would have less incentive to become fluent in and use English in 2000 than in 1970. Yes, they might, but wheres the evidence? There is none; just false parallels and unsupported conclusions.																					He really ought to get out more. He might start by visiting Canada, which takes in proportionately twice as many immigrants as the US, picking them by rules that give every region of the world an equal chance. As a result, about a quarter of its immigrants are Chinese. Old-stock Canadians, whether English- or French-speaking, seem remarkably unalarmed by this, and most non-white Canadians will tell you that they live in a less racist society than the one next-door.																					If nothing else came of his Canadian trip, Huntington would come home with two good ideas. One is how to solve the Mexican problem: open up Americas doors to immigration from all over the world at the same per capita rate as Canada, and Mexican immigration would quickly shrink to relatively insignificant proportions. Alternatively, when he needs a topic for his next book, he could write about the hordes of black, brown and yellow Canadians, who are about to inundate the US from the north.

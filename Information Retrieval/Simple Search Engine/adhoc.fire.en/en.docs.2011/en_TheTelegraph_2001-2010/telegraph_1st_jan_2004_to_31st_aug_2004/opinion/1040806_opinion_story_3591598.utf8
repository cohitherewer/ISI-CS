		 Friday, August 06, 2004 							 																						ALL IN THY NAME				 	 From the pages of historyTHE REFORMATION By Patrick Collinson, Weidenfeld  amp; Nicolson, pound; 14.99The most important cultural revolution witnessed in Christendom was the Reformation. It was begun on All Saints Day by an unknown monk named Martin Luther in the German town of Wrttemberg in 1517. It would be a gross oversimplification to say that the Reformation began with this one act. As Patrick Collinson in this compact and readable history of the Reformation explains, the idea that drove Luther had been around in the medieval world for some time. Luther spoke for history at the right time, and there was no stopping an idea whose time had come.																														One neglected aspect of the Reformation is emphasized by Collinson: The Reformation was awash with words. Luther himself was prolific: a book a fortnight for thirty years. Luther was full of the Word. This was the Logos as expressed in the opening verse of St Johns Gospel, In the beginning was the Word. For those who protested against the Roman Church and thus came to be known as Protestants, Word of God was a synonym for the Bible. The reformers believed that the Church was to be validated by the Bible, not the Bible by the Church. The Word had to be heard and read.																														In this celebration of the Word, two developments were crucial. One was Renaissance humanism which cleaned up Latin and thus enabled the Latin edition of the Bible (the Vulgate) to become popular and translatable into the vernacular. The other was the invention of book production by means of movable type by Johann Gutenberg. Collinson writes, If language made for shared identities, including national identities, print constructed a common vernacular language that was imposed on an infinite number of local dialects. Those who virtually invented the literary languages of the future, Luther for Germany, Tyndale for England, John Calvin for France, were expert linguists who brought their Latin, Greek and even Hebrew to bear on the task. In the 16th century, the nation was imagined through the Bible and texts made people. This was perhaps the worlds first textual turn.																														Luther set in motion events over which he had no control and which he did not approve. The European Reformation was not everywhere a Lutheran Reformation. Even in Germany, every preacher and pamphleteer was a reformer according to his own lights. Other regions and cultures invented their own reformations. Calvin in Geneva and the Henrician Reformation in England.																														The latter, because it was a movement that flowed from the monarch downwards, most critically raised the question of relationship between politics and religion. Cuius regio, eius religio  rulers have the right to determine the religion of their subjects  became a hotly debated subject. A dominant strand of Protestantism believed that men had a duty to resist an ungodly king. From duty to resist to a right to resist was a big but logical step.																														Collinson builds into his analysis the story of the Counter-Reformation, through which the Roman Church decided to protect its turf and terrorize the faithful. Collinson writes without the weight of his formidable scholarship on his shoulders. This allows him to prise open arcane theological issues for the comprehension of the layman.

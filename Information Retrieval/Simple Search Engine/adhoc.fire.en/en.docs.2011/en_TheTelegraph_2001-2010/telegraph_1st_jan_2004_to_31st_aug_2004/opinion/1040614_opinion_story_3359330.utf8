The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 14, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Change of heart				 																																																				Sir  The creation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act by the Bharatiya Janata Party has always been mired in controversies. The United Progressive Alliances promise of repealing this act comes as good news. But what is more heartening is the assurance given by the home minister, Shivraj Patil, that the new government will incorporate provisions in the existing criminal laws against terrorism (Patil walks terror law tightrope, May 12). Ever since its inception, the POTA has either been used arbitrarily to make arrests or to settle political scores  the most famous instance being J. Jayalalithaas use of it to keep her opponent, Vaiko, out of her way. Patil, in trying to reverse such misuse of a draconian law, should make use of the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code to come up with new means of tackling terrorism. This will be the perfect way to stick to Indias commitments to the United Nations Security Council and, what is more important, the Congress can also earn laurels for taking preventive action with a human face.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Chaitali Chakraborty, Calcutta
				 																Clear the air				 																																																				Sir  The editorial, Water in peril (May 28), points to the problems that arise because of the inordinate emphasis on growth rather than development in modern economics. The massive environmental degradation that we see today is the result of wrongly equating growth with development. 				 																																																				Waterbodies do not just provide water in a locality, they also help maintain its ecology and economy. Above all, they play a vital role in recharging groundwater. Studies by the Geological Survey of India, Indian Meteorological Department and Central Ground Water Board have revealed that there has been virtually no regeneration of groundwater in Calcutta. This, together with the indiscriminate and large-scale withdrawal of groundwater, has resulted in the water table in the central city area dropping by an alarming nine metres. Normally, underground water flows north to south towards the sea. But the flow has been reversed in Calcutta, raising chances of the north-flowing bracken waters mixing with the sweet reserves. Also a bowl-like subterranean trough has formed beneath central Calcutta. This, and the falling water-table, enhances the risk of massive landslides. In 1980, a study had revealed that Calcutta had sunk by one centimetre. 				 																																																				Besides, structures built on landfills are susceptible to damage during quakes since the soil particles in such areas are loosely bound. This is what caused the massive destruction in the Kobe earthquake of January 17, 1995. 				 																																																				Policy-makers and city-planners need to be aware of all this when deciding on the fate of waterbodies in and around Calcutta.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Jaydev Jana, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Many a seminar and lecture was organized on June 5, World Environment Day. But what is the state government doing to improve the air quality in Calcutta and other parts of West Bengal? Large sections of the wetlands on the eastern fringes of Calcutta are being converted into concrete jungles, despite the warnings of ecologists. I have been visiting Rajarhat for many years now  much of the once lush greenery is lost now. Can not the wetlands in the east be spared and the city developed along the north-south corridor, and Howrah be developed into a comparable, twin city? Also, cant we keep at least 300 metres of greenery between two housing blocks?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  I left Calcutta after having lived in the city for 29 years. The report, Draw in death with every breath (June 3), encapsulates all the reasons why I left. The citys air has been getting steadily worse. Everybody complains about it but the people who have the power to do something about it seem reluctant to go all out to do whatever it takes to make things better. Are they worried about unions, votes, bandhs? They should follow the example of Delhi  get the public transport, the buses, cabs and autos, moving on compressed natural gas. This will take care of 80 per cent of the pollution. If there is a will, there is a way. But how long will it take the authorities to get down to action? Five, ten years? Or perhaps never?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I was born and brought up in Calcutta, and had been suffering from severe chronic bronchitis since I was two years old. I was used to carrying an inhaler around all the time. But ever since I came to Stanford University two years ago, I havent had a single attack. Everyone, including my doctor, is surprised. That says everything about the situation in Calcutta. Also, I didnt know leaves could be so green or the sky so blue until I came here. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully

				 																																																				Sir  The chart, Failure foul in clean-up class (June 5), exposes the West Bengal chief ministers hollow claims of doing the best to improve the environment. Since they have not been doing anything to bring their plans to fruition, no results are visible. Isnt the government to blame when the civic body chops down trees in the name of development or poachers have free run of the Sunderbans? The people have had enough of lectures and symbolism, it is time for action now. It may already be too late, but more will be lost in all the time that is being wasted on the awareness campaigns. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bikram Sarkar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Trees are being cut down and ponds are being filled with mud and garbage everywhere in the city. The people who do this and the government which condones such acts do not understand that the cutting down of trees disturbs the oxygen-carbon dioxide ratio in the environment. Also, citizens must learn to conserve natural resources so that the future generations can see and use them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ankur Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I regret to observe that Calcuttans are woefully ill-informed of the ban on smoking in public areas. The other day, while dining at a speciality restaurant in Ballygunj, I was astonished to note that the other patrons there were smoking away freely. On telling the management of my discomfort, I was firmly told that the restaurant was a smoking zone and anyone was free to smoke if they so desired. I was also told that they did not have a non-smoking zone on the premises. All my protests fell on deaf ears. Can any law achieve its objective as long as people refuse to obey it?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Amrita Bhaumik, Calcutta

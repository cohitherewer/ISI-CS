The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 30, 2004 							 																						UNPRODUCTIVE CONFRONTATIONSTwenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan 				 	 Action and reaction																														Politics in India is on the simmer again but not over substantive issues of governance. The polity is getting unnecessarily confrontational, with no one sure of how the system would get out of this unproductive face-off. The next milestone seems to be the Maharashtra election. It would decide whether the system would become less dysfunctional or not.																														The present situation cannot be understood in terms of who started the confrontation first. A relationship of conflict over programmes and ideology between the ruling party and the opposition is a given in a democracy. But the leading political parties of the country  the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party  seem to be pushing for extremely confrontationalist politics, in which larger public concerns are absent.																														The BJP would argue that it is the Congress that gave currency to such politics. When it was in the opposition, it raised the issue of tainted ministers in the National Democratic Alliance; it boycotted the then defence minister, George Fernandes, in parliament; he was accused of being involved in the coffin scam and there were allegations of a senior ministers son being involved in the purchase of AK-47 rifles.																														Yet, now that the Congress is leading the new government, it has not investigated these alleged cases of corruption. Not one case has been registered. If today the Congress is getting paid back in the same coin, why should they be blamed, BJP leaders seem to be asking?																														The BJP on its part does not seem to have emerged from the shock of having lost the general election, more so because their defeat was solely the handiwork of the foreigner they had so maligned. Moreover, her stature has grown manifold after she gave up the prime ministership that was offered to her on a platter.																														If the BJP is still confused and shocked, the Congress seems also to be nursing bitterness in its heart. The relentless attack of the BJP and its allies targeting Sonia Gandhi and her family seems to have created deep psychological wounds in the Nehru-Gandhi family. Sonia Gandhi was described variously as a smuggler of antiques and a dumb woman with no political sense. 																														The academic record of her son, Rahul Gandhi, at Cambridge University was meticulously investigated as if he was a third-rate fraud. And even today, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh supremo, K.S. Sudarshan, does not flinch when he alleges that Sonia Gandhis father was a CIA agent.																														Yet, the Congress needs to shed the bitterness that such attacks might have bred. If it does not, it is bound to merely keep reacting to the provocative jibes of the opposition. 																														The campaign launched by the human resource development minister, Arjun Singh, to detoxify the education system is thoroughly ham-handed. Even if the Indian education system needs to be reformed, its transformation cannot be achieved by handing over decision-making to a gaggle of crass slogan-mongers.																														As for the BJP, the party seems to have learnt two lessons from its defeat at the hustings. One, that the confrontationalist path followed by the Congress in parliament eventually paid off. Two, the party is once again wondering whether it made a mistake by giving up the path of Hindutva as an electoral strategy. This confusion over the development versus Hindutva issue was evident in the BJPs national executive in Mumbai. That the party could not make up its mind on this issue was evident when it took a diametrically opposite line from Mumbai a few weeks later in Goa.																														There are some indications that the BJP has come to an uneasy compromise on this issue: Hindutva as a mobilizational strategy would be used at the local level, while the national leadership will not embrace Hindutva openly. While the former will allow the consolidation of the Hindu vote, the latter strategy will help keep the NDA partners together.																														The Uma Bharti issue, the Savarkar issue and the bomb attacks on Friday Muslim congregations in the election-going state of Maharashtra are likely to contribute towards the consolidation of the communal Hindu vote. It remains to be seen whether the bomb blasts in mosques in Maharashtra are part of a plan, but the intention of those behind the bomb blasts seems to clearly be aimed at scaring the Muslims and polarizing the electorate.																														The outcome of the Maharashtra election would determine how the BJP would forge its future strategy. If it wins  and as of now the odds seem to favour its victory  it would be emboldened to continue its agitational approach. It would then further feed the vicious cycle of reactive politics that is making the political system dysfunctional. Only if the BJP loses Maharashtra would it be forced to rethink its national political strategy.																														Meanwhile, a political initiative also seems to be on to destabilize the United Progressive Alliance government, with George Fernandes being actively encouraged to forge a third front. By excluding the Congress, left parties and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, such a political formation could be supported by the BJP from outside, enabling the likes of the Samajwadi Party and the Lok Janashakti Party to join the front. If one examines the numbers in the 14th Lok Sabha, then such a front can hypothetically muster 277 seats  well past the halfway mark  even if one assumes that besides the left and the RJD, even the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha would not join it. 																														Such a front can rule for a year or so with the BJPs support before a general election is precipitated. The interregnum would be used by the BJP to consolidate, strengthen its state governments through Central largesse, and revitalize its front organizations. Essentially it would use this period to prepare for the next Lok Sabha election so that it can gather a tally of over 200 seats.																														The basic premise of this scenario, of course, is the weakening of the Congress, such as through its defeat in Maharashtra and ensuring that governance is crippled.																														So, clearly a Congress defeat in Maharashtra would destabilize the political system. Its position in the UPA would be weakened and its bargaining position with Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar, where elections are due early next year, would be eroded. Laloo Yadav would then be unlikely to give many seats to the Congress.																														Conversely, a Congress win in Maharashtra would help reassert the partys primary position as the leader of the UPA and would be a vindication of its policies. The Congress then might also be able to get a sizeable chunk of seats in Bihar. However, the Congress partys long-term political future is unclear because of the contradictions of its political coalition. Its allies at the Centre are also its main competitors in the states.																														In a more immediate sense, the Congress needs to get out of the vicious circle of reactive politics. The only way out is to embark on highly visible radical national programmes that put the opposition on the defensive. These can be in the areas of poverty alleviation, education, infrastructure, overhauling governance or irrigation. Imagination should be the limit for conceptualizing these programmes, which will identify the UPA and the Congress with positive, pro-people, initiatives rather than with tit-for-tat reactions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 							 																						CONTRACT BRIDGE																														Outside of totalitarian regimes, the rule of law and the law of contract are the two pillars that hold society together. They ensure the sanctity of property, and the law of contract facilitates commercial and business transactions that take a society forward in economic terms. The law of contract also upholds certain important societal institutions like marriage, inheritance and so on. In India, the respect granted to the rule of law and the law of contract has been a noteworthy legal landmark especially when India is compared to, say, Pakistan or China. But recently, the rule of law and the law of contract have come under a threat emanating from a most peculiar quarter: public interest. Increasingly, the courts are being asked to take cognizance of something called public interest when looking at certain issues. In some cases, the courts at various levels have recognized public interest as a valid basis for their judgments. The Telegraph in its various editorials on matters legal has advocated judicial conservatism and has argued that the job of the judiciary is to judge whether something is within or outside the laws of the country. If something violates the law, the court has the additional responsibility of meting out an adequate punishment for the violation to the violator. There already exists a forum to decide on what upholds public interest and what does not. This is the Lok Sabha, where the elected representatives of the people meet to pass laws or amend existing ones. The judiciary should not step on the legislatures turf under any pretext.																														What denotes public interest is a thorny issue. Its definition will vary according to the position one adopts. Such an ambiguous and fluid idea should not be allowed to dilute the law of contract, the existence of which is an enabling condition for any commercial transaction and for some societal conventions. Even nationalism should not be allowed to violate the law of contract in the guise of public interest. It will benefit the judiciary and the functioning of society if public interest litigations are prohibited by amending the Constitution. A ban on PILs would allow the judiciary to concentrate on what is really their responsibility: the enforcement of the laws of the land. The transgression of the law of contract under the magisterial flag of public interest has made commercial transactions vulnerable to causes and interests that have no relevance to commercial transactions. This situation should not be allowed to prevail and grow if India is to enter the competitive world of the 21st century.

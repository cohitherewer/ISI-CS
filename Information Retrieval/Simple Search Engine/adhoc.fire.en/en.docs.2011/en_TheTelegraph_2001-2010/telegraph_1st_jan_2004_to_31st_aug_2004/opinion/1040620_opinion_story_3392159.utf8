The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, June 20, 2004 							 																						HOME FIRESAs tensions between mothers- and daughters-in-law erupt into the court, it must be asked if fear of the law is the best wayto a harmonious existenceDomestic drama is always a best-seller. The saas-bahu serial hogs prime time slots on the idiot box, recreating tensions, highfalutin sentiments and maudlin tears in a frantic recall of things as they once were. The breakdown of the joint family has contributed in its own way to the lucrative nostalgia industry. But the drama enacted in courthouses is less entertaining, and the disintegration of the joint family is only one factor in its history. Mothers-in-law can be victims too, seems to be the moral of a few recent judgments of the Calcutta high court. West Bengal had grown used to in-laws and husbands in the dock, since Section 498(A) was promulgated to check the dizzying rise in dowry deaths. Cases of torture in the marital home were heard regularly. The wife or daughter-in-law was the victim, the power equation was loaded against her. 																														Recently the real-life saas-bahu drama has received a new twist. According to a few judgments, the daughter-in-law may have to leave if her husbands mother does not like her. Then again, the parents can decide whether or not they want their married sons family to live with them. Most recently, the high court has rebuked a daughter-in-law for torturing her 81-year-old mother-in-law because the latter has refused to divide the house they share so that the younger woman can have an independent portion. The court has also refused anticipatory bail for another woman whose mother-in-law has filed a case of torture against her. All laws can be misused; these judgments could be perceived as redressing the imbalance that may have been caused by Section 498(A).																														Only it is not a matter of a simple see-saw in perception. The joint family was based on necessities dictated by economics and principles of inheritance of land-based property in a patriarchal system. Today the married son or his wife can be asked to leave only if the parents are financially independent. In the reverse situation, the neglect of old parents by the children can on occasion be as cruel as the mental or physical torture of a woman in her marital home. While the law can punish violence and define rights, it can hardly prescribe tolerance thresholds or regulate notions of human decency and mutual respect. That the intimate domestic drama of mothers- and daughters-in-law should be played out in court is an indication of a breakdown of value systems in a rapidly changing society. It is expecting the court to play the role of an avuncular family ombudsman. The situation raises other questions. How far can law regulate the dynamics within a family and its relationships? And is fear of the law really the best way to a harmonious existence? Interpersonal power equations have social, cultural, economic and individual dimensions that cannot be contained within the purely legal. The unending saas-bahu epic may provide instances of tragedy, cruelty and crime in real life, as well as episodes of black villainy and sentimental sacrifice on the small screen. But it is also a testing-ground for the troubled opposition between the private and the public, the personal and the institutional.

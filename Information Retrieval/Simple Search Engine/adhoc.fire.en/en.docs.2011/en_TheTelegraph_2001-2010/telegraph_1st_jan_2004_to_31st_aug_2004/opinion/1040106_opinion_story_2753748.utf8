The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 							 																						SWEET NOTHINGS																								Populism is the password to elections in India. All governments gearing up for elections announce policy packages and decisions that are thinly-veiled attempts to buy votes. No government has been free from this vice so it may seem a trifle unfair to point an accusing finger at the government of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. There is, however, good reason to this with regard to the decision to raise the price of cane to Rs 73 a quintal. This decision did not have the full approval of the mandarins in the finance ministry. Neither was it backed by recommendations of the food ministry. Despite objections from the concerned ministry, the decision was taken by the prime minister himself. This only confirms the suspicion that the decision was taken with an eye on the forthcoming elections. Raising the price of cane is a blatant attempt to win over the cane growers even though the sugar industry is not in a position to pay a higher price. Cane prices have gone through two upward revisions already. These were rationalized on the ground that the farmers needed to be compensated for the drought. This argument no longer holds. Mr Vajpayees decision thus cannot be explained except by populism, the birthsign of Indian electioneering.																								No economic logic quite supports the price hike given the condition of the sugar industry. Sugar prices have remained low over two years because of over production. The current cane price arrears amount to Rs 4,000 crore and the sugar industry is unable to meet the arrears because the market has not been all that good. The governments decision will ruin the industry but its benefit to the farmers is also doubtful. Sugar units will shut down, some will refuse to pay and take recourse to legal action and cane arrears will mount. It would have been more advisable for the government to withdraw from intervening and allow cane and sugar prices to be determined by the forces of demand and supply. This would also prevent the erection of an artificial barrier between the sugar industry and cane producers. Such forces are not allowed to operate because politics continues to lead the economy despite a decade of liberalization. Since the economic reforms were initiated by Mr Manmohan Singh in 1992 no government has done more than the present one to further the pace and the ambit of economic reforms. But even Mr Vajpayee flounders when a general election is breathing down his neck. One suspects, that there is an attitude at work here and unless that changes, economic reforms will continue to remain half-baked and hangdog.

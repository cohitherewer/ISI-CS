The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, July 31, 2004  Out and About
Those breathless in love can expect Air Supply to come to their aid soon. The veteran Australian soft rockers, who have, for sometime now, been teaching one and all to make love out of nothing, have decided to hold classes in India as well. Come November, Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock promise to exhibit their power of love through live concerts to be staged in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore as part of their For Lovers Only 2004 tour around the world. Non-lovers stay away.  Shweta Nanda				 																																	If your parents are celebrities, and you arent, what do you do? Simple. Write about them and have fame chase you around. Shweta Nanda nee Bachchan is a case in point. Nanda is writing mom Jaya Bachchans biography-of-sorts. The book is expected to be out by the end of this year. And guess where Nanda was seen last? At the Delhi launch of Rahul Singhs book on his father called In the Name of the Father. Sarod maestro Amjad Ali Khans son Ayaan Ali Bangash was also present. Need we tell you that his brother Amaan has written a book on their clan for Roli Books Family Pride Series and so has Anoushka Shankar, on her father. See the connection? Keya Banerjee				 																																	Acting isnt her Lakshya, dabbling in visual effects is. Thats 27-year-old Keya Banerjee, actor Victor Banerjees daughter, for you. Following Lakshya, this St Xaviers College alumni who studied visual effects in the US is all set to work on another feature film in November. It is a challenging project with a new realm of reality-based special effects, she gushes. Sounds effective.

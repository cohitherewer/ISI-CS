		 Friday, June 04, 2004 							 																						DESPERATE GAMBLE																														Difficult situations often call for desperate gambles. That probably explains why Nepals King Gyanendra has chosen Mr Sher Bahadur Deuba as the next prime minister. The monarchs move is bound to generate much confusion because the countrys present political turmoil began with the former dismissing Mr Deuba two years ago. There could be two possible arguments in favour of the kings choice. First, the major political parties declined the kings offer to name a unanimous choice for the prime ministers post. The palace, therefore, had to make its own choice. Second, Mr Deuba could be more acceptable to the parties than his immediate predecessors  Mr Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Mr Surya Bahadur Thapa  both of whom were viewed by them to be too royalist. Whatever the kings justification, the appointment of the new prime minister should be seen as a positive signal for ending Nepals political and constitutional crisis. It may not immediately restore the trust between the king and his people, which was breached when Mr Deuba was dismissed and parliament dissolved. But it can at least mark a new beginning.																														It is now upto Mr Deuba to win the trust of the two main parties  the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist). He will need their support to form a cabinet that can restore some semblance of governance. But more important, he will have to take the parties along with him to restore the democratic political process. Only if he can achieve that can he hope to take the country through the much-delayed parliamentary polls. But another round of narrow, partisan games would be suicidal for Nepal. The prime minister and the parties need to join hands to fight the bigger threat posed by the Maoist rebels. The spectre of Maoism has haunted Nepal for far too long and threatens to destroy its hard-won democracy. It is time politicians in Nepal realized that the failure of the multi-party system and of elected governments helped the Maoists destructive cause. Whether Mr Deuba succeeds in bringing the Maoists back to the negotiating table will depend on his ability to evolve a political consensus on the issue. Mr Deuba faces a truly Himalayan challenge. How he tackles it will be crucial for both peace and democracy in the country.

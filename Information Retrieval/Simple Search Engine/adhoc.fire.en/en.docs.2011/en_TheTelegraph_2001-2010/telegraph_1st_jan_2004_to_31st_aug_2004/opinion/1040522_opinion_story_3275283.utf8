The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, May 22, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																A family business				 																																																				Sir  Whatever Bill Clinton did, George W. Bush does better (discounting Monica Lewinsky of course). Which is probably why not only Laura Bush, but his two daughters are also being inducted into the family campaign (Bush daughters to work for fathers campaign, May 20). But while Clinton was blessed with a well-qualified and innately intelligent wife and a daughter who thought it more worthwhile to pursue her own concerns, Bush has been less lucky. Laura was almost coaxed to work for women and children and the daughters have brought Bush much ill-repute. Its just that some people have all the bad luck.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,M. Chatterjee, Calcuta
				 																Faulty reading				 																																																				Sir  Anup Sinha in his A verdict from below (May 20) tries to justify the mandate of the people by ignoring the practical experience of the country under the socialist order. His argument is to lead India back to a welfare state, which would imply that people will henceforth look up to the government to solve their problems. It has been proven in the past that when this dangerous trend takes hold, the governments ability to do so gets reduced more and more. The government is after all made of people and soon there is nobody to take care of anybody.				 																																																				Further the crux of a market-friendly economic strategy is that the government has no business to be in business. By this principle, the government should look after civil governance such as law and order, where there is need for its intervention. Healthcare, education, transport and such other public services fall under the grey area of government and business. Even in these, the way the distribution of welfare is undertaken needs to be given a thought. It has been proved that providing direct assistance on merit to those who need it is better than giving it to organizations who provide these services. Manmohan Singh needs to lead the people rather than follow them and subsequently fall into the trap of implementing the symbols of welfare state such as keeping public sector units and increasing interest rates without sufficient economic justification.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anand Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Like most leftist political thinkers, Anup Sinha blames the economic policies and the so called religious fascism of the Bharatiya Janata Party for the poll debacle and calls it a verdict from below. But he fails to clarify why the electorate gave a fractured mandate. The National Democratic Alliance government could boast of one of the most learned cabinet and it tried its best to instil a sense of self-esteem in the common man by virtually ending Indias dependence on foreign loans and doles. Yet, the electorate snubbed it the wrong way because the NDA had misread the man on the street. The average Indian, whether a villager or a townsman, is barely literate. His patriotism ends in his loyalty to his village, tribe or caste. So the long-term policies of the government which aim to make the country strong and prosperous do not impress him unless it brings him immediate gains. Which is why the NDAs bid to woo voters on its development and stability planks was rejected in the villages and met with lukewarm response in urban areas.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

				 																																																				Sir  It is perhaps right to conclude that the economic reforms of the previous dispensation lacked a human face. But isnt it a bit too optimistic to think that the any government can devise a policy that will look after the concerns of the bottom 80 per cent, especially if this percentage is divided not by economic factors alone?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Mahanta, Calcutta

				 																Slice of the cake				 																																																				Sir  The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has been a part of almost every cabinet constituted by coalition governments in the past (Jaya softens, DMK rushes to Delhi, May 20). This indicates its survival instincts. Even this time, K. Karunanidhi did not ask for Cauvery waters as price for his support, but for the tightening of the noose around J. Jayalalithaa. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Subramanyan, Mumbai

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Decoding behaviour				 																																																				Sir  Just a few days back the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had emphasized on the need to consensually evolve a code of conduct for all political parties so as to uphold the values enshrined in our Constitution. The time to do so couldnt be more right, if the incidents leading to and following the adjournment of parliament are anything to go by (Govt, BJP in blame game, Aug 28). Singh, if he is serious, can take a cue from the left which has organized a workshop for its parliamentarians to improve their public relations. Such workshops can be extended to all parties. In fact, they should be made mandatory considering how expensive rowdy members of parliament are proving to be for the exchequer. Hoping for a constructive opposition is like wishing for the moon. Even then, peoples representatives have to be made more accountable for their rash actions.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Chaitali Chakraborty, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is extremely unlikely that a gentleman like Manmohan Singh would be rude to any person (Rivals see Singhs unseen face, Aug 26). Whatever George Fernandes has told the press is obviously an exaggerated version of what really happened. Before making such allegations, Fernandes should have remembered that Singh is not merely his political rival, but the prime minister of the nation. But then, personal attacks and disrespect for high office have become second nature to the National Democratic Alliance. One only needs to bring to mind the comments of the illustrious Narendra Modi. 				 																																																				It is time the NDA realized that the blows it intends to deliver will only boomerang on it. The opposition is not only reducing Indian politics to mudslinging and bickering, but is also losing the respect that some of its able leaders had earned from the people during its regime. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur 

				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayee has the impression that his successor has adopted a confrontational position, and says that the role of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led opposition has been consistently constructive (BJP springs Atal on Singh, Aug 27). Presumably, he is referring to the many hours of relaxation which have been made possible by the oppositions walk-outs and the entertainment it provides while disrupting the procedures of parliament. 				 																																																				Manmohan Singh did not accept the memorandum offered to him by the NDA delegation because the latter had not allowed a proper discussion on the general budget. Vajpayee, along with the opposition, must face facts if he is to keep to the constructive path and help the nation move ahead. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Mukul Dube, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  It is obvious that the BJP is yet to reconcile itself to the loss of power. Like a spoilt child, it is now out to sabotage the political game as and when it does not get its way. The country can well do without the petulance of these bad losers who are bent on creating trouble to keep themselves in the public eye, rather than doing something about the problems posed by the spiralling inflation. It appears, from the way it continues to focus on trivialities, that the BJP has not yet realized that the public has seen through its pseudo-nationalism. Which is why it is still taking things for granted. The United Progressive Alliance government should take the opportunity to get some serious business done every time the opposition chooses to absent itself from parliament. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  This is in reference to, PM voices Parliament worry (Aug 27). The prime minister is advised to do some introspection himself before lecturing others on the need to look inside. The Congress constantly disrupted the proceedings of parliament when the NDA was in power. Witness its boycott of George Fernandes. Party members walked out each time he rose to speak. Wasnt this unbecoming of parliamentarians? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Shankar Srinivasan, UK

				 																																																				Sir  Manmohan Singh deserves kudos for the way he dealt with the oppositions note of dissent to the budget. As democratically elected members, our legislators have a moral duty to articulate the concerns of the people they represent. However, in this case, they behaved like cowards. Instead of focussing more positively on issues of national importance, they are holding the country to ransom with their impetuosity.				 																																																				The budget deserves more time and the attention of the house, and the opposition has to think prudently before going forward with its threat of boycott. A protest is all very well, but disregard for the functioning of a democratic set-up is uncalled for. The prime minister should stick to his stand and be firm and fair. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
S. Deenadayalan, Secunderabad

				 																																																				Sir  It is disturbing to see our elected representatives bringing disgrace to parliamentary democracy by their antics. For some time now, parliaments functioning has been interrupted all too frequently. Parliament House may be standing tall but it has been shattered from within. Our politicians do not look beyond power equations. They have no time or concern for the problems of the people who send them to the legislature to provide good governance, be it as the government in power or from within the opposition. Is a parliamentary system of government then unsuitable for the country? There should be a serious debate on the kind of government most appropriate for India as no concrete change can be expected from a parliament which decides to be unanimous only on issues like a raise in wages and allowances for ministers and parliamentarians. 				 																																																				There should be stringent criteria set for candidates contesting the elections  these may include police verification to find out if the contestant has a criminal past, an upper age bar and disclosure of the sources of income of all candidates. Candidates should have an independent source of income since politics is a means for serving people, not a way to amass wealth.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

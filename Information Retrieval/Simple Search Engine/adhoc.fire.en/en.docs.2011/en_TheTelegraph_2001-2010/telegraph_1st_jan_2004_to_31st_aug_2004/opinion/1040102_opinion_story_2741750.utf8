																								Saving a coalition is not the same thing as making it work. Jharkhands chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, may have managed to prevent his National Democratic Alliance government from disintegrating, but even he knows that it is not working. Mr Mundas challenge comes, not from the opposition parties like the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha or the Congress, but from the coalition partners themselves. Mutual accusations of non-cooperation and inefficiency between the Bharatiya Janata Party and its partners have become part of Ranchis political routine for quite some time. The charges made by the states BJP leader and industries minister, Mr Ravindra Kumar Rai, against the Janata Dal (United) are the latest in that sordid saga. Adding to the confusion is the atmosphere of mutual mistrust between ministers and bureaucrats. It is easy to gauge the impact of all this on the administration and on the morale of the bureaucracy. It remains primarily Mr Mundas failure to hold the squabbling partners in check and put his house in order. 																								The BJPs central leadership too must take its share of the blame. Its dilemma goes back to the time when the former chief minister, Mr Babulal Marandi, had to step down in the face of a revolt against his leadership. But in its anxiety to save the coalition, the partys national leaders seem to have ignored the complete lack of discipline in the partys state unit and of cohesion in the coalition. The confusion in the NDA ranks in Jharkhand has now been compounded by the BJP leadership wooing the JMM leader, Mr Shibu Soren, as a potential ally in the next Lok Sabha elections. The effect of this new strategy cannot but be unsettling for Mr Munda, who would obviously feel threatened by his partys overtures to Mr Soren. For the saffron strategists in New Delhi, the aim clearly is to try and wean Mr Soren away from the Congress before the polls. But this new development may also pit the BJPs national leaders against their compatriots in Ranchi. It seems safe to assume, however, that the politics of opportunistic alliances will further cripple governance in Jharkhand.

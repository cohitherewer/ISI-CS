The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 							 																						A LESSON FROM HISTORY Shobita Punja																					The election results are awaited and may the best people win, may the winners take their new roles with humility and losers live on gracefully, and may everyone realize that some good lies in everyone.																					Its a prayer, but its also an introduction to a story about the importance of museums, about the value of their collections. We have over 700 museums in India, and each one boasts of the uniqueness of its collection. Each object tells a story  we only need people who can hear their story and grasp the vital role that museums can play in our everyday polity. The significance of one object in the collection of the Bharat Kala Bhavan in Varanasi is the centre of this story.																					Bharat Kala Bhavan is one of Indias finest and this world-famous museum is located in the throbbing, vibrant city of Varanasi within the Banaras Hindu University campus. The sprawling campus has shady avenues and huge faculty buildings. The museum originated from the private collection of a single visionary individual  Rai Krishnadasa. When the museum was transferred to the university in 1950, just after independence, several other donors continued to enrich the museums collection. Unfortunately, no Indian government has ever clearly understood the role of museums in the education of its citizens.																					The museum has an outstanding collection of sculptures of the Mauryan, Sunga Kushan and Gupta periods. The painting collection of the museum is spectacular with Buddhist manuscripts, and exquisite Mughal paintings from early Akbar period, works like the Hamzanama and also delicate miniatures from the Pahari school.																					If one were to vote, one of the most maligned characters of Indian history would definitely be Aurangzeb, the third son of Shah Jahan. The creator of the beautiful Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan, did what no father should ever do to his sons and that is to publicly favour one son and belittle another. We are told that Shah Jahan so loved his son Dara Shikoh that he openly criticized his son Aurangzeb. Anger, jealousy and court politics ensured that Aurangzeb took revenge on his father and imprisoned him and killed his rival brother. 																					Aurangzeb also inherited from his lavish father a bankrupt empire, from which large sums of money had been spent on an extravagant lifestyle and building works. Aurangzeb, in reaction, and trying to be a responsible ruler, professed a simple, austere, lifestyle and tried to do so by example. Yet Aurangzeb is always depicted in history as an intolerant, insensitive man.																					Win to create																					But one of the most important objects in the collection of the Bharat Kala Bhavan is a farman or royal decree of Aurangzebs inelegant calligraphy, signed and sealed with his insignia. The farman proclaims that in accordance with the Holy Law, we decided that the ancient temples of Varanasi shall not be overthrown but that new ones shall not be built.																					No person will disturb Brahmins and other Hindu residents in those places so that they remain in their occupation and continue with peace of mind to offer prayer. For the continuance of our god-given empire that is destined to last for all timeyou are instructed to follow this decree immediately.																					Would it be possible to hope that politicians will change? That they will decide to leave residents of India to continue to live with peace of mind? To hope that India will be a place where ancient historic buildings can live in peace in their surroundings, that they will not be stormed by the army, or reduced to rubble in anger or out of political rivalry? Would it be possible to stop building new places of worship till we have learnt to care for the ancient ones that make every nook and corner of India a sacred land?																					Let us hope that whoever wins this election will value human life and the creative spirit that constructs significant buildings, and crafts objects of art. Museums showcase astounding samples of human creativity, which reflect how the human mind can refine and improve itself. Museums can educate.

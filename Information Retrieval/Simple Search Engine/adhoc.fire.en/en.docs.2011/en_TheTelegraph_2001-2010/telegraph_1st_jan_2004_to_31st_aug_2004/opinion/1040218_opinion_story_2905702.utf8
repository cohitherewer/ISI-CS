		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 							 																						THE SCENARIO IN INDIA 															- Document Excerpts from Abortion in India: overview and synthesis of emerging issues from the qualitative studies by CEHAT, Mumbai, and Health Watch, Delhi				 	 Sensitive issues																														Abortion remains a sensitive issue in most countries of the world, and has only recently received international attention as a public health issue. India pioneered in legalizing induced abortion under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971. Abortion can be legally availed if a pregnancy carries the risk of grave physical injury to a woman, if it endangers her mental health or when pregnancy results from a contraceptive failure in a married woman or from rape or is likely to result in the birth of a child with physical or mental abnormalities. Abortion is permitted up to 20 weeks of pregnancy duration and no spousal consent is required. The act and the subsequently defined MTP rules of 1975 also clearly specify who can legally perform the abortion and the kind of facilities in which it can be performed (government of India, 1971; GoI 1975).																														Information on the number of abortions performed every year in the country is difficult to compile because a large proportion of abortions are performed either by practitioners who are not registered or in settings that are not registered or both. According to the ministry of health and family welfare, in 1996-97 about 4.6 lakh MTPs were performed in the country... Against that, an estimated 6.7 million abortions per year are performed in other than registered and government recognised institutions, often by untrained persons in unhygienic conditions (Khan et al 1998).																														After the initial attention on unsafe abortion in the Sixties and early Seventies that was the driving force behind legalization, public discussion in India on abortion related morbidity and mortality has been practically absent and despite an intensive national campaign for safe motherhood, the issue of abortion has not captured public attention. 																														Although the review of literature done during the preparatory planning phase of Abortion Assessment Project  India in 1998 indicated that morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion remains a serious problem for Indian women 28 years after abortion was legalised in India (Johnston, 1999), data on abortion related morbidity have been scant and there are some indications that mortality due to abortion procedure has decreased over time. In the last decade, womens health advocates have tried to draw the attention of policy makers and administrators to a range of issues related to abortion in order to improve the availability, safety and use of services. From the perspective of both the providers and clients some of the concerns that have been raised in recent years are: 																														Abortion is perceived as an extension of the governments population stabilization programme; safe abortion facilities are out of reach for the majority of women in rural areas and also for poor women in urban areas; there is a dearth of medically approved abortion providers and registered facilities; post-abortion family planning counselling and services are woefully inadequate; abortion is not perceived as a womens health issue among policy makers and service providers; abortion is often used as another method of family planning; and there is a growing trend in many regions of India towards sex selective abortion.																														For almost forty years, despite officially advocating the cafeteria approach, the main thrust of Indias family planning programme was on sterilization (male sterilization until 1977 and female sterilization since 1978). As a result, the contraceptive needs of those who are not ready for a permanent method of contraception and of unmarried couples have received very little attention.  TO BE CONCLUDED

		 Monday, May 31, 2004 							 																						PRECARIOUSLY PERCHEDTWENTY-TWENTY / BHARAT BHUSHAN Powers withinStability of a government does not only mean survival. Yet governments, especially coalition governments, need to survive before they can stabilize.																														There are many potential sources of instability for the Manmohan Singh government. It is their interplay that would determine its longevity and impact its performance.																														The coalition partners of the Congress in the United Progressive Alliance can be a source of stability to the extent that none of them wants an early election. They are aware that breaking the coalition could pave the way for the Bharatiya Janata Partys return with increased strength.																														Yet, these very coalition partners could become a source of instability for the government. Manmohan Singh has already been forced to make a doctrinal shift about the role of the prime minister regarding the formation of the cabinet. In defending the clamour of his alliance partners for the portfolios of their choice, he is reported to have claimed that ministerial quotas had been allotted along with a set of portfolios to the alliance partners for distribution among their nominees.																														Someone other than the prime minister had signed the letter of agreement displayed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader, M. Karunanidhi. Allotting portfolios to potential ministers would normally be unthinkable in the cabinet system of government. But things could get perceptibly worse. If Karunanidhi on a whim wants to swap the portfolios of some of his ministers or nominate someone else for the portfolios they hold, can the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, deny him that right? He has clearly given up the prime ministers right to assign portfolios to his ministers.																														In effect, there are a number of mini-prime ministers in this government, each with his own cabinet. In the extreme, the Rashtriya Janata Dal ministers would take orders from Laloo Prasad Yadav, the DMK ministers from Karunanidhi, the Pattali Makkal Katchi ministers from S. Ramadoss and those from the Nationalist Congress Party, from Sharad Pawar.																														These alliance partners know that individually their importance to the stability of the government is limited. However, if they were to unionize, it would be a different story. If Laloo Yadav defends the DMKs tantrums, might not Karunanidhi then come to the rescue of RJDs tainted ministers? Was Laloo Yadav not trying to use the combined bargaining power of the allies for seeking the home portfolio for himself when he flew in from Patna and went straight to Sharad Pawars residence? That Pawar did not play the game is a different matter.																														The alliance partners of the United Front government of H.D. Deve Gowda had tried to unionize, forming the Federal Front. Although the Federal Front never really took off, an informal union of the non-Congress UPA allies can work in concert to keep the Congress and the prime minister in a perpetually weakened state.																														Instability may also arise from within because of the unbridled and unrealized ambitions of ageing Congress ministers. What business did Arjun Singh have, for example, in making the extension of the multi-disciplinary task force inquiring into the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case an issue, showing a red rag to the DMK within the first few days of Manmohan Singh assuming office? Equally, did Pranab Mukherjee do right by his party when media reported his private conversation that he had appointed Manmohan Singh as the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, suggesting that he was the senior leader? This is when Mukherjee had served under Manmohan Singh as the leader of the house in the Rajya Sabha. The Congresss stalwarts are so petty-minded that they will not give the nation even two whole days to get disillusioned.																														The sycophancy of Congress ministers also makes them promote Sonia Gandhi in a way that undermines the powers of the executive. Already, the external affairs minister has suggested that Sonia Gandhi would be visiting Pakistan. But should Natwar Singh and Manmohan Singh be visiting Pakistan first or Sonia Gandhi? Why announce her intention to visit Islamabad before announcing your own visit or setting your governments Pakistan policy on course? If Islamabad makes full use of these divisions to destabilize New Delhis policy initiatives, then the Congress has itself to blame.																														Another source of instability for the government could be the populist measures announced. They cannot be sustained for long. Is it easy to provide 100 days of employment at minimum wages for one able-bodied person in every rural and urban poor household? Can the Central government ensure that the state governments clear the dues of all farmers including sugarcane farmers? Can it provide irrigation of all lands owned by Dalits and implement land ceiling and redistribution laws to the benefit of the landless? Can it keep industry happy while reducing the job market flexibility?																														The demands on any democratic government are often contradictory in nature. Governance is judged by how well these contradictions are managed. If the expectations of the farmers, trade unions, the rural and the urban poor are not met, then this itself would become a source of instability.																														The BJP would also continue to be a threat. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has many front organizations. Its front organizations, like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, in turn have their own front organizations  like the organization of religious story-tellers and temple priests. They can be used very effectively to spread disinformation since their decentralized functioning allows them to operate in a surreptitious manner. The sangh parivars many unused weapons could be deployed to create social tension.																														The inability of the government to handle the Gujarat issue could also become a major problem for it. It has to be seen to act demonstrably against those guilty of communal violence in Gujarat including those responsible for the Godhra tragedy. Inaction on the Gujarat issue would lead to the Indian Muslim becoming inward looking. This could feed into Islamic militancy and fundamentalism.																														The failure to engage Pakistan meaningfully into a peace process and its consequences for the levels of violence in Kashmir and elsewhere in India is yet another issue that could threaten the functioning of the Manmohan Singh government. The attacks on the Red Fort, parliament and the Kashmir legislative assembly did not happen because L.K. Advani was the home minister. They happened because of lack of forward political movement both within Kashmir and with Pakistan.																														Lastly, extremist violence  especially Maoist violence cutting across the heart of India from the Nepal border to Maharashtra through Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa, Chhattisgarh  will prove to be a source of instability. Given the synergy between the Indian Maoists and their Nepalese counterparts, Indias Nepal policy would play a crucial role in this regard. Indias continuing support for King Gyanendra  who is moving towards executive monarchy by keeping the democratic forces divided  is going to compound the Maoist problem both in Nepal and in India. Maoist influence in Nepals terai is growing, Jharkhand is virtually ungovernable outside Ranchi and Nepali Maoists are recruiting among Indians of Nepalese origin in Sikkim and north Bengal. These are dangerous portends. The challenge would be to deal with extremist violence firmly while at the same time addressing the socio-political issues it raises.

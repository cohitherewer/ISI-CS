		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 							 																						NOT EASY TO FIND AND KEEP Shobita Punja																					Every once in a while the story of the Elgin Marbles comes back into the news. These exquisite sculptures were taken from the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, to England and housed in the British Museum 200 years ago. They are called the Elgin Marbles because it was Lord Elgin, the British ambassador at that time, who was responsible for taking them to England where they now stand in an exclusive gallery, the pride of the British Museum, where thousands of visitors can admire and study them. 																					The pro-return-of-the-marbles group, called Marbles united, want the marbles back in Greece where they originated. They argue that these marbles are the pride of Greece, national treasures, and must be returned to their country of origin. Others say that Athens is a very polluted city and it is best that these precious sculptures remain in the British Museum where they are well looked after. These sculptures represent world heritage  something for everyone to enjoy.																					We have an important collection in the British Museum  the Amaravati collection. Back in 1797, Colonel Colin Mackenzie discovered the ruins of a stupa built between the 2nd century BC and the 2nd century AD, at Amaravati in what is now Andhra Pradesh. On his second visit in 1816, Mackenzie found the stupa completely destroyed, as the local landlord had been using the beautiful sculptures as building material and burning the sculptured limestone to produce lime. Whatever Mackenzie was able to salvage from the scene of devastation was taken to the British Museum. Here these magnificent sculptures are housed in a very modern glass unit in the South Asian Gallery. A generous donor  not an Indian  has made this new renovation possible. 																					The British Museum has, in recent years, lent the National Museum in New Delhi a few exemplary pieces of sculptures from its collection so that visitors to the Indian capital can also get a glimpse of this outstanding artistic culture of Amaravati.																					Return to sender?																					Some of the remaining pieces of sculpture were sent to the Indian Museum, Calcutta, and the largest collection is in India at the State Museum in Chennai. The State Museum does not seem to realize that these gorgeous pieces are the finest collection of south Indian art of this early period and have cemented them onto the wall and base. Very often, when over zealous white-washing of the State Museum takes place, the delicate sculptures of the Buddha are smattered with lime wash. Andhra Pradesh wants them back. The British Museum and many other agencies have offered to help make the Amaravati Gallery in Chennai a world-class show case but the pleas have fallen on deaf ears  we may as well be burned for lime.																					We have another famous case of the Bharut sculptures in the Indian Museum in Calcutta. In 1873, General Alexander Cunningham discovered the ruins of the Bharut Stupa constructed around the 2nd century BC. The sacred mound of the Buddhist stupa was surrounded by a huge stone railing and gateways intricately carved with subtle and humorous sculptures over 2000 years old. 																					Cunningham found the stupa in ruins and pieces of sculpture lying around in a state of disarray. He decided to transport the sculptures to Calcutta and install them in the Indian Museum, Indias oldest museum. Professor Childers in England heard of Cunninghams plan and was secretly keen to see the sculptures in England  he wrote, I hear of a proposal to remove them from Bharut. The scheme carries with it a certain aroma of vandalism (fancy carting away Stonehenge). 																					Cunningham persisted, for he felt he was saving the only surviving evidence of early Buddhist artistic heritage. The refurbished Bharut Gallery is one of the pleasures of visiting the Indian Museum in Calcutta today.																					The story of these sculptures may give you some idea of the complexity of the problem and will hopefully enable you to decide which camp you are in  Marbles Reunited or the group which says Art unites the world, as long as our artistic heritage is well looked after let it grace any space in the world.

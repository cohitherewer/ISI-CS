		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 							 																						A FESTIVAL FOR THE PEOPLE Perhaps it is the egalitarian ethic of the voting process or perhaps it is a sense of ritual that brings rural Bengal out to vote in droves, writes Mukulika Banerjee 				 	 Modern deities																														For a country where mundane matters often go awry, rituals are performed with rare punctuality and precision in India. Despite their unprecedented mega-scale, the Kumbh mela, the haj and the general elections each seem to bring out the best in the civil and military machinery. One only needs to recall the rows of neatly laid out tents at Kumbha Nagar awaiting the pilgrims, the thoughtful establishment of separate haj terminals at Indian airports or the punctual press releases of the Election Commission detailing all manner of poll-related information well in advance of the elections themselves, to appreciate this fact. 																														Each of these events comes round periodically according to its own calendar and internal logic, bringing together vast numbers of otherwise unconnected people in participation and faith. Information about the where and when is miraculously diffused among millions who never read newspapers or listen to the radio, with almanacs, delivery boys and itinerant peddlers all playing their part. 																														We tend to take all this for granted. Press reports during elections largely focus on the coalition moves of political parties or on the contents of leaders speeches. But in this article, I intend to convey a sense of how an election is perceived in one part of rural India. In order to understand popular perceptions of democracy, I have conducted research in two villages of West Bengal for the past five years. Here, the illiteracy rates and voter turn-out figures both stand at the staggeringly high figure of over 90 per cent. It is an ideal location therefore to ask the question we all should be asking: what do elections mean to these largely illiterate village folk?																														In the village there was an air of suppressed excitement on election day, with everyone up earlier than usual and bustling around urgently. Chores were stripped down to the bare necessities of fetching water and milking cattle, with all attention centred around the mile-long journey to the polling booth. So, when are you planning to go for the vote? was the constant question. The men preferred to go in the early morning cool to be present when the doors opened, the women necessarily later after the children and cooking pots had been seen to.																														Concerned about looking respectable to the officials at the booth, men swapped their usual lungis and dhotis for trousers, while women put on jewellery and sindoor and took out their handloom saris. I was chided for not having put on something new. The children were bemused, since unlike in the case of other festivals when they were the centre of attention, today they were largely ignored by their preoccupied elders. However, they soon realized that this meant a whole day of no school and unsupervised fun and games.																														People travelled to the booth in groups of three or four, partly for moral support but also to help pass the time while trying to hitch a ride from passing trucks or queuing in the sun to vote. The polling station was the little school building which, adorned by bunting and banners, could be mistaken from a distance for a shrine or country fair. Outside it were rows of chairs for the various parties agents who formed a seated guard-of-honour for any approaching voter, and were almost intimidating in their eagerness to check names from their lists. The officials were keen to ensure that the day remained trouble free, and armed guards stood around, half-languid, half-alert.																														The voting itself was efficient and the queues moved quickly, facilitated by the new electronic voting machines. For weeks before, there had been endless discussions during quilt-making, fan-weaving and tea-drinking about the magical new contraption. 																														The local communist party agent had helpfully brought round to his supporters the curious black box, with its buttons that lit up like the eyes of a dark deity, in order to explain and reassure, and ensure their presence. This demonstration was followed by lots of speculation about the  computar, including guestimates of how many votes it could register per minute.																														The households which had not been shown it worried that it was because the machine had already somehow ascertained that they might not vote for the communist party, and so attributed to it mind-reading powers. Those who had had the privilege of darshan reported that it gave you an electric shock if you voted for a non-communist candidate, or that there was a hidden cable which allowed officials to monitor which button lit up and so blew the secrecy of the ballot. 																														There was talk of special ointments circulating that could remove the black ink mark from the index finger and allow the same person to vote again and again. Some regretted losing the satisfaction of folding ones ballot paper and stuffing it in a sealed box, but others were relieved that they no longer risked humiliation in front of the officials as a result of their awkwardness with a pencil.																														After the voting, the rest of the day passed in the easy and relaxed conviviality of a holiday, in comparing notes with others, checking who had gone at what time and generally letting everyone know that they had indeed been to cast their vote. Talking about their experiences that day, they explained their enjoyment of the egalitarian ethic of the process, with everyone  regardless of caste and class  having to stand cheek by jowl and wait to take their turn. People also liked the fact that unlike religious rituals, which can go ahead so long as the officiating imam or priest is present, there would be no election without their own participation. Thus it was a festival for the people, not for Allah. 																														Thus, it was as unthinkable not to vote as it would be to leave ripe paddy unharvested or not to fast during Ramadan or to be gloomy during puja. In short, there is a profound element of simple faith which is a characteristic of ritual but which, in the context of the Indian elections, strikes me as something rather wonderful. If democracy is modernitys gift to India, then the sacralization of its elections is Indias gift to democracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, August 07, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Playing with numbers				 																																																				Sir  If Sumit Mitra is to be believed, Asim Dasgupta, West Bengals finance minister, may not kick up a fuss if his pet project, the state-level value added tax, gets overshadowed by a centralized VAT (Home in on the trouble spot, Aug 4). So what if the latter requires tax collection to be split between the Centre and the states in a fixed ratio? Knowing how good Dasgupta is with numbers and their manipulation, it may be assumed that Bengal will manage to bag a decent slice of the national pie which will help Dasgupta to tide over the financial mess he has created. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Kaushik Ray, Calcutta
				 																Tale of horror				 																																																				Sir  The West Bengal police showed great awareness and efficiency in catching Hannah Fosters killer. The media too played an important role by covering the entire operation extensively (British catch in Bengal, July 16). The prompt action that was taken against the appeal of Fosters parents is truly commendable. Now even the courts are out to assure that the killer, Maninderpal Singh Kohli, is given strict punishment. But why dont the police and the media in India show the same degree of vigilance and efficiency when numerous Hannahs are molested and murdered every day? Why must similar crimes meet different fates? Is it because not every parent can offer rewards in lakhs, or because the foreign tag is missing? This only proves that even the police and the media, like everyone else, work to get publicity. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Renu Sirothiya, Indore

				 																																																				Sir  Maninderpal Singh Kohli has confessed, in the presence of the media and the police, that he abducted, raped and killed the 17-year old Hannah Foster. Kohli may have been under the impression that his confession would fetch him some sympathy from the public, and his decision to confess was therefore a carefully calculated one. His conscience couldnt have been troubling him too much, or he would not have been on the run for so long. He deserves a death sentence like Dhananjoy Chatterjee. No matter how many time he confesses, he still remains a rapist and a heartless, cold-blooded murderer.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sneha Shaw, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Viewers of Maninderpal Kohlis interview on television should not get taken in by his display of remorse. He was merely trying to save his skin. What does it say of a person who deserts his wife and children in one country and dupes an innocent woman into marriage in another country? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Mandal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Kohlis wife in Kalimpong, Bharati Das, has been till recently wearing sindoor and mangalsutra. Blind faith in a stranger has cost her dear. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur 

				 																																																				Sir  The United Kingdom should reciprocate the Indian governments efforts in apprehending Hannah Fosters assaulter. Indias cooperation will also be needed for the extradition of the accused for trial in the UK. The accused in Gulshan Kumars murder, currently taking shelter in the UK, should be arrested and handed over to India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa 

				 																																																				Sir  It is horrifying to read about Hannah Fosters and Hetal Parekhs every day in the newspapers. I wish girls could grow up and chase their dreams without having to fear the evil designs of men. Kohlis arrest will not bring Hannah back to her parents, but at least the search and the trauma are over. Hannah did not deserve to die so young. Her parents have reportedly been haunted by thoughts of what their daughters killer was doing and where he might be. They wondered why he should get on with his life when Hannah no longer has one. 				 																																																				The dead have a habit of not staying dead. They live with us. I take some comfort from that. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Premendra Agrawal, Raipur

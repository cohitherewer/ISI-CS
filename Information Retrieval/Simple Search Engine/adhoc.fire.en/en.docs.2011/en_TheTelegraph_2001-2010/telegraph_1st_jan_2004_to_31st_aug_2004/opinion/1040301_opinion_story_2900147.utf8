		 Monday, March 01, 2004 							 																						TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE Debabrata Mohanty argues that Naveen Patnaiks rule brought about little development in Orissa, despite all its initial promise of change and progress  Leaving nothing to chanceOn Republic Day this year, the Orissa chief minister and Biju Janata Dal chief, Naveen Patnaik, was in a particularly benevolent mood. Soon after unfurling the tricolour at the Republic Day celebrations in Cuttack, Patnaik announced a reduction in sales tax on everything from mobile phones, raw silk and cooking gas, to educational instruments, sal leaf plates and match-boxes. In fact, his speech could well have been mistaken for a budget speech. But Patnaik, who also holds the finance portfolio, could not care less. He went on to announce a hike in the stipend given to children at government-run orphanages and residential schools, as well as old-age pensions for 50,000 more senior citizens.																														It is no coincidence that Patnaiks sops come at a time when elections to the state assembly and the Lok Sabha are less than three months away. Having failed to provide succour to the states electorate during his four-year rule, Patnaik is in a hurry to solve pending problems and to please all. Between Republic Day and February 6  the day the state assembly was dissolved and Patnaik became a caretaker chief minister  the Orissa sop opera ran non-stop. The night before the assembly was dissolved, the state cabinet hurriedly approved tax concessions of about Rs 6,666 crore for the proposed Rs 7,250 crore oil refinery at Paradip, as well as electrification of 5,000 more villages and stamp-duty exemption for self-help groups.																														The chief minister also tried to mollify state government employees. Having antagonized them over the past four years by downsizing the administration, he decided to release an additional 7 per cent dearness allowance for the employees. The burden to state exchequer: Rs 94 crore. Other beneficiaries included teachers of 1,429 private high schools and 153 private colleges, who will now get their salaries under the grant-in-aid scheme. Though his government had earlier decided against the grant-in-aid, a wave of protests by teachers forced him to approve it. The bill of this largesse, Rs 34 crore.																														Patnaik kicked off his campaign with a not-so-ingenuous public-relations exercise. Under the guise of attending official programmes, he used state government choppers to fly into three assembly constituencies everyday, to lay foundation stones. The opposition was quick to dub the exercise a political stunt aimed at fooling the people in an election year. 																														With the opposition led by the formidable J.B. Patnaik, newly-crowned chief of Orissa Congress, Naveen Patnaik is leaving nothing to chance. Though he termed the return of the Congress strongman to state politics as old wine in old bottle, he pitched for simultaneous elections to the state assembly and the Lok Sabha in the hope that the pro-Atal Bihari Vajpayee wave would see him through. On a single day, he laid the foundation stones for three medical colleges in the infamous Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region, though the proposals had been pending for quite some time. At a gathering of kendu and bidi workers in Angul district, he announced that 10 lakh chappals would be provided to kendu-leaf pluckers in the state at a cost of Rs 3 crore.																														When he took charge of Orissa four years ago, Patnaik had a massive mandate to carry out his promise of providing a corruption-free administration that would bring progress to this most impoverished state in the country. Despite the sniggers of critics and fellow politicians, Biju Patnaiks young son was seen as a refreshing change in the states politics. The regime of his predecessor, J.B. Patnaik, had been rejected at the hustings for its crony nepotism and corruption. Naveen Patnaik came with no such political baggage and therefore had nobody to fear or favour.																														The 57-year-old politician also had his priorities right when he took over as chief minister  reconstructing a cyclone-devastated state, developing the Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region and creating an investment-friendly atmosphere to attract investors. But he went astray with his over-dependence on the bureaucracy. His dependence on Pyari Mohan Mahapatra  a retired civil servant who was principal secretary to his father during his last stint as chief minister  for day-to-day political and administrative decisions, has considerably eroded his authority. The state capital is agog with stories of how PM (as Mahapatra is known) is the real CM of the state.																														But Patnaik did considerable damage to his credibility when, despite his insistence on transparency, he took on as ministers four persons with dubious reputations  Damodar Rout, Kalindi Behera, Suryo Patro and Prafulla Ghadei. While Behera and Patro have been accused of amassing assets disproportionate to their sources of income, Ghadei was an accused in the murder of a trade union leader. Rout, the panchayati raj minister, has been accused of sexual misdemeanours in the past. Although these ministers have been cleared by trial courts, the Orissa government did not appeal in the higher courts against the acquittals.																														Orissa, during Naveen Patnaiks rule, saw no significant development. While much of the Rs 900 crore the state received from the Centre for cyclone reconstruction remained unspent, there was little development in the Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region. Farmers in western Orissa were forced to sell their paddy at throwaway prices as a result of the unholy nexus of rice millers, politicians and Food Corporation of India officials, but the government did little to bring relief to the farmers. In the last four years, little investment flowed to the industrial sector in the state. Despite being a partner in the ruling National Democratic Alliance at the Centre, Patnaik has failed to capitalize on his personal equations with Vajpayee. In the last four years, Patnaiks government has been able to provide electricity to just 1,210 more villages.																														The only achievement Patnaik can boast of are the 9,000 pani panchayats (water user associations) under participatory irrigation management; getting Central approval for about 8 lakh Indira Awas Yojana houses for the states poor; and the enrolment of 11.65 lakh women into 87,203 self help groups under the Mission Shakti programme, which generate savings worth Rs 36.84 crore. Not too many are convinced about his drive against corrupt officials in the state because many more remain outside the vigilance net.																														The absence of a strong political will seems to have compounded the states woes. The state is hurtling towards a serious debt trap with a debt stock of more than Rs 32,000 crore. In Orissa, wages have long overtaken the governments revenues, and 90 per cent of the states plan outlay is financed from borrowing. No wonder, critics call Patnaik a wimp. Last year, Patnaik did make a feeble demand to declare Orissa a special category state. But it was too late and was drowned in political din.																														But despite his failures, Patnaik might just get a majority, thanks to his fathers popularity and his pre-poll alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. In election meetings, he still recalls Biju babus dreams of realizing a new Orissa. The ageing J.B. Patnaik may be no match for Naveen Patnaik who is yet to be sullied by scandals. But for someone who started his chief ministership with a bang, the sop opera sounds more like a last-minute whimper.

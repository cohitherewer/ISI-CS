The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 							 																						PAY UP OR LOSE OUT Neither the left nor the Trinamool Congress is willing to accept that taxes are inevitable to generate funds for rural development, writes Ashis Chakrabarti		 Utility into burden?As you enjoy an extended weekend, thanks to Mamata Banerjees Bangla bandh call, it is possible that you have no idea what it is all about. Not that you knew any better during other bandhs. This time, though, the issue may seem somewhat more remote or vague than on other occasions. The Left Front government, we are told, is so bankrupt that it has proposed to levy taxes on some animals villagers tend for a living. The bandh call is in protest against this new tax burden on the poorest of people. 																														The leftists disclaim they have any such plans. The government has even issued advertisements in newspapers to this effect. The bandh call, in the leftists opinion, is the Trinamool Congress leaders familiar ploy to get into the limelight on the eve of the coming Lok Sabha elections. 																														It is true that Banerjee has been down and out for a pretty long time, thanks to her own problems with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Even otherwise, she seemed to have lost much of her earlier appeal among the urban middle classes which had been her principal support base. She would definitely want the bandh to launch her back to street politics and into the election mode. 																														But the leftists too are hedging the issue mainly because of the coming elections. The fact is that the government is desperate to find new sources of revenue at all levels. West Bengal may not be the only state whose debt burden is assuming alarming proportions. Last year, the states debts amounted to Rs 66,000 crore. 																														No wonder that the government finds it increasingly difficult to allocate funds for rural development schemes. Even the Central funds for such schemes have dropped considerably over the past few years. Hence the urgency to create mechanisms by which all units of the government can generate their own revenue, be it state undertakings, municipalities or the panchayats. 																														No matter what the government or the Left Front says now to oppose Banerjees bandh call, there is no escaping the fact that the taxes are coming. If the panchayats are to function effectively as local self-government, like the civic corporations or municipalities, they have no option but to generate their own revenue. And that can come only from the people living within the panchayat area. 																														One can argue that poor, landless villagers earning a meagre living by tending cattle or other livestock cannot be expected to pay taxes. Surely, the panchayats have to devise a mechanism by which they can identify those who can pay the taxes and those who cannot. But the days when villagers could expect to live on doles from the Central or the state government are definitely numbered. It is time villagers realized that self-government does not mean merely electing their panchayat representatives and that they have to pay to get the services they expect from the panchayats. 																														Given our tradition of looking up to the government for everything, making villagers pay for their own development schemes is not an easy decision. Rural taxes have been particularly unpopular, and agricultural income all over the country has always enjoyed low taxation because of political considerations. 																														That the Left Front government is veering round to this new approach has been evident at the time of last years panchayat elections in the state. Villagers are being slowly introduced to a new system which entitles them to a common village facility for a fee. Thus, many panchayats have set up common cattlesheds where willing villagers can keep their animals for a nominal fee. Panchayats are now collecting taxes for motor vehicles which use the village roads. It is a matter of time before more and more village facilities are used to raise money for the panchayats. 																														It is not really a political issue. Panchayats have to increasingly face the funds crunch, irrespective of whether they are run by the leftists or the opposition parties like the Trinamool Congress or the Congress. That is why the Trinamool mayor of Calcutta, Subrata Mukherjee, is so anxious to levy new taxes or increase some existing ones. That is why the Berhampore municipality, run by the Congress, is perennially at war with the state government to garner enough money to pay salaries to its employees. 																														But Mamata Banerjee would have none of this, either from the Left Front government or from her own party colleagues like Mukherjee. One has only to remember her fierce opposition which forced Mukherjee to drop his plans for some civic taxes in Calcutta. 																														The question is whether she can make substantial political gains by clinging to old-style populism. Obviously, the unpopularity of taxation, particularly in the villages, forced the government to beat a hasty retreat on rural taxes. But the official move could make it difficult for her to sustain the campaign till the elections. 																														For the left, on the other hand, the basic issue of rural taxes could prove as challenging a political campaign as the new agricultural policy. The new farm policy underscored a basic change in the lefts rural policies. After two decades of a purely political orientation, which saw both panchayats and farm policies as an appendage to vote banks, the Left Front is beginning to see the virtue of the economic argument. The new policy, therefore, sought to emphasize the role of private capital in agriculture and even of contract farming.																														In all this, the idea is to make agriculture more profitable and thereby raise the level of rural earnings. And this is directly linked to the question of generating funds for the panchayats. Ultimately, the people can pay only if they earn enough to be able to pay. The nonavailability of Central or state funds for rural projects only brings in an element of compulsion and urgency to an otherwise incontrovertible economic logic.																														If this is the stuff of economic reform, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has already accepted it in principle, no matter what his party does to try to cover it with political jargon. If hospital and education fees are being raised and new taxes levied, that is because the government has at last awakened to the futility of running the economy on subsidies. 																														It is possible that not just Mamata Banerjee but some of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s partners in the government would object to rural taxes as and when they come. It is also possible that the Marxists themselves would develop cold feet for fear of upsetting their rural votebank too much. If they do so, the panchayats would continue to be mere political tools and not self-reliant administrative bodies they are meant to be.																														But then Bangla bandhs, called by the leftists or their opponents, have always been precisely that  political tools that take a toll on the states economy.

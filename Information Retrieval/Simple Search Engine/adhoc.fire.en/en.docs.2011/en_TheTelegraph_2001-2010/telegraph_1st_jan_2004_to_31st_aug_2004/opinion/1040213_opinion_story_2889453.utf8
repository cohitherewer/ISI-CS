The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, February 13, 2004 							 																						THE WRONG GAME																														There are times in history when sportsmen assume a role that goes beyond the playing fields. Such a development may not be beneficial for the game concerned or for the players, but the situation is imbued with a significance that is inescapable. The Indian cricketers, whether they like it or not, are placed in such a bind. More than cricket hinges on their willing participation in the forthcoming Indo-Pak series to be played in Pakistan. The series is part of a package of good-will gestures that Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee extended towards Pakistan. It is aimed at normalizing relations between the two countries even as diplomats and politicians sit across negotiating tables to place the relationship on a firm and viable footing. In recent months, thanks largely to the efforts of Mr Vajpayee, there has been an unprecedented thaw in the proxy war that prevailed between the two countries. The global situation, especially the influence of Washington, has also contributed to the thaw. A cricket tour, given the huge popularity that the game enjoys in the sub-continent, will serve to bring the people closer together. Cricket lovers in both countries are partisan but they are also extraordinarily warm and appreciative. A cricket series will send out the signals of normalcy.																														Indian cricketers, however, have a somewhat different concern. They are worried about their own personal security and these fears are fuelled by the home minister, Mr L.K. Advani, and by sections of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The assumption seems to be that the situation in Pakistan is far too volatile for anyone to guarantee the safety of the players. Everyone knows that it takes only one fanatic to spoil everything and that no security shield can be a protection against one man who is willing to die for a cause. There is thus a question mark over the tour. This has placed the players in the most unenviable position. They have valid reasons to be worried about security in Pakistan. But if they make heavy weather of these, they run the risk of being called unpatriotic and of jeopardizing the prime ministers entire gameplan. Cricketers have become instruments in a rather tricky political process. Mr Vajpayee wants to bat for history but the players are reluctant to bat on his behalf in Pakistan, where the level of security is dicey. The question mark on the tour will be removed by a political decision in which the players will not have any say. It is unfortunate that cricketers have to play for politics. Indo-Pak cricket is worse than war minus the shooting: it has been reduced to diplomacy without diplomats.

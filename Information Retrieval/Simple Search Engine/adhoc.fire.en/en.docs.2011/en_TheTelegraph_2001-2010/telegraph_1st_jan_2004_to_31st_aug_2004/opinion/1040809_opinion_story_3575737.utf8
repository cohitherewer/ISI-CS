		 Monday, August 09, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Parenting troubles				 																																																				Sir  If the Bharatiya Janata Party hardliners have been sidelined in the recent chintan baithak in Goa, then a few men in Jhandewalan may be jumping for joy (Sangh plans to loan leader to BJP, Aug 7). It may not be common for a parent to rejoice at the offsprings distress, but as far as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is concerned, the BJP has been playing truant from before the elections. The hardliners, led by L.K. Advani, probably feared turning the voter away with too hard a line. But in giving in to this fear, they turned away their mentors as well who must have felt vindicated when the BJP lost. The sidelining of Advani and friends in Goa may well have been the handiwork of the RSS: plans to install (loan is the preferred term) the RSS joint general secretary in the BJP make the speculation stronger. What more does Advani need for his cup of woes to be full?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Raman Vasudevan, Jamshedpur
				 																Bullied and bruised				 																																																				Sir  There has been much speculation in the press regarding Indias reaction to the hostage debacle in Iraq (A penchant for blunders, July 29). But surprisingly enough, not much has been said about the factual discrepancies in the kidnappers demands. They have asked India to withdraw its troops, yet we have no military presence in Iraq. They have also asked India to condemn the American occupation of Iraq, which we have already done (albeit not in the strong terms that the kidnappers might want). 				 																																																				Our ever-so-patriotic leftists are already demanding everything to be done to get our people back. True, we must not desert our citizens, but hasnt the governments handling of the whole issue again underlined Indias image as a soft target for extremists? I feel that India ought to have threatened to send its armed forces to Iraq if the kidnappers do not release the three Indian truck-drivers. 				 																																																				What has the release of Iraqi prisoners of war in American prisons got to do with India? I think India is giving in to a lot of arm-twisting and bullying, even though this may not ensure the safety of our citizens. The prospect of having to deal with the Indian army would have scared the terrorists of the Holders of the Black Banner far more than our ministry of external affairs ever can.

				 																																																				Sir  It is becoming increasingly clear that the entire international community will have to pay a rather heavy price for the crime committed by the United States of America in Iraq. Contrary to its expressed objective of making the world a better place without Saddam Hussein, the US has managed only to create yet another rogue state at a geographically critical position in the world. 				 																																																				If the government of India had the guts to speak up against the lone superpower, it should have asked George W. Bush why innocent Indian citizens like Antaryami, Sukdev Singh and Tilak Raj should pay for the American governments actions. It is not only the nationals from India, Kenya and Egypt, but countless Iraqi civilians who are caught between American imperialists and their Iraqi facilitators.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I am quite amazed at the amount of news stories and sound bytes that has been generated in the print and electronic media about the three truck-drivers who have been abducted in Iraq (Three Indians seized in Iraq, July 22). Every day one reads reports of kidnappings in places like Bihar. Those who are kidnapped are persons who, like Antaryami, Tilak Raj and Sukdev Singh, are engaged earning a livelihood to feed their families. Seldom are their near and dear ones interviewed by the press, nor is there a fraction of the activism we are witnessing now to get the hostages in Iraq released. Some reports have gone to the extent of comparing this to the Kandahar crisis, ignoring the fact that our national carrier was involved in that.				 																																																				The point that has to be made is that the three Indian hostages in Iraq were in that country to earn more money than they could in India. They were not doing a service to the nation which would set them apart from those whose disappearences and even deaths usually go unreported and uninvestigated. It hurts me as an Indian citizen to see such blatant double standards.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The killings of Raja Azad Khan and Sajjad Naeem have broken the myth that Islamist terrorists do not kill members of their own community (Two Pak hostages killed, July 29). The killings of the two Pakistanis have made the crisis over the three Indian hostages more grave than before. 				 																																																				It is time to think of assigning responsibilities for the current mess that has been created in Iraq. The responsibility lies solely with the US. This is clear from the fact that before the invasion of Iraq, hardly any case of bombing, arson, kidnapping or murder was reported from Iraq in the international media. It is a pity that innocent civilians  even from countries which have no military presence in Iraq  will have to continue sacrificing their lives to pay for the mistakes of the leaders of the US and United Kingdom. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

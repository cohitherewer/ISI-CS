TWENTIETH CENTURY By John W. Garver, Oxford, Rs 595The Congress and the Communist parties always had a romantic attachment with China, both before and after independence. However, Jawaharlal Nehrus famous refrain Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai soon turned sour and India is still paying the price of Beijings intrusion in south Asia. John W. Garver analyses the origin, characteristics and consequences of the India-China conflict in his book.																					Graver uses geopolitics in explaining inter-state conflicts. Rivalry between India and China started in the Fifties when both the countries were following autarkik economic policies. Even in the Nineties, when these two countries opened up their economies significantly, there was no clash among them for markets and raw materials. The contention has rather been for power and prestige. Garver writes that the struggle between Beijing and Delhi continues despite the harmful economic consequences. 																					Jawaharlal Nehru had accepted the British-Indian geopolitical strategy in 1947. In the framework of the raj, the three Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim were client states of the British Indian Empire and functioned as a shield for securing Indias northern border.																					In 1949, Mao had accepted in toto the strategic framework of Han China. Among the imperial regimes of the Middle Kingdom, the Han dynasty was most aggressive. The Hans sent military expeditions to Tibet and forced the latter to accept tributary status vis--vis Beijing. Tibet in turn coerced Bhutan, Sikkim and Nepal to accept tributary status vis--vis Lhasa. Thus, in a way, Beijing came to perceive Bhutan, Sikkim and Nepal as tributaries of China. 																					When China became weak in the 19th century, the British in India sent expeditions to Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim. British India extended control over these regions as part of a greater plan to prevent Russia from extending its control over the Himalayas. Finally in 1903, Tibet became a tributary of the British Indian Empire. Mao could not accept the extension of British control over this region by taking advantage of Chinas political weakness. This was the beginning of the Mao-Nehru tussle.																					In 1950, the Red soldiers of China entered Tibet. Nehru did not raise any objection then. Though the United States of America was willing to aid India against Chinese aggression in Tibet, Nehru was convinced that if India accepted Chinese control over Tibet, China would also accept Indian control over the three Himalayan Kingdoms. Nehrus blunder was in his assumption  he did not even bargain with China over such issues before accepting Chinas control over Tibet. He underestimated Chinas presence in Tibet. But Mao initiated a break from imperial legacies and China started building roads, airports and cantonments in Tibet. Such activities are still continuing today and the presence of the Chinese military in Tibet is becoming stronger with time. What is worse, China is changing the demographic balance of Tibet by inducting Han Chinese settlers in large numbers.																					India started appeasing China only after 1962. Delhi has accepted Taiwan as part of China. In addition, China is increasing military links with Bangladesh, Pakistan and Myanmar. The objective is to contain India within south Asia. India, concludes Garver, could buy peace only by accepting Chinas hegemony.																					Garvers well researched book is an essential read not only for policymakers and strategic analysts, who are reluctant to accept the China threat, but also for the left-oriented intelligentsia who accept Beijing as their ideological big brother. The moral of Garvers brilliant analysis is that appeasement has failed in the past. And it will fail in the future.						KAUSHIK ROY

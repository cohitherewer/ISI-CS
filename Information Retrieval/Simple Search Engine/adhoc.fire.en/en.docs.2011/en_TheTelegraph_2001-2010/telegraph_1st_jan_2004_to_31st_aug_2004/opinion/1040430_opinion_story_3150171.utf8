		 Friday, April 30, 2004 							 																						GLORY ON THE GREENS				 	 Ancient turfThe Romance of the Indian Open (1964-2003) By K.R. Wadhwaney, Siddharth, Rs 600The recent triumphs of Arjun Atwal, Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa in international golf tournaments have enhanced the popularity of the game in India. But it was the persistence of the Australian golfer, Peter Thomson, that led to the first Indian Open Golf Championship being organized in 1964. As winner of the inaugural edition of the championship, Thomson received the paltry sum of $25,000. In contrast, the winner of the 2003 Shaw Wallace Indian Open in Calcutta, Mike Cunning of the United States of America, received a handsome prize of $500,000. The first golf course in Delhi was laid down at the time of the Delhi Durbar in 1911, while the Calcutta Golf Club was founded decades earlier in 1829. In 1876, the cost of running the Calcutta Golf Club was Rs 720, the salaries of servants being just Rs 100 a year.																														Such interesting nuggets of information about the early history of golf in India and eminent golfers of the past can be found in K.R. Wadhwaneys book. Glossy and readable, The Romance of the Indian Open has lots of photographs, statistics, and even a table on all previous winners of the Indian Open.																														This book is the first comprehensive history of golf in India. Twenty-one of its 32 chapters deal with the Indian Open tournament, which alternated between Delhi and Calcutta, except for 2000 and 2001 when it was held in Haryana. Among the remaining chapters, a few provide a close insight into the game in India, some deal with the history of golf courses in the country, giving details of layout and topography. Besides, there is one chapter on the formation of the Professional Golfers Association of India in 1988. 																														The book also has biographical sketches of renowned golfers, some information on sponsors of the game like ITC and Shaw Wallace, and above all, on how professional management groups like Tiger Sports Marketing, have helped the game to grow.																														In the chapter titled, Renowned Indian Stars, the author chronicles the triumphs of all leading Indian golfers. There are anecdotes on past players like Billoo Sethi, Raj Kumar Pitamber and Ashok Malik as also profiles of some of the eminent supporters of the game like the Bharat Ram, Siddharth Shriram, Brendon DSouza, Surender Lall Bandy and Pawan Kant Munjal. 																														What makes Wadhwaneys book invaluable are his astute social insights. He traces the rise of caddie golfers like Ali Sher (two-time winner of the Indian Open) and Vijay Kumar, who hailed from the remote village of Martinpurwa near the La Martiniere college golf course in Lucknow. 																														Wadhwaney also traces how the profile of the game is changing in India. His book is the best evidence of this  until the early Nineties, freelance golf experts like Ramesh Kohli and Harji Malik wrote on golf for all the leading newspapers in India. But nowadays, newspapers have specialized reporters to cover major events. Then there is the mushrooming of golf magazines, which also reflects the rising fortunes of the game in India.

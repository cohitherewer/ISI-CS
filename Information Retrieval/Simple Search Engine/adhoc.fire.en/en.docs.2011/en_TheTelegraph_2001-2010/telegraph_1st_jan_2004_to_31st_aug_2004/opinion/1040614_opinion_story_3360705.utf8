		 Monday, June 14, 2004 							 																						A WAY OUT OF THE MIREGwynne Dyer																					President George W. Bush has had a good two weeks on Iraq. A United Nations special envoy helped to choose the members of an Iraqi interim government. A UN Security Council resolution then blessed the deal by which the United States of America will allegedly hand over sovereignty to that interim government on June 30 . And at the G-8 summit in Georgia, nobody openly criticized his invasion of Iraq and everybody smiled at the photo-ops. 																					By the end of the summit, he was so emboldened by all this international cooperation and good will that he wondered aloud if the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation might like to send some troops to Iraq. Is it possible that he still doesnt get it? 																					The sovereignty deal, the UN resolution and the show of solidarity at the G-8 are all about smoothing the path so that the US can get out of Iraq as fast as possible. None of the other major powers except Britain approves of what the US has done there, but none of them wants this to end with bitter and humiliated Americans turning their backs on theworld, so they swallow their anger and try to help Bush find his way out. Frances president Jacques Chirac bluntly called it an exit strategy from a crisis.																					Messy affair																					Most other governments fear that Iraq has been fatally destabilized by the US intervention. The problem was not so much the US invasion itself  that was a frontal assault on international law and the UN, but potentially beneficial for Iraqis suffering under Saddam Husseins brutal rule  as what happened after. The occupation regime has so consistently made the worst possible choices that it would have done better simply by flipping a coin each time. 																					It disbanded the Iraqi army and the whole apparatus of the Iraqi state, although it clearly lacked the skills or resources to create adequate replacements. It refused to hold early elections for fear that the Shias would win. It has never had even half the soldiers that conventional military wisdom would dictate for the occupation of such a large country. As a result, overstretched American troops have relied far too much on firepower, random arrests and intimidation, alienating even the Iraqis who were initially well disposed towards the US.																					Those decisions were presumably dictated by the neo-cons in the Pentagon, but Paul Bremer, the outgoing head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, made his own contributions to the mess, like seeking a confrontation in April with Sheikh Moqtada al-Sadr and his radical Shia militia that the CPA could not possibly win without damaging the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala, killing thousands, and driving the Shias to revolt.																					Throwing a lifeline																					The US military authorities outdid Bremer by besieging the Sunni insurgents in Falluja, creating another no-win situation. US forces have now given up trying to control either Falluja or Najaf, and further no-go zones for American troops are likely to follow. The myth of American military power has been smashed in the eyes of ordinary Iraqis, just as trust in American motives has been destroyed by the disgusting revelations about the abuses inflicted on Iraqi prisoners.																					I believe we are absolutely on the brink of failure. We are looking into the abyss, general Joseph Hoar, former commander of US Central Command, told the Senate foreign relations committee last month. Americas friends and allies think that, too. 																					The other great powers have pretty much abandoned hope of a happy outcome in Iraq. If they were sure that Bush will lose next Novembers election, they might just wait him out, but since they are not confident of that, they are actually throwing him a lifeline. They are offering him the political cover that would let him cut and run now, because the worst possible outcome of this mess would be a US catastrophe in Iraq, an Arab world in revolt against Western meddling and an embittered and isolated America. The question is whether Bush understands that this is a lifeline and not a blank cheque.

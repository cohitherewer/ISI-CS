		 Thursday, July 08, 2004 							 																						THE MANY FACES OF POVERTY						DOCUMENT Excerpts from the West Bengal Human Development Report, 2004				 	 Left hungry																														On the whole, the incidence of poverty in West Bengal has come down. While there are some problems of comparability of the 55th round national sample survey data for 1999-2000 with the earlier rounds, it is possible to introduce some degree of comparability by making some adjustments... 																														It is evident that poverty has indeed come down over the Nineties (although the decline is slightly less than is suggested by the unadjusted 55th round data). However, the variation in incidence of poverty by household occupational category is substantial. Agricultural labourers remain the poorest...and have also experienced the lowest decline in poverty rates. Even in 1999-2000, nearly half of such households were absolutely poor. The group with the second-highest incidence of poverty is that of other labour, but here it is worth noting that the poverty ratio at the end of the decade was less than one-third, and also that this group had experienced the largest drop in poverty over the Nineties. 																														The lowest poverty ratio was for the miscellaneous category others, although for this group, the incidence of absolute poverty seems to have increased marginally. The group of cultivating households showed a broadly stable extent of poverty 																														The tea crisis and the conditions of plantation workers: Pipli Mahali, aged 34 years, was a permanent worker in Mujnai Tea Estate, who lived on the estate with her husband and her two-and-a-half year-old son. After the crisis in the tea estate began, it became increasingly difficult to manage her household. Her husband, who suffered from tuberculosis, died in early 2002 because the estate hospital had no stock of medicine. Once the employers abandoned the estate in November 2002, there was no food provided to the workers at all. Pipli was then forced to feed her son whatever fruits and vegetables were available in the nearby jungles. The child was unable to digest these wild fruits and died of blood dysentery within a month. By late 2003, Pipli was living alone and had sold off all her belongings in order to survive. She too was suffering from untreated tuberculosis.																														The tea industry of North Bengal has been facing a major economic crisis in recent years because of the continued fall in international tea prices, and therefore a number of tea plantations have been closed down or abandoned by the private management. In the Duars region of Jalpaiguri district alone, there were 20 such abandoned plantations in late 2003, which affected more than 30,000 workers and their families. There has been an alarming increase in death among workers households after July 2002, when most of these plantations closed. Most of these have been of young children and women in childbirth. 																														Since some food forms part of the wage basket in most tea plantations, the abandonment by the management typically means there is no food provision for the workers. Also, the closure means the electricity supply to the plantation is withdrawn, denying workers access to common water tanks and forcing them to fetch drinking water from nearby streams which are polluted by waste from cement factories in Bhutan. Many workers in this area face not only starvation but significant increases in water-borne diseases. 																														In other plantations which have not yet closed, there are reports of retrenching of workers, delayed payment of wages and mounting provident funds and gratuity dues. Women workers, who form the bulk of permanent workers in these tea estates because of their role as pluckers, are the worst affected. They increasingly face not only poverty and possible starvation, but also other forms of exploitation. The recent incidents of violence in the tea estates reflect the growing desperation of all workers in the area. TO BE CONCLUDED

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, July 12, 2004 							 																						UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES The finance minister has done well given his constraints, but Udayan Bose expected more boldness and hard decisions from the Chidambaram he knows  All things to all menThis budget was going to be a difficult one to formulate, given the noises coming from certain parties supporting the government and the need to placate the old socialist lobby within the Congress and in the coalition. Yet there was the expectation of a dream budget, the burden of which the finance minister happily carries around from his earlier days.																														Given all these pulls and constraints, one has to say that P. Chidambaram has done a good job. Not a firecracker of a budget perhaps, but a strong foundation-laying one, sincere and growth-oriented and one that would appeal to large sections of our society.																														Before the budget speech began, some of us watching it together wrote down what we wanted to see. They ranged from higher tax-to-gross-domestic-product ratio, hence a wider tax net; reduction of subsidies, resulting in lower revenue and fiscal deficits; yet a larger outlay in planned expenditure, agriculture, education and manufacturing. Where would the revenue come from? Higher taxes? We pondered whether the finance minister would have the courage to increase foreign direct investment limits in select sectors. Would he abolish the Foreign Investment Promotion Board? We were sure that he would bring about changes in taxation and make it simpler and easier on the payer. Do away with capital gains tax, perhaps? 																														Now that all the sound and fury is over and dust has settled in Raisina Hill, I think that the big takeaways for me were the following:																														The government, through the finance minister in the parliament, has made two strong commitments, namely to maintain a continued growth of 7-8 per cent per year for the foreseeable future and execute direct action to reduce revenue deficit to zero by 2008. These two are huge statements. If India can grow at say a gross total of 40 per cent over 5 years and not have any revenue deficit, we will, in our own lifetime, be able to see a different, vibrant, excitingly wealthy and utopian India, an India with a strong future for our children. 																														This budget gives a large thrust to agriculture. This was both necessary and expected. One hopes that this will catalyse a strong growth in the agricultural sector, which still plays a large part in our economy and also in the make-up of the GDP. The outlay on education was laudatory. Amazingly, one recently came across statistics that India progressively has spent less and less per capita on education over the last 7-8 years. This trend needed reversal, and the 2 per cent cess will generate sufficient revenue to pay for the primary education of our future generations. But the cynic in me questions the efficiency of government-level education. Will teachers be there to teach, or will the money that we pay as cess get wasted on irrelevant matters and faceless job-creation for those the state governments wish to favour? Kerala and West Bengal have proved that education can be imparted to all, and this must happen one day in Orissa, Bihar, Himachal and Uttar Pradesh, the lowest educated states in our country.																														The finance minister has produced an additional Rs 10,000 crore in planned expenditure, which is great news. Yet he has promised to keep the revenue deficit to 2.5 per cent and overall fiscal deficit to 4.4 per cent. Add another 5 per cent of the states, we are then looking at a deficit of 9.4 per cent for the country as a whole. Not good, but better than the 10.6 per cent as it is currently touted to be.																														But here I have a bone to pick with the finance minister. While he was trying very hard to be all things to all men, I had expected from the Chidambaram that I know a prescription for fiscal prudence at the Central and state levels. Not one word on lowering government expenditure, reduction of government staff or indeed of tightening the belt. One cannot have fiscal prudence if you allow state governments to run amuck, as some states have done in the recent past. The time has come for such profligacy to stop and even if no one else says it, there are two men in this government who can say so and with authority: the current prime minister and finance minister. That they did not say so was disappointing.																														There are many things in good measure, although they might not spark off a revolution in the stock market: implementation of value-added tax by April 2005, focus on airports, seaports, attention to tourism, new container terminal in Cochin, thrust on drinking water, and the subtle but firm nudge to farmers to switch to oilseeds. All very commendable, but the effects of these will take some time to show up and the devil is in the implementation. 																														There are a few interesting side lights. One is the creation of the investment commission. As Chidambaram was speaking, I thought he was going to announce the demise of the FIPB. That didnt quite happen, but went very close. India has to open up for FDI. No matter if the left agrees or not, FDI has contributed to GDP growth, and we must strive harder. I enjoyed it when Chidambaram brought in higher FDI limits for telecom, civil aviation and insurance. Insurance? I almost shrieked. Will there be demonstrations now in Calcutta? The other interesting one was about setting up a bureau for the reconstruction of public sector enterprises, which sounded like the now defunct disinvestment commission. I hope the bureau plays as dynamic a role as its predecessor. 																														The next few days will see a lot more analysis, debates and shouting matches in parliament. And then the budget will get passed. Roll back? What is there to roll back? Nothing perhaps. And here lies the rub.																														The Indian GDP pie roughly comprises of 50 per cent allocation of the growth in the services sector, 24 per cent of agriculture and 26 per cent of industry. If the services sector maintains its current growth at 9 per cent, then it will contribute 4.5 per cent to the GDP. The finance minister said his attempt was for industry to grow at 10 per cent, leading to a contribution of 2.6 per cent, agriculture has to do a 5 per cent (lower than the current 9.1 per cent) that will contribute 1.2 per cent, totalling 8.3 per cent of GDP growth. When the fundamentals are so strong, one wishes that the finance minister had been bolder and taken some hard decisions. Which brings me to another point: if the current growth is 8.2 per cent (handed down by the previous government) and expected growth now is 8.3 per cent, then was it wrong to say that India was shining? 																														Finally, two other points. There was no tax reform or simplification in this budget. Perhaps it was too much for us to expect, for, Chidambaram has been in government for only 5 weeks. But he said he will be back in February and then we can expect a strong tax reform. 																														Much has been said and much more will be said about the turnover tax. I met a stockbroker who said that he makes only 10 to 12 basis points in brokerage and paying out 15 was going to kill him. Another wag commented that if he were to buy a stock, he would now have to pay turnover tax, yet he may not make any capital gain, even make a capital loss, in which case he is worse off. Case for rollback perhaps, Mr Finance Minister?

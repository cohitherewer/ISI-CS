The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 							 																						CHANGE OF GUARD																														The fugleman has fallen. The defeat of Mr N. Chandrababu Naidu  chief minister of Andhra Pradesh and, for many, the model chief minister and exemplar of a reformist political leader  is a blow to the project of development and economic growth. The verdict of the electorate in Andhra Pradesh is overwhelming and unambiguous. It amounts to a complete rejection of Mr Naidu and the policies that he formulated and implemented. It is clear that in Andhra Pradesh and in other parts of India, democracy and economic growth are at odds. Mr Naidus efforts to bring his state to the cutting edge of investment and economic reforms did not find the approval of the voters. The experience of Mr Digvijay Singh in Madhya Pradesh, and that of Mr Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan in the assembly elections last year, were somewhat similar to the humiliating defeat suffered by Mr Naidu. Both Mr Singh and Mr Gehlot, like Mr Naidu, pursued a policy of economic reforms and development. They lost at the hustings. Mr Naidus defeat is a little more spectacular because his achievements were showcased as the success of economic reforms, and Andhra Pradesh became the emblem of a modern India which was on the fast track of development. All this has been brushed aside in one magisterial popular gesture.																														The verdict of the people cannot take away from Mr Naidus achievements, substantive as they are. But they provide clues to his failures. Mr Naidus obsession with economic reforms and growth led him to neglect vital issues in the social sector. Observers noted that a few miles out of the modern citadel of Hyderabad, the usual signs of poverty were only too visible. Lack of water, health facilities, educational institutions and absence of electricity  the standard features of under-development  were noticeable. These aspects of life in Andhra Pradesh had obviously not entered Mr Naidus ubiquitous lap-top computer. Economic developments centred around Hyderabad had outstripped improvements in the infrastructure and Mr Naidus government paid scant regard to this problem. The signs were there for him to read, but tunnel vision is not an asset in a marriage between democracy and development.																														India is unique in that it decided immediately after independence that democracy would not only precede economic growth but would also assist the process of wealth generation. The decision to adopt universal franchise in a fledgling democracy was a giant leap in faith. The significance of the value given to liberty cannot be denied and it remains the cornerstone of the Indian democracy, but the pursuit of the god known as the gross domestic product cannot also be allowed to falter if India is to break the shackles of obscurantism and poverty. Mr Naidu tried to marry democracy to development, and believed that economic growth would filter down to remove the burden of poverty. His defeat might be a triumph of democracy, but it should not mark a retreat of the enterprise he epitomized.

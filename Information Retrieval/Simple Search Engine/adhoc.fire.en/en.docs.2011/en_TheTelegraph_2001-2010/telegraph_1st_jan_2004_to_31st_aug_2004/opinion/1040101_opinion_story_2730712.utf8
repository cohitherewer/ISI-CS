The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, January 01, 2004  Letters to Editor				 																Up for sale				 																																																				 Sir  Why did the Brits suddenly feel the urge to value themselves  land, property, people, et al  in terms of money (Buy Britain for $8 trillion)? And remember, the valuation was publicized as much in pound sterling as in American dollars. Does that mean Tony Blair has had offers from George W. Bush, who might have been interested in buying up the United Kingdom? But then shouldnt someone tell Bush that there actually is no need to? Blair has already sold his soul to the Yankees, and whichever way he goes, his cabinet, minus the usual irritants, is bound to follow. Besides, there might be a few other problems for Bush. One, he will inevitably have to contend with the spectre of elderly women climbing over palace gates or slipping under wired fencings to declare their hatred for him. The other problem is worse. He will have to pay for the underemployed, ever-multiplying, good-for-nothing British royalty for ages to come. And knowing the Brits, there is a chance they didnt count that expense in the $8 trillion. Yours faithfully, 
 J. Acharya, Calcutta Saving grace
 Sir  The media has exposed Chhagan Bhujbals resignation over the attack on the Zee television offices in Mumbai as nothing but a face-saving measure (Honourable Bhujbal exit, Dec 24). The Central Bureau of Investigation should now act swiftly to catch the politicians involved in the stamp-paper scam so that Bhujbal and leaders like him are not able to destroy evidence. To prevent such scams in the future, capital punishment should be awarded for all corrupt deals above, say, one crore rupees. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government should utilize the remainder of its term to expose and weed out corrupt politicians. This will ensure its victory in the coming general elections.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  The hurried resignation of the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, Chhagan Bhujbal, clearly proves his connection with the stamp paper scam. It is surprising that Bhujbal should have risked his political career to allow a scandal of such enormous magnitude to continue, and for such a long time. Abdul Karim Telgi, supposedly under police custody, was allowed to visit his residence, allegedly under Bhujbals own instructions. Bhujbal knew that the noose around his neck was tightening, and so did his party. Which is why the attack on the news network office, the flimsiest possible excuse, was used to make him resign. 				 																																																				But possibly the Nationalist Congress Party and Bhujbal realize that the resignation does not grant him immunity from the judicial process. In other words, the party may not have been successful in hoodwinking the electorate after all. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  The recent discovery of fake stamps in a Calcutta civil court proves that the stamp scam has struck deep roots in India. The prime minister should personally look into the matter. Chhagan Bhujbals resignation should not be allowed to give a burial to inquiries into the scandal.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Party rallies round Bhujbal (Dec 25), reflects the political tragedy of independent India. Instead of coming down heavily on a tainted minister from its own ranks, the National Congress Party has shamelessly rallied around Bhujbal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Barun Sanyal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sharad Pawar seems determined to make it to the prime ministers chair this time, given that Sonia Gandhi, post-defeat, has gone soft on the issue of sitting on the chair for the sake of getting an alliance together. Which means Pawar could not but come down hard on Chhagan Bhujbal whose dalliances with the scamster, Abdul Karim Telgi, makes him, and therefore Pawar himself, a soft target for the opposition. Bhujbals resignation elevates Pawar to a moral high ground, although it makes Bhujbal himself vulnerable to investigations. But then, there must have been some concrete promises made to Bhujbal for the chair vacated with such ease. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Samanta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Politicians all over India must be cursing Chhagan Bhujbal for resigning on such a pretext as a party-sponsored attack on a news channel office. If this was sufficient reason, the whole of the Left Front government should have resigned from office long ago.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																Milking us dry				 																																																				Sir  The West Bengal government has planned to impose an annual flyover tax of Rs 500 to repay a loan from the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (Take high road, pay annual tax, Dec 13). Why should the common man, with reduced purchasing power, lower dearness allowance, and sometimes without employment, pay the governments dues?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Although the salaried continue to pay their taxes, the government goes on misusing public funds. For years there has been hardly any improvement in the infrastructure, medical facilities or education for children. Yet whenever there is need for money, the government does not hesitate to levy a new set of taxes. If people are forced to pay their taxes, the government should also be forced to fulfil its duties. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

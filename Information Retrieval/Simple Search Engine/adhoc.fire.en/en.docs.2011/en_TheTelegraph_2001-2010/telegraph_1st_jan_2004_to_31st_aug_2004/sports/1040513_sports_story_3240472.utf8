 Bryant pleads not guilty
Colorado: Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, facing a possible sentence of life in prison, pleaded not guilty to charges that he raped a 19-year-old woman at a luxury Colorado resort last year. Dressed in a black suit, a white shirt and a gold tie, the 25-year-old Bryant said just four words during his brief arraignment on Tuesday, which was televised nationwide. Asked by judge Terry Ruckriegle whether he understood the charges against him, the Lakers shooting guard replied: Yes, sir. Asked to enter his plea to the charges of felony sexual assault, which carries a sentence of between four years and life in prison, Bryant said not guilty, before sitting down between his lawyers, Pamela Mackey and Hal Haddon. Bryant, who is married and has a young daughter, admitted to having sex on June 30, 2003, with the woman concierge at the Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Edwards, Colorado, but said it was consensual and denied raping her.

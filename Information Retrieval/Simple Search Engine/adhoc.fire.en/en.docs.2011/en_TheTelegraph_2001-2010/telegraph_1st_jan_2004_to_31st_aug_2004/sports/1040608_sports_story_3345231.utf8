 South Africa to scrap racial quota
Durban: South Africas new sports minister Makhenkesi Stofile has said that selection of black players for cricket and other sporting teams according to the racial quota system would no longer be tolerated. I am sick and tired of the artificial use of sport quotas as window dressing, said Stofile in an interview with the Natal Mercury On Monday. Stofiles statement comes in the midst of growing unease over the selection of black players when they are not really ready for international sport. The minister also said the government would not influence the selection of teams in any way. He had believed 12 years ago that quotas could provide an answer to representation in sport, but that it did not bring about meaningful transformation. These days I get the impression people are selected for window dressing, he said. They sit on reserve benches and sometimes participants are even bought. Sport federations are not doing enough to ensure that local talent is properly utilised, Stofile said. The sports ministry would focus in future to create a pool of black players that can represent the country in any sport on merit. Stofile said his ministry would ensure that the traditional white sports such as cricket and rugby were played at traditionally black schools. He also said the senior administrators of all sports codes in South Africa would in future be held responsible for the use and development of talent. As the former chairman of parliamentary sports committee he favoured the quota system to bring about transformation in sport. (PTI)  Copyright

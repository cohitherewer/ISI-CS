 Rudolph keeps SA alive
 - First Test 
- Murali goes past Warne but Lankan bowlers face resistance  Jacques Rudolph, who scored an unbeaten 85 from 252 balls, blocks one in Galle on Friday. (AFP) Galle: Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan recaptured the world Test wicket record on the third day of the first Test against South Africa on Friday before Jacques Rudolph scored a painstaking unbeaten 85 as the visitors closed play at 347 for seven. Muralidharan had opener Martin van Jaarsveld caught at slip in the first session for his 528th wicket to pull one ahead of Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne and then combined with Sanath Jayasuriya to peg down the South Africans scoring rate. South Africa started the day on 82 without loss in reply to the hosts 486. Just 14 runs were added in the first hour with the loss of Boeta Dippenaar, before Jacques Kallis scored a commanding 59, adding 72 runs for the third wicket with Rudolph. Kallis pushed Sri Lanka on to the back foot with his aggressive approach, especially against Muralidharan, whom he slog-swept for several boundaries before the off-spinner tempted him into another that he mistimed and skied a catch to Kumar Sangakkara at mid-wicket. Captain Graeme Smith, pushed down the order after suffering from a virus, added 45 runs with Rudolph for the fourth wicket before being trapped leg-before for 23 by left-arm spinner Jayasuriya. Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher (6) was also snared by Jayasuriya, one of four spinners to be used by the hosts on the dry and cracked pitch, to reduce South Africa to 225 for five. Sri Lanka took their second new ball but struggled to break a 62-run stand between Shaun Pollock (25) and Rudolph that carried South Africa past the follow-on mark of 287. Eventually, left-armer Chaminda Vaas produced a delivery that kicked off a length to catch the shoulder of Pollocks bat and fly to gully, where Sangakkara took the catch. Lance Klusener (2), playing his first Test innings since 2002, lasted just 16 balls before popping up a catch in close. Nicky Boje ensured South Africa survived the final 52 minutes without further loss as he scored an unbeaten 31. Muralitharan bowled the bulk of the overs and finished with two for 112 from 39 overs while Jayasuriya took two for 34 from 20 overs. South Africa coach Eric Simons believes his team can still win the first Test after battling their way to within 139 runs of Sri Lankas first innings total on Friday. No. 3 batsman Rudolph led South Africas fight with a gruelling 85 from 252 balls while Kallis chipped in with an important 59 as South Africa reached 347 for seven by the end of the third day. There are now a number of scenarios that can take place, Simons told reporters. If we can get the lead close to 50 then suddenly there is pressure on them again if they lose a couple of early wickets. But if the lead stays 130 then they can lose two or three wickets and still be in a reasonably good position. Simons paid tribute to Rudolph and Kallis. Jacques really battled up front, he said. We had a gameplan for him to play to and he stuck to it which really started to pay dividends. Obviously it would be nice to have a faster scoring rate but he has done really well and kept his head  I think he did superbly. Jacques played an important little role for us before lunch as we were going nowhere for a little while  to go in there and get the run rate up was important. Sri Lankas skipper Atapattu was impressed with South Africas batsmen. For a team to come straight from South Africa and bat for more than a day was a good effort, Atapattu told reporters. Their eighth wicket partnership (worth 52 runs) has done a lot of good for them, rather like in our innings. It all depends on how we go in the first half hour tomorrow. If we can grab an early wicket then we will be in a good position.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

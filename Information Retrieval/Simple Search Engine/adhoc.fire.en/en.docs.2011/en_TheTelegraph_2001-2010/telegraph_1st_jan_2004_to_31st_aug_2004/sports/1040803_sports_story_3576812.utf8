 Anand regains Dortmund crown
	 - Indian ace tames Kramnik in final tie-breaker  Anand KramnikDortmund: Viswanathan Anand once again proved he is the boss in the rapid variation as he recorded an emphatic victory over Vladimir Kramnik of Russia to win the Dortmund Sparkassen chess tournament on Sunday (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). Having drawn the two games under normal time control in the final, Anand gave no chance to the BrainGames champion when it came to rapid chess. With this victory, Anand emerged the only unbeaten player in this years edition and also ended his Dortmund woes. It may be recalled that Anand had finished joint second in the last edition after a bad start while in his previous outing before that, the Indian stalwart had finished at the bottom of the table in 2001. Anand had won this event jointly in 2000 and 1996. Kramnik, third in world behind Garri Kasparov and Anand, was left without a clue in the rapid games. It was another English Attack with white that gave Anand the vital victory in the second rapid game. Kramnik tried a slightly unusual order of moves but the Indian was unimpressed. The game took a decisive turn in the middle-game after both players had castled on opposite flanks and Kramniks king side was severely weakened. Anand was almost on autopilot once he gained the upper hand. All moves he made were correct and Kramniks challenge fell apart like a pack of cards. The Russian could not find a reason to continue beyond the 31st move. In the first game of the tie-breaker, Anand drew comfortably with black. Kramnik played the Anti-Marshall which had already been tried out a few times in this meet and drew in 19 moves after some regulation exchanges leading to a balanced position. Earlier, the second game played under normal time control also did not see many chances going Kramniks way even though he was a pawn plus in the rook-and-pawns endgame arising out of a Sicilian Taimanov. The game lasted 47 moves. For the record, the status quo was maintained only for the top two players  Anand and Kramnik. Russian champion Peter Svidler finished third after beating Hungarian Peter Leko in the rapid tie-breaker as well. Leko finished fourth while German hope Arkadij Naiditsch finished a creditable fifth. Last years winner Viktor Bologan of Moldova finished seventh while the worlds youngest GM ever, Sergey Karjakin, finished eighth.  (PTI)  Copyright

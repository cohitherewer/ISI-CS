The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Good show by Mongia, Agarkar
	 - COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP London, July 24 (PTI): Dinesh Mongia continued his good run for Lancashire, scoring 76 off 52 balls in the second innings of the County championship Division I match against Gloucestershire in Cheltenham. Mongia struck two sixes and eight fours as his side, virtually assured of victory, declared at 354 for two. The Punjab left-hander had hit 111 in a first-innings total to 375. Gloucestershire, who made 234 in their first innings, closed the third day on 48 for one. The 27-year-old Indian is in his second stint for Lancashire. He had first served as replacement for West Indian Carl Hooper and is now filling in for Australian Stuart Law. Paceman Ajit Agarkar, who missed out on an India berth in the Asia Cup, also proved his worth for Middlesex. He took three for 72 runs to help his side restrict Worcestershire to 305 in the Division I match at New Road. The Mumbai player dismissed Andy Bichel, A. Hall and M. Mason. In reply, Middlesex were 260 for three.  Copyright

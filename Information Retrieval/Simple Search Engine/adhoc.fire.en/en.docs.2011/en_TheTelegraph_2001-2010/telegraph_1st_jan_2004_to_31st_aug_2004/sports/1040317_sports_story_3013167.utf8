 Nehra out for a week, replacement to be sought
 FROM OUR ORRESPONDENT  Ashish Nehra successfully appeals for a leg-before verdict against Moin Khan in Rawalpindi on Tuesday Rawalpindi: Ashish Nehras injury woes never seem to get over. If it was the swelling on his right ankle that kept him in doubt for the second ODI till Tuesday morning, a split webbing on his bowling arm required two stitches and has ruled him out for a week. Nehra will thus miss at least the next two ODIs, and the Indian management will seek a replacement for him. The left-arm pacer, who returned figures of three for 44, was injured while trying to stop a ball on his follow through. The injury-prone pacer has been in and out of the team after the World Cup following an ankle injury which needed surgery. He went to Australia before the Pakistan trip and suffered an injury there too. That injury, and indifferent form, put a question mark on his selection for the Pakistan series and Nehra was asked by the selectors to play the Duleep Trophy final to prove his fitness. Tri-series in Amstelveen Meanwhile, Rameez Raja has announced that the tri-series featuring India, Pakistan and Australia will be held in Amstelveen, The Netherlands, just before the Champions Trophy in England. The tournament will be held in Amstelveen before the ICC Champions Trophy in England in September, Rameez said. Its another move towards having regular cricket ties with India, he added. The Amstelveen ground hosted a 1999 World Cup match between South Africa and Kenya.  Copyright

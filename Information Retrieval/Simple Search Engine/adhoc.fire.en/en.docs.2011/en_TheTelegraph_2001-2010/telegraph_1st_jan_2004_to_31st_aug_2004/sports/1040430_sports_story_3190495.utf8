 Britain stripped of Paris silver
London: Four British athletes have been stripped of their silver medals in the 4x100 relay final at the 2003 world athletics after Dwain Chambers decided not to appeal his two-year doping ban. The IAAF said on Thursday it had stripped out Chambers results from each event he had contested since his positive sample was provided on August 1, 2003. Brazil are promoted to the silver medal slot behind the US.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

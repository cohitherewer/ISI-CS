		 Sunday, July 11, 2004  Professional opinion... 
 FROM OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 	 Prakash				 										Bangalore, July 10: In spite of S. Ganapathys strong Derby line-up, most of his fellow-professionals feel they are in with a chance. The following are some opinions:				 										Trainers				 										I. Ghatala: Full Speed may do well over the trip. He may surprise.				 										M. Eshwer: Blurr is in good nick but suspect over the trip. At the most she looks to be a place proposition.				 										S. Ganapathy: It is between my three wards Elite Zone, Spectacular Quest and Star Admiral. My fancy is Spectacular Quest.				 										S. Singh: Fantabulous King maintains good form. But on his disappointing run in the colts, he will have to produce an extraordinary run to win.				 										Jockeys				 										B. Prakash: Going by Spectacular Quests Colts triumph, all may have to beat him.				 										C. Rajendra: Elite Zone is in the pink of condition. I hope he wins.				 										M. Gallagher: Star Admiral finished on late in the Colts. He may do better over the Derby trip.				 										P. Shroff: Fantabulous King seems to be suspect over the trip. But he is in good condition and may place.				 										S. Storai: If Full Speed takes off well, he will take some beating.				 										Y Srinath: Blurr maintains good form. But if has to last the trip to win.

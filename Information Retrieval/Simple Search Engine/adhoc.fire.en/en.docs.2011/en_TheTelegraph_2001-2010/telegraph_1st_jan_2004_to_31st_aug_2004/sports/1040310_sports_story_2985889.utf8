The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA to host meet in Sept. 2005
Durban: After successfully staging the 2003 World Cup, South Africa will host the inaugural Super Series tournament in September next year. The dream series will pit the 2005 world champions against a Rest of World side comprising the cream of international talent. The event will involve three one-dayers and a five-day Test. UCBSA media officer Gerald de Kock said the board took the opportunity to host the series at its general council meeting at the weekend. No dates and venues have yet been finalised. The schedule will be decided when the ICC president (Ehsan Mani) and ICC chief executive (Malcolm Speed) visit South Africa on March 31, he said in a statement issued here.  (PTI)  Copyright

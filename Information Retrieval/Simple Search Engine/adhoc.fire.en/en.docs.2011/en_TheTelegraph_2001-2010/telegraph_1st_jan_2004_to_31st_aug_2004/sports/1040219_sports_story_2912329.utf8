 Fully fit Zaheer, Nehra ready to tour Pakistan
 - Indian pacers to take full advantage of Dennis Lillees visit  Lillee feels Zaheer should not jump too high and Nehra must be more side-on to reduce load on his legs Chennai: Top Indian pacers Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, who were struggling with injuries said on Wednesday they are fully fit and raring to tour Pakistan. Khan and Nehra were here to get useful tips from former Australian fast bowling great Dennis Lillee, who is visting the MRF Pace Foundation. The sessions last evening at the gymnasium here and bowling with Lillee at the nets have made me feel better and I am raring to make the trip to Pakistan, if selected, Khan said. He had been of great help to our bowling and this was our routine trip to the foundation. I was not feeling fully comfortable last week. For over two years now, I have been taking Lillees advice before a tour, Khan said. Nehra said he was concentrating on building techniques to avoid injuries and has recovered from the ankle injury sustained during the recent Australian tour. I made a comeback during the Australian tour after being out of action for nearly eight months. I am fit now and can always make use of Lillees visit to fine tune myself, Nehra said. His advice have been of great help to me in past and I always look forward to talking to masters like him, he said. Lillee said he had advised the bowlers on how they could avoid getting injured. I had advised Zaheer to take fewer steps in his run-up and avoid jumping too high before releasing the ball. Nehra too needed some changes. He has been asked to be more side-on to avoid putting the load on his legs, Lillee said. Khan had sustained a knee injury and then suffered from hamstring problems. T.A. Sekar, former Indian bowler, who is the director of coaching at the foundation said: It has been the practice of our bowlers to seek advises from Lillee, who has been involved with the foundation since 1987. Both Khan and Nehras action would be watched by Lillee for another three days.  (PTI)  Copyright

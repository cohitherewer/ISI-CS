The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The noose visible to Marion, Tim
	 - Dope distributor points directly at stars  Marion Jones (seen above after winning a 400m relay in Philadelphia on Saturday) cheque has bounced back on her San Francisco: A nutritionist charged with distributing illegal drugs to pro athletes told federal agents he gave steroids to athletics stars Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery in exchange for endorsements, a newspaper reported last night. The story on the San Francisco Chronicles web site, quoting sources who requested anonymity, said Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) founder Victor Conte told US federal investigators that Jones and Montgomery received the performance-enhancing substances in exchange for endorsements of his nutritional supplement. Jones attorney, Joseph Burton, issued a statement saying the Chronicles story was wrong. Victor Conte is either lying or the statement was involuntarily coerced. This is a character assassination of the worst kind, Burton said. Marion has never had an endorsement deal of any kind with Victor Conte or any of his businesses, and most specifically she has never received any illegal substances from Conte in exchange for her endorsement of his products. A lawyer for Conte told the Chronicle that the lab owner denied ever providing information to federal agents about any specific athletes receiving steroids. Contes attorneys, Robert Holley and Troy Ellerman, did not immediately respond to phone and e-mail messages from the AP. Conte said in an e-mail message to the AP that he couldnt comment. Jones publicist, Lewis Kay, could not be reached for comment. Jones and Montgomery, both of whom testified last fall before a federal grand jury that indicted Conte and three other men, repeatedly have denied steroid use. All four indicted men have pleaded innocent. Jones won an unprecedented five track medals  three of them gold  at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her boyfriend, Montgomery, holds the world record of 9.78 seconds in the 100 m. A source who requested anonymity told the Chronicle that Contes statements to federal investigators came after agents raided Balco last September. Three other anonymous sources confirmed to the Chronicle the information about Jones receiving drugs from Conte. Sources told the newspaper that federal agents were told that Jones and Montgomery received a then-undetectable steroid known as the clear and a testosterone-based steroid known as the cream in exchange for endorsing a zinc- and magnesium-based, legal nutritional product called ZMA. Prosecutors have identified the clear as THG, which was unmasked last summer by anti-doping officials. Five track and field athletes and four NFL players have tested positive for THG. Jones and Montgomery were not among that group. Federal officials have refused to make public the names of athletes who allegedly received performance-enhancing drugs through BALCO. The San Jose Mercury News reported early Sunday on its web site that federal agents claimed Conte told them of 27 athletes  including Jones, Montgomery and baseball players Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield  that he allegedly supplied with steroids.

 Anju eyes podium finish in Osaka
New Delhi: World No. 7 long jumper Anju Bobby George hopes to begin her quest for Olympic glory on the right note at the Japan Grand Prix in Osaka on Saturday. Im aiming to finish in the medal bracket in Osaka but I expect a tough challenge, Anju said over phone from Bangalore before flying out to Japan with husband and coach Robert. The World Championship bronze-medallist was disappointed with her gold-winning effort of 6.66m in last months national circuit meet, her first competition this season, but is more confident of her form now. I am consistently doing 6.80 in practice, she said. The 27-year-old, who last year became the first Indian to win a medal in the world meet in Paris with a leap of 6.70, plans to compete in 10-12 events in her build-up to Athens. She has a good build-up programme and I want her to peak at the right time, Robert said. Anju will return from Japan on May 10 and her next stop would be the Super Grand Prix in Doha on May 14. June will be a busy month for Anju and Robert as they participate in four top-class meets beginning with the Milan GP on June 2. That would be followed by the Golden Spike meet in Ostrava (June 8), Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, USA (June 19) and the Norwich Union Super Grand Prix in Gateshead (June 27). In July, Anju will compete in two meets  in Madrid on July 17 and Stockholm on July 27.  (PTI)  Copyright

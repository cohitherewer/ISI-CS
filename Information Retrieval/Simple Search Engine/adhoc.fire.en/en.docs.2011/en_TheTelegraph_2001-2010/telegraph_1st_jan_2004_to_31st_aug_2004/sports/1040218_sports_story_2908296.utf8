 Pantanis mom blames death on probes
Rimini: The grief-stricken mother of Italian cycling great Marco Pantani blamed anti-doping investigations on Tuesday for driving her son to his death. An initial autopsy on Monday revealed Pantani, a former Tour de France winner, died from accumulated fluid in the brain and lungs. The 34-year-old had been at the centre of a series of legal probes into doping. They murdered him, Tonina Pantani was quoted as saying in Gazzetta dello Sport ahead of a church ceremony honouring the cyclist in his hometown of Cesenatico. The body of Pantani will be dressed in a dark blue suit and a trademark black bandana, which earned him the nickname The Pirate, news agency ANSA said, citing hospital sources. Up to 40,000 people were expected to head to the small town for his funeral on Wednesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Hoggard hattrick ruins WI
 Graham Thorpe of England after his century in Bridgetown on Friday. (AFP) Bridgetown: Matthew Hoggard claimed a hattrick to trigger yet another West Indian batting collapse as England took a big step towards securing a series-clinching win on Day 3 of the third Test on Saturday. The home team, trailing 0-2 in the four-Test series, were all out for 94 on a rain-truncated day, leaving England a victory-target of 93 with more than two days remaining. The home team resumed at 21 for one and lost opener Daren Ganga, also to Hoggard, before the Yorkshire paceman produced the one-two-three act. Hoggard dismissed Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ryna Hinds with successive deliveries with captain Brian Lara watching his teams demise from the other end. Hoggards was the 33rd hattrick in the history of Test cricket and the tenth by an Englishman. He finished with figures of four 14-4-35-4. Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff chipped in with three and two wickets, respectively. It was the home teams second total below 100 in the ongoing series, following the lowest-ever 47 they managed in the second innings of the first Test in Kingston. Lara top-scored with 33 before being caught by Michael Vaughan off Harmison. The innings lasted just 42.1 overs as England moved tantalisingly close to a first series win in the Caribbean in over three decades. Earlier, on Day 2, Graham Thorpe scored an unbeaten 119 to help England take a lead of two runs. It was a sterling effort and dashed West Indian hopes of a comeback which seemed very much possible at one stage.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

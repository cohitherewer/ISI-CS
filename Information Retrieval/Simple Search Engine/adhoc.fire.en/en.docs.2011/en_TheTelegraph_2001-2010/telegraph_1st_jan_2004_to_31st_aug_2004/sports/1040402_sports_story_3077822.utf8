(AFP) London: France failed in their bid for a world record 15th successive win when they were held to a goalless draw in the Netherlands on Wednesday, a night of 21 European friendlies. The Czech Republic also saw their proud unbeaten record stopped at 20 as Robbie Keanes injury-time goal gave Ireland a 2-1 win in Dublin. Greece, one of the outsiders for this years European championship, extended their impressive unbeaten run to 15 with a 1-0 over Switzerland in Crete. Midfielder Vassilis Tsartas got the only goal after 57 minutes to make up for having a first-half penalty saved by Jorg Stiel. Sweden also maintained their remarkable stranglehold on England as Zlatan Ibrahimovics second half goal gave them a 1-0 win in Gothenburg and stretched their unbeaten record over the English to 11 games since 1968. Among other teams fancied to do well in Euro 2004, a below-strength Italy beat hosts Portugal 2-1 in Braga, Spain had a flattering 2-0 home win over Denmark while Germany thrashed Belgium 3-0 in Cologne. The showdown in Rotterdam between two of the favourites for the summer tournament proved to be a disappointment, with neither side able to put much together in the way of attacking football. Even the introduction of in-form Arsenal striker Thierry Henry after the break failed to galvanise the European champions, who were without Zinedine Zidane, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira. Portugals build-up for the tournament they will be hosting in June and July suffered a setback when Fabrizio Miccoli scored directly from a corner to secure Italys 2-1 win in a rain-soaked match. Portugal took the lead after five minutes through Nuno Valente and then missed a succession of clear chances against a weakened Italian defence. Christian Vieri rose powerfully to head in the equaliser after 40 minutes before Miccoli squeezed in the winner at the near post. Ireland failed to qualify for Euro 2004 but showed all their traditional fighting spirit to bring the Czech Republic down to earth. The Czechs had beaten France, the Netherlands and Italy in a run of 15 wins and five draws in which they had scored 55 goals. They looked to have preserved that record when Milan Baros 81st-minute equaliser cancelled out Ian Hartes 52nd-minute free kick but Keanes opportunist late strike gave Ireland the win. England fell to their first away defeat since Eriksson took charge in 2000. His team had looked the more dangerous in the first half, twice hitting the woodwork, but were caught out by the sharp finish of Ajax Amsterdam striker Ibrahimovic early in the second. Goals in each half from Fernando Morientes and Raul gave Spain a flattering 2-0 win over a Denmark. Germany cruised to a 3-0 home win over a lacklustre Belgium. Striker Kevin Kuranyi, Dietmar Hamannand Michael Ballack were the scorers. Latvia kept up the momentum ahead of their first appearance in the finals of a major tournament with a 1-0 win in Slovenia.ulgaria twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with Russia in Sofia.

 Subhas: Savour the feeling 
	 - East Bengal coach wants code of conduct for players and power to call the shots  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick with (from left) Bhaichung Bhutia, Alvito DCunha and Cristiano Junior on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Anticipating a second successive NFL title, Subhas Bhowmick is in great mood. During a chat on the eve of East Bengals match against Indian Bank, there was more stress on how Bhowmick intends to carry on, instead of how he would tackle the Chennai outfit  a win against whom will give his team the crown. Q. What did you tell the boys? A. I told them we are all mortals and can die any day. Lets make this purple patch linger and sustain the good run for as long as we can. We are winners and winners dont lose. So savour the feeling and lets concentrate on touching the finishing line with as many wins as possible. What helped the team bounce back after the bad start (two points from the first three matches)? I wasnt worried. If you look carefully, youll see that we had got just one point from these three games (away to Salgaocar, Vasco and JCT) last season and still became champions. But the credit goes to the boys because they sacrificed a lot in order to pull things back. How would you describe the success of this team? We have been consistently raising the bar. Things have gone to such an extent that even beating Mohun Bagan after being a goal down doesnt satisfy our supporters. They want more. Therein lies the real success of this team. What are your plans? The club wants to retain me and I have placed a charter of demands before them. This includes a one-year contract with no tinkering in case the team doesnt do well. There must be a code of conduct for players with me setting the terms and conditions. I also want an air-conditioned dressing room and a Jacuzzi. There are financial demands too. I want all this to be penned in my contract and the players should all be made aware of my powers.  Copyright

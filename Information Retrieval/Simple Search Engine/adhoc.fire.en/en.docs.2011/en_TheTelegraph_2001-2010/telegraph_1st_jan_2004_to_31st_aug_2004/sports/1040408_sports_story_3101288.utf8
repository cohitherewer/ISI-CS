The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Veeru is batting like God: Sourav
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Lahore: Regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly returned on Wednesday evening and, on reaching the hotel (Pearl Continental), headed for Rahul Dravids room for an update on the latter part of the second innings at the Gaddafi. Sourav missed that, on the TV, as he was travelling (aboard PIA) from New Delhi. Its clear were struggling... Our only hope in this Test is for Veeru (Virender Sehwag) to get a double and Parthiv (Patel) a maiden hundred... Otherwise, with two days remaining... I wish Id come back in happier circumstances, Sourav told The Telegraph. He quickly added: Veeru, of course, is batting like God... Be it in Multan or here, he has been out of this world... Sourav, it may be recalled, went home last Thursday to consult specialists for the back injury during the fifth and final ODI last month. He has missed the first two Tests, but will be fit for the one in Rawalpindi (from April 13). Im on medication... Besides, Ive got to be regular with the prescribed exercises, he informed. Asked whether he had begun focussing on what is probably going to be the decider, Sourav answered: Ive definitely been thinking... I was hoping we would win this Test and, with it, the series... I would then have been somewhat relaxed (in Rawalpindi). However, thats unlikely to happen... Sourav, though, isnt unfamiliar with pressure situations.  Copyright

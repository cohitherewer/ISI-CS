				 																																	London: Wales international striker John Charles, dubbed the gentle giant by Italian fans during five prolific seasons with Juventus, died early on Saturday at the age of 72.				 																																	Charles, who had emergency heart surgery and part of his foot amputated due to serious blood circulation problems after falling ill in Milan in January, died in a Wakefield hospital.				 																																	Born in Cwmdu near Swansea on December 27, 1931, Charles scored 147 goals for Leeds United in 200 games before moving to the Turin club in 1957 for a then British record of 65,000.				 																																	He became one of the greatest players to represent Juventus, notching 93 goals in 155 matches, and also enjoyed the rare distinction of playing an entire career without being booked or sent off. Charles, tall, strong and quick, was equally formidable at centre-half or in midfield and was the first leading British player to make a lasting impression in Italy.				 																																	Marseille: World No.1 Roger Federer has pulled out of the Marseille Open next week because of injury, organisers said on Saturday.

Berlin: Arsenals Jens Lehmann has apologised to Oliver Kahn for the controversial remarks about his goalkeeping rival and said he is prepared to travel with him to the Euro 2004 finals.				 																																	Germanys reserve goalkeeper had said he was better than Kahn and criticised Kahns lifestyle. I understand that what I said can be interpreted as a moral judgement and that was certainly irresponsible. I have to apologise for that. Lehmann told Saturdays mass-circulation Bild daily. 				 																																	Amsterdam: Coach Guus Hiddink has agreed a three-year contract as coach and technical director with Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven, the club said.				 																																	An agreement between club chairman Harry van Raaij and the former Dutch and Korean national coach was over-ruled by PSVs supervisory board this month because the board wanted extra conditions such as the possibility of cancelling the contract after one year. Im pleased that the conflict inside the board of PSV has been solved, said van Raaij.

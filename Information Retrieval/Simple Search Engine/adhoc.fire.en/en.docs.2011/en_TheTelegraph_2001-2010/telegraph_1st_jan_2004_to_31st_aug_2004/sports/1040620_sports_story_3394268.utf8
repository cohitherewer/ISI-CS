 Dravid ducks opener issue
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Rahul Dravid during a press meet on Saturday Bangalore, June 19: Rahul Dravid has nothing to say on who should partner Virender Sehwag as opener in Test matches. The vice-captain simply says whoever is chosen, must enjoy the job. I wont make it a fourth different view on it. Whoever is chosen and whom the captain picks will open the batting, Dravid said on Saturday. But he must enjoy the job. I think that if anything, its very important that you enjoy what you do. Whoever the captain chooses, he should be sure that the person is keen to do the job and enjoys it. The batsman was judicious in handling questions on the wicketkeeper issue as well. What I personally believe or do not believe is not relevant here. Its important to understand that you play as a team and a team member. Sometimes, whats personally relevant does not matter. I keep saying that keeping for me is a challenge and not something that comes to me naturally. Its not something which I have done for 15 years. I just hope that Parthiv (Patel) comes along well. He has got 60s against Lee, Gillespie, Shoaib and Sami. Thats a great sign for Indian cricket. I hope he will be given the opportunities to become a full-fledged wicketkeeper-batsman that India needs, Dravid said. At the just-concluded camp, Dravid spent long hours with physical trainer Gregory Allen King and the yoga expert. He also had an extended session with Sandy Gordon. Dravid is a class act by himself. I was touched by his humility, Gordon, the psychologist from Australia, said. Dravid said the best start for the Indian team would be to win the Asia Cup and Champions Trophy prior to the home series against Australia and South Africa.  Copyright

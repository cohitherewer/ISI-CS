 Germany demolish Malta 
Berlin: Four goals from Michael Ballack helped Germany restore pride with a 7-0 demolition of Malta in a Euro 2004 warm-up in Freiburg on Thursday. Ballack, criticised for below-par performances for Bayern Munich this season, shone throughout Germanys first outing since their embarrassing 1-5 defeat by Romania last month in Bucharest. That was important, said Ballack. Jens Nowotny, Torsten Frings and Fredi Bobic also contributed goals in a convincing performance. In Tallinn, striker James McFadden helped Scotland overcome a defensive Estonia 1-0. Estonia produced very few scoring chances and only a superb performance by their goalkeeper Martin Kaalma prevented the Scots from winning by a more impressive score. In Oslo, Norway and Wales drew goalless while in Tbilisi Israel put one past Georgia.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Bhupathi-Mirnyi in final
 Mirnyi and Bhupathi beat Bjorkman and Woodbridge New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi entered their first ATP doubles final of the season after beating second seeds Jonas Bjorkman and Todd Woodbridge in the semi-finals of the Rome Masters. The third seeded Indo-Belarussian pair overcame a tough first set loss to defeat the reigning Wimbledon and US Open champions 6-7 (6-8), 6-2, 6-4 at the 2.4 million euro claycourt event on Saturday. Bhupathi and Mirnyi, whose best performance this year so far has been a semi-final appearance at the Indian Wells Masters, will play Australian duo Paul Hanley and Wayne Authurs in the final. Authurs and Hanley downed top seeds Mike Bryan and Bob Bryan of the US 6-4, 6-1 in the other semi-final. They had beaten Leander Paes and his Czech partner David Rikl 7-6 (7-6), 7-5 in the second round earlier. Bhupathi and Mirnyi defeated Frenchmen Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro 7-5, 6-3 in the quarter finals, and Switzerlands Yves Allegro and Roger Federer 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the second round after a bye in the first. Moya champion Sixth seed Carlos Moya produced a faultless display of claycourt tennis to crush Argentinas David Nalbandian 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 and win his first Rome Masters title on Sunday, adds a report from Rome. The victory laid to rest years of underachievement by the 27-year-old Spaniard in the Italian capital.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengal ready for challenge
 - NATIONAL ONE-DAYERS - Hosts set to go in with three spinners against Delhi  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bengal captain Devang Gandhi with Shib Shankar Paul at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The national one-day meet will be short on stars and glamour but not on competition as the top teams from each of the five zones get down to business in the city from Thursday. Bengal will take on Delhi at Eden Gardens while Mumbai meet Rajasthan at the Jadavpur University campus ground at Salt Lake on the opening day. Tamil Nadu, the fifth team in the fray, begin on Friday. Bengal, basking in the glory of East Zones Deodhar Trophy triumph recently, will aim to keep up the good form. The Deodhar victory will go a long way in boosting our morale in this tournament, Devang Gandhi, who had also led East Zone, said. Delhi, boasting of the likes of Akash Chopra, Gautam Gambhir, Ajay Jadeja, Mithun Minhas, Vijay Dahiya and Sarandeep Singh, will be strong contenders for the title along with Mumbai as well as the hosts. Weve played against each other quite a few times in the recent past and matches have gone down to the wire, noted Devang. The Bengal skipper felt no team could be regarded as favourites. By the way, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya was present during practice this morning. Bengal are likely to go into the match with a three-pronged spin attack  two left-armers in Anirban Chatterjee and Utpal Chatterjee, besides off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri. Shib Shankar Paul will open the attack with Ranadeb Bose. Nikhil Haldipur is likely to open the innings with Arindam Das while Deep Dasgupta will come in at No. 3 followed by Devang. Utpal will be back after giving Deodhar a skip for personal reasons. Having Utpal is always a privilege. He is a wicket-taking bowler and his experience is always valuable, said Devang. Delhi coach Madanlal believes it is a big chance for youngsters to make a mark. The players will have everything to gain. They just have to perform and excel at this stage. Delhi is led by Minhas but once he and Gambhir leave for the India A engagements after the first two matches, Jadeja will take over as captain. Madans presence has meant hard work and the players went through a tough three-hour session in the afternoon. The former India allrounders son, Kunal Lal, a left-arm pacer, is also in the squad. This, however, does not mean any extra leeway. If he performs, he plays, was Madans riposte. He doesnt think the toss will hold much significance in the context and it will boil down to getting the basics right.  TEAMS Bengal (likely): Devang Gandhi, Nikhil Haldipur, Arindam Das, Deep Dasgupta, Sanjib Sanyal, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Utpal Chatterjee, Anirban Chatterjee, Sourashish Lahiri, Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose.

Mumbai focus on spin Mumbai are also likely to go in with three spinners against Rajasthan  skipper Sairaj Bahutule, Ramesh Powar and Nilesh Kulkarni. The ground, with its sprawling lush green outfield and the swanky pavilion, has come in for a lot of praise but the newly laid wicket is keeping both sides guessing. Rajasthan skipper Gagan Khoda appeared confident. Yes, Mumbai are a strong side, and will have some advantage over us. But we are no pushovers, Khoda said.

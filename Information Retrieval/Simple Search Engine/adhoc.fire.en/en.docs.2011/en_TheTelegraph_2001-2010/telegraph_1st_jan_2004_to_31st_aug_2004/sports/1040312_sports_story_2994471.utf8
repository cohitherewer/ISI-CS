The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ashim a worry for both teams
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Coach believes Ashim will soon come out of his bad patch Calcutta: Quite a distance away from the title-race, both teams are aiming for a respectable finish in the National Football League. It may be enough motivation for the Goa debutants Haywards Sporting Club. But for a team like Mohun Bagan, to keep pushing themselves when they are not engaged in a fight for the top slot, is something hardly inspiring. But Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee tried to downplay the de-motivating factor and aimed for a return to winning ways against Haywards at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. We played well against Mahindra UnitedIf the boys can keep up the performance of the Mahindra game, it shouldnt be a worry, Mukherjee said at the end of the practice session on Thursday. But his concern and caution about the attacking qualities of the Goa outfit is understandable. As Mukherjee pointed out: Dudu (Omabgemi) and (Abdulateef) Seriki are good strikersWe have to be cautious. He felt the front-line has been playing well, but Ashim Biswas lack for goal-scoring form is bit of a worry. Hes our main strikerIts just a bad patch and Im confident he will come out of it. India coach Stephen Constantine has reportedly asked the player not to think too much about the game once he is not on field. In spite of the recent lack of form, Haywards Sporting coach Clifford Chukwuma also feels Ashim will be the man to look out for. Hes a good player, well have to keep an eye on him. But he said the current Mohun Bagan team is nowhere near the side which came back from two goals down to hold them in Goa in the first phase. The man who was instrumental in that superb comeback is not around anymore, we can play much more freely. Jose Ramirez Barreto scored two to give the city giants a face-saver in that game. Haywards Sporting will f defenders Louis Aniweta and Akshay Das (both out with double bookings). Yes, our defence is a bit of a suspectBut I hope the others will be up to their task. He informed that his team would play in the 4-4-2 formation, Dudu and Seriki playing upfront. They are playing really wellTheres no reason why they shouldnt do it tomorrow.  Copyright

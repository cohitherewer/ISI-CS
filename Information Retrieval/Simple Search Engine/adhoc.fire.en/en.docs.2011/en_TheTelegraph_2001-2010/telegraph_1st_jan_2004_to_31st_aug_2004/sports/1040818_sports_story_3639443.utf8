 A new goal for Ottey at 44
Athens: Veteran sprinter Merlene Ottey said on Tuesday she was already looking beyond the Olympics in the hope of competing at the 2006 European championships. Ottey, competing in her seventh Olympics at the age of 44 after switching allegiance from Jamaica to Slovenia, told a news conference: I got my Slovenian citizenship in 2002 and wanted to compete for them in the 2002 Europeans but I got a knee injury. So I would like to run for them in 2006. Im still enjoying it, I feel good and my curiosity keeps me going  I often ask myself how fast can Merlene Ottey run at 44? Its about performance, its about age. People have been asking me when I plan to retire since the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. I used to say maybe, now I say I dont know. Ottey said she hoped to reach the semi-finals of the 100m on Saturday. Im a complete underdog but there may be room for one surprise.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

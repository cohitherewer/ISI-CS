The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Waqar predicts a close series
			New Delhi: Waqar Younis said on Monday the Indo-Pakistan series will be close. Itll be a very close series. The ODIs will be very tight as both teams are in very good nick It can go either way. The former Pakistan captain urged the home team bowlers to get their act right. Our bowlers should tighten up their line and length as they gave the Indian batsmen too much width in Karachi. Younis added that he favoured longer terms for Pakistan captains, like it is in India and Australia. I feel the PCB should give at least three-year terms to skippers as they can settle down and knit the team to get good results, the 34-year-old said. The fast bowler, who is here as an expert commentator for a TV channel, cited the examples of Cricket Australia and BCCI to substantiate his remark. Ricky Ponting and Sourav Ganguly are showing good results after being allowed to continue at the helm for a long period. The PCB should follow this example and give Inzamam-ul Haq at least three years to prove himself. On the thrilling Karachi match, Younis said: Credit should be given to both Inzamam and Yusuf Youhana for their magnificient fightback. We lost in the end but the way the boys fought back was a very good beginning to the series. On his chances of making a comeback to the national team, Younis, said: Ill wait till the current series is completed before making any plans. Asked whether he would be interested in coaching young Pakistan fast bowlers, Younis said: Of course, Id love to pass on my experience to youngsters. I feel it is my duty to help up and coming players by sharing my experience. (PTI)  Copyright

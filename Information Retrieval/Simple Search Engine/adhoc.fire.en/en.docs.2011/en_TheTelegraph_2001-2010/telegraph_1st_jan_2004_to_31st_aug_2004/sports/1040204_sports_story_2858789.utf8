 Norman no to women in mens tourneys
 Norman says women should stay at their rightful place on their own Tour Melbourne: Australias Greg Norman has called for an end to women competing in mens golf tournaments, while world No. 3 Ernie Els also expressed reservations about the growing trend on Tuesday. Norman said women should stay in their rightful place on their own Tour. I think everyone is just jumping on the bandwagon and its got to stop, Norman told a news conference at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club, where the former world No. 1 will play in this weeks Heineken Classic. I think the situation is more of a marketing ploy than anything else, the 48-year-old two-time major winner added. If the girls come out and think they can play against the guys and fail every time, that cant be very positive. Former world No. 1 Laura Davies will become the first woman to play in an Australasian or European mens tour event when the Briton tees up for the ANZ Championship from February 12 to 15 at the Horizons Golf Resort north of Sydney. Fourteen-year-old Michelle Wie narrowly failed to become the first female to make the cut in a mens PGA Tour event at last months Hawaiian Open. Swedens Annika Sorenstam became the first woman in 58 years to play a PGA Tour Event at the Colonial in May 2003. The US-based Norman however thinks that the rightful place is that women play on their Tour and we play on ours. Els said: If theyre doing it for the publicity stunt, you know, Im not for it. If theyre doing it to prove something to themselves, I can be for it but Im not sure what the future is.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

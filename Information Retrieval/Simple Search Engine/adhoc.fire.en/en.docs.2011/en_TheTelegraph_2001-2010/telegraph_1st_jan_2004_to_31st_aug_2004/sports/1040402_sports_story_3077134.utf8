The Telegraph - Calcutta
Mindless stuff from Pakistan
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasThe Indians could not have had it any better at Multan, and, by the same token, the Pakistanis could not have had it any worse. It was a famous victory for the visitors, made all the more memorable by that triple-ton by Virender Sehwag.It was the first by any Indian, and the victory was the first by any Indian team visiting Pakistan. Great stuff, really. Well done, India!The kind of spirit and camaraderie that has been on display by the tourists is something that we generally do not associate with Indian outfits of the past, and it was no wonder that the results thus far have been different from what was achieved in the years gone by. The huddle the players form after the fall of every wicket carries a lot more weight than one expects from such things. A dejected Inzamam-ul Haq after Pakistans loss on ThursdayIt is, for sure, way beyond mere symbolism. Everyone in the unit appears to take a lot more pleasure in the success of his colleagues than in his own. It is a great sight to behold on a cricketing field.While performances came from everyone, if I had to pick one, I would definitely rate that of Sachin Tendulkar ahead of Sehwags. It was clearly Tendulkar who egged on Sehwag to keep concentrating. He was the one who guided Sehwag to what remains uncharted territory to even his own self. His commitment to ensure the execution of team strategy on the field was visible in the rather understated innings that he played. Add to it his wonders with the ball, and you have your true champion.It was a pity that he could not get his double century and there would be many who would try to read a few things in Dravids decision to declare when Tendulkar was just six short of what would have been a richly-deserved double century. But, to me, the decision was yet another display of the spirit of New India that I have noticed in the current lot.As for Pakistan, nothing worked, and nothing worked because apparently nothing was planned. I wrote before the match that there seemed to be some confusion in the Pakistan ranks regarding team composition, and when the match started it was nothing but confusion.Leave aside the controversy surrounding the wicket, but whatever it was like, the nature of it was known to the team management and they said it in as many words in their pre-match media interactions. Yet, they chose to go into the match with four pacers and just one spinner, who was required to turn his arm over before lunch on the first day!By dropping Sehwag four times  and dont forget the missed run-out chance by Razzaq  Pakistanis only added to their troubles, and compounded them further with their inept bat-ting.It is really difficult to explain why Pakistani bowlers struggled so much when Pathan, Balaji and company could still have the ball wobbling about later in the match. And if Tendulkar could grind his way, what was there to stop Inzamam and company from doing the same.And how would you explain the dismissals of Moin Khan on the last ball of the third day, of Saqlain in the first innings, and that pointless run-out of Inzamam in the second? It was all mindless stuff. It is clear that the team management failed to devise any strategy, and whatever there may have been, the players failed to execute it. The result was beyond doubt after the first four sessions in the game, with all Pakistani hopes from thereon resting on some miracle that never happened.Pakistanis didnt deserve it either. Copyright

 Gilchrist fined
 Adam Gilchrists reaction after umpire Peter Manuel ruled Andrew Symonds out in Dambulla on Sunday Colombo: Australias vice-captain Adam Gilchrist was fined half his match fee on Tuesday after being found guilty of dissent over an incident during the one-day match against Sri Lanka at the weekend. But Andrew Symonds, the batsman at the centre of the controversy, was found not guilty by ICC Match Referee Mike Procter and escaped any punishment. I find Gilchrist guilty, but in the case of Symonds, it was more a case of disappointment than dissent and I find him not guilty, Procter told reporters after a hearing with both players. Symonds, given out leg-before during Sundays second one-dayer in Dambulla by umpire Peter Manuel, protested the call, saying the ball had struck his bat before hitting his pad. Manuel consulted with fellow umpire Billy Bowden of New Zealand, withdrew his appeal and called Symonds back to the crease. Television replays show a furious Gilchrist shouting at Manuel when he raised his finger to signal Symonds dismissal. And Symonds also loudly questioned the Sri Lankan umpires decision before trudging back towards the pavilion. Symonds had almost reached the boundary rope when his teammates realised the umpire had called the batsman back and yelled at him to turn around. According to the rules, Symonds would not have been given a second life at the crease if he had crossed the boundary line. It is an unusual incident and something I took into account, Procter said. It is the third time Gilchrist has been found guilty of dissent following incidents against India in a one-day match in Bangalore in 2001 and in the fifth Ashes Test against England in Sydney last year where he was reprimanded after swearing when an appeal was turned down. Procter said Gilchrist twice spoke to Manuel saying what is going on here and then threw down his batting gloves. It didnt come across very well on television, Procter said. Gilchrists defence was that he was showing his emotions, he is a very emotional guy. I think it is tough on him as hes a very fair cricketer but in my opinion he was showing dissent.

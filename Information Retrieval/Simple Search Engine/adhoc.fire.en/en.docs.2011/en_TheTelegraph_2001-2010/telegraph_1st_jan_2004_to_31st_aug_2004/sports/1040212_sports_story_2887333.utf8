The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea await new upheaval
 Claudio Ranieris days as coach may be numbered London: With a Russian owner, an American chairman, a self-confessed Manchester United fan for a chief executive and a dozen new players, Premier League side Chelsea have been transformed in half a season. While the team was grinding out a 1-0 win against London neighbours Charlton Athletic at the weekend, employees from doorman to coach were wondering what new upheavals lay ahead in Roman Abramovichs brave new Stamford Bridge world. Chief executive Peter Kenyon has already caused ructions after a week in charge. In several interviews his endorsement of Claudio Ranieri has been lukewarm, leading to speculation about when the genial coach might have to leave. Kenyons arrival has also put paid to a club institution. Former chairman Ken Bates choleric column in the programme was axed on Sunday after 22 years. (New chairman) Bruce Buck told me Peter Kenyon would be doing a profile piece and it would be better if I didnt do my notes. I told him he could shove it and I wouldnt be doing them again, newspapers quoted Bates as saying. The irascible Bates, who bought the ailing club for  1 in 1982, took the team back into the top flight and invested heavily in the south-west London stadium. Under Bates and benefactor Matthew Harding, Chelsea pioneered the importation of foreign talent. Chelsea began to flex their muscles when Harding, who later died in a helicopter crash, joined the board in the early 1990s. Dutch coach Ruud Gullit, a former World Footballer of the Year, brought Chelsea their first honour for 26 years when they lifted the FA Cup in 1997. He attracted top Italians Gianluca Vialli, Gianfranco Zola and Roberto Di Matteo to the club, which recaptured some of the swagger and style it had enjoyed 30 years earlier. Vialli replaced Gullit as coach in 1998 and guided the team to victories in the English League Cup and European Cup Winners Cup over the next three months. A second FA Cup success followed in 2000. When Abramovich arrived last July he paid off  80 million ($149.7 million) of debt, bought up  60 million of shares, including Bates 17 million worth, and allowed Ranieri to spend more than  100 million on new players. Kenyon feels Chelsea, whose only league title came in 1955, have under-achieved. While we are prepared to invest we also want over a period of time to get a return for that investment, Kenyon said. All of which leaves Ranieri, a Bates recruit in 2000, in a tight spot. (Reuters)  Copyright

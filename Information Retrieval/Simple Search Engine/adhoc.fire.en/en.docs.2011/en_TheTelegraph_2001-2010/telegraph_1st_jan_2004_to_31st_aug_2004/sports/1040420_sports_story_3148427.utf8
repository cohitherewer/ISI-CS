 Read sees England through
 Darren Gough and Marcus Trescothick celebrate the dismissal of Chris Gayle in Bourda on Sunday. (Reuters) Georgetown: Wicketkeeper Chris Read was Englands saviour on Sunday as his three late sixes helped the tourists beat West Indies by two wickets in a thrilling opening to the seven-match ODI series. In a match reduced to 30 overs per side due to heavy rain in the run-up to the game, Read smashed 27 off 15 balls before Darren Gough hit the winning runs to see England to their target of 157 with three balls to spare. Chasing West Indies total of 156 for five, England looked out of it as they slipped from 60 for two to 120 for seven. But Read, dropped from the Test side ahead of the final match in Antigua, responded in style as he smashed three sixes and a four before Gough saw England home. Gough, recalled to the side, showed few signs of rust with a tight opening spell and made the early breakthrough, bowling Chris Gayle for two with just seven runs on the board.  But while others struggled, Chanderpaul, recalled to the side after missing the final Test, hit 11 fours and two sixes, including 17 off Paul Collingwoods only over, before he was fifth man out for 84. In reply, England made a terrible start when Vaughan was bowled by Mervyn Dillon for a third-ball duck. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss added 59 for the second wicket before Strauss was bowled by Dwayne Bravo for 29, giving the debutant his first wicket.  Blackwell was bowled by Ravi Rampaul for 27 and Clarke was run out for one before Reads heroics lifted England to the verge of victory.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 IFA to review Bhowmick suspension
 - Function at Salt Lake Stadium on East Bengals NFL match-eve deferred  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick will be asked to appear before the IFA governing body Calcutta: There may still be an amicable end to the IFA-Subhas Bhowmick saga. The state body had suspended the East Bengal coach for two years (ban to be in effect from May 16) for making derogatory remarks against the association. Following an appeal from the club to reconsider the decision, the IFA office-bearers on Tuesday announced that the issue will be referred to the governing body. Now, that doesnt say much, since this practice of referring an appeal to the same governing body, which endorsed the penalty, is not out of place. Somehow, signs of truce between the two sides have been noticed. The IFA is extending all organisational help to the club to host the February 25 AFC Cup match against Negri Sembilan of Malaysia without demanding a share of the profit. That is exactly how the relation between the parent body and its affiliated unit should be. The parent has to be strict when required and stand by the club when it needs help, said IFA secretary Subrata Dutta. The club has appealed that considering Bhowmicks success and contribution, the penalty against him be reviewed. We have agreed. The governing body will meet in 10-12 days. May just be an indication here that the ice is melting. It was also learnt that the IFA will present another chance to Bhowmick and East Bengal to appear before the governing body or its disciplinary committee to explain their stand. A satisfactory answer may well cause some change in what had for long been a story of two sides confronting each other, unwilling to compromise. It all depends on how they defend themselves, said a top IFA official. In a separate development, it has been learnt that the state government will defer a function slated for Salt Lake Stadium on February 28  a day before East Bengals NFL clash against Salgaocar. East Bengal had requested for a change in venue and state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Tuesday football will get the priority if the game and cultural programmes come in the way of each other. Bhowmick has looked least concerned about the tussle with IFA ever since the club took up the issue on his behalf. He is counting the positives his team has got during the month-long break in the NFL. And to his own admission, there have been a few. This gap helped us a lot in terms of recovery. We took a good look at the diet and training schedule and the rest was also valuable. And the away win against Singapores Geylang United should be a big boost to our confidence. Barring the odd injury problem, we are in good shape, Bhowmick said. Are things looking good again in East Bengal after the mid-season slump, which followed the bright start? Bhowmick is keeping fingers crossed.  Copyright

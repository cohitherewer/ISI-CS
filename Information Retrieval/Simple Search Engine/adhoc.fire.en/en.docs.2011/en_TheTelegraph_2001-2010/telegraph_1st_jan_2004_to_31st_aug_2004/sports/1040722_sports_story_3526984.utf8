The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Comeback show satisfies Harbhajan
	 - Id have been happier had I got a couple of wickets  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Colombo: Seven months and two days after his right index finger was operated upon in Melbourne, Harbhajan Singh returned to big league action, at the SSC on Wednesday. And, after conceding just 20 runs (to Bangladesh) in ten overs, remarked he was satisfied. For the first few moments, it did seem I was starting my career all over again... Lekin, main khush hoon... Of course, I would have been happier had I managed a couple of wickets, but 20 off ten isnt bad in a ODI... Im satisfied, he told The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra. The off-spinner was utilised in two spells, with the opening one being of eight overs. Speaking after an extended pool-session, Harbhajan added: I think the ball came out of the hand rather well and, except one delivery (the last of the first over, which went for six), I got things right... Now, its a question of getting more confident. Harbhahan, though, didnt get much time to prepare himself mentally. Its in the morning that I was informed Anilbhai (Kumble) is going to be rested and I would make the XI... But theek hai, at this level, one should always be ready for opportunities. Much has been made of the magic ball he is working on, but Harbhajan clarified he wont rush: Sab time pe ho ga... When Im hundred per cent sure of getting what I want... While Harbhajans tidy comeback may complicate matters if only one spinner is to be played versus Pakistan on Sunday, captain Sourav Ganguly is, for now, quite happy. Bhajji bowled very well... Its expected of a world-class performer like him. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore too felt Harbhajans return was on expected lines.  Copyright

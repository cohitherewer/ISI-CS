 Spain need surgery on squad 
 Raul brought his poor domestic form and fired blanks Lisbon: Deja vu struck again with a vengeance at Euro 2004 for Spain, one of the big five nations who failed to set the tournament alight. Inaki Saezs team arrived in neighbouring Portugal determined to shrug off their perennial underachievers tag and show that their failure to qualify without the need for the playoffs was a fluke. In the qualifiers the Spaniards had been cruising, aided by an early away win in Greece, until they inexplicably lost their return match against the same opponents, who, thus buoyed, went on to win the group and forced Saez and company to edge aside Norway in the playoff. Fated to meet the Greeks again in the opening phase, Spain licked their lips with an impending thirst for revenge. And completely fluffed their lines. A solitary goal success over Russia looked par for the course but, with a game to come against the hosts  against whom they had never lost a competitive match  Spain knew a win over the Greeks would give them a watertight insurance policy. Instead, despite dominating the match, Spain were unable to convert their chances with Real Madrid striker and record goalscorer for his country Raul bringing his poor domestic form into the championships, failing to score in three outings. As with his clubmate David Beckham, Raul, in front of goal usually unstoppable, was regarded as undroppable. Invited by a nation to think the unthinkable and give greater scope to Atletico Madrid youngster Fernando Torres in the Spanish attack, Saez, whose record at international level with lower age groups is almost unmatched anywhere, persisted with his man. The result was an attack which failed to get anywhere near top gear as Reals Fernando Morientes, coming off a superb season on loan to Champions League finalists Monaco, also repeatedly fired blanks, his goal in the draw with Greece aside. Against the Portuguese, with four points already on the board despite the frustration emanating from the renewed acquaintance with the Greeks, the Spanish ship looked set fair for a safe arrival in the quarter-final port. All they had to do was not lose to a side who could not even take one point from the Greeks. Instead, Nuno Gomes plunged the dagger home with the only goal to prompt massive celebrations in red and green. Spanish red and yellow was packed away as in an instant once Saezs armada hit the rocks and sank without trace, memories of the countrys sole major triumph in 1964 an almost forgotten memory as the Greeks moved through on the basis of goals scored. A forlorn trail of vehicles headed back across the border while Saez ruminated on his future upon his return to Madrid. Step forward the veteran Luis Aragones, who now has to perform surgery on the squad in time for the World Cup in Germany in two years time. In the face of such repeated failure the solution does not appear to lie in the hands of an individual. (AFP)  Copyright

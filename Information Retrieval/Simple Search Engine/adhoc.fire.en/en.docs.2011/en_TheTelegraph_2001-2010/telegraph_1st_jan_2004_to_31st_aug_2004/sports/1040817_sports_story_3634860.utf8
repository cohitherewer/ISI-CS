 Fischer plans to tie the knot
Tokyo: Former world chess champion Bobby Fischer, detained in Japan and wanted in the US, plans to marry his longtime supporter and friend, who happens to be the head of the Japan Chess Association (JCA), Fischers lawyer said on Monday. Fischer has also appealed to US secretary of state Colin Powell and the US embassy in Tokyo to accept the renunciation of his US citizenship, Masako Suzuki said in a statement. Mr Fischer and Ms Miyoko Watai, acting president of the JCA, have been living together since 2000 and are in a state of common-law marriage. They have decided to take steps to legally marry, said the statement. The couple has already signed the documents necessary to marry, and they would submit them to the authorities as early as Monday, Suzuki said. (AFP)  Copyright

 Sautin happy with 7 medals
Athens: Dmitry Sautin, the great warrior of diving, is weary and after winning a record seventh Olympic medal he reckons that Athens may prove to be his final Games. The 30-year-old Russian battled once more after a year bedevilled by injury and came away with his third 3m springboard bronze in four Olympics. For many a long year having offered almost lone defiance to the dominant Chinese, Sautin for many is simply The Man. His Olympic battle honours also include platform gold in 1996 and bronze in 2000 plus synchronised highboard gold and synchronised springboard silver. This is my seventh Olympic medal. I think that for a career, thats not bad.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

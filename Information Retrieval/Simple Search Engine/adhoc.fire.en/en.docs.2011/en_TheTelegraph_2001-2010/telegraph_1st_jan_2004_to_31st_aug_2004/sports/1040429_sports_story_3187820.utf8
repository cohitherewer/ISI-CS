				 Check your backlift while facing yorkers																										I am a right-arm medium pacer. Whenever I try yorkers, I end up bowling full tosses or the batsman picks it up early. Why does this happen?																										(Mohsin Khan, 19, Ranchi-4)																										Its a delivery that demands a lot of practice. A very still head at the point of delivery is also essential and try and target a spot  the base of the stump or the middle  that suits you right. 																										I am an off-spinner. How does one bowl the wrong one? Are straighters and wrong ones the same type of deliveries?																										(Charan Kamal, 13, Jamshedpur)																										No. The straighter is one that doesnt turn and goes straight. The wrong one is usually bowled by the leg spinner and is more like a googly. It spins from off to leg for a righthander.																										I am an opener and often get out to outswingers. Please help.																										(Tapas Das, 14, Calcutta-14)																										You are not watching the ball closely. Also check your footwork. Get as close to the line of the ball as possible. Youre also playing away from the body.																										I am a medium pacer. Whenever I try to increase my pace, I end up bowling a wide or full toss. Please help.																										(Ankit Saraf, 12, Calcutta-55)																										Youre not balanced at the point of delivery and your head is moving all over the place.																										I am a righthanded batsman. Whenever I face yorkers, I miss or get bowled. Please advise.																										(N. Sunil Kumar, 14, Ghatsila; Dipul Saikia, 30, Jorhat)																										Check your backlift and dont try and hit the ball too hard.																										I am a righthander and often get out after crossing 50 to slower deliveries. Why does this happen?																										(Vikram Ranjan, 14, Deoghar)																										This is mainly because youre losing concentration and not watching the ball closely coming out of the bowlers hand. You also tend to relax after crossing fifty.																										I am a righthander and often misjudge the length when attempting the sweep. What should be the ideal length for the sweep?																										(Abhijit Medhi, 14, Tezpur-1)																										When you stretch your front pad, the ball should be close enough to the front pad to sweep on length. If the ball is of a fuller length, then use the angle and pace of the bowler.																										I often get hit on the body when attempting the hook against short-pitched deliveries. Please help.																										(Dhiman Chatterjee, 20, Hooghly)																										First check your footwork with your backfoot. Youve got to use the depth of the crease when moving back and across. Its also important to pick the right length.																										I fail to keep the ball down whenever I attempt the drive. I have tried to get as close to the pitch of the ball as possible when attempting the shot, but there hasnt been any improvement. Please help.																										(Subir Nath, 17, Calcutta-16)																										The problem is with your head. Youre lifting your head at the time of contact. You could also be getting too much of bottomhand into play.																										What is the difference between a flipper and a googly?																										(Raman Seth, 19, Howrah)																										A googly is one that spins in from outside off-stump into the righthander. A flipper is the one that pitches just short of length and skids through straight. The delivery is well disguised and quicker off the pitch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt ready to prove Big W point
 - I feel Im hitting the ball well and am confident in my own game  Lleyton Hewitt is still up there with the best, feels Andy Roddick London: Lleyton Hewitt walks on to the hallowed Wimbledon lawns later this month with a point to prove. Twelve months ago he had entered the worlds greatest grasscourt tournament with his head held high, ready to begin the defence of his mens singles title in the traditional opening match on Centre Court. The champions stay, however, lasted only two hours 24 minutes. In one of the biggest shocks in tennis history, little-known Croatian Ivo Karlovic ripped the Wimbledon trophy out of Hewitts hands in the first round, leaving the shattered Australian to make a hasty exit from the All England Club. Hewitt became the first Wimbledon mens champion to stumble at the first hurdle since the sport turned professional in 1968. Obviously it was a disappointment sitting out those two weeks but the good thing in tennis is that youve always got a big event to look forward to and I focused on the hardcourt season after that, Hewitt said at Londons Queens Club on Saturday. (But) I feel Im hitting the ball well and am confident in my own game. Its been good preparation for me before a Grand Slam, the Australian, added referring his progress to the last four of the Stella Artois Championships. Hewitt had started 2003 as the world number one and with the Wimbledon title in his possession. By the end of the year, he was neither a Grand Slam champion nor a member of the ATPs top 10, finishing ranked 17th. While Hewitt decided to dedicate himself to Australias Davis Cup cause by curtailing his schedule on the ATP tour, players such as Roger Federer and Andy Roddick took over, winning three Grand Slam titles between them in the space of seven months. Roddick, however, is under no illusion about Hewitts chances of claiming a second Wimbledon crown come July 4. The only reason Lleyton isnt at the top because hes been more selective with what events he plays. Hes sure up there with the best, Roddick said after beating Hewitt 7-6, 6-3 in the Stella Artois semis. With his 2003 Wimbledon humiliation now just a distant memory, Hewitt is determined to prove that he can once again capture the major titles. Grand Slams are always tough to win as youve got be on top of your game for seven five-set matches, the 23-year-old said. Hopefully I can keep improving and sharpening up my game and be ready Monday week.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Sindelar ends long wait
 - CHARLOTTE MEET 
- Late charge helps Woods finish joint third  Joey Sindelar admires his trophy after winning the Wachovia Championship at the Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Sunday. (Reuters) Charlotte: Joey Sindelar captured his first PGA Tour title in 14 years when he parred the second play-off hole to win the $5.6 million Wachovia Championship on Sunday. Sindelar, who closed with a three-under 69 to finish on 11-under 277 at the Quail Hollow Golf Club, earned a first prize of $1,008,000  more money than he has won in any of his 20 seasons on Tour. Arron Oberholser, playing two groups behind in the final pairing of the day, carded an even-par 72 to join Sindelar in the play-off. World No. 1 Tiger Woods made a run at the title but his four-under 68 for 278 earned him a tie for third place with Paraguays Carlos Franco. US Masters champion Phil Mickelson finished joint fifth on 279 with Steve Flesch, Notah Begay III and Jeff Maggert. Swedens Mathias Gronberg was ninth on 280. Sindelar, whose previous best finish this year was a tie for 30th at the Buick Invitational, said he had kept his nose to the grindstone for the last 14 years. Work, work, work, the 46-year-old said. You keep hitting your head against the wall hoping it will break one day instead of your head. I never, ever gave up hope. Sometimes it hurt bad. It will take a while to understand this is real. Oberholser, who began the day with a one-shot lead over Begay and Australias Geoff Ogilvy, eagled the par-five 15th hole to go two strokes clear. But the 29-year-old American, playing in his 38th Tour event, hit his drive into the trees on the 16th and made a bogey. Nursing a one-shot lead at the par-three 17th, Oberholser knocked his tee shot within inches of the water to the left of the green and made another bogey, dropping into a tie with Sindelar, who had birdied the 16th. Sindelar and Oberholser parred the 18th in regulation play and again on the first sudden-death hole. The two players each drove into the fairway at the 16th and Sindelar struck his approach to 35 feet from the pin while Oberholser found the bunker and took three shots to get down. Sindelar lagged his first putt to two feet and converted the par to claim his seventh career title, and his first since the 1990 Hardees Golf Classic. This was the second time this season that Oberholser had failed to win after holding or sharing the 54-hole lead. Im a little disappointed but everything that I set out to do today I did, Oberholser said. I guess Im happy for myself, playing in the final group on a, in my opinion, a Major championship-calibre golf course and hanging in there for 18 holes. Im very happy. It really proves to me that I belong out here, that I can win out here. In the future, I will be contending for Majors, as well, as long as I stay focussed on the process, which is what I did well today.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

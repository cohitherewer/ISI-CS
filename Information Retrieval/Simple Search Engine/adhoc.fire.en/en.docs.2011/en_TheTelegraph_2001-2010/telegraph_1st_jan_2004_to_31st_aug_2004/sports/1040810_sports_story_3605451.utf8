 Jones warms up in style
 Marion Jones in action during the 4x100m at the Team Challenge between Germany, France and US in Munich on Sunday Munich: Embattled triple Olympic gold medallist Marion Jones won the long jump and helped the United States sprint relay quartet to victory in a pre-Olympics international match here. Competing for the first time since the US trials three weeks ago, Jones produced a jump of 6.82m on Sunday in the event she has been selected to contest in Athens, although she could not score points in the USA versus France versus Germany match as she was competing as a guest. Her fellow American Grace Upshaw was the official winner with 6.74m. Jones jumped 7.11m to win the US trials last month. She then ran the second leg as the US team won the 4x100m relay in a time of 41.67 seconds ahead of reigning world champions France who fielded a reserve team. Jones looks set to compete in the long jump and possibly the relay in Athens despite facing accusations that she bought steroids and other drugs from the California-based BALCO Laboratories, although she has never tested positive for a banned substance. Ironically she could still be handed a chance to defend her Olympic 100m title because her American teammate Torri Edwards is set to be banned for two years for a doping offence, freeing up a spot. Gail Devers finished fourth in the event at the US trials, but if as expected she opts to concentrate on winning an elusive Olympic sprint hurdles title then Jones, who was fifth, may be selected.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB face Mahindra test
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal players during a practice session on Thursday, the eve of their National League match against Mahindra United Calcutta: There is an aura of invincibility around East Bengal these days. The way they mastered teams from Singapore and Malaysia, followed by their comprehensive win over Salgaocar the other day makes them the team to beat. Subhas Bhowmicks men will kick off their National Football League (NFL) match against the in-form Mahindra United with quite a few worries, but that still wont make the frontrunners the underdogs. Dipak Mondal, one of the pillars of the East Bengal defence, will have to sit out Fridays game after being red-carded in the Salgaocar game. Subhas Chakraborty, a livewire in the midfield, is also unavailable after picking up an injury in practice. Goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee is a doubtful starter, while Sasthi Duley and Debjit Ghosh stay out for at least one more game. Even without five first XI players, the East Bengal line-up wears a settled look, such is the teams bench strength. Sandip Nandy, S. Malsawmtluanga, Bijen Singh are eager to play their respective roles, while Alvito DCunha and Douglas da Silva are fit to don the mantle once more. Though Bhowmick didnt divulge the team, he will surely be toying with the idea of playing Douglas in the heart of defence, as a cover for Mondal.  Bhowmick would no doubt have told his boys to keep an eye on S. Venkatesh, Abhisek Yadav and Ghanaian Odartey Lawson. The Federation Cup champions did taper down after a rollicking start to the season, but have regained form in the past few weeks beating Dhofar FC in the AFC Cup first round.Twenty-three points from 13 matches keeps them within striking distance of the top position (East Bengal have 24 from 12 games). I am focussing on my team playing to its potential. If we can do that, we can trouble any team, Mahindra coach David Booth said.  Copyright

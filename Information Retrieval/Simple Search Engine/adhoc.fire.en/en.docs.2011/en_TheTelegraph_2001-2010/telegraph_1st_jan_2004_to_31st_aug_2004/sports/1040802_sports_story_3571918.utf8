 Federer-Roddick clash
Toronto: Roger Federer and Andy Roddick stormed into a re-run of last months Wimbledon title match, each blowing past opponents to set up a grudge-match final at the 2.5-million-dollar Masters Series. Federer, current king of the game who has won his last nine finals, 22 matches in a row and past three tournaments, did his part with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Swede Thomas Johansson. Roddick, runner-up to the Swiss at the All England Club a month ago, followed on as he polished a 3-0 career mark against German grinder Nicolas Kiefer, winning their semi-final 7-5, 6-3. It was the second meeting between that pair on Saturday after Roddick lifted the Indianapolis Trophy last weekend over the 25th-ranked Kiefer. Victory in one hour, 22 minutes was the longest of the week for Roddick and gave the defending champion a third victory against Kiefer. Im excited to be through in final, said Roddick, winner of 18 straight on cement. I cant wait to get out there tomorrow. It should be a great match, Roger and I look forward to playing each other we bring out the best in each other  and I owe him one from Wimbledon. The 21-year-old American, who is bidding to duplicate a torrid summer, 2003 run which led to four titles including the US Open, won his 38th match of the season on his preferred hardcourt surface, improving to 19-2 in Canada. Kiefer put up a fight in the first set, forcing Roddick to save three break points in the fifth game. The German salvaged two set points in the tenth game, levelling for 5-all before Roddick pounced. Two games later, the American put Kiefer into a 0-30 hole, then managed to more set-winning chances. The German saved the first but netted a forehand to lose it. The tide turned in the second set with Roddick running off with through a break in the sixth game. Top seed Federer, is now a win away from claiming four trophies in succession.  (AFP)  Copyright

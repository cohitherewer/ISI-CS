The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Capriati all for a family affair
Paris: If the Williams sisters asked Jennifer Capriati for advice on hiring a parent coach, she would tell it to them straight. If your parents love you, theyll be very supportive, said Capriati, who trained her whole career with her father until recently hiring Heinz Gunthardt, a former coach of Steffi Graf. I would just say, go for it Capriati said. At least you know, youve tried everything. Some critics have suggested in the past that the Williams sisters, who are coached by their divorced parents, seek outside guidance. I think theyre doing all right where they are now, Capriati said about Serena and Venus, both of whom advanced to the fourth round. Haute cuisine  Craving a gourmet fix at the French Open? Fear not, a team from Alain Ducasse is running the kitchen. Return visitors to the tournament might notice that the main food court has been renovated, decorated with baskets of white asparagus and fresh figs like an outdoor market in Provence. Theres also tastier fare at slightly higher prices. The idea was to give the mass public a little something special, said Bruno Caironi, the executive chef at Alain Ducasses cooking school, who was hired to impart his gastronomic savoir-faire. Ducasse is the worlds only chef with a total of eight coveted Michelin stars. Lovers of hot dogs and other ballpark fare might be disappointed. The basics have been replaced by roquette salads, shrimp or plump chicken kebabs grilled up fresh, and specialties like pissaladiere, a pizza-like onion tart typical of the south of France. The Open in Arabic Tucked amid the souvenir and food stalls at Roland Garros is a booth promoting Al-Jazeeras new sports channel, which is beaming the French Open in Arabic for the first time across the middle east and North Africa. A division of Al-Jazeera news, the sports channel was launched late last year and has exclusive rights to several major international events including the French Open, which is its first Grand Slam, said Einat Yogev, a spokeswoman. It also has rights to next years Australian Open. Its information booth on the tournament grounds has drawn mixed reactions. Everybody finds it very interesting and wants to know how come Al-Jazeera is here at Roland Garros, Yogev said. She said many people have voiced encouragement for the Arab satellite networks efforts to edge into a market dominated by English-language stations. Some tennis fans were sceptical. For a lot of people, Al-Jazeera is the Bin Laden channel. Theyre surprised to see us, said Yogev. The network has repeatedly broadcast videotapes purportedly from Al-Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden.

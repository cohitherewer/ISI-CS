 Kiris warning for Parthiv
Bangalore: Parthiv Patel has to be consistent to retain his place in the national team, selection committee chairman Syed Kirmani said on Tuesday. Parthiv has shown his talent in Pakistan and Australia. But there are other wicketkeepers who are competing very well like Dinesh Karthik and Vinay Uthappa, Kirmani said. There are wicketkeepers from other zones who are also in the fray, he said. One has to be very, very consistent and should not take his place in the team for granted. On Rahul Dravid doubling up as wicketkeeper in ODIs, Kirmani said: I wouldnt like to see him as the wicketkeeper. (PTI)  Copyright

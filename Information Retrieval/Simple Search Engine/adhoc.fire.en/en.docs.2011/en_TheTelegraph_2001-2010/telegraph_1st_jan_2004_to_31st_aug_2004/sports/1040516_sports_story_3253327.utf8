The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jyoti, Jeev tied at 11th
Shanghai, May 15 (AFP): Australian legend Greg Norman was disqualified from the BMW Asian Open Saturday even as Englands Simon Dyson put the trophy in sight with a sizzling 66 to open up a six-shot lead going into the final round. Dyson is six clear of Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thailands Prayad Marksaeng, in with a 67. Indias Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh were tied 11th on 212 with Taiwans Chen Yuan Chi and Marcus, 11 strokes behind the leader. Jyoti carded a 68 while Jeev returned 70. Norman signed for a 71 which would have placed him joint eighth and nine shots behind Dyson, but was disqualified after reviewing television footage of an incident at the par-three 17th.  Copyright

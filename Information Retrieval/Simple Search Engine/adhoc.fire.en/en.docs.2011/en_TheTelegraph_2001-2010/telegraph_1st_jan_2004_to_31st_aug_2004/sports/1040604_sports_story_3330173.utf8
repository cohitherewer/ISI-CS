 Pakistan drop Shoaib Akhtar
 - ASIA CUP - We must allow him to be fully fit, says chief selector Wasim Bari Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar has been ruled out of next months Asia Cup by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). We have received directives from the PCB that Shoaib should not be considered for the Asia Cup to allow him to recover from his rib-cage stress fracture injury, chief selector Wasim Bari said on Thursday. The Asia Cup will be held in Sri Lanka from July 16 after a gap of four years. Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and two qualifiers Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates have confirmed they will play. Australians waited for Glenn McGrath for eight months to get fit for international cricket and we must allow Shoaib to be fully fit, Bari added. Shoaib, 28, who has been playing in England for Durham, has been carrying the injury since Pakistan lost the third and final Test to India in Rawalpindi in April. But the speedster was in good form in a one-dayer against Derbyshire on Monday when he returned to action after missing Durhams previous two games. He took four for 15 in nine overs, helping dismiss the visitors for 82 on the way to an easy seven-wicket victory. Bari said the other Pakistan players appearing in County cricket had all been advised to report for a training camp from June 20 in Lahore. Shoaib said he was disappointed he would not feature in the Asia Cup. I want to play more and more for Pakistan but since I am not fully fit I would not take a risk and would better come after attaining full fitness, Shoaib said from England. Meanwhile, captain Inzamam-ul Haq, coach Javed Miandad and manager Haroon Rashid have submitted a paper to the PCB outlining steps that need to be taken to prepare the team for important upcoming tournaments. One of the suggestions is that the PCB should identify a pool of players from which teams could be picked for meets like the Asia Cup in July and Champions Trophy in September. They said Inzamam, Miandad and Haroon had all suggested that the selectors announce a shortlist of players who can be considered for all three tournaments. In this regard they have also suggested to the board to keep the visas ready of the shortlisted probables for all three tournaments. The team management has also written that Shoaib should only be considered for selection if it is certain he is 100 per cent fit.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

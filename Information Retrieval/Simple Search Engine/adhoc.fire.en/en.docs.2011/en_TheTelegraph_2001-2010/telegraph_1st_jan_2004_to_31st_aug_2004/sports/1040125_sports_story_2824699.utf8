The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand loses to Topalov
 - Super GM lead now halved  Anand lost in 44 moves  Wijk aan Zee, Jan. 24 (PTI): Defending champion Viswanathan  Anand suffered a shocking loss at the hands of Veselin Topalov  of Bulgaria in the 12th round of the Corus chess meet. Despite the loss, Anand (8 points)  who had a one-point lead going into this round  maintained a slender half point lead over nearest contender GM Peter Leko of Hungary. The penultimate round was in fact topsy-turvy in more ways than one as the biggest upset of the tournament also came in this round. Dutchman Ivan Sokolov, who had not won a game so far, accounted for top-seeded and BrainGames champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia.  Though he has been in tremendous form so far in this category 19 event, Anand could not really match Topalov who has thus far had mixed results here. Playing black, Anand just needed a draw to ensure himself the title as he plays white against tail-ender Ivan Sokolov in the final round game on Sunday.  However, as things turned out, the Indian star was  denied the needful by a resurgent Topalov, who put up a  tremendous effort to beat the man in form in 44 moves.  Copyright

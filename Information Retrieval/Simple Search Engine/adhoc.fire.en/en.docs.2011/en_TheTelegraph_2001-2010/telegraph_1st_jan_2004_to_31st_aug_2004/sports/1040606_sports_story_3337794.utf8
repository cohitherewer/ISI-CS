 Beckham in minor cyst problem
Manchester, June 5 (AFP): England skipper David Beckham was to make a hospital visit to have an injection to remove a cyst from his back. The procedure, described as routine by an FA spokesman, was to be carried out at a hospital here after Beckham had played the first 45 minutes of Englands final Euro 2004 friendly vs Iceland. In the match Wayne Rooney ensured a brilliant 6-1 win for England, having scored twice. Beckham will not be able to train for two days after the operation but he will not miss any session with England as they are not due to train again until Tuesday, a day after their arrival in Portugal. David needs to have an injection into the bursa (small cyst) at this juncture to give him the two clear days required for him to be able to train Tuesday, the spokesman said.  Copyright

 Utpal, Kiran keep East hopes alive
 - North not comfortable despite Yuvrajs 2nd ton  Utpal scalped four Mohali: East Zone, looking for their maiden Duleep Trophy triumph, reached 213 for three at stumps on Day 4 chasing 409 for victory against North Zone. First-innings centurion Kiran Powar was unbeaten on 51 with nightwatchman Sourashish Lahiri on one. East, thus, need 196 runs on the final day with seven wickets in hand. East fell eight short of Norths first-innings tally of 322 on Saturday, Powar playing a lone hand (102 off 161) before holing out to Sarandeep Singh who took five for 64. North then rode Yuvrajs second century of the match (148) and Test opener Akash Chopras solid 95 to a commanding 292 for three at stumps on Day 3. The two put on 230 for the second wicket after Gautam Gambhir fell cheaply to Sourashish Lahiri. On Sunday, North collapsed to 400 all out Utpal Chatterjee scalping four victims. Then Yuvraj let off Rohan Gavaskar twice. The left-hander was dismissed one short of fifty just before the close of play. Powar was also given a reprieve at 21, Ajay Ratra grassing a chance behind the wicket. Utpal struck in the first over of the day, trapping Mithun Minhas leg-before. Chatterjee then had Ratra (2) caught by Arindam Das. Skipper Dinesh Mongia himself departed eight overs later when he was bolwed round his legs by Chatterjee for 48. Sarandeep became Chatterjees fifth victim. East had Arindam opening in place of Shiv Sundar Das who is nursing a torn calf muscle. The free-stroking Dhoni and Arindam gave East a terrific start. Dhoni smashed 60 off 47 balls. Gagandeep Singh fielded off his own bowling and hurled the ball back at Dhoni to be warned for unsporting behaviour by umpire Jasbir Singh. Dhoni fell mistiming an intended pull. Arindam then fell to a questionable leg-before verdict off Sarandeep.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Aussies ready for Lankan spin music
 - FIRST ODI - World champions in for challenge on slow, turning Dambulla wicket  Matthew Hayden (right) and Andrew Symonds during a practice session in Dambulla on Thursday. (Reuters) Dambulla: Australia will face the brunt of a formidable Sri Lankan spin attack when they take the field for the first of five ODIs on a slow, turning wicket on Friday. The Aussies, fresh after convincing home wins against India in the tri-series finals, are in for a different challenge here, says Sri Lankan one-day skipper Maravan Atapattu. We know our cricket, the way we play the one-day game, and our approach to it under these conditions and the type of wickets. It is our greatest strength, Atapattu said. Playing on home soil and in front of our own crowd will be our greatest strength. Australia won the last encounter between the two sides  a 2003 World Cup semi-final match in South Africa  but Sri Lanka can look for inspiration from their 2002 Champions Trophy win in Colombo. Sri Lankas team selections for the first two matches are indicative of their reliance on their strength  spin bowling. There are four specialist spinners in the squad  Muttiah Muralidharan, Kumara Dharmasena, Upul Chandana and young leg-spinner Kaushal Lokuarachchi, along with part-timers Sanath Jayasuriya and Russel Arnold. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting, though, is confident his team has improved its game on turning pitches and their recent records only show that they are not meek performers against spin. What weve done over the last few years with our game in the sub-continent, I think we have improved a lot, Ponting said. Australia won five of their six tri-series matches last year on spinning Indian wickets, including the tournament final against the hosts. Sri Lanka are likely to continue with the experienced opening pair of Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, a proven successful batting combination for several years, with a combined total of close to 500 one-day Internationals. Skipper Atapattu, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillekeratne Dilshan make up a solid batting line-up. Australias batting strength looks even healthier with the likes of Adam Gilchrist, Ponting, Matthew Hayden and Damien Martyn  each scoring around 40 runs per innings and playing about 600 matches between them. Bowlers like Ian Harvey, Simon Katich and Brad Hogg are also useful low-order batters. The Australian bowling, including speedster Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, who is looking to get claim his 100th ODI wicket during the series, could prove a challenge to the hosts despite the absence of the experienced Glenn McGrath. Australia and Sri Lanka have played in 50 one-day Internationals since they first met in a 1975 World Cup match. Australia have won 33, Sri Lanka 15 and two matches ended without results. However, the Sri Lankans have won nine out of 4 matches played at home against Australias three wins.

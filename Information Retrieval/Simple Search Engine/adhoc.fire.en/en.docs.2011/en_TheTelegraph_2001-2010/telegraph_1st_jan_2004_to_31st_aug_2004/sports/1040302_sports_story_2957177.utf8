 Rookie pacer among 16 for WI camp
St Johns: The West Indies selectors have named a 16-man squad to go into training ahead of the first Test against England in Kingston. The camp, to be held in Jamaica, starts on Thursday and the squad will be reduced to 13 players by March 8. The first Test starts on March 11. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has confirmed Brian Lara as captain for both the England and Bangladesh home series. Injury has kept out Vasbert Drakes and Wavell Hinds, poor form has shut out Daren Ganga and Mervyn Dillon, while Ravi Rampaul, spearhead of the West Indies colts side in Bangladesh for the Under-19 World Cup, has not been considered. The West Indies selection panel, under the chairmanship of Vivian Richards, has brought back fast bowler Tino Best as well as batsmen Devon Smith and Ryan Hinds, included Ricardo Powell, and sprung a surprise with unknown fast bowler Dwight Washington. The West Indies, whose record in Test cricket over the last 10 years has heightened the visitors expectations, are bullies at home and Michael Vaughans side, looking to become the first English team to win a Test series in the Caribbean in 36 years, will have their hands full.

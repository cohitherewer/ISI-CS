 Flintoff doubtful for opener
London: Andrew Flintoff was rated no more than 50-50 Monday for Englands triangular series opener against New Zealand Thursday. The Lancashire all-rounder is doubtful for the day-night match against the Black Caps on his Old Trafford home ground after suffering pain in his left foot during Englands third Test victory at Trent Bridge. Flintoff had a scan on the injury last week and will be given further physiotherapy. Meanwhile Marcus Trescothick added to Englands injury problems by twisting his left ankle during fielding practice in the indoor school at Cardiffs Sophia Gardens. Trescothick was given immediate ice treament and is due to have his ankle X-rayed later.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Atwal fires final-round 66 
- Craig Parry takes title after play-off with Verplank 
 Craig Parry hits a shot from the rough on the 17th hole during the final round of the Doral Championship in Miami on Sunday Miami: After just about making the cut at the Doral Championship, Indias Arjun Atwal, the only Indian to have made it to the prestigious US PGA Tour, fired a six-under par 66 in the final round on Sunday to finish with a two-under 286 aggregate. The Calcutta pro finished a credible 64th, along with five others at the par-72 Doral Resort and Spa here. The 30-year-old began the tournament with a nightmare first round, carding a five over 77, but made up for collecting seven bogeys by bringing in a 68 on Day II, thus just being able to scrape into the money rounds at Dorals Blue Monster. Day III saw a slip, the PGA Tour rookie finishing at 79th (four over 220) with a three-over 75. Then came Sunday, and a 66 that was two less than even champion Craig Parrys card on the day. The Australian holed out from 176 yards on the first play-off hole against Scott Verplank to win the title after both had finished the 72 holes on 17-under-par 271. Parry had a 68 in the final round and Verplank a 67. In the play-off, Parry found the fairway off the 18th tee, while Verplank was in the rough on the right side 219 yards from the hole. Playing first, Verplank hit a long iron that found the green and stopped about 30 feet from the hole. Parry hit a six-iron that landed just short and right of the hole, then rolled to the left and into the cup for an eagle two. That was an indescribable shot, Verplank said. If you do that, youre supposed to win. It was the second time Parry had claimed victory after holding the 54-hole lead. I think this is now not a fluke, Parry said after winning his second PGA Tour title. I wont say anyone could win once but to win twice, it means that youre able to play on the tour, I think. Parry won his first PGA Tour title  the WGC-NEC Invitational  from a similar position at Sahalee Country Club in 2002. South Africas Retief Goosen finished one shot back on 272 after closing with a 66 in the final round, and Joe Durant placed fourth on 273 with a 68. European Ryder Cup captain Bernhard Langer shot a seven-under 65 and finished on 274. Joining the German in a tie for fifth were Koreas K.J. Choi, David Toms and Gene Sauers.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Mighty Mo looks up to mentor Pamela 
 Mohini Athens: Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson will bring her sculptured looks to the land of goddesses, cheering on American gymnast Mohini Bhardwaj here at the Athens Olympics. Andersons $20,000 support helped 25-year-old Mighty Mo achieve her Olympic dream at an age when most of the pixie-like tumblers are retired and Bhardwaj is now captain of the US team. Pam is my mentor. She has funded the whole thing. Im excited to have her here, Bhardwaj said. Shes just a person who has goals and dreams and wants to do things for other people. Anderson backed Bhardwajs dream after bonding with the fellow vegetarian over tattoos and hopes. It was exciting, Bhardwaj said. I didnt believe it at first. When I heard about it I said, Ill believe it when I see it. Then she came into the gym and said she supports someone sticking to her career. Were both women who go for our goals and dreams, said Bhardwaj. Were both a little crazy. Mine is a lot more settled down. I cant speak about her crazy  and I dont know if I want to (see it). But she admits her life has become hectic since Anderson walked into it. Everything has been kind of crazy since she decided to fund this whole thing. Asked if she would be here without Andersons aid, the daughter of a Russian mother and an Indian father India said, probably, but I would be in very, very bad debt. Bhardwaj has worked as a barmaid and waitress to finance her quest after failing in the 1996 trials and not even trying in 2000. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bitter-sweet feeling for Agassi
 Roger Federer during his quarter final showdown with Lleyton Hewitt on Wednesday. The top seed was leading 6-1, 5-4 when rain stopped play. (AFP) London: The rigours of Wimbledon routinely take their toll on the bodies of the leading tennis players this time of year, but for Andre Agassi, this years event is wearing out his thumb. The American, champion at the All England Club in 1992, is sidelined with a hip injury but said on Wednesday he was finding it hard to switch off. I cant help that my thumb and remote control gravitate toward tennis, he said in a teleconference. Its been a bittersweet feeling; its not an easy one. Clear as the decision was, it had not been an easy one to make for the man who is still competing as hard as ever at the age of 34. Its tough to sit back and watch it. I believe in what Im doing and Im working hard. The jury is still out on my hip and its something Ive struggled with on and off for a while now. Not playing the clay season and then going straight out to the grass compromised how its feeling. I knew I wasnt physically in a position to be anywhere near my best.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

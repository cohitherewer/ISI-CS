The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Now, rebels look beyond Zimbabwe
 Heath StreakHarare: Zimbabwes rebels have abandoned their bitter struggle with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU). My clients want to move on, the players lawyer, Chris Venturas, said on Friday. They talked about it and decided it is time to disband and fly north. I think there is a very remote chance that they will play for Zimbabwe again. Zimbabwe have been forced to pick a second-string team since April 2 when 15 white players made themselves unavailable over what they see as racially driven selection policies. Their stand was sparked by Heath Streaks removal from the captaincy after he questioned the composition of the selection panel. The ZCU fired the players, and the rebels asked the ICC on May 20 to form a dispute resolution committee to arbitrate. Venturas said his clients had yet to receive a response from the ICC. We gave the ICC seven days to get back to us and we havent heard anything. We have to assume that nothing is happening, or even if it is its too late for my clients. They want to move on. A statement signed by 13 of the rebels said they took their action in solidarity with our national captain, Heath Streak, who was unlawfully dismissed, as well as in protest at the unfair and discriminatory employment practices perpetrated against us by individuals of the ZCU. The rebels alleged that ZCU officials committed transgressions, including interfering with the selection process and making threats to try to ensure teams included more black players. For the record, our actions have never been racially or politically motivated. In fact, through our years of service and dedication we feel we have been an example of a successful and multi-racial team. The statement was signed by Streak, Grant Flower, Stuart Carlisle, Craig Wishart, Trevor Gripper, Andy Blignaut, Gary Brent, Travis Friend, Sean Ervine, Ray Price, Barney Rodgers, Neil Ferreria and Richard Simms. Several rebels have made arrangements to play elsewhere, while an unofficial tour by them as a team has also been mooted. Streak will play for Warwickshire, Blignaut for Tasmania and Ervine for Hampshire and Western Australia.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

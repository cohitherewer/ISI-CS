 Indian challenge ends
Tripoli: Indian challenge ended at the world chess championship as GM P. Harikrishna and IM Neelotpal Das bowed out in the second round. Harikrishna went out after a valiant effort against European champion and 2001 finalist Vassily Ivanchuk of the Ukraine in the second round while Das lost in the first set of tie-beak rapid games against Armenian Grandmaster Ashot Anastesian. Das had earlier held his famous rival to a draw twice in the normal time control in the two-game match, but failed to keep the momentum ticking in the rapid chess. India fielded five players in the championship but stalwarts Krishnan Sasikiran, Dibyendu Barua and Surya Shekhar Ganguly crashed out in the first round itself and with the ouster of Harikrishna and Das in round two the team will return home early. Top seed Grandmaster Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria proceeded to the third round with back-to-back victories over compatriot Alexander Delchev.  (PTI)  Copyright

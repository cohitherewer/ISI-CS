				 																																	Visakhapatnam: A teenaged cricketer died on Sunday after he was hit on the chest during a match at the Government Arts College at Srikakulam near here. Eighteen-year-old Dileep Kumar was batting against Vizianagaram in an inter-district tournament when he was fatally hit on the chest by a rising delivery. Kumar, a junior intermediate student of Nalanda College, who collapsed was given first aid before being rushed to the government hospital where doctors declared him dead.				 																																	Andhra Pradesh Cricket Association secretary Pranarayana Swamy expressed deep shock at the tragic incident. 				 																																	Auckland: Former All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu left hospital on Sunday, six days after undergoing a kidney transplant. Lomu, 29, was suffering from the kidney disorder nephrotic syndrome. He received the kidney from an anonymous donor, thought to be a friend. Bridget Abernethy, Lomus spokeswoman, said the player had surprised doctors with his speedy recovery. He is resting comfortably at his Auckland home and is happy to be out of hospital, Abernethy said.				 																																	Chennai: Indian boys won the gold and girls took the silver at the children of Asia Sports and Games meet at Yakutsk in Russia. China took the silver and Russia the bronze in the boys section. Russia won the girls gold and the bronze (Russia-Thomaskiya). Teams from Asian countries, including Russia and India, participated in the championship, a press release from the Volleyball Federation of India said. 				 																																	London: Arsenal and England defender Sol Campbell will be sidelined for the first six weeks of the new Premier League season due to an Achilles injury, British Sunday newspapers reported. It will be at least six weeks, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was quoted as saying in the Sunday Express after the 29-year-old was sent home early from the English champions pre-season tournament in Amsterdam.				 																																	This is a big blow for us although there is more reassuring news about Thierry Henry, who could be ready for the first Premiership match. Wenger told newspapers on Friday that France striker Henry was doubtful for the start of the season. The manager said Campbell was injured while playing at Euro 2004, where England were knocked out by Portugal in the quarter finals.				 																																	London: Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd has confirmed that Bobby Robson will not be staying on as manager when his contract expires at the end of the season. Asked if the 71-year-old might continue in his role as manager of the Premier League club beyond next May, Shepherd told The Guardian: No. He said the club and Robson would be in the Guinness Book of Records if he were the manager at the age of 73.				 																																	New York: AC Milan squeezed past Manchester United 9-8 on penalties after the two sides drew their Champions World Series match 1-1 in New Jersey on Saturday. The Italians won the shootout at the Giants Stadium in East Rutherford after United captain Roy Keane and goalkeeper Tim Howard hit the post with their penalties.				 																																	United, who also lost on penalties to Bayern Munich in Chicago and were beaten 2-1 by Celtic in Philadelphia, took a 33rd-minute lead through Paul Scholes in the final game of their US tour. But Andriy Shevchenko equalised in injury time for Milan.				 																																	AS Roma beat Celtic 1-0. Italy striker Francesco Totti scored the only goal of the game in the 25th minute.				 																																	n Cricket, West Indies vs England: Second Test, Day IV highlights from 1.30 pm on STAR Sports n Cricket, Legends: Muttiah Muralidharan from 2 pm on TEN Sports n Cricket, Asia Cup final: Repeat from 3.30 pm on ESPN

 Family before football: Becks
 - The invasion into my private life is tough  BY ROY COLLINS  Even the England captain finds it difficult to differentiate between Beckham the brand and Beckham the man As David Beckham was doing his best to defend himself against accusations that football has become an afterthought in his diary behind celebrity interviews and sponsorship photo shoots, several of his interrogators were sipping from Pepsi cans emblazoned with an image of him dressed as a gladiator. Such is the confusion that arises when you try to distinguish between Beckham the brand and Beckham the man and even he finds it difficult to explain or differentiate. On the one hand, he seems to crave a life away from the paparazzi lens but on the other, he has consented to so many endorsements that you can no more escape his image during a cosy chat in a Lisbon suburb with the man himself than you can at Bounds Green underground station. Even so, it was difficult to withhold all sympathy as he described a lifestyle that, he says, prevents him driving his two sons to the park without a fleet of photographers for company, an existence now more in keeping with Madonnas than that of an England football captain. But having allowed that to evolve, he accepts that the genie cannot be put back in the bottle, nor for that matter, the Pepsi in the can. Beckham said: I dont actually do as much as people think. But I was pushed into some situations and I have taken on some myself. Unfortunately, this is now my life and my wifes life. You either lie down and let everyone batter you with it or you come out fighting and this is what we will all do as a family. The move to Spain has meant a new environment where people are not used to me. In Manchester, I was able to walk around the Trafford Centre with my family but now, my biggest problem is working out how to get to the supermarket without being photographed. That takes time and energy. You have to think and plan every time you go through the front door. The intrusion and invasion into my life is tough. I have got children and I want them to enjoy their lives. People say why is he complaining. Well I am not, I am just explaining how it is. Despite much photographic evidence to the contrary, with various pictures of Posh Spice in New York and on shopping expeditions in Knightsbridge, he claims that she spent more time in Spain last season than was reported. And now that he has committed himself to at least another year at Real Madrid, eldest son Brooklyn has finally enrolled in a local school. His failure to attend last season was also misinterpreted, says Beckham. The real reason was that his teammate Zinedine Zidane warned him against it, telling him that during his childrens first two months in a Madrid school, they were regularly filmed in the playground. As well as invasion of privacy, such actions would arouse concerns about kidnapping. Beckham says: I am not prepared to put my children in that situation and if that case arises, I will take a long look at it. I am very protective of them. They say I do photo shoots with my children but I never have and never will. I protect them as much as I can. What Beckham does not seem to comprehend is that the majority of England supporters could not care a jot about his celebrity lifestyle, his alleged affairs and whether or not his family opt to live with him in Madrid or with Poshs mum and dad in Hertfordshire. They care only about the toll those problems have evidently taken on his football career, leaving him not only visibly drained on the pitch but a shadow of the inspirational captain he once was for his country. He is aware that knives are being sharpened. It has been tough on and off the pitch because of certain situations, but I have got to be strong because I have two little boys and a wife to look after. When I am down they pick me up and when they are down, I pick them up. My family is number one and football is number two. Thats the way it is and will always be.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Thursday, July 08, 2004  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Bhaichung Bhutia, who returned from Singapore Tuesday after his Euro commentary stint, Wednesday refused to spell out whether he will be back at East Bengal or whether he will be playing in Calcutta. 				 																																																	If I play in Calcutta I will play where my heart is, was all he would comment, an obvious reference to East Bengal.				 																																																	However, the issue was whether he will be playing in Calcutta or trying again, for greener pastures in a league abroad. 				 																																																	I am not making any comment on that at this moment, said, cautiously. I do not want any quote of mine to backfire on me, and I will say in due time.				 																																																	In the recent past Bhaichung has been linked with clubs in Greece and in Cyprus. For the moment, though, he will be going back to his hometown, where my father isnt keeping well. Much will be decided after that.				 																																																	 Mohun Bagans soccer team gets patched up for the season, slowly. 				 																																																	They take to the field on Friday, and it was only Wednesday that one Brazilian, Eduardo Coelho, the stopper from Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club, signed up for the club. 				 																																																	The clubs defence has been in tatters for a long time now and even coach Subrata Bhattacharyas request to keep him back for three-four more days did not hold as Dutch defender Frank van Aegis left.				 																																																	Even Subrata Bhattacharya signed up Wednesday, a new requirement after the Subhas Bhowmick-IFA spat, but Bhowmick said he has no idea why he signed. Nigerian defender Eduardo Canthon, who was rejected by Bagan Tuesday, Wednesday paced up for Mohammedan Sporting.				 																																																	 Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) secretary Gurbux Singh on Wednesday was accompanied by Calcutta Municipal Corporation officials to the Park Circus Maidan for a possible alternative site for an astroturf. The BHAs plea for an astroturf at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium was turned down some time back, with the soccer lobby winning.				 																																																	Gurbux said he had a meeting with state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, mayor Subrata Mukherjee and Director General of Police Dinesh Vajpai where the minister had suggested if a place can be found. 				 																																																	The Park Circus Maidan had come up, and today I saw the place. It can easily house four such astroturfs, including the amenities.				 																																																	The visit may or may not yield any result, but Singh said it was another beginning. The CMC people have asked for requisite measurements.				 																																																	 Calcutta Sports Association and CSSC beat Salkia Swimming Association and PYMA, respectively in their all-Bengal Arnika plus senior waterpolo meet of the Ahiritola Youth Swimming Club, Wednesday. Over the YMCA course CSA won 8-4, while CSSC swept through 10-1. P.Bal of CSSC scored five goals.				 																																																	FOOTBALL: CFL super division  Mohammedan Sporting vs CFC (Howrah); Tollygunge Agragami vs George Telegraph (Rabindra Sarobar). Matches from 3.30 pm.				 																																																	GOLF: The Telegraph Merchants Cup: Third round tee-off at 8 am (RCGC).				 																																																	WATERPOLO: All-Bengal Arnika plus senior meet: ILSS vs Rishra SC, 3.15pm; YMCA vs Central SC, 4.30pm (YMCA course).

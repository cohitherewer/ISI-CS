 Sasikiran, Harikrishna finish 2nd 
 - DUBAI CHESS - Mamedyarov pips Eljanov to clinch crown  Thirteen-year-old Magnus Carlsen during his final-round game in Dubai on Tuesday. (AFP) Dubai: Grandmasters Krishnan Sasikiran and P. Harikrishna drew their ninth and final round games to finish joint second with ten others in the Dubai international chess championship here. World junior champion 19-year-old Grandmaster Shakhriyaz Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan clinched the Dubai Cup with seven points, defeating overnight leader Grandmaster Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine in the last round on Tuesday. Twelve players, including Sasikiran, Harikrishna and 13-year-old GM Magnus Carlsen of Norway shared the second spot with 6.5 points each. GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly (5) put an end to his run of losses after settling for a draw with compatriot Abhijeet Gupta. The last round was not devoid of excitement as quite a few players seemed interested in catching up with Eljanov, who had only a slender half point lead before the start of the final round. Mamedyarov cashed in bravely on the offered opportunities with fine performance that not only yielded the full point but also gave him the winners share of $ 5000. Eljanov employed the Grunfeld Defence as black but appeared at sea in a complex middle game that eventually saw him losing a pawn without much counter play. Mamedyarov clinched the issue in 70 moves after netting another pawn. Sasikiran appeared to have caught GM Alexander Goloshchapov of Ukraine off guard in a deeply analysed variation of the Semi Slav as white but a gritty display by the latter helped the Ukrainian snatch half point from the jaws of defeat. Sasikiran could not do much as his own king came under attack.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, March 06, 2004  Flame set to strike on Sunday 
 BY STAR RACER				 										The Indian Turf Invitation Cup returns to the Mahalaxmi raceground in Mumbai after a five-year long wait. The 2,400m race, billed for Sunday, promises the winner a whopping purse of Rs three million plus a trophy valued at Rs one lakh.				 										Normally, Mumbai and Bangalore horses are known to rule the prized event, one of the richest in the country but with Psychic Flames surprise victory in the Indian Derby last month, the equation has changed in favour of Calcutta.				 										The Razeen-Eminence daughter has been on the up eversince she claimed the Calcutta 1,000 Guineas  significantly, in her third career start. The Darius Byramji-trainee has not looked back since with the 2,000 Guineas, and the Derby falling into her lap as a matter of formality. Therefore, Psychic Flame is the obvious choice for the Invitation Cup.				 										Jockey Pesi Shroff, who partnered her to Indian Derby will be seen in action again on the favourite.				 										Ignore Aretinos last run. He boasts of finishing close to Psychic Flame in the Calcutta 2,000 Guineas and therefore, selects himself for the 1,600m Maj. P. K. Mehra Memorial Super Mile Cup over 1,600 metres. C. Alford partners the Vijay Singh-trained four-year-old.

 Tiger ready to pounce
	 - BRITISH OPEN 
- Weather and world No. 1 player could begin to stir any moment BY LEWINE MAIR  Tiger Woods climbs out of a bunker during his practice round for the British Open at Royal Troon in Scotland on Wednesday. (Reuters) The wind and the aura surrounding world number one Tiger Woods have been missing this Open week. Yet no one doubts that the weather and the player could begin to stir at any minute. Woods is itching to get started on this Open examination and wants the questions to be as tough as they come. Id like it to blow. It forces you to hit the different shots and to work the golf ball, he said. Thursday is expected to be relatively calm, but a 15mph breeze, laced with rain, is on the cards for Friday. Though most were revelling in Tuesdays sunshine, Woods was thinking wind. He hit a series of quail-high irons and, in between, there were plenty of straight and booming drives. Even those cynics who have been raising a collective eyebrow every time they hear him say, Im nearly there, were beginning to wonder if he could be right. Nick Price is among those who expect a Woods resurgence. It was Woods performance at the recent Western Open, where he shot a 73 in the second round after catching no more than four fairways, which told Price that there was no question of the player having lost any of his desire. If hed lost interest, hed have gone home that day. Hes got this will to succeed. If hes on the bubble to make the cut, he makes it. If he has a par putt which has to be holed, it goes down, the Zimbabwean said. Price suggested the main reason Woods had lost his air of invincibility was that he had pushed other players into working harder and they had responded. Tigers bottomed out at the moment, but when he starts playing at his best again, which he will, that invincibility will return. Price was also prepared to be drawn on the matter of how Fred Funk, who played so well for so long in the recent US Open at Shinnecock, had pulled out of this week in favour of playing the concurrent event in the US. Funk is a nice man but that did not stop Price from saying that he was in line for the Bonehead of the Year Award. Retief Goosen, who has bagged two US Opens, told how, in his earliest days on tour, he always felt that the Open was the major he might win. I can play these courses, he warned. This modest man added that he had plenty of Open experience and four top-10 finishes before realising that he had gone way beyond what he would usually say. Asked if there was a side of him people did not know, Goosen said he was low-key and planned to stay that way. He talked of older guys getting spiky haircuts and 300 pairs of trousers I couldnt even think about wearing. This, you assume, was aimed at Darren Clarke, who has had to take a lot of light-hearted stick for his hair-dos and attire over the last few months. Phil Mickelson sees Troon as a wonderful course and cannot wait to find out how the new, lower approach shots he has will work. You need two styles of play on Royal Troon, he said. Downwind, over the first half, Ill be using full swings and hitting the ball higher. Into the wind coming home, Ill be hitting the ball lower and using run-ups.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

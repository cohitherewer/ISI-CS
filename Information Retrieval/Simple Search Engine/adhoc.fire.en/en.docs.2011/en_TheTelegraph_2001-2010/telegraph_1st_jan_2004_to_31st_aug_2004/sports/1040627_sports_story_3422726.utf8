The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Santini blames over-confidence
 - Technically, our football was at its lowest level, says France coach  Santini was aware things werent right after the last warm-up game Lisbon, June 26 (Reuters): Having won the World Cup and European title in the past six years, France may have been too cocky about their chances of winning Euro 2004, coach Jacques Santini admitted on Saturday. The champions shock 0-1 defeat to Greece in Fridays quarter final followed a disastrous 2002 World Cup campaign when France were knocked out in the first round. Maybe we imagined we were better than we were, the French coach told a news conference. There was that 3-0 win over Germany last year and some of the players may have thought France were back to their best. They certainly needed to reassure themselves after what happened in South Korea, and they tried to convince themselves that 2002 was now behind them and here we are again. Santini said the 2004 side was nothing like the standard of the brilliant team crowned champions four years ago. Many of his players were exhausted at the end of a long season and the coach said he knew they were in trouble even before arriving in Portugal. Technically, our football was at its lowest level, said Santini. We knew that we needed to be more competitive to achieve the goals we had set. You cant expect to beat your opponents when you play for only 45 minutes during a match. This is not enough to warrant the tag of favourites. Santini confessed he was aware things were not right after the 1-0 victory over Ukraine in Frances last warm-up match in Paris, achieved through a late Zinedine Zidane goal. The coach said he had held meetings with key players but making changes became impossible as they were running short of time after arriving in Portugal. We reviewed the matter but once we were here, it was too late. We only tried to do what we could and hope our opponents would not realise we had problems, he said. Some players were physically exhausted. They have had two or three demanding seasons with their clubs and they were unable to take anymore. When you play too many matches during the season, you are certainly not capable of performing in such a tournament. I suppose this kind of situation can be overcome but its really tough to find the proper motivation. Santini felt his side made too many mistakes against Greece. Too many technical mistakes and a lack of ideas in the last part of the game did not allow us to come back after a great goal, observed Santini, who will shortly be departing for English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. We are all responsible for our elimination, Zinedine Zidane said after the shock defeat. Defender Bixente Lizarazu said: We had the team to go further. I think in the second half, we were in better shape than the Greeks. They were on the verge of collapse defensively. Lilian Thuram said they may have taken the Greeks too lightly and had paid the price for not taking their chances. The only thing we can tell is that we didnt expect such a challenge, he said.

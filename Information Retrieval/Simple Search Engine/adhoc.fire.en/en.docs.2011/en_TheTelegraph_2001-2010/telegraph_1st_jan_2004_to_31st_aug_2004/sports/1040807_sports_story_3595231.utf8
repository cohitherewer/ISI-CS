The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav sure Karthik can deliver 
 - Captain disagrees with U-19 coach Robin Singh on TN youngsters wicketkeeping skills  Dinesh Karthik New Delhi: Sourav Ganguly does not agree with India under-19 coach Robin Singh that Dinesh Karthik is good with the bat, but not impressive behind the wickets. I dont know what Robin Singh said about Karthik. But we spoke to Sandeep Patil, who is the India A coach, before the selection and he said Karthik is outstanding. I have also seen him keep in the under-19 World Cup, he didnt look that bad, Sourav, who was here as part of a promotional campaign for LG, said. On Karthik playing the last match as a batsman and M. S. Dhoni keeping wickets in Zimbabwe, where the A team is currently touring, Sourav said it was just a one-off thing and was meant to give Dhoni a chance. Patil told us that he wanted to give Dhoni a chance. Three of their batsmen were unfit, including Hemang Badani and S. Sriram, and hence, he asked Karthik to play as a batsman and let Dhoni keep wickets. Sourav made it clear that Rahul Dravid will continue keeping wickets in one-dayers and Karthik was just a back-up. The Indian captain also indicated that Parthiv Patel, who has been dropped from the one-day squad, would keep in Test cricket. Parthiv has done wonderfully well in Test cricket, Sourav said. Asked why Dinesh Mongia, who is enjoying a good run in English county cricket, was not picked, Sourav said: We could pick only 14 players as per the ICC rule. We have seven batsmen who pick themselves automatically. He is doing well for Lancashire, but unfortunately he had to miss out. Again, we think Mongia has had enough opportunities. Also, he is not a part of the India A team and we basically wanted to pick someone from the second string. Ravi Shastri on Friday said the Indian teams debacle in Sri Lanka will serve as a wake-up call for the side which has the potential to win the World Cup. The defeat in the Asia Cup final was a big setback. But knowing the talent of this side, it is going to be temporary. It is a wake-up call for the team, said the former captain. 1983 was the turning point of Indian cricket. This team has the potential to repeat the feat of the 1983 World Cup winning side, said Shastri, a member of the Kapil Dev-led team. He felt India could begin their pursuit of the ultimate dream by winning the Champions Trophy this September. For starters, India can look to win the Champions Trophy, he said. Meanwhile, the senior selection committee named Andhra allrounder Venugopal Rao and wicketkeeper-batsman Vinay Kumar Ojha of Madhya Pradesh as replacements for India A cricketers Rohan Gavaskar and Dinesh Karthik who have been picked for the Indian team. The two replacements will join the India A team, which is to play a triangular one-day series in Kenya from August 11 to 21 and last two four-day matches against hosts Kenya from August 26 to September 4, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary S. K. Nair said from Thiruvananthapuram on Friday. The A teams of India and Pakistan and Kenya are in the fray in the tri-series. (PTI)  Copyright

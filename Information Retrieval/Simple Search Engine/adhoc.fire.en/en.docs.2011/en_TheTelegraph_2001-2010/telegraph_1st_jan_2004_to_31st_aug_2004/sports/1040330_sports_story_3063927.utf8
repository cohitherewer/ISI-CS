The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The urge is very much there: Michael Slater
	 - WEARING THE BAGGY GREEN AGAIN  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Slater says hell be fit in a couple of months Multan: Michael Slaters last appearance for Australia was almost three years ago and, only months ago, he was in a Sydney clinic with a severe attack of arthritis. However, the dashing opener hasnt given up hopes of a comeback. Realistically, the chances are slim... Im already 34... But, within me, the urge to again wear the Baggy Green is very much there, Slater, a member of Ten Sports commentary team for the Indo-Pak Test series, told The Telegraph. Slater has pulled down quite a bit and hasnt fully recovered from the illness which briefly confined him to a wheelchair. I should be perfectly okay in a couple of months... Im into a lot of swimming and the rehab is going fine, he added. Like the rest of the fraternity, Slater complimented Virender Sehwag  somebody who shares his approach  for an India best of 309: Quite simply, he produced an awesome innings... He wasnt as free-stroking today (Monday), but his timing was flawless on the opening day... Hes an amazing talent... Talking of the continuing dominance by Australia, Slater said: Be it with the bat or ball, weve remained aggressive... Thats made a difference and, with Shane (Warne) back in phenomenal manner, even better times lie ahead for Ricky Ponting. Slater, of course, confessed it had initially been very tough to accept his exclusion from the side (during the 2001 Ashes series in England). If anything, the New South Welshman is a fighter and hasnt thrown in the towel.  Copyright

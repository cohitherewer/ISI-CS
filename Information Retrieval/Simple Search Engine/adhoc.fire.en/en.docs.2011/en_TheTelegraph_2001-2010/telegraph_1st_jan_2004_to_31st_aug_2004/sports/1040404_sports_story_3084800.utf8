The Telegraph - Calcutta
DCunha, Suresh may face punishment
- East Bengal leave today to face unknown islanders in AFC Cup
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Suresh (top) and DCunha have not reported back to club since Indias World Cup qualifier against Oman Calcutta: It isnt the prospect of facing a team totally unknown to the coach in the Maldives, but the fact that the team is suffering from injured and truant players that is the main concern for East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick today. Speaking after morning practice at the Central Park ground in Salt Lake, Bhowmick said he had absolutely no idea on the strengths and weaknesses of the Maldivian team, Islands FC, who the National Football League leaders face in their AFC Cup Group E match away Wednesday. We had a fair idea from website info and such about our last away team, Geylang United of Singapore. Hence there was a sense and direction in our preparation. Against Islands I am pretty much in the dark, he said. But the bigger problem is the big hole in the team as players fall back. Dipak Mondal and Subhas Chakraborty remain injured and virtually ruled out of the trip. Debjit Ghosh, too, carries an injury, but he is likely to travel with the team. Sangram Mukherjee isnt looking good too. Christiano Juniors two bookings will see him out, and Shylo Malsawmtluanga is in Islamabad, with the national team at the SAF Games. Mike Okoro didnt attend practice today, being a trifle indisposed, but he will be around with the team. He has a big future ahead in this continent, having already been approached by Geylang, and he isnt one to give up this opportunity for a few aches and pains. The icing on the cake, of course, is the absence of two key players, Alvito DCunha and M. Suresh. They have been with the national team, to play versus Oman (in Kochi, where the Stphen Constantines national team was thrashed 0-5) and have not reported back to the club since. They havent even bothered to inform their club as to why they are not around. The club authorities believe that there is a limit to how much East Bengal will take of this couldnt-care-less attitude, and a strong letter (purportedly a show-cause notice) will be issued to the players once the team is back from their Maldivian sojourn. There is a school of thought in the club which calls for exemplary punishment, though it is also true that the utility value of these players to the team cannot be overstated. DCunha also has another curious problem. His passport has run out of pages and an extra booklet will be required. This will not be possible in the weekend, though he could easily have solved this in Goa had he himself taken the initiative. A club official pointed out that the two had played truant before as well. After the match versus Singapore, they had overstayed a couple of days, said an official of the club. What irks the officials is the amateurish attitude and lack of respect for the clubs engagements of the duo. Regarding the match, Bhowmick said: I have a problem in being able to decide who to play and how to. He said. He fears it is possible that Islands will take a defensive approach (the team not being in too good a position at the moment). Hence a little knowledge of the team would have helped. He said other players are in good shape and that there hasnt been any problem for any of his senior wards, in the changeover from the national camp. The only problem is of fatigue, her said. They are playing too much, and there is less and less of recovery time. The process of recovery and detoxification takes some time and a body should be allowed that. Though it is generally believed that the Maldivian side wouldnt be too much of a problem (Mohun Bagan defeated a local side there by a big margin a few years back), home advantage is always what one takes into account when preparing for any match. Mohun Bagan had been to Maldives last, led by coach Subrata Bhattacharya, when the Indian team won 3-0. East Bengal has a bad memory from 1995 when they had lost to Valencia. Island, however, remain a new team. East Bengal leave Sunday evening, via Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.  Copyright

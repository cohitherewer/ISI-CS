The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Loss brings coach closer to axe
 Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri at Nice Airport on Wednesday. (Reuters) Monaco: As Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri led his squad on a pre-match walk round Monacos harbour, their paymasters enormous yacht loomed in the distance, a reminder of who holds power at the London club. After losing 1-3 to a spirited Monaco in their Champions League semi-final, playing most of the second half of the first leg against ten men, coach and players know Roman Abramovich may want to wield that power very soon. The axe will almost certainly fall first on Ranieri, whose position has been the centre of speculation for months. Ranieris decision to introduce three substitutes in the third quarter of the match disrupted Chelseas rhythm and Monaco, who had midfielder Andreas Zikos sent off seven minutes after halftime, scored twice late on. We needed one more player up front to win the match, said Ranieri after Chelseas first away loss in seven games in the competition this season. But in the last 15 minutes we lost the plot. Its not the players fault, its mine. Only our best performance (in the second leg) can help us, Ranieri said. I think we have only a 20 per cent chance. Argentine striker Hernan Crespo, who scored Chelseas first-half goal, said the whole team was angry and disappointed. Maybe in our own stadium we can change things. It is now clear in our minds we have to think about the second leg. The team has the attributes to win, he said. Captain Marcel Desailly said Chelsea had to emulate Monacos quarter-final performance when they reversed a 2-4 defeat against Real Madrid to win 3-1 at home. They managed to come back from 4-2. We have to still believe in the possibility, Desailly said. Monaco coach Didier Deschamps said he had decided against playing defensively because his players were natural attackers. Monaco scored eight goals earlier in the competition against Deportivo Coruna. I think the fact they brought on one more striker left us more space, he said. I wanted to keep two forwards because I wanted players to create space and still have chances to score. He was all praise for Spanish striker Fernando Morientes, who scored the second goal and took his tournament tally to eight. I think great players are always here when it matters and Fernando is always there for the big games. He does more than he has to, said Deschamps.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

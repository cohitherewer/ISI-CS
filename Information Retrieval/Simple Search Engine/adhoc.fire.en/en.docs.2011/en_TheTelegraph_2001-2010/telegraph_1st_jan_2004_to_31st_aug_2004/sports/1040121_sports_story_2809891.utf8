The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vermeulen fractures skull 
 - Zimbabwean hit by misjudged Pathan bouncer  Mark Vermeulen, soon after being struck by a Pathan bouncer on Tuesday. (AFP)  Melbourne: Zimbabwes Mark  Vermeulen fractured his skull while batting in a triangular  series match against India in Brisbane on Tuesday.  The 24-year-old top-edged a bouncer from Irfan Pathan  and the ball struck him above the right eye, wedging between  the visor and peak of his helmet. Vermeulen, who suffered a hairline skull fracture during a net session at last years World Cup, was taken to a Brisbane hospital on Tuesday night where a depressed skull fracture was diagnosed. He is expected to have reconstructive surgery in Brisbane this week and will play no further part in the series. The Pathan bouncer that knocked Vermeulen down was vicious, and having mistimed the attempted hook, the ball lodged in the grill and he retired hurt. The 24-year-old was taken to a Brisbane hospital, where he is expected to have the surgery. Its just really sad, Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak told a news conference later. Weve already lost Craig Wishart (knee surgery) and to lose Mark is a big blow to Zimbabwe cricket. If he had stayed who knows what would have happened. He was timing the ball so well. Team physio Brad Robinson said there has been a nasty fracture on Vermuelens skull and he would need to stay in Brisbane for at least three weeks. He at present is on antibiotics and pain-killers. After his operation is done, he would need to be in Brisbane for two-three weeks. He would need a few months to recover. It is the second time it has happened to him. It happened in the World Cup also in the nets when he was hit on the left side of his eye.  Streak ruled out any replacement for Vermuelen, stating  there were two batsmen, Visu Sibanda and Stuart Matsikenyeri  sitting on the bench.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jalandhar may lose tie 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Zones Duleep Trophy match against England A, scheduled to be held from February 27 to March 1, is likely to be shifted out of Jalandhar. It has been learnt that the Jalandhar pitch has not impressed the BCCI pitches and grounds committee, which suggested the match should be moved to an alternative venue. East Zones first match in the Duleep Trophy is against South in Dharamshala from February 14-17. A decision on the new venue is yet to be taken.  Copyright

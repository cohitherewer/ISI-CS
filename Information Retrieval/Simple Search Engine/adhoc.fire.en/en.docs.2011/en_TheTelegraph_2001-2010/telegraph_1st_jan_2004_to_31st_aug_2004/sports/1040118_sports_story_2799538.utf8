The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal makes cut in 1st US meet
 Atwal recovered from early bogeys New Delhi, Jan. 17 (PTI) Ace Indian golfer Arjun Atwal, from Calcutta, strung together a well compiled two-under 68 to make the cut at the Sony Open in Hawaii, his first outing on the prestigious US PGA Tour. Atwal, who became the first ever Indian to qualify for the biggest stage in world golf, rests on the bubble with a two-day tally of one-under 139, the very score at which the cut was applied, according to information received here. Daniel Chopra, the India-born Swede, also into his first season on the PGA Tour, slipped out of contention despite tying for the ninth position in his opening round. Chopra, followed up his day one 67, with a 73 Friday, thereby slipping to a tally of level-par 140. Meanwhile, Australian Steve Allen fired a superb eight under 62 to assume a one-stroke lead at 11-under 129. American, Harrison Frazer was placed second at 130, with South Africas Ernie Els occupying the third place at 131. The 31-year-old Atwal started on the tenth tee, and after a series of pars, suffered setbacks in the form of bogeys on the 15th and 17th. Atwal held his nerve to birdie the 18th. One over on the first tee box, Atwal steeled himself, pulled his game together and fired birdies on the third, fifth and one on his closing hole to earn himself a place. It was one of the most mentally challenging rounds of golf I have played, said the Asian PGA Tour 2003 Order of Merit winner. Yesterday, I struggled a bit, but today I hit the ball really well. The early bogeys were unsettling, but I was determined to put in my best effort and it paid off. Now I want to finish as high up the leader-board as I can, he said.  Copyright

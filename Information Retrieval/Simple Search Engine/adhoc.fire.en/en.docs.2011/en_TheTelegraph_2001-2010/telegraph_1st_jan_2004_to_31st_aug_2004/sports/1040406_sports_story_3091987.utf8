The Telegraph - Calcutta
 All eyes on Arsenal-Chelsea
 Ljungbergs injury is a worry for Wenger London: The all-London clash between Arsenal and Chelsea at Highbury on Tuesday is the highlight of this weeks Champions League quarter final, second-leg games. Delicately poised at 1-1, it is the only one of the four ties level after the first leg and comes hard on the heels of Arsenals FA Cup defeat by Manchester United on Saturday. Tuesdays other game looks much more straightforward as Real Madrid take a 4-2 lead to Monaco in the fight to meet the winners of the London derby in the semi-finals. Holders AC Milan also look likely to progress as they visit Deportivo La Coruna with a 4-1 advantage. Wednesdays other game sees Olympique Lyon trying to overturn a 0-2 deficit at home to Porto. The forthcoming fixtures appeared to be on the minds of many teams involved at the weekend as only two of the eight quarter-finalists managed domestic victories. Arsenals hopes of a treble disappeared with their 0-1 FA Cup defeat to Manchester United on Saturday but manager Arsene Wenger would happily swap domestic success for an elusive taste of glory in Europes premier competition. The Frenchmans north London side, which has never gone beyond the last eight, has the advantage in terms of the away goal secured by Robert Pires in a tight, cagey first leg and Chelsea have to score to have any chance of progressing. That has not proved a problem in the four games between the two teams this season but keeping goals out has  Arsenal won the three previous domestic encounters 2-1. However, Saturdays defeat to United, and the injuries to striker Jose Reyes and midfielder Freddie Ljungberg that came with it, have dented Arsenals confidence. Chelsea warmed up with their 12th Premier League away win of the season, 1-0 at Tottenham Hotspur courtesy of a Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink goal. Highbury, however, remains an exception. Chelsea lost there in league and FA Cup this season and have not won a major game at the ground since 1990. As if trying to turn round a 2-4 deficit against Real Madrid was not a tough enough prospect, Monaco will have to attempt it without several key players. Midfield duo Lucas Bernardi (suspended) and Andreas Zikos are both out, as is outstanding centre back Sebastien Squillaci. The French league leaders came from 0-3 down at half-time to draw 3-3 with AC Ajaccio on Friday and will need to show similar tenacity to have any chance of getting the minimum two goals required. Real, who will be without suspended England midfielder David Beckham, beat Albacete 2-1 away on Saturday with two deflected Roberto Carlos free-kicks. Milan chose to rest Brazilian Kaka for most of Sundays 1-1 draw at Modena but the on-song midfielder, who scored twice in first leg against Deportivo, should return to the starting line-up on Wednesday. Andriy Shevchenko, who missed Sundays game with a broken nose sustained playing for Ukraine last week, remains a doubt and Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson, who scored at Modena, is standing by to partner Filippo Inzaghi. The Spaniards drew 2-2 at home with Real Betis on Sunday. (Reuters)  Copyright

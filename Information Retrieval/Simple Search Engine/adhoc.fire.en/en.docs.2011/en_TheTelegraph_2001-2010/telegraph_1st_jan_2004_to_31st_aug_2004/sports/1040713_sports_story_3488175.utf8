The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies 256 ahead
 - SECOND TEST - Warne now four short of Muralis record  Matthew Hayden in action on the fourth day of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Cairns on Monday. (Reuters) Cairns: Shane Warne moved within four wickets of the world record as Australia bowled out Sri Lanka for 455 on the fourth day of the second Test Monday, giving the hosts a first innings advantage of 62. Australia reached 194 for two from 49 overs before the close of play for an overall lead of 256 runs with eight second innings wickets in hand. Resuming on their overnight score of 411 for five, Sri Lanka lost their last four wickets for 10 runs with leg spinner Warne finishing with three for 129 from 38 overs. The 34-year-old Warne now has 523 Test wickets, four behind Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan. Australian paceman Jason Gillespie also took three wickets as the hosts gave themselves a chance of clinching a 2-0 series win. First innings century-maker Matthew Hayden was unbeaten on 68 in Australias second innings with Damien Martyn blasting a quickfire 52 not out from 54 balls. Obviously, we will bat tomorrow for a period of time and then we will definitely be looking to have a crack at them, Gillespie told a news conference. There is not a lot of rough there but Shane is a quality bowler and he will be able to extract something out of that (pitch), the 29-year-old Gillespie added. He is every chance (to get five wickets). Hopefully we can put Sri Lanka under pressure. Sri Lanka coach John Dyson said the momentum was with Australia going into the final days play. They can dictate what happens. Weve got to try like crazy to limit their scoring, which we did pretty well after tea for a while until Damien Martyn came out and played a superb innings, Dyson told a news conference. Dyson appeared to be growing tired of questions about Warnes world record bid. Im not obsessed by this record. You guys are, but Im not and I dont think Shane is either, Dyson said. Because he knows that Murali will at some stage start playing again and go past him again and Shane might go past him again Justin Langer was the first man out in Australias second innings, caught behind off Nuwan Zoysa for eight in the second over. Hayden then put on 95 for the first wicket with captain Ricky Ponting who was caught at gully by Sanath Jayasuriya off the bowling of left-armer Zoysa for 45 at 105 for two. Martyn put on 89 for the third wicket with Hayden in just 74 minutes. Wet weather had wiped out the morning session and both teams took an early lunch before play started at 12.10 pm local time with Australia keen to make up for lost time. Glenn McGrath struck in the third over, when Romesh Kaluwitharana was caught at slip for 34 at 420 for six. Gillespie then removed Thilan Samaraweera for 70 and Chaminda Vaas for two, both caught by Ponting at second slip. Warne had fellow leg spinner Upul Chandana stumped on 19 and last man Lasith Malinga was run out without scoring.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

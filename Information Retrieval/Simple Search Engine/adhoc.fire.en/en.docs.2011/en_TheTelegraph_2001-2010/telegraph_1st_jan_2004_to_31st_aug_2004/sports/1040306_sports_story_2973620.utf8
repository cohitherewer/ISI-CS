The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saqlain, Afridi recalled
Lahore: Pakistan unveiled a surprise fast bowler  Ifthakar Rao  and recalled two top players  veteran off spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and allrounder Shahid Afridi  to play in the first two one-day Internationals against India starting next week. Also in the 16-member squad announced here is Shabbir Ahmed, just back from Australia where he had gone to correct his bowling action, and right-hand batsman Younis Khan who had been dropped after last years World Cup in which Pakistan had a disastrous run. The pace attack will be led by tearaway Shoaib Akhtar who will be supported by Mohammed Sami, allrounder Abdul Razzaq and Rao, whom chief selector Wasim Bari expects to be a surprise against the famed Indian line-up. The 23-year-old Rao bowls at about 135 kmph and is known to bowl a good line and length. His consistent outswingers and ability to extract bounce prompted the selectors to include him in the squad. He has been selected based on his performance in the domestic season where he bagged a lot of wickets, Bari said. The squad was decided after consultations with coach Javed Miandad and captain Inzamam-ul Haq. Inzamam said he was pleased with the composition of the team. I am quite happy. The best players who were available have been picked in the squad, he said. Justifying the inclusion of Saqlain and Shabbir, the skipper said: The team needed some experience. Saqlain has been performing well in first-class cricket. As far as Shabbir is concerned, he was terrific in the last series against New Zealand. Bari said Afridi had won back the favour of the selectors on account of being a good one-day player. Bari said Saqlain could prove to be handy in both forms of the game because of his experience. He also has a good record against India. The Pakistan A side was also named for the tour opening one-day warm-up game at the Gaddafi in Lahore on March 11. Taufeeq Umar was appointed captain of the squad. Meanwhile, the PCB has appointed a computer analyst in Khawar Rabbanito help the team.

(Reuters) London: Opener Mark Richardson scored a painstaking 93 on Thursday to take New Zealand to 284 for five on the opening day of the first Test against England at Lords. The left-hander was ably supported in a fifth wicket partnership of 106 at the end of the day by Jacob Oram who struck an unbeaten 64 in his first Test against England. Nathan Astle scored 64 from 77 deliveries with 11 boundaries, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 103 with Richardson, while captain Stephen Fleming contributed 34. New Zealand lost middle order wickets cheaply to the four-pronged England pace attack, with Simon Jones the most impressive of the bowlers, but England could not force home their advantage. Earlier, England took two quick wickets in five balls after Nathan Astle had briefly threatened to tear their attack apart. Astle, partnered by the obdurate Mark Richardson, took New Zealand to 161 for one during the afternoon session before he was caught behind off Andrew Flintoff. Scott Styris fell to Simon Jones four balls later in similar fashion for a duck. At tea the tourists were 172 for three after Stephen Fleming had won the toss and elected to bat. Richardson was at the crease on 56. Fleming, opening for only the second time in 83 Tests looked full of runs. But after reaching 34 he played a loose drive to Jones for debutant Andrew Strauss to take a smart catch in the gully. (Reuters)  Copyright

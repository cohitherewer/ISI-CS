 Jailed for beating umpire
London: A cricketer, involved in attacking an umpire who had given him out in a Sunday League match, has been jailed for three years. Mahmood Akhtar, 38, and his brother, Gulfam Zaqar, who was brandishing a baseball bat, charged on to the pitch in Keighley, West Yorks, and attacked Qadeer Hussain, breaking his arm, York Crown Court was told. Hussains teenage nephew was also attacked when he tried to help in one of Britains first recorded cases of cricket rage. Akhtar, a shopkeeper from Leeds, was batting in a local Sunday League match when he was sent back to the pavilion by Hussain, the stand-in umpire.  (PTI)  Copyright

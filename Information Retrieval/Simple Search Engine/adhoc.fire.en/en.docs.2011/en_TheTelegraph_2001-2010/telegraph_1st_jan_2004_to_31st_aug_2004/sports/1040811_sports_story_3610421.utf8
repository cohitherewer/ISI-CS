The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lee works out under Srinath
Chennai: With the Australian tour to India commencing in late September, Brett Lee is here to get first-hand knowledge on bowling in Indian conditions from former international Jawagal Srinath. Lee, who arrived here last night, spent time on Tuesday learning the tricks on slow bouncy Indian wickets from Srinath, T. A. Sekhar, chief coach of the MRF Pace Academy, said. Australian Cricket Academy lost their first match against MRF on Tuesday. Meanwhile, while a Test series win in India was the last unconquered frontier for Steve Waugh, the former captain hopes the Australian team under Ricky Ponting would break the drought. I had some good success against India but I think you cant win everything and you cant achieve everything you want to do, Waugh said. Some things are left for others to achieve and if they do win, Ill feel as I have played my part in that success anyway, Steve told a website. (PTI)  Copyright

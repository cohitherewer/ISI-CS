The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ajit Agarkar shines
London: Ajit Agarkar made up for the absence of Australian speedster Glenn McGrath as he put Middlesex on top on Day I of their County championship Division One match against Gloucestershire on Tuesday. Agarkar exploited the overcast conditions to grab three for 41 to reduce Gloucestershire to 133 for four by stumps on a truncated day at Lords. Agarkar dismissed Mike Hussey, caught in the deep to break a 79-run second wicket partnership between the Australian and Weston. He then followed it up with wickets of Chris Taylor and Alex Gidman, justifying his captains decision to bowl first.  (PTI)  Copyright

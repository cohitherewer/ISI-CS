The Telegraph - Calcutta
 5 ex-captains say yes to BCCIs Pak invite
 - Kirmani-headed selection committee to watch either Lahore or Rawalpindi Test at Indian boards expense BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Pataudi BordeWadekar Viswanath Vengsarkar Calcutta: Only five of the 15 former Test captains invited by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to visit Pakistan during either the Lahore or Rawalpindi Test have, thus far, responded positively. Incidentally, this thoughtful gesture  celebrating the latest Revival Tour  isnt a joint venture (as was on the cards initially) with Pakistan. While Chandu Borde, Gundappa Viswanath and Dilip Vengsarkar have opted to watch the second Test, in Lahore (from April 5), Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Ajit Wadekar are going to be in a VIP box during the third and final Test, in Rawalpindi (from April 13). According to The Telegraphs sources, Vijay Hazare, Polly Umrigar, D.K.Gaekwad and Nari Contractor have declined  apparently all on grounds of health. Of the other invitees, Bishan Singh Bedi, Sunil Gavaskar and Krishnamachari Srikkanth may not say yes owing to Media commitments. A positive response, though, is expected from Srinivas Venkatraghavan, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri. Significantly, the 16th living one-time captain, Mohammed Azharuddin, got ignored as (a) he has been banned for life over his involvement with match-fixing and (b) he has dragged the BCCI to court on that. Even if Azhar hadnt challenged the ban, it would have been awkward to club him with the Hazares, is how a source put it. The BCCI, by the way, will also be sending the Syed Kirmani-headed (senior) selection committee to watch either the Lahore or Rawalpindi Test. A formal announcement is expected on Monday afternoon, after the Test squad is picked in New Delhi. In yet another first, the BCCI has invited each affiliate to send one nominee as its guest, either for an ODI or a Test. The BCCI is picking up the tab for three days in the ODIs and, in the Tests, its going to be for a couple of days more. Watching the first Test, in Multan (from March 28), hasnt been offered as an option as the city has just one five-star hotel.The Elite List Yes to Lahore Test: Chandu Borde, Gundappa Viswanath, Dilip Vengsarkar.

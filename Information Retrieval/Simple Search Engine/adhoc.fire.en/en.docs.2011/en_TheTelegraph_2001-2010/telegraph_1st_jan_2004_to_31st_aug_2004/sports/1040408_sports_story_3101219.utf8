The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inter confident vs Marseille 
 - UEFA CUP QUARTER FINALS - Robson vs Hiddink clash in Eindhoven  Valencia will have to do without the injured Pablo Aimar London: Three-time winners Inter Milan and Olympique Marseille meet for the first time on the European stage in the most attractive of the UEFA Cup quarter-final, first leg ties on Thursday. The competition is the one remaining hope of silverware for both sides this season after disappointing Champions League and domestic campaigns. Inter head for Marseilles Stade Velodrome in confident mood with three successive Serie A victories re-igniting their challenge for Champions League qualification. At the beginning of the championship we started off with very important objectives and now we have the Uefa Cup and fourth place (in Serie A) left, Inter defender Fabio Cannavaro said. Marseille coach Jose Anigo believes his Ligue 1 side will be more confident facing Inter than they were against Liverpool in the previous round, when they secured a 3-2 aggregate victory. Anigo will have to do without injured striker Steve Marlet, and Egyptian Mido, who is suspended. Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson is certain to receive a great reception when he makes an emotional return to former club PSV Eindhoven. I spent three years of my managerial life at PSV, three happy years, three great years. PSV is a wonderful club, said Robson, who guided PSV to the Dutch title in his first season in charge in 1991 and repeated the feat the following year. Current PSV coach Guus Hiddink has had to contend with a stream of injuries to key players with his side almost certain to relinquish their league crown to Ajax Amsterdam. Winger Arjen Robben and midfielder Johann Vogel are still injured but defender Andre Ooijer is back in training. Danish winger Dennis Rommedahl returned from a three-month lay-off last weekend. Valencia coach Rafa Benitez is likely to continue his policy of rotating players for Uefa Cup matches when his side travels to Ligue 1 Girondins Bordeaux. Valencia, chasing Real Madrid hard for the Primera Liga title, will be without injured Argentine playmaker Pablo Aimar while versatile Miguel Angel Angulo is doubtful after suffering from a chest infection. Bordeauxs leading goalscorer Jean-Claude Darcheville, who may require knee surgery, will miss the game. Last seasons beaten finalists Celtic take on Spanish opposition for the second successive round in the shape of competition debutants Villarreal who visit Glasgow for the first leg. The runaway Scottish Premier League leaders overcame in-form Barcelona last time but boss Martin ONeill says Villarreal will prove just as tough. I watched Villarreals game against Barcelona (0-0) on Sunday night and it tells you everything about them, ONeill told the clubs website. Celtic are without long-term injury absentees John Kennedy, John Hartson, Ulrik Laursen and Shaun Maloney. Villarreal have played six Intertoto Cup and eight Uefa Cup games to reach this stage.

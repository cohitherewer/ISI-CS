 Ahmed action under scanner
 Ahmed can continue playing Wellington: Pakistan fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed has been placed on report for a suspect bowling action, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Sunday. The ICC said the report came from Australian umpire Darrell Hair and New Zealands Billy Bowden. Ahmed failed to take a wicket in his ten overs in the final ODI against New Zealand on Saturday, conceding 63 runs. The umpires asked to review footage of Ahmeds action from the match and after seeing this footage decided to report the bowler to the ICC, said ICC general manager David Richardson. This issue now comes under the ICCs regulations dealing with this matter and over the next six weeks Ahmed and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will have the opportunity to work on any areas of concern. Ahmed will be able to continue to play during this time. In 1995, Hair repeatedly called Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan for throwing during the Melbourne Test against Australia. In 1999, Hair and Peter Willey reported Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars action which led to a months ban. Under ICC regulations, Ahmed must now work with specialist advisors to be appointed by his home cricket board and a human movement specialist from an ICC specialist panel to review his action. A report will then submitted by the PCB to the ICC. If Ahmed is reported again by umpires, a formal hearing will then held by the ICCs bowling review group. If that happens, he may be banned from the game for 12 months or until the review group is satisfied that the concerns with his action are rectified. (AP)  Copyright

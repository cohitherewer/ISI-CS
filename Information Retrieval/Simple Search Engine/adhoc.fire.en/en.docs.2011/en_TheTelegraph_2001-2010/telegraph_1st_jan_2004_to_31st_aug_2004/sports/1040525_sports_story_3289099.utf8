Collina among foreign referees in FA plan
 Pierluigi Collina London: Italian referee Pierluigi Collina could be taking charge of Premiership matches next season after the FA unveiled plans to bring in foreign officials. FA (and Arsenal) vice-chairman David Dein said it was considering the idea of introducing a number of foreign officials in a bid to stamp out over-familiarity between English referees and players that he feels breeds prejudice. Dein revealed that English referees would continue to take charge of the vast majority of top-flight games, but feels the introduction of overseas officials could help in the big clashes. At 45 years of age, Collina  widely regarded as the worlds top referee  must retire in Italy at the end of this term but is still eligible to referee in the Premiership for a further three years. Hes one of several officials the FA is looking at introducing, Dein told a TV channel. I am in favour of introducing foreign referees into the Premier League  not for every game but maybe three or four times a season. Id like to see them because I think certain players do get targeted because of familiarity. And you look at the difference in the way foreign referees are treated by the players. They are definitely respected more. You dont see players swearing at them and when a foreign referee says thats it, players back off.  (AFP)  Copyright

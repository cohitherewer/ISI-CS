The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag, Kumble top averages
Islamabad, April 17 (PTI): Virender Sehwag and Anil Kumble topped the batting and bowling averages among both sides in the just concluded series. Sehwag, named Man-of-the-Series for scoring a triple century in Multan, finished with an aggregate of 438 runs at an average of 109.50. Golden ball winner Kumble snared 15 victims in the three-Test series at an average of 25.93 with a best performance of six for 72 in the second innings in Multan. Indias new-ball pair of Irfan Pathan (28.50) and Lakshmipathy Balaji (30.75) overshadowed their more hyped counterparts, capturing 12 wickets each in the three-match series that India won 2-1. The much-vaunted Pakistani bowlers cut a sorry figure with Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Danish Kaneria managing just seven wickets each. Vice-captain Rahul Dravid, who shaped the series-deciding victory in Rawalpindi, was placed second in the batting list with an aggregate of 309 runs at an average of 77.25. For the hosts, vice-captain Yusuf Youhana was the leading scorer with 280 runs at an average of 56. Skipper Inzamam-ul Haq was the second highest with 219 runs at an average of 43.80.  Copyright

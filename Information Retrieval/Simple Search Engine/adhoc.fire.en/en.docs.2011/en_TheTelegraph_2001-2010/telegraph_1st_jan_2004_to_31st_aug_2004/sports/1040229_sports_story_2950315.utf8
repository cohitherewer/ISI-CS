The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangladesh struggle 
Bulawayo, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Sean Ervine removed both openers as Zimbabwe ripped through Bangladeshs middle order, before rain forced an early end to play on the third day of the rain-delayed second Test on Saturday. Bangladesh, 0-1 down in the two-Test series, were put in to bat and limped to 88 for five in 37.1 overs. Play started an hour before lunch, after the first two days were wiped out without a ball being bowled. Openers Hannan Sarkar and Shahriar Hossain survived a testing spell by Heath Streak to reach the interval on 24 without loss.The pair upped the tempo in the afternoon and had put on 64 for the first wicket before Hossain drove at a wide delivery from Ervine to be caught behind. Three overs later, Habibul Bashar drove at a Streak out-swinger to be caught at by Travis Friend in the gully for four. Bangladesh, who have lost a record 21 Tests in a row, then slipped to 73 for three two balls later when Sarkar was bowled around his legs by Ervine.  Copyright

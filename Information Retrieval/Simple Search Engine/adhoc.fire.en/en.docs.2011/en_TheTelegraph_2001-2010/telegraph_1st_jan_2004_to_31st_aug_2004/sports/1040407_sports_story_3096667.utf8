				 																																	Melbourne: The first Grand Slam tournament of the season will start a week later in January 2007, Australian Open chief executive Paul McNamee said on Tuesday.				 																																	Australian Open officials have reacted to pressure from an international calendar working group by agreeing to start the 2007 tournament on January 22 but have ruled out a move to March.				 																																	The tournaments dates for the next three years are January 17-30 in 2005, January 16-29 in 2006 and January 22-February 4 the following year.				 																																	The move would give players an extra weeks break in the off-season, McNamee told a news conference. However, McNamee added he was also keen to see the season end a week earlier from 2006 onwards.				 																																	The Hopman Cup international mixed teams event in Perth, Western Australia, will be pushed back a week from its traditional new year starting date as part of the changes, Pollard said.				 																																	New Delhi: Sixth seed Sai Jayalakshmi became the first seeded player to be shown the door in the ITF womens tennis tournament when she went down to Shizu Katsumi of Japan 3-6, 6-4 in the opening round here on Tuesday.				 																																	Top seed Chia-Jung Chuang of Chinese Taipei and second seed Rushmi Chakravarthi moved into the second round in contrasting styles. While Rushmi beat Yan Chong Chen of China 6-4, 6-2 Chuang beat Mari Inque of Japan 6-4, 6-4. Two other seeded Indians in the fray  seventh seed Ankita Bhambri and eighth seed Sonal Phadke  won easily. Sonal thrashed qualifier Geeta Manohar 6-2, 6-1 while Ankita defeated wild card Parul Goswami 6-2, 6-3. 				 																																	Lisbon: Canadian-born singer Nelly Furtados Forca has been chosen as the official song of the Euro 2004 soccer championship being held in Portugal, tournament organisers said on Monday. Furtado, who was born in Canada to Portuguese emigrant parents from the Azores, will sing the song as part of the entertainment before the final at the Stadium of Light on July 4 and is likely to release a new version in Portuguese.				 																																	Zurich: Fifa has entered its centennial year of 2004 on a solid financial footing after recording a profit of 141 million Swiss francs ($111.1 million) last year, world soccers governing body said on Tuesday.				 																																	Fifa president Sepp Blatter said he was delighted that the organisation had recorded such healthy results in the first year of its 2003-06 World Cup cycle.				 																																	Our finances are healthy in every respect, Blatter said in a statement. We can now celebrate the FIFA centennial safe in the knowledge that we have built upon our forefathers legacy and done everything in our power to guarantee a successful future.				 																																	The federation was presenting its annual results for the second time since allegations of financial mismanagement surrounded Fifas presidential campaign in 2002.				 																																	Blatter was cleared of financial mismanagement by a Swiss court and last year won damages for defamation.				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Former Brazil international Rivelino, the 1970 World Cup player famous for his so-called banana free-kicks, resigned as technical director of Corithians on Monday after six months at the trouble-hit club.

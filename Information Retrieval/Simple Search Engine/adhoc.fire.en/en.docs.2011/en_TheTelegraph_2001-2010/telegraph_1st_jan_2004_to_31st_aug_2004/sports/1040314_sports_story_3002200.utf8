The Telegraph - Calcutta
 KCA brass to meet tomorrow
 Maurice Odumbe Nairobi: Kenyan cricket chiefs will hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the match-fixing allegations surrounding former national captain Maurice Odumbe, officials said on Saturday. On Friday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said Odumbe would face a formal hearing in May, but Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) secretary Sharad Ghai said no official word had yet been received from the ICC. We cant comment at this early stage, but we will meet on Monday to discuss how to march forward, he said. Jimmy (Rayani, KCA chairman) is away in Australia and we need to put our heads together and deliberate on it in detail, given the seriousness of the matter. Odumbe told Reuters: I cant comment until I receive formal communication because I dont know what the allegations are and which matches were fixed. The ICC said in a statement on Friday that the Odumbe hearing was the result of an investigation by the organisations Anti-Corruption and Security Unit. It added that former Zimbabwe Supreme Court Judge Ahmed Ebrahim had been appointed to conduct the hearing, which was expected to take place in Kenya.  Reuters)  Copyright

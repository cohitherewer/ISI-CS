The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Test results fabricated, says drug company
San Francisco, May 22 (Reuters): The California laboratory at the centre of a doping scandal threatening track and field athletes said Friday that no positive test results for steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs were found at the lab. And in a statement, Robert Holley, the lawyer for BALCO Laboratories head Victor Conte, added that reports of positive test results for athletes are nothing more than a fabrication. The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that investigators had found records indicating that Conte had sent blood or urine samples of athletes to another lab, Quest Diagnostics, and that this was among the evidence gathered by federal agents. The San Francisco Chronicle said these private test results, once confiscated, were among the evidence subpoenaed by a Senate committee and given over to the anti-doping agency. There were no positive test results for steroids or any other performance enhancing drugs found at BALCO, said Holley.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Brett Lee back in Australian XI
 - Thommo advice for Aussie tearaway: Become smarter by putting the ball in right areas  Ponting feels the  rest will do Lee good  Streak hints at change  in batting orderMelbourne: Australia have recalled paceman Brett Lee and spinner Brad Hogg for Fridays triangular series one-day match against Zimbabwe in Hobart. Lee and Hogg, members of last years World Cup-winning side, were overlooked for Australias opening two matches. They will replace fast bowler Jason Gillespie and allrounder Ian Harvey, who have been given rest. Australia began the series with an 18-run win over India before crushing Zimbabwe by 99 runs. India scored their first victory by beating the Africans by seven wickets at Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Wednesday. He (Lee) probably wasnt (bowling well) a couple of weeks ago and thats why we decided to give him a rest, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said in Hobart on Thursday. I think he was a bit tired, which was hindering the way he could bowl and the way he could perform, so weve given him a bit of time to recover and Im sure youll see him perform better over the next couple of weeks. Lee, 27, missed the first two matches of the drawn four-Test series against India because of an ankle injury. The 27-year-old took eight wickets at an average of 59.5 in the final two Tests in Melbourne in December and Sydney earlier this month, bowling 37 no-balls. One of the worlds fastest bowlers, Lee appeared to lack rhythm and his length was often too short or too full, drawing heavy media criticism including career advice from former Australia paceman Jeff Thomson. Thomson told local newspapers on Thursday: I like Brett but I think there have been a lot of excuses made for him. I just think he has to become a smarter bowler and put the ball in areas which are going to get wickets... It is time for him to shape up. Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak scored an unbeaten 59 against India and was also among runs in the first game against Australia. Sean Ervine struck an unbeaten 49 against India but none of the other batsmen, barring young Tatenda Taibu, have been able to make much of an impression. But more than the string of low scores, the poor technique shown by the top order batsmen has been the worrying factor. Vusi Sibanda, Stuart Carlisle, Mark Vermeulen and even the experienced Grant Flower have got out because of their technical flaws more than anything else. We may have to change the batting order and see how things go. Ervine or I could come up the order as we have got some decent scores under our belt, he said. Streak said his beleaguered team needs to put on the thinking cap and devise ways to put pressure on the opposition. We did not put enough runs on the board. We struggled from the beginning and never really got on top of our opponents. We did not put enough runs on the board. We struggled from the beginning and never really got on top of our opponents, Streak said. We have to put our hands up now and put some runs on the board to exert pressure on the opposition. India and Australia are two good teams and we need to put the thinking cap on and see what works for us, he said. TEAMS Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Andrew Symonds, Michael Clarke, Michael Bevan, Brad Hogg, Andy Bichel, Brett Lee, Brad Williams. Zimbabwe: Heath Streak (captain), Vusimuzi Sibanda, Stuart Carlisle, Mark Vermeulen, Grant Flower, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Tatenda Taibu, Sean Ervine, Andy Blignaut, Ray Price, Douglas Hondo.

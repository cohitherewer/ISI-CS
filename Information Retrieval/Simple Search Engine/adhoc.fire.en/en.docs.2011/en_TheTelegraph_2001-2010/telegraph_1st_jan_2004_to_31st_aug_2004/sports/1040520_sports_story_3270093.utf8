 Bashar helps Bangla to 118
St Georges: Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar hit 42 off 45 balls, his first double-figure score of the series, but the team could only muster 118 for seven wickets off 25 overs against the West Indies on Wednesday.  Heavy overnight rains reduced the series final match from 50 overs an innings to its minimum of 25. Bashar had to revive the innings from a shaky start of 18 for two after openers Hannan Sarkar and Mohammed Ashraful were out cheaply.  Dwayne Smith was the best West Indies bowler with three for 24 from four overs. Tino Best was restricted to three of his five overs by a strained hamstring and had to leave the field for medical attention.  (AP)  Copyright

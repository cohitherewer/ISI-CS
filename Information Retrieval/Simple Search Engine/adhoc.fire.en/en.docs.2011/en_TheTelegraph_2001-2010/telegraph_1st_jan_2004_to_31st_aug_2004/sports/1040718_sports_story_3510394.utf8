The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan desperate as EB look beyond
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 17: The seasons first East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan clash comes rather early. Sundays Salt Lake Stadium showdown catches both teams under-prepared and working towards contrasting goals. The following are excerpts of what the two coaches said on match-eve:  Subhas Bhowmick: I am more concerned about winning the first match in England and playing the final in the Leicester City 120th anniversary meet. In England, we will play against Real Mallorca, Leicester City and Maritimo (Portugal). East Bengals rating is much higher than Indias rating as a country on the Fifa list. It means we are the flag bearers of the nation. I understand that for supporters, the Mohun Bagan clash is very important, but for me the meet in England is more important.  Subrata Bhattacharya: No team can be in any real good shape after such a short period of practice. Moreover, there are about nine new faces in our side, who have no idea about the road to success on the Calcutta Maidan. East Bengal have, more or less, managed to keep their last seasons team intact. My young players will feel the pressure of a big match.  Copyright

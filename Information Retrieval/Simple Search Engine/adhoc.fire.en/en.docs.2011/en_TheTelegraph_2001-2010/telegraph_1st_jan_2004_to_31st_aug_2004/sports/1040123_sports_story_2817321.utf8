 Manslaughter charge on attacker
 Hookes Melbourne: A man charged over an assault that led to the death of former Australian Test cricketer David Hookes was also charged with manslaughter on Thursday, court officials said. Zdravko Micevic, 21, was originally charged with assault but a second charge of manslaughter was added when he made a brief appearance at the Melbourne magistrates court. Local media reported that Micevics lawyer Brian Rolfe told the court his client would plead not guilty to both charges. Micevic was released on bail and told to reappear on April 13. The charge carries a maximum of 14 years in jail. Rolfe also said his client had been receiving hate mail and death threats. Hookes died on Monday night after suffering serious head injuries and a heart attack in an assault outside a Melbourne pub in the Bayside suburb of St Kilda where Micevic worked as a security guard. Survived by wife and two stepchildren, his funeral will be held next Tuesday in Adelaide., the capital of his home state of South Australia. He was the current coach of the Victoria state cricket team and a television and radio commentator.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies to keep pressure up
	 - SECOND TEST 
- Our batsmen should contribute more: Atapattu  Shane Warne and Allan Border chat during a training session in Cairns on Thursday, the eve of the second Test between Australia and Sri Lanka. (Reuters) Cairns, July 8 (Reuters): Australia captain Ricky Ponting said on Thursday he was strongly considering sending Sri Lanka in to bat first in Fridays second Test to capitalise on the touring sides poor batting form. Sri Lanka were bowled out in Darwin last week for 97 and 162 in the first Test as Australia clinched victory by 149 runs inside three days. There might be a little bit of moisture about tomorrow morning, Ponting told a news conference in Cairns. If conditions suggest you should bowl that will certainly come into consideration in the morning. Their batsmen are going to be under pressure coming into this Test the way they batted in the first game. Ponting, who missed last weeks first Test because of a family death, said his tactical thinking for the second Test was influenced by former skipper Steve Waugh. Thats the way he used to think. When you have got them under pressure, get them back out there as soon as you can again and try and keep them under pressure, Ponting said. For a bowler like Glenn (McGrath), who lands the ball in the right area most of the time, hell make the most of these conditions and Im sure youll see him bowl well. Ponting said his players were all behind the world record attempt by leg-spinner Shane Warne, who needs eight wickets to pass Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharans world mark of 527. This record would mean a fair bit to Shane and the team if he managed to do that, Ponting said. Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu said himself, fellow opener Sanath Jayasuriya and the next two batsmen in the order, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, needed to make big scores to put the side in a winning position. We havent been let down by our bowling in the recent past, even without Murali, Atapattu told a news conference on Thursday. Its the batsmen who should contribute more. We are working on that. Hopefully it will come sooner rather than later. TEAMS Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Simon Katich, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath. Sri Lanka (likely): Maravan Atapattu (captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Thilan Samaraweera, Russel Arnold/Romesh Kaluwitharana, Chaminda Vaas, Upul Chandana, Nuwan Zoysa, Lasith Malinga.

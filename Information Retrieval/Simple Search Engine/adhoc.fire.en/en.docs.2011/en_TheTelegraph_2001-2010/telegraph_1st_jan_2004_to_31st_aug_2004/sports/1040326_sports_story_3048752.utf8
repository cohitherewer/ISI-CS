 Produce evidence or shut up: ICC
London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has called on anyone making claims of corruption within the game to produce evidence or withdraw the allegations. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said media speculation surrounding the one-day series between India and Pakistan, which the Indians won 3-2 on Wednesday, needed to be supported by evidence if it was to be treated seriously. Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif, commenting on the fourth one-day International in Lahore on Sunday, said: Even a common man could observe that the players were acting on a script because the body language of the players was not as it should have been. Speed said in a statement on Wednesday: We have all seen the opinions of various people that have been aired in the media and they all share a common theme  they are all long on speculation but short on evidence. The PCB has also threatened Latif with legal action for suggesting the one-dayer might have been fixed.Speed stressed that the ICCs Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) has the systems in place to deal with any malpractice in an international match. The ICC now has in place an experienced and well-resourced team to deal with these types of issues. The ACU team is in Pakistan and it is alert to the dangers posed by the amount of betting that is taking place on these matches. With the people and processes now in place for international cricket matches the ICC has built a strong defence against the dangers of corruption.  (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nabi gets Md. Sp. a crucial point
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Salgaocar fade out in second half  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Mohammedan Sportings Chidi Edeh wins an aerial battle with Mahindra United players at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: It was a tale of two halves in Mondays National Football League (NFL) encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium. In the end, Mohammedan Sporting must have rued missing out on full points versus Mahindra United. The visitors from Goa went ahead through Jatin Bist, a minute from the breather. But Mohammedan Sporting came back strongly and deservedly equalised in the 74th minute, thanks to Syed Rahim Nabis opportunism. The 1-1 result took Salgaocars tally to 18 points from 14 matches, while the NFL debutants went up to 14. Splitting a point with the former NFL champions is certain to provide relief to Mohammedan Sporting  who are still not out of relegation zone. Coach Jamshed Nassiri, though, was not smiling at the end of the day. I needed three points from this match and we certainly came close to achieving it. Lack of experience and maturity in our striking zone denied us those precious points. Now I have to win the next two matches to have at least some breathing space for the time being, Nassiri said. Savio Mediera, his opposite number, admitted his boys played a poor game. It was no hard luck story. We simply didnt play good enough to beat them, he pointed out. However, there is no denying the fact that the first half belonged to the visitors. Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Amar Deb brilliantly saved a quick flick-on from Climax Lawrence in the 21st minute. Three minutes later, Jules Alibas header went inches above the crossbar. Nassiris team found it tough to penetrate the danger zone on the back of long crosses from the wings. The opening goal was as much a reflection of Bists quick reaction as the lack of communication between Mohammedan Sporting central defender Satish Bharti and right-back Syed Hossain. None of them covered an innocuous Bernard Pires cross from the right, allowing Bist ample time to drive home from close. Mohammedan Sporting immediately responded with a nice move, Nabi failing to get close to an inviting pass from Dipendu Biswas. That also signalled the end of the first half, but promised signs of a Mohammedan Sporting fightback after change of ends. Okoli Onyeka Odafa, set up by Nabi top of the box, came up with a feeble attempt soon after resumption. The Nigerian striker went one better in the 60th minute, shooting wide of the mark with only goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar in front of him. It was left to Nabi to restore parity, as he took advantage of a silly mistake from Rajat. The former India goalkeeper failed to hold on to an Odafa drive and Nabi, lurking nearby, pounced on the rebound.

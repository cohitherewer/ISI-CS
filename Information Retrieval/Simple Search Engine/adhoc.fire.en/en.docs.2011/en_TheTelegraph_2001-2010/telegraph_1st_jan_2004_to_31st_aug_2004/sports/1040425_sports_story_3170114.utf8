The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pole for Dalal, Amittrajit fourth
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, April 24: Gaurav Dalal qualified in pole position in the FISSME class for the second round of the JK Tyre National Racing Championship at the newly-opened Kari Motor Speedway in Coimbatore. According to information reaching here, Calcuttas Amittrajit Ghosh qualified at P4 position, behind Dalal, Jigar Muni and Gaurav Gill. Sarosh Hataria and Gurunath Meiyappan followed. The first round was held in Calcutta, and the next two rounds will be in Chennai and Goa. Meiyappan got pole in the Saloon Class, while Rajvirdhan was pole in the Formula LGB category. All the finals will be run on Sunday. For Ghosh it was a rush. He had to write his exams before flying out and then catching a train to Coimbatore, reaching this morning. However, though Ghosh seems more comfortable with the high powered cars, he decided not to risk changing pace this race and stuck to the 800cc.  Copyright

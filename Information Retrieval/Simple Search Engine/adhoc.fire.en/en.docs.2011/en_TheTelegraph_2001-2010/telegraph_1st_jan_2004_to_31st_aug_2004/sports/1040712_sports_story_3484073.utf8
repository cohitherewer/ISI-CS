The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Raman, Temjen doubtful starters
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Raman Vijayan Calcutta: Having logged full points in their first Super Division outing, Mohammedan Sporting are charged up to collect another three against Peerless SC at the Barasat Stadium on Monday. We will play an attacking game tomorrow, though the few injuries we have, Mohammedan Sporting coach Mridul Banerjee said on Sunday. According to Banerjee, captain Raman Vijayan and Temjen Kibang are doubtful starters against Peerless. Vijayan also missed the clubs opening match against CFC. But Temjens absence, no doubt, will be a big blow for the black-and-white camp. I havent yet decided who will replace Temjen, as all are junior players, Banerjee said. The team, which has been relegated from the National League last season, comprises of a bulk of immature players. And for quite obvious reasons, the coach has already asked for two foreigners  one stopper and one striker. We need a couple of players immediately to keep our hopes alive in the Super Division. Banerjee feels that an early goal in the match, will release the pressure from the glamour outfits to some extent. If we get an early goal, that will put the Peerless players on the back foot and we will have to take advantage of that, said Banerjee. But the Mohammedan Sporting coach seemed a bit sceptical while talking about the opponents. Peerless are a good side and the problem is, I dont know about their strengths and weaknesses, said Banerjee.  Copyright

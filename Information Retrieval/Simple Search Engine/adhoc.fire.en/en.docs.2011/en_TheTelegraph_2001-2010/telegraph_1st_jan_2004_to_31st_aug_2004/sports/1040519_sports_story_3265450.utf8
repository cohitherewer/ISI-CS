 Beckham steals show on Keowns day
 - England captain may well have played his last game in Spain on Sunday  BY MARK HODGKINSON  England Select XIs David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne line up ahead of the Martin Keown testimonial match against Arsenal at Highbury on Monday. (Reuters) Always a cult hero rather than a millionaire megastar, Martin Keown was upstaged at his own sell-out testimonial last night even though his Arsenal side beat an England XI 6-0. For all the eulogies to the Arsenal defender, Highbury was more concerned by the sight of David Beckham playing football in North London. Even if Beckham only touched the ball only four times. The England captain, who had flown in from Spain to honour the long-standing commitment to his friend, was refused permission by paymasters Real Madrid from taking any proper part at the last moment. Jermain Defoe passed to him from kick-off and it had been thought that Beckham would then immediately depart. But the midfielder stayed around for a free-kick, a short pass and a longer one  a three-minute farce that ended with his substitution by Paul Gascoigne. It is understood that, on arrival in late afternoon, Beckham had fully expected to play most of the 90 minutes. Negotiations were believed to have continued up until kick-off with Beckham, who had played against Real Murcia on Sunday night, appearing for a lengthy warm-up. Madrids decision to withdraw their summer galactico seemed a strange one, especially since Beckham had gone a little loco during their fourth straight league defeat, a 1-2 loss to an already-relegated club that made it the worst run of results in their 102-year history. Beckham called the linesman hijo de puta [son of a bitch], an outburst that showed that his conversational Spanish is coming on nicely, but also led to his second red card of the season and meant that he will miss Madrids final game of the season against Real Sociedad. With continued whispers that Beckham is moving to London next season  either Arsenal or Chelsea  he may well have played his final game in Spain. Beckham did not appear to be overly delighted by his clubs intervention. The testimonial marked the glorious close of a summer weekend of Islington parties. Keown, who had sung his own name from the balcony of the Town Hall on Sunday afternoon, last night heard 38,000 fans chant it for the final time in his Arsenal career. The 37-year-old  who needed a few late, late substitutions to make up the 10 appearances needed for a championship medal  had the opportunity to score a first-half penalty after goalkeeper Robert Green brought down Edu. Keown, however, scuffed it left for an easy save. Green, the Norwich City keeper, got the ironic boos from the Arsenal supporters but it did not mattered, with the home XI already in a 2-0 lead at half-time. Ashley Cole back-heeled the first with Jeremie Aliadiere scoring the second. The delicious irony, of course, to the Beckham situation involved the watching England head coach Sven Goran Eriksson. He had given permission for Beckham  and five others of the 23-man squad for Euro 2004 that he had named earlier in the day  to take part. Arsene Wenger, who had started 72 hours of partying by steering his team to a 2-1 win against Leicester City and an unbeaten Premiership season, saw his Spanish striker Jose Antonio Reyes score a hattrick of goals. Another who wanted to take centre stage off the host for the evening, Aliadiere, scored his second. As for Keown? Was he immortal? Highbury thought so. Invincible? As above. Invisible? Even with Beckham-gate, not quite. When Keown was withdrawn towards the close of this light-hearted affair, he was given a warm, heartfelt, standing ovation from the supporters he had served for so many years. The hard man nearly shed a tear.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

 Murali faces fresh charge
 The problem is with Muralis wrong un Colombo: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who is close to overtaking Courtney Walshs 519 Test wickets record, has been reported for a suspect bowling action. ICC Match Referee Chris Broad announced his decision after the final Test on Sunday, won by Australia to complete a series whitewash (report on S2). Murali enjoyed a prolific series against Australia, claiming 28 wickets to extend his career tally to 513, in sight of Walshs 519 though four behind Shane Warne. The reporting of Murali revives a controversy surrounding which dates back over eight years when he was called for throwing in a Test match in Australia. I informed the Sri Lanka team management that a report had been lodged with the ICC concerning the action of Muttiah Muralidharan, particularly when he bowls his new delivery that turns away from the right-handers, said Broad. The concern is that this ball may be delivered with an action that is not in accordance with the laws of the game and accordingly I have submitted this report for further investigation. Murali will now start the ICCs new streamlined two-stage process for dealing with bowlers with suspect actions. The Lankan board will be responsible for the reviewing before submitting a report to the ICC within six weeks. Throughout this period  which includes a two-Test tour of Zimbabwe from mid-April  Muralidharan will be able to play for Sri Lanka. The report will then be circulated to the ICCs umpires and referees. If Muralidharan is reported again within a 12-month period then stage two of the process will be automatically started and his action will be reviewed by an ICC-appointed Bowling Review Group. The Sri Lankan board released a statement after the close of play of Sunday, saying: We have already initiated action in co-ordination with the SLC Cricket Committee and Bowling Review Group to work with Muralidharan in compliance with the process that it is in place with the ICC. Sri Lanka Cricket will vigorously support Muralidharan through this process and are confident that he will continue to play for his country and clear any doubts with regard to his bowling action. Hashan steps down Hashan Tillekeratne resigned as Test captain after the third Test. He was appointed as an interim Test skipper after the resignation of Sanath Jayasuriya last year but won just one Test in his 10-match tenure. I am stepping down as captain because it is high time that someone should take over and I can concentrate on my batting. I have spoken to the selectors and they have accepted my resignation, he said (Reuters)  Copyright

 New play-off
Augusta: The format for a US Masters play-off has been changed for this weeks event for the first time since 1976, organisers announced on Wednesday. Should extra holes of sudden death be needed to decide this years winner at Augusta National, the play-off will start at the 465-yard 18th instead of at the 495-yard 10th. We think this is a more exciting format, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Hootie Johnson said. (REUTERS)  Copyright

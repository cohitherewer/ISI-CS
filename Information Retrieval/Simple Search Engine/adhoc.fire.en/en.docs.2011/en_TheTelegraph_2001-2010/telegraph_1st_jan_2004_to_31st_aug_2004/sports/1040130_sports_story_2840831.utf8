The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Washout in Melbourne
Melbourne: Rain thwarted Zimbabwes hopes of registering their first victory in the tri-series after they had restricted Australia to 263 for nine at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. A half-century by Michael Bevan helped the world champions reach a competitive total after they had been reduced to 155 for five. But there was bad news for Bevan as he has been ruled out for the rest of the tri-series with a fractured rib. Rains, which had caused a 45-minute interruption during the Australian innings, visited again during the lunch break and never stopped. The match was called off when there was no let-up in downpour after two hours wait. The teams shared three points each from the no-result. The Africans have six points and are left with one match against India on Tuesday in the round-robin stage. Australia (31) and India (23) have already made it to the best-of-three finals. Zimbabwe once again came up with a tidy bowling performance after Heath Streak won the toss and asked Australia to bat first in overcast conditions. Streaks men produced some inspired cricket as they effected three run outs that took the wind out of the Australians sails. Streak himself picked two for 47 but Andy Blignaut was brilliant on the field, running out the dangerous Bevan and Ian Harvey besides taking a catch in the deep to dismiss Brett Lee in the final over. It was Bevans 56, including just three fours, that gave the world champions a fighting total, one which had looked impossible after the top order failure. Damien Martyn broke his run of poor scores with a quickfire 42 that came from 40 balls with eight fours before he was snared by a Streak delivery that nipped back and struck him in front of the stumps.

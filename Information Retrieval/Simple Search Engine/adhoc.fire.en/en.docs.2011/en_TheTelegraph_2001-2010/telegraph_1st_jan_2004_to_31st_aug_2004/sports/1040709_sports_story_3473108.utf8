The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A test for the best in trying times
 Greene will attempt to show he is still the king of 100m Sacramento, July 8 (Reuters): Historically a meeting with the sparkle and tension of the Olympic Games, this years US trials starting on Friday are a test not only of Americas best but of the sport itself. In a setting less than three hours drive from the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), alleged to be at the heart of a doping scandal which threatens to engulf the sport, the United States will pick their team for next months Athens Olympics. It is here that triple Olympic champion Marion Jones, returning after giving birth to her first child last year, will attempt to shake off a spring and early summer of disappointment and again make the US team in the 100 and 200 metres and long jump. It is here that Olympic champion Maurice Greene will attempt to show he still the king of the 100 metres. Veteran hurdlers Gail Devers and Allen Johnson will take their first steps towards more gold while emerging 1,500 metres runner Alan Webb and shot putter Christain Cantwell will bid to make their first Olympic team. Yet, reminders of the BALCO scandal will not be far away. Six athletes, including Joness partner and 100 metres world record holder Tim Montgomery, will compete although they are awaiting hearings on doping charges. Even the sports biggest female name, Jones, is under scrutiny by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) although she has never failed a doping test and has denied ever using performance-enhancing drugs. Weve had trying times as an organisation over the past 25 years, USA Track amp; Field chief executive Craig Masback told his board of directors this week. But nothing is more challenging or dispiriting than the situation in which we find ourselves. Instead of a daily celebration of our great sport and our outstanding athletes, newspapers around the world are delivering news of scandal and shame related to some of our athletes and coaches. Masback blamed the scandal on a small sub-culture of cheating athletes and coaches whom he said believe that using performance-enhancing substances was an acceptable route to success. For Jones, the trial is on the track. The five-time Olympic medallist at Sydney has run poorly outdoors this season, finishing an uncharacteristic fifth in her last 100 metres. Greene, healthy again after breaking his leg in a motorcycle accident in 2002, will be challenged in the 100m by a covey of sprinters, including a pair of former world indoor champions, Shawn Crawford and Justin Gatlin, and world 200 metres champion John Capel. Capel, Crawford, Gatlin and Darvis Patton will to be the runners to watch in the 200 metres. Crawford has the fastest 100 metres in the world this year of 9.88 seconds.  Copyright

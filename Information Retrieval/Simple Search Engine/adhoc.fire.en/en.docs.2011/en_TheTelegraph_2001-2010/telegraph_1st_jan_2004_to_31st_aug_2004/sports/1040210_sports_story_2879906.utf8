The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA starting afresh in NZ
 Shaun Pollock tries out rugby in Auckland on Monday Auckland: The South African team arrived in New Zealand on Monday looking for batsman-friendly conditions in the six-match one-day series. However, captain Graeme Smith announced he has no problems if the wickets are being prepared to suit the home team. The Proteas begin with a warm-up match against Northern Districts in Hamilton on Wednesday and play the first ODI against the Black Caps in Auckland on Friday. A three-Test series follows next month. The South Africans are fresh from a home Test and one-day series win over the West Indies. We are starting afresh, he said. Hopefully they will prepare the best wickets possible for one-day cricket, Smith said, adding he had no problems with the home side getting favourable conditions.  (AFP)  Copyright

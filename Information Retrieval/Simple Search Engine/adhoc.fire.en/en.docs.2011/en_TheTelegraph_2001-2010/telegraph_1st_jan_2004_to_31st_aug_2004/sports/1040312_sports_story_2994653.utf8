The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England take early honours
	 - FIRST TEST Kingston: England made a good start to their attempt to win a series in the Caribbean for the first time in 36 years as they reduced the West Indies to 81 for three at lunch on Day I of the first Test, including the prized wicket of captain Brian Lara. Lara and Devon Smith added 51 for the third wicket as the home side recovered from 22 for two but Simon Jones, playing in only his third Test and first since injuring his knee 16 months ago, had Lara caught for 23 just before the interval. Smith was unbeaten on 42, while Shivnarine Chanderpaul was on one at lunch. Lara chose to bat on a good-looking pitch, but must have been ruing the decision when Chris Gayle (five) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (nought) were dismissed within 40 minutes. Gayle smashed one shot over cover off Matthew Hoggard before he played back to Steve Harmison and deflected the ball onto his stumps. Sarwan was then trapped in front by Hoggard. Lara then joined Smith and after a couple of streaky boundaries behind square, he found his timing, with one lovely flick off his legs bringing up one of his four boundaries. Englands game plan appeared to attack outside Laras off stump in an attempt to entice a rash shot and it almost paid dividends when he lifted a ball from Jones just over the outstretched hand of Ashley Giles at cover point. But the respite was only brief as Lara edged a Jones delivery to Andrew Flintoff, who took the easy catch at second slip, in the Glamorgan bowlers next over. After a nervous start, the left-handed Smith took the attack to the England bowlers, striking eight boundaries in his 42. Harmison bowled with genuine pace in a seven-over spell to have session figures of one for 17.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

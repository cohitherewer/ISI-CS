 Jadhav puts Maharashtra in command
Pune: Opener Dhiraj Jadhav hit a brilliant unbeaten 124 as Maharashtra reached a healthy 285 for three against Madhya Pradesh on Day I of the Ranji Trophy plate championship final here Friday. Electing to bat, the hosts lost an early wicket on 14 when Niranjan Godbole (6) was snared by N. Ojha off Shantanu Pitre. But Jadhav and captain Hrishikesh Kanitkar (55) shared a 124-run second-wicket partnership to take the hosts to a position of strength. After Kanitkars dismissal at 138, Jadhav continued the good work and completed his century, which included 17 boundaries. Kaushik Aphale also chipped in with an useful 49 (8x4) before being castled by leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani. The hosts were three for 218 when Aphale got out, but Jadhav and Dhruv Mohan (36) ensured that they do not lose any more wickets. For Madhya Pradesh, Shantanu Pitre (two for 48) and Narendra Hirwani (one for 72) were the successful bowlers.

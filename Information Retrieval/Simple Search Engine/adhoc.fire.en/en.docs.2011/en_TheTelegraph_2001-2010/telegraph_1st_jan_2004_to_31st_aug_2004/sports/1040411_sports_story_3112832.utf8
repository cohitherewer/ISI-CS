The Telegraph - Calcutta
Checks and balances needed for umpires
- Rawalpindi a great opportunity for India to get rid of the inconsistent tag
 BY HARBHAJAN SINGH A critical element of the Lahore Test was the umpiring. I would say that this, more than anything else, took the match away from us. There were some bad decisions  Imran Farhat looked out on 99 and so did Inzamam-ul Haq and Yusuf Youhana at least twice during their decisive partnership. Our bowlers toiled hard but were clearly hard done by the umpiring. To make matters worse, Parthiv Patel also copped a fine. A cricketer is bound to give vent to his frustration if even clear-cut catches are denied to his team. The least he could do is to appeal and the next thing that happens is that he is hauled up and punished. The authorities must try to introduce the right element of checks and balances on umpires. If a series that has been played in an exemplary spirit is in danger of being ruined by incompetent umpiring, then surely the matter cannot be allowed to go out of hand. This was a disappointing Test for Indian fans after the high at Multan. I am surprised by the failure of our batsmen in both the innings. I dont remember it to have happened in recent memory. India have, in the recent past, squandered leads in Test series abroad  we have won a Test, and unfortunately followed that up with a defeat in the next. Word is doing the rounds that India are an inconsistent team. Even a draw in this Test would have suppressed this growing din. I dont think the decision to bat first was a bad one. Rahul Dravid couldnt have decided on it all alone, it must have been a team decision. We must remember that despite the green look of the wicket, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami had not been able to swing the ball. It could well have been a masterpiece of a decision, but for one man  Umar Gul. He got the ball to swing both ways, and his one spell doomed us. It was a kind of spell that could have scuttled any batting line-up in the world. But Yuvraj Singh showed in this Test that he is ready for Test cricket. He has become an extremely mature batsman and is capable of pulling a team out of a crisis. He is not intimidated by pace and is flexible enough to change his game according to situation.  I dont think there are many batsmen in this game that hit the ball harder than Yuvraj Singh. He is one of the cleanest strikers in the game today and what is better, he can also defend should the need arise. And of course, Yuvraj should play the final Test. He is the in-form batsman. I am sure it is going to be tough on someone but the team management would have to make room for Yuvraj in the XI. In the Lahore Test, Rahul Dravids run out in the second innings was a major turning point. The situation was just right for Rahul to anchor the innings and play out two days, but to get run out without facing a ball is one of the most disappointing ways of getting out. Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman had an average match, but they are too good to fail again. Had we played well in the second innings and got a lead of around 150, Pakistan would have found it difficult to counter our bowlers in the last two sessions of the Test on a deteriorating pitch. Sourav Ganguly will be back to lead the team and the series is hotting up for an exciting climax. One cannot wait for the Rawalpindi Test to happen. History awaits the Indian team, and this is a great opportunity for India to get rid of the inconsistent tag. (PTI)  Copyright

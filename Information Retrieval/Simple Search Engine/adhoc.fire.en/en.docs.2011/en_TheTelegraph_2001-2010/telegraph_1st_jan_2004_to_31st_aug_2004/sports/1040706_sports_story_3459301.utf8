The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gul to be considered, says Inzy
Islamabad: New Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, who took charge on Saturday, will return to England on Wednesday for a short trip. The Englishman will join the team in Sri Lanka where the Asia Cup starts on July 16, according to a local daily. The reason behind Woolmers sudden trip to England is not clear. Woolmer replaced Javed Miandad recently. The Asia Cup squad is likely to be announced on Wednesday. The camp with 26 probables started on June 28. Captain Inzamam-ul Haq said paceman Umar Gul will be considered for selection as his MRI and bone-test reports are clear. Inzamam said he and chief selector Wasim Bari had a discussion with Woolmer on team composition. The coach wants to watch each player in the camp and is not in a position to form an opinion at this moment, he said. Asked to give his view on the long training session on Sunday, which began at 9 am and continued till 4.30 pm in scorching heat, the captain said every coach had a different way of working and Woolmer had his own.

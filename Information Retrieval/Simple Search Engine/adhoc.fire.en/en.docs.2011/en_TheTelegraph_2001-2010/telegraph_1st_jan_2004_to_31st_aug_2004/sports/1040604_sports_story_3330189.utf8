The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Babli Mitra sets lone record on Day I
 - STATE ATHLETICS - Soma sure of clinching Olympic berth  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Under-20 pole vault state record-breaker Babli Mitra takes tips from Olympic hopeful heptathelete Soma Biswas on the opening day of the state athletic meet at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Even as 17-year-old Babli Mitra set the days only record  a 2.9m in the girls under-20 pole vault event, to wipe out her own mark of 2.55m set last year)  star heptathlete Soma Biswas decided to play it safe with entries in three events only at the 54th state athletic championships which began at the Salt Lake Stadium Thursday. Babli, of North 24 Parganas, was followed to the podium by Trisha Ghosh of Pioneer SA, way back at 2.1m and Shampa Sarkar of SOPC, losing in merit also at 2.1m. While the womens pole vault event was cancelled (run only as a trial) because there were only two competitors (AAFI rules dont allow events with less than three participants), seven other finals were run through with mediocre results. Suparna Ghosh of Pioneer clinched the girls under-18 discus gold with a throw of 28.24m. Dipali Ghosh (Malda DSA) won gold in the events girls under-20 section at 33.81m, while in the womens category of the event Pardeep Kaur of East Midnapores throw for gold was 35.03m. In the girls under-16 category of the event Sharmila Dey of Hooghly DSA beat the competition with a throw of 25.16m. Asha Sadhu of Eastern Railway, ran 10,000m in 39:52.1 for the womens gold, while Aryans Ruhidas Sardar, in the boys under-20 category, had his 10km gold run clocked at 34:56. And in mens shot put, Souvik Bhattacharya of East Bengal won gold with a throw of 15.20m. Meanwhile, Soma was taking it lightly at the state meet, so to say. She remains an Olympic squad hopeful for the heptathlon. If she makes it to the squad, her target is to be among the top ten in the fray in Athens, she said Thursday. The Indian squad can take in one more heptathlete. Keralas J.J. Sobhha has already met the qualifying mark of 6050 and Soma is getting at it, says her coach Kuntal Roy. The fight for the lone berth is with G.G. Pramila of Bangalore. Somas personal best is 6186 and Roy feels she will surely make it in time and secure the berth. She has not gone to the national camp because she feels she is doing well with her coach Roy here itself. That is despite her having to take the jumping pit couch all the way from the SAI to the Salt Lake Stadium and back again. She has refused to take part in the full heptathlon in the state meet, saying it will not help in her preparations. She is taking part in three events  the 100m hurdles, the 400m and the long jump. She has entered in the javelin as well (another heptathlon event), but that will likely be just a trial run. Coach Roy believes that while the gold and silver prospects at Athens have personal bests at 7001 and 6756, there is no reason why Soma (attaining her personal best, at least) cannot stay among the top ten there. She said she is fit and doing well and expects to gain the target soon. Her last chance comes at the Chennai inter-state meet, to be held between July 18 and 20.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal cross Mahindra hurdle 
 - NFL - Junior, Bhutia score after Malhotra send-off  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Cristiano Junior is fouled by Arun Malhotra of Mahindra at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Malhotra was sent off for this challenge and Junior scored from the penalty spot. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The sparks didnt fly, but the contest between East Bengal and Mahindra United at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday was high-voltage indeed. The strongest teams of the country met in this crucial National Football League (NFL) match and East Bengal produced a performance worthy of champions en route to their 2-0 win. Cristiano Junior and Bhaichung Bhutia scored the goals. Subhas Bhowmicks boys probably crossed the most difficult hurdle in their quest for a second successive title. If they succeed, they will become the first team in NFLs eight-year history to defend the title. East Bengal have 27 points after 13 matches, with Mahindra on 23 from 14. It was a hard-earned win, as Mahindra were threatening to break East Bengals resistance in the initial stages. It was like two heavyweights sparring in the ring and East Bengal wore down their rivals gradually. In the end, they should rue the fact that they didnt score more. East Bengal took the lead in the 35th minute through Junior, who converted a spot-kick for his eighth goal of the competition. This was also the defining moment of the match as Mahindra defender Arun Malhotra received marching orders for a tackle on Junior, which resulted in the penalty. The teams were evenly matched till then, with the visitors holding a slender advantage thanks to a fast and mobile midfield. They were swift in interchanging positions, played smart and short passes to weave a move and always had enough men around the ball in attack and in defence. Mahindra, however, didnt look the same force once they were reduced to ten. The forwards scored the goals, but a major credit of East Bengals success should go to the defenders. They soaked up the pressure in front of the goalmouth and despite Mahindras early ascendancy, didnt allow them a clear look at the goal. It was also a proud statement of East Bengals seemingly abundant pool of options as someone like Shylo Malsawmtluanga played like a seasoned campaigner in an unaccustomed position of left half. Also, playing as central defender after some time, Surkumar Singh had a great game. Counterattacks through long passes from the deep was East Bengals plan in the initial period of the match as Mahindra laid the off-side trap way up, almost close to the centre-circle. This also meant there was a big gap between the goalkeeper and the last line of defenders. The first goal came after a ball landed in this no mans land. A free-kick from just outside the East Bengal box cleared the centre line and Chandan Das flicked it on, above the advancing defenders. Junior chased it well, took control and was about to shoot before being tripped from behind. The penalty and the goal rattled Mahindra as East Bengal went for the kill in the remainder of the first half. The visitors had no answer to this and were lucky to see a Bhutia header hit Mike Okoro on the goalline following a corner. Mahindra tried to stage a recovery after the breather and there were moments of tension in the East Bengal box. Abhishek Yadav came close soon after the restart and a header by Felix Aboagye went just wide. But East Bengal withstood the pressure and came back with vigour and purpose. There were several close shaves near the Mahindra goal and another Bhutia header was parried from the goalline. The India captain wasnt to be denied and took full advantage of a defensive lapse to drive home the second three minutes from time. TEAMS East Bengal: Sandip Nandy; Mahesh Gawli, M.

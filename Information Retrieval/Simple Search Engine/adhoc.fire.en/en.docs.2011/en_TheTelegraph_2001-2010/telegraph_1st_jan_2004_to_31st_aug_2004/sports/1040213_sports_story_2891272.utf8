The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Clean sweep by India A
 - Hosts clinch final one-dayer by five wickets vs England A  Sriram scored a fine unbeaten 105 Chennai: India A completed the whitewash, defeating England A by five wickets in the third and final one-dayer at the Chidambaram Stadium on Thursday. With this, they clinched the series 3-0. Chasing a modest target of 211, the Indians suffered a mini-collapse, losing the first four wickets for just 34 runs. But in-form Sridharan Sriram (105 not out) ensured that there were no further damages. He stitched a 155-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Y. Venugopal Rao (66) as India A achieved the target with 4.5 overs to spare. The partnership was finally broken when Rao fell to a superb catch by Pietersen at the midwicket off S. Mahmood. Mahmood had earlier grabbed three early wickets, including both openers Dinesh Mongia and Gautam Gambhir. He later added the scalp of Jai Prakash Yadav, while Graeme Wagg removed Mithun Minhas for 14. But India rallied through Sriram and Rao. It was a superb innings from Sriram who rarely played a wrong stroke. He was timing the ball perfectly and found the gaps on both sides of the wicket with ease. Sriram had got a half century in second match of the current series and 92 in the first game. This has been a good season for him. Though he was ignored for most of the A tri-series in Calcutta in December, he scored a half-century in the only outing he had. The other opener Mongia also had a good series before this game. A century was followed by a fine 88 in Bangalore. Earlier, electing to bat, the visitors slumped from 140 for 3 at one stage to 210 in 42.1 overs. Ed Smith (76 n.o.) and Scott Newman (68) were the only two batsmen who applied themselves at the crease. Skipper Sairaj Bahutule claimed three wickets for 33 runs while medium pacer J. P. Yadav chipped in with 3/52. Siddharth Trivedi finished with two for 44. It has been a difficult week for England A, with defeats in the first two matches, and the loss of their captain, Alex Gidman, to a hand injury. His absence was compounded by the suspension of Bilal Shafayat for dissent in the second match. It was a disappointing performance from start to finish for England. Newman and Smith added 99 for the third wicket, but only one other batsman could reach double figures  Sajid Mahmood, who made a rapid 13. Bengals Shib Shankar Paul, who played in the first two games, was dropped on Thursday.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

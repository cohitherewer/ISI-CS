 Greek soldier shot dead
Athens: A Greek soldier on patrol with a police cadet guarding an Olympic facility in Athens was shot dead on Monday after apparently playing game of Russian roulette with a policeman, security sources said. Antonios Syrou, 25, was shot in the head by police cadet Christos Chloros, 20, while the two were pointing service revolvers at each other, police said in a statement. The cadet is facing charges. Chloros and another police cadet had gone to visit Syrou, who was on duty at the Olympic site, police said. The incident occurred shortly before dawn near the site on Mount Parnis about 20km (13 miles) from the centre of Athens, police said. Olympic sites are regularly patrolled by teams of soldiers and police. The mountain bike course was built solely for the Olympics competition. Riders will have to navigate tight trails through the forest, steep hills and several rocky sections.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Porto join the Rivaldo queue
 - Benficas bid for Brazilian superstar falls through over wages  Rivaldo is still looking for the right club Lisbon: Uefa Cup holders Porto have joined the chase to sign Brazilian World Cup winner Rivaldo, who was released by Champions League title-holders AC Milan earlier this month, the players lawyer said on Wednesday. Porto has shown interest, but there still is no concrete offer, Jose Carlos Lajes told Portuguese radio. Rivaldo has been seeking a club since being released by Milan after an unsuccessful 17-month spell. The 31-year-old joined Milan on a free contract, a month after winning the World Cup with Brazil. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti limited him to just 16 Serie A matches, and eight Champions League games last season, when he only made the bench in the Champions League final against Inter Milan. This season has been even worse for Rivaldo, who has made only one substitute appearance in the Champions League, and has not played in Serie A. Porto are looking to repeat their success of the last season when they won the both the Portuguese Cup and championship, in addition to the Uefa title. The club currently leads the 18-team Portuguese first division, five points ahead of Sporting Lisbon. But Porto will have to do without playmaker Derlei for the rest of the season after he injured a ligament in his right knee in a league match against Alverca on December 22. The 28-year-old Brazilian striker, the top-scorer in the Portuguese Premiership, underwent knee surgery on Monday. Portuguese giants Benfica, who currently lie third in the league, reportedly also made a bid for Rivaldo. Negotiations, however, have stumbled over wages. The 1999 Fifa World Player of the Year was reported to be on 215,000 Euros a week at Milan, which could be too steep for those eyeing him. Rivaldos agent says they have had three offers from English Premiership clubs and have already turned down an offer of $ 1 million a month to play in Qatar. Meanwhile, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro has offered to use public funds to help one of the citys four first division clubs sign World Cup winner Rivaldo. Cesar Maia said in a radio interview on Tuesday that he had spoken to Rivaldo, who was open to the idea of continuing his career in the so-called Marvellous City. (AFP)  Copyright

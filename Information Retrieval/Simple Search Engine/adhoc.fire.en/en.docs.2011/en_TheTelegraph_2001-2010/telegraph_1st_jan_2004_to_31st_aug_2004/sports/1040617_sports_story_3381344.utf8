 Becks to frame Zidanes shirt
 FROM HENRY WINTER IN LISBON  Beckham believes England can go a long way in the competition Among the Euro 2004 souvenirs piling up in David Beckhams hotel room on Tuesday was the sweat-streaked blue shirt graced by Zinedine Zidane against England. Beckham has been gazing reverentially at the ZZ top, taking inspiration from the leadership and match-winning qualities of its original owner as he heads to Coimbra for Thursdays Group B tie with Switzerland. The Zidane-Beckham comparison provides a microcosm of the difference between cross-Channel rivals; Frances captain has conquered the world and Europe, while Englands skipper continues to audition for the role of global leading man. Beckham fluffed his lines at the Stadium of Light, missing a penalty that would have given England complete control. Moments after swerving in a free-kick, Zidane serenely converted his spot-kick and France prevailed. Beckham sought out his Real Madrid club-mate later. We said a few things in Spanish, he smiled as if to say Thats the way it goes and then we swapped shirts. Zinedine didnt sign it because it was soaking wet but I will get it signed in Madrid. I will frame it and put it my house. It will give me great memories of a great player. It is important to have things that remind you of disappointments so you can look forward to better ones. Zinedine loves football, loves training. He works as hard in training as he does in matches. I am proud to be in the same team as him. Give him a chance and he takes advantage. Beckham had tried to trade international shirts with Zidane before. But Dennis Wise went into a tackle on Zidane and we didnt see him after the game. I do have a Juventus shirt of his. And when I played for Manchester United against Madrid in the Champions League, he asked for my shirt. Englands midfielder would love to swap medal collections with Zidane. Beckham knows him personally  as well as England collectively must start delivering to revive their Euro 2004 dream. There have been lows in my life but nothing will defeat me. My belief has not wavered. We can go a long way in this competition. Traditionally famed for his dead-ball prowess, Beckhams reputation from 12 yards has been eroded following successive misses against Turkey and now against Fabien Barthez. I worked with Fabien for a number of years at United. We used to have a few competitions and I got the better of him. He guessed right this time. Beckham insisted he would not hand over spot-kick duties to a confident teammate such as Frank Lampard. Even if I miss the next five penalties, I will still step up and take another one, although I am not sure people will want me to. Maybe I would let him (Lampard) have it but my mentality is to carry on until I win. Although this is an impressive declaration of his personal determination, the time will come when Beckham must consider the team and pass the responsibility to Lampard. Applying the enduring rule of form is temporary, class is permanent (which also relates to Michael Owen), Beckham will doubtless show his 12-yard class again. But one more mistake and the task must be passed on. Beckhams innate competitiveness has been affronted by the shock turnaround against France. When English people get knocked down they respond in the right way. If the team can react the right way we will be loved even more. Our frustration will be taken out in the game on Thursday. As soon as that whistle goes we will be at them. There is an anger in us, not to kick players but to go out there and win games and make people believe in us. Any hot-headedness will be cooled and the energy properly channelled by Eriksson. The English mentality is wear your heart on your shirt but Mr Eriksson brings calmness. The last thing he said to us before we went out against France was Keep your heads. Not many managers have said that to us over the years. Straight after the game, he said: Get your heads up. His calmness is essential. Beckham added that he and his teammates were surprised by Patrick Vieiras remarks alleging rough-house tactics by England. Patrick is a physical player and he likes a tackle himself. He is respected around the world for his tackling and passion. As captain, Beckham was quick to lend his support for David James following criticism about the keepers poor response to Zidanes opener. When the free-kick was given, I asked Jamo if he wanted someone on the post. He said no. He was comfortable with how it was. Thats how he always does things. The goalkeeper takes charge of those situations and we believe in Jamo. Englands attacking axis of Wayne Rooney and Owen was also given a ringing endorsement by Beckham, who extolled what he sees as their complementary strengths. Wayne can come short, hold the ball up, turn and run at players. As you saw against France, some of the best defenders in the world were petrified by him. Thats great testament to Wayne. Having Michael gives you something different; it a strength of ours where you can play the ball over the top and have Michael on the end of it. England could do with a touch of the old magic from the Beckham-Owen combination.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

 Scolaris warning for softies 
Lisbon: Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has warned there is no room in his Euro 2004 squad for cry-babies who refuse to play because they are injured. I dont want cry-baby players on my team. Being on the national team means having the biggest pain in the world and still playing, he said in an interview with sports daily A Bola. It is like being called to go to war for your country, he added. No one goes to war thinking they have a little pain in their shoulder. I want warriors who grab their arms and put them on their shoulder without always complaining, saying it hurts a bit. Scolari, who led his native Brazil to a record fifth world title in 2002, said Portugal playmakers Luis Figo and Rui Costa were good examples of players who never refuse to go out on the pitch. Last month Scolari, who has a reputation for employing physical violence and gamesmanship, threatened to discard Cristiano Ronaldo for Euro 2004 after the Manchester United winger pulled out of training for a friendly against Sweden because of a thigh strain. Portugal, who are in Group A in the Euro 2004 finals alongside Greece, Russia and Spain, have a 8-5-3 record under Scolari. Scolari, meanwhile, was finally able to assemble his entire squad for a training session on Monday, although injured full-back Nuno Valente was confined to light running. Striker Pauleta Resendes, who scored the only goal in Paris St Germains French Cup final win over Chateauroux on Saturday, trained with the squad for the first time on Monday at their base in Obidos, 80 kms north of Lisbon. He was joined in the session by Maniche Ribeiro, Francisco Costinha, Paulo Ferreira, Deco Souza and Ricardo Carvalho, who all helped Porto to their Champions League final win over Monaco last week. Valente, who was also part of that team, is trying to shake off a slight injury to his left leg. We know were going to have hard games but we have a good group of players, said winger Cristiano Ronaldo. We have a lot of chances to go a long way. Thats what were hoping for. (Agencies)  Copyright

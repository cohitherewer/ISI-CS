 Brabourne to have floodlights
Mumbai: Former cricket board president and chief of the Cricket Club of India (CCI) Raj Singh Dungarpur said efforts are being made to install floodlights at the Brabourne Stadium so that the historic ground can stage international matches yet again. Without lights, stadiums do not get big matches. Hence we have decided to arrange for floodlighting at Brabourne. I am sure it wont be too long before big time cricket returns here, Dungarpur said at a welcoming function for the ICCs Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACU) delegates, who are here for a three-day seminar, on Monday. While the last Test match was hosted by the Brabourne way back in 1972-73, it has hosted one-day Internationals much more recently. Brabourne is one of the best in the world with a picturesque backdrop. I can assure you gentlemen that when we host big time cricket again, you are welcome to watch some fine cricket and enjoy the hospitality of the club. Those here for the meeting are chief investigator and ACU general manager Jeffery Rees, Indian and Pakistani representatives Niranjan Virk and Col Nurrauddin. The function was attended by former cricketers Nari Contractor, Polly Umrigar and Hanumant Singh, BCCI joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty and ex-official P. M. Rungta. Also present was former Aussie skipper and coach Bobby Simpson.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

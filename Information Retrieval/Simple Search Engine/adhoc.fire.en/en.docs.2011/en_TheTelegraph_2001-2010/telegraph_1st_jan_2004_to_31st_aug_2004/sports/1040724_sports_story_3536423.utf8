 Alex admits rivals are ahead
 - COPA AMERICA FINAL - Brazil captain says Bielsas team is favourite to lift title  Brazil captain Alex (left) and teammmates during a practice session in Lima on Thursday. (AP) Lima: Less than 24 hours after scraping through the semi-finals, Brazil admitted that arch rivals Argentina are better placed to win the Copa America title clash on Sunday. They are not 100 per cent favourite, but they are a step ahead of us right now, Brazil captain Alex said. We have a young squad that just got together, while they have been playing with their top players. The makeup of the squads means little to Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa. As usual in any Argentina-Brazil match, winning is all that matters, and the Copa America final is a nice backdrop to fight for national bragging rights. If they have brought their B team, I dont think thats important, Bielsa said. That certain players arent here isnt what obligates us to win, those feelings arise from our own desire to win. The matchup comes more than a month after Brazil defeated Argentina 3-1 in a World Cup qualifier, a loss that triggered another round of public criticism of Argentinas performance under Bielsa. But Argentine fans and the press have started warming up to the national team as Bielsas attacking style has eased the team into the Copa final with a tournament-high 14 goals in five games. And Bielsa said hell stick to his all-out offence, setting up as many as six forwards to flay Brazil. Well be attacking as we have done throughout the tournament. Well be looking to send as many as six players forward, he said. As for handling Brazils own high-octane front line  Adriano leads the tournament with six goals in five games  Bielsa had a simple plan in mind. By defending with one more player than they have in their attack, he said. But our emphasis will be on offence, looking to press Brazil in its own half of the field. We know we wont have a chance to win if we dont keep up the pressure. Argentinas relentless go-forward has impressed all observers, and was the reason it was favoured against Brazil by Uruguay midfielder Marcelo Sosa, who played and lost to both teams in the Copa. If Argentina keeps pressuring the way that they have been I think theyll easily beat Brazil, Sosa said. After thrashing Mexico 4-0 in the quarter finals, Brazils standing fell somewhat in its struggle to overcome Uruguay in their thrilling semi-final on Wednesday, ultimately ending in a penalty shootout Brazil won 5-3. Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira praised his second-stringers for passing a testing challenge from the 14-time champions. Our boys showed against Uruguay that they have nerves of steel, he said. Penalty shootout hero Julio Cesar, the goalkeeping backup to Brazil regular Dida, was proud of his teams accomplishments in a short time together. Argentina definitely deserves our respect, Cesar said. But our team has shown it has quality, it wouldnt be a surprise if we beat them. Brazils World Cup qualifying victory last month evened the teams series since 1916 at 33 wins each and 23 draws. But the record is one-sided in Copa finals. Argentina has won a record-equalling 14 Copa titles, eight of them at Brazils expense. Argentina has never lost to Brazil in the finals. It will be Argentinas first final since its last victory 11 years ago. Brazil has six titles, the last in 1999. They played more consistently throughout the tournament, they should be seen as the favourites, but we feel we are prepared to face them anyway, Brazil defender Gustavo Nery said. Brazil reported no injuries, while Argentina hoped Barcelona striker Javier Saviola and Wolfsburg midfielder Andres DAlessandro would be available. Saviola scored a hattrick in the opener against Ecuador but has missed the last three games with a muscle injury. DAlessandro missed the semi-final with a pulled thigh muscle. Bielsa said a decision on their availability would be made this weekend.  (AP)  Copyright

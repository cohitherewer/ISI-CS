 WI claim openers cheaply
 - Harmison takes six for 61 to bowl out hosts for 208  Steve Harmison celebrates his sixth wicket in Port-of-Spain on Saturday Port-of-Spain: After bowling out the West Indies for 208, England lost two wickets and scored only eight runs when rain forced an early lunch on the second day of the second Test at Trinidad on Saturday. Pedro Collins and Tino Best shared a wicket each to give early blows to England. Mark Butcher was batting on six and former captain Nasser Hussain was yet to open his account. Earlier, the West Indies resumed on an overnight score of 189 for 8. Ridley Jacobs stitched a 37-run ninth-wicket partnership with Pedro Collins (10) before a run out ended their resistance. Jacobs was caught short by Ashley Giles pinpoint return to England keeper Chris Read. Jacobs struck four boundaries off 64 balls in 94 minutes. Fast bowler Steve Harmison was back in hunt as he picked up six wickets for 61 off 20.1 overs. The West Indies hit back immediately through left-armer Collins. England captain Michael Vaughan lasted just two deliveries. The first angled across him to beat the outside edge, while the second one swung in and trapped him in front. Marcus Trescothick lived a charmed life but could not make the most of two slices of luck in Bests first over.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

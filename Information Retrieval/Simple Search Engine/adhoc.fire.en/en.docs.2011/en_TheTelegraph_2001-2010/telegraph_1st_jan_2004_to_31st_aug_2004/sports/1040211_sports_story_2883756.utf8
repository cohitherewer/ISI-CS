The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India A clinch series
 - Second tie - Patel takes three as Mongia leads charge again vs Englishmen  Dinesh Mongia struck a fine 88 Bangalore: Dinesh Mongia struck a fine 88 as India A defeated England A by two wickets in the second one-dayer at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Tuesday to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. India A had beaten England A in the first match on Monday. The last match of the series will be played in Chennai on Thursday. After bowling out the visitors for 228, India A got off to a sound start as Mongia and Gautam Gambhir (37) put on 84 runs for the first wicket. There was another valuable stand of 82 runs between Mongia and Sridharan Sriram (50), which helped the home teams secure victory in 41.1 overs despite the fact that wickets tumbled regularly towards the end. England A, who won the toss and elected to bat, were dismissed for 228 in 46 overs with opener Kevin Pietersen cracking a superb century (131, 12x4, 3x6). Barring Pietersen, none of the England batsmen could stay long enough at the crease as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Munaf Patel was the most successful bowler for India A, taking three wickets for 42 runs from nine overs, while Ramesh Powar claimed two for 32 from two. Bengals shib Shankar Paul, who had a decent outing in the first match on Monday, did not have a very good day. The burly medium-pacer went for 37 runs in his four overs but had the consolation of bagging the wicket of century-maker Pietersen. India A, who began their chase on a promising note, came under some pressure when the middle and late order failed to contribute with the bat. Englands Sajid Mahmood took four wickets. It has been a fine series for Mongia so far. The Punjab left-hander, who went to Bangladesh right after World Cup for a tri-series there, has failed to make the national team since then. He was ignored for the tri-series featuring Australia and New Zealand here last year and also missed the bus for the triangular tournament Down Under. Mongia, who looks determined to prove a point here, scored a brilliant 118 against England A on Monday and has followed it up with another match-winning effort. Even Sriram has done a creditable job in the two matches so far. The Tamil Nadu left-hander, who was not picked for the one-dayers in Australia even after scoring a half-century in his only outing in the tri-series for A teams from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in December, had scored 92 in the first match of the on-going series. The England A team is playing this series as preparation for the Duleep Trophy, where they will participate as special invitees. They have East Zone and South Zone in their group.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Jones finishes 2nd in 100m heat
Sacramento, July 10 (AP): Everything has changed for Marion Jones. The three-time Olympic champion finished second in her quarter final heat of the womens 100m at the US Olympic trials on Friday, good enough to advance to Saturdays semi-final but far from her dominating form of past years. Jones began her bid for a spot on the US squad for the Athens Games by finishing behind Latasha Colander in the opening-round heat. Jones, who dominated the event in the late 1990s and is the reigning Olympic champion, finished in 11.38 seconds  just seventh fastest among the 24 competitors. Jones, who remains under investigation by the US Anti-doping agency, is known for her radiant smile and bubbly personality. But she remained serious throughout and after Fridays race, left the track without saying a word to fans or reporters. Also qualifying for the semi-finals was Chryste Gaines, one of four sprinters who face a lifetime ban after being charged with steroid use. Her case is awaiting arbitration by the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport. NCAA champion Lauryn Williams, who just finished her junior year at Miami, turned in final time of 11.13. When Jones last visited Sacramento, for the 2000 Olympic trials, she began her quest for a record five gold medals at the Sydney Games by winning her quarter final heat in 10.92. She routinely won races by large margins in those days. When Jones won an unprecedented five medals in Sydney  three gold  she confirmed her status as track and fields reigning queen. Now, she is dogged by allegations of drug use  though she repeatedly has denied ever using performance-enhancing substances. And her talk of trying to go for five Olympic medals again this summer is much more muted than in 2000. She isnt at the point where she was in previous years, said Inger Miller, the 1999 world champion and second fastest in the quarter finals on Friday with a time of 11.28. Its yet to be seen where she is. In the only final on Saturday, Meb Keflezighi won the mens 10,000 in 27:36.49. Abdi Abdirahman was second and Daniel Browne was third. Two-time Olympian Bob Kennedy dropped out midway through the race. In the mens pole vault, a couple of top contenders failed to make it out of the preliminary round. Jeff Hartwig is the American record-holder in the mens pole vault and a four-time national champion. But bad things always seem to happen to Hartwig when the Olympics approach. Hartwig missed out on a chance for the Athens Games when he failed to clear any of his attempts on Saturday. He also failed to make it out of the qualifying round at the Olympic trials in 2000. Also failing to qualify was Lawrence Johnson, the reigning Olympic silver medallist.  Copyright

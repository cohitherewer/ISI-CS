 German surprise for Dutch 
Almancil, June 12 (Reuters): Germany have a surprise ready for The Netherlands when they open their Euro 2004 campaign against their arch-rivals on Tuesday. We have a surprise for (Dutch coach) Dick Advocaat and his team, assistant Germany coach Michael Skibbe said on Saturday. Rudi Voellers deputy, who would not elaborate, said Germany would concentrate on tactics in the training sessions before the Group D clash in Porto, all of which will be staged behind closed doors. The emphasis will be on the defence after nervous displays in embarrassing defeats by Romania and Hungary in the build-up. It will be crucial for us to have a compact and aggressive defence and to make sure we do not allow the Dutch to play their game, Skibbe said. The surprise promised by Skibbe could be that Germany field just one man up front, probably VfB Stuttgarts Kevin Kuranyi, to concentrate on neutralising the dangerous Dutch strikers, including the prolific Ruud van Nistelrooy.

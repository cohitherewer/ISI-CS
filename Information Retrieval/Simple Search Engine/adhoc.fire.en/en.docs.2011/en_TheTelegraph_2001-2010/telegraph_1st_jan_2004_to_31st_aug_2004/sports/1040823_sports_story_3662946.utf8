The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ritwik floors 12th seed
	 - Telegraph chess  A CORRESPONDENT  Diptayan Ghosh deep in thought on Sunday. Picture by Sanjay Chattopadhyaya Calcutta: Unrated Ritwik Mahashabde of Maharashtra made short work of 12th seed Debashis Das of Orissa in Round 3 of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan on Sunday. The 13-year-old Mahashabde, a class IX student from Nasik, won two pawns on queenside in a Petroff defence after which Das struggled. Das tried to launch a kingside offence to counter his material deficit, but his opponent defended well. Das resigned on the 48th move. Top seed Debayan Majumdar of St James got the better of Kaushelendra Kumar of Jamshedpur in a Sicilian defence with the white pieces. Kaushelendra, tried to grab a pawn on the queenside with his Queen, which proved to be his undoing. Dame luck smiled yet again on Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar of Bangladesh, as he was fortunate to win from a clearly inferior position against Vinay Raj Bhatt of Dehradun. Minhazuddin was a Bishop down against Bhatt but exploited the back rank weakness to force mate. Rajib Dhar, the Guwahati leg champion, beat Shalini Shristava of Jamshedpur. Sudip Rajbanshi, the visually challenged student of Lious Braille Memorial School for the Sightless, Uttarpara went down to Saurav Chakraborty of St James School after a tense struggle.

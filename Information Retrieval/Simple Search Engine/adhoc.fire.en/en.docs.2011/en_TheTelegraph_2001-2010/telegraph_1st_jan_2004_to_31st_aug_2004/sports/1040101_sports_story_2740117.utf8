The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ive been the type to do something new, to challenge myself
	 - Hours away from his last Test, steve waugh speaks exclusively to The Telegraph  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sydney: Steve Waugh is battling on many fronts. From trying to beat India to seeking some time for himself... Australia did put it across India at the MCG, but the outgoing Test captain isnt being successful on the time-front. Thats not going to change till the evening of January 6, when his fantastic career comes to a close. Steve has not been giving one-to-one interviews, but he made an exception for The Telegraph. The following are excerpts from an absolute exclusive: Q Is it a struggle trying not to get emotionally overwhelmed? A This definitely is an emotional period. Equally, its an important period for cricket in Australia... One has to be professional... At the moment, my thoughts are on the final Test (from Friday)... Having said that, it will be nice to sit back and have a moment of reflection. Come January 6, whats the legacy you will be leaving? Havent thought about it... Let the others decide... Besides giving that hundred per cent, I played hard and fair... Thats all I will say. Did the Adelaide result, a huge deviation from the farewell script, upset you? No... The beauty of sport is that the unpredictable can happen... Indeed, thats why one becomes a sportsperson. Given the stature youve enjoyed, did you ever get the impression you were being portrayed as becoming bigger than the game? (Laughs) I was brought down plenty of times as well, you know... Theres this tendency to exaggerate the good times... Actually, the bad times too get exaggerated... Though nobody can ever be bigger than the sport, I know where I stand and what Ive achieved. While its nice when people go over the top, its not so when they go the other way. You must have worked out just how you will be keeping yourself busy... There will be lots to do... Charity work, in India and in Australia... The Steve Waugh Foundation is going to take up time... Then, I will continue writing and doing commentary is an option. Five years from now, where do you see Australian cricket? Still on top... But, its going to be a lot closer as India and South Africa are catching up... Pakistan cant be overlooked either. Where will you be five years hence? (Laughs again) Dont know what Im going to be doing next week! Well, obviously, Ill be spending time at home with Lynette and the kids... Ill be watching Rosie, Austin and Lillian grow... However, Im not one to look too far ahead. Given a chance, will you do anything differently? I prefer looking for a fresh challenge, newer opportunities... I dont like looking back... Perhaps, the odd thing could be done differently, thats about it... Im definitely very pleased with the way my personal life has shaped up and, really, I regard the family as my No. 1 accomplishment. Role model, most capped Test cricketer, social worker... Where has the maximum enjoyment come from? All three... Theyve been satisfying, theyve been challenging... Each one gave a new perspective to life... Essentially, Ive been the type to do something new, to challenge myself... All three roles gave that opportunity. Are the commercial demands on cricketers threatening to get out of control? Theres more of everything and, so, must be professionally handled. Endorsements will grow and, with that, will come more pressure and responsibility. There will be less of privacy as well... As with everything else in life, there will be a bit of good and a bit of bad. Being an elder statesman, is there a facet of todays game which disturbs you? There needs to be less cricket... I mean, look at the bowlers... So many are breaking down because the commitments are high. In any case, too much of anything is bad. Clearly, if top performers keep getting injured, the standard is going to drop... (After a pause) If the emphasis is on quantity, the quality is bound to suffer. Do you have a message for fans across the globe? Thanks for the support and affection... As I said last month, its time for me to move on in life... Perhaps, look at new challenges, perhaps do something Ive never done before... Is there a message for Ricky Ponting? He should lead his way and follow his instincts. Over the past 18 years, is there one contemporary whom youve admired more than the others? Lokendra, thats a tough one... I wouldnt like to single out any one person. Well, how do you expect to feel on the morning of January 7? (Laughs yet again) Great... After all, the previous day, we would have won my last Test and series... I dont wish to bow out a losing captain. The final question: Frankly, how long did it take you to overcome the disappointment of losing the one-day captaincy (in early 2002)? As we were heading for South Africa, I didnt have much time to think about it... My priority, then, was to return victorious  and, we did. My successor wasnt named straightaway, but I knew Ricky had the qualities to emerge a good captain. He has proved me right.  Copyright

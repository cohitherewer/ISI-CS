The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Duo cites teamwork
Cairns: Australian opening batsmen Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden say they focus more on partnerships than on the achievement of individual centuries. After both scored hundreds against Sri Lanka on Friday, Hayden, who has a highest Test score of 380, said: Those little partnerships that you have along the way motivate us. Not just Justin and I. You have got seven batters all keen to make good partnerships amongst each other. Langer joked that he was the main run-scorer of the duo. Both have made 19 Test centuries. Like you saw today, Haydos tends to block them and see off the new ball and I tend to smack them around, Langer said. Thats the key to it. Concentrating on the partnership... it takes all the focus off you individually, and thats got to be a good thing. The taller Hayden, who tends to drive straight down the ground with brute force, added: Our strengths are in very different areas and that makes it difficult to bowl at us. Their 255-run stand on Friday in the first days play of the second Test guided Australia to 370 for two with Langer on 159 not out including 22 boundaries and Hayden out for 117 with 14 fours and two sixes. It was the sixth double-century opening stand by the pair, a world record, and the 11th time they had posted triple figures, which is an Australia record. (Reuters)  Copyright

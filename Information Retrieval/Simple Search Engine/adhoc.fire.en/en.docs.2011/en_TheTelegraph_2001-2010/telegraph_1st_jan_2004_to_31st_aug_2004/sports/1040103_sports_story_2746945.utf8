 Croft retires
		 Robert Croft will continue to lead GlamorganLondon: England off-spinner Robert Croft Friday announced his retirement from international cricket. However, the 33-year-old, who played 21 Tests and 55 one-day Internationals, will continue as Glamorgan captain. Croft was called up for the recently concluded Sri Lanka series but failed to make the XI. Ive come to the conclusion that I will no longer offer myself for selection for any future England Test or one-day side, Croft said.In making this decision I was conscious that Ive had a challenging and full career with England both at Test and one-day level of which I am extremely proud of, he added. Its been a great honour and privilege to represent England and Ive enjoyed every minute of it. I would also like to thank my fellow players for all their help and huge contribution to my career over the years. Croft, who finished with 49 Test wickets at an average of nearly 38, made his England debut back in 1996 but struggled to confirm place in the team. Like several other spinners, Crofts England appearances were restricted by the fact that the selectors often opted to do without a specialist slow bowler in English conditions. And when they did, former Middlesex left-armer Phil Tufnell and later Ashley Giles got the nod amidst a growing belief that conventional offspinners such as Croft, whose stock ball turns into the right-hander, were becoming ineffective at the highest level. Welshman Crofts greatest moments in an England shirt came three years ago in Sri Lanka when he starred with both bat and ball as the tourists recovered from losing the first Test to win the series 2-1. He then played a Test in the following season against Australia at Trent Bridge.  But his refusal to tour India  because of security concerns following the September 11  terrorist attacks in the United States effectively signalled  the end of his Test career. (AFP)  Copyright

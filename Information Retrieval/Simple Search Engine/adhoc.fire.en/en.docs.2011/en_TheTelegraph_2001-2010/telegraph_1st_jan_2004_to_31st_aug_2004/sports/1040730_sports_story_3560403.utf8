The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The pressure is on China, says Iraq coach
 - ASIAN CUP QUARTERS 
- Uzbekistan start favourites against Bahrain  The Iraqis are eager to do well for their war-ravaged country Beijing: Hosts China will be under enormous pressure to beat Iraq when they meet in the Asian Cup quarter finals, Iraqi coach Adnan Hamd said on Thursday. Iraq have already defied the odds to reach the last eight, knocking out bitter rivals Saudi Arabia along the way and Hamd warned that his team could pull off another surprise in Beijing on Friday. For us there is no pressure, he said. Sometimes the support of the home fans can give you more pressure. China are under more pressure than Iraq. Uzbekistan, meanwhile, have completed a remarkable turnaround after a miserable Asian Cup campaign four years ago and on current form will be favourites to beat Bahrain in Fridays other quarter final in Chengdu. The War-wrecked Iraq produced a minor miracle just to reach the Asian Cup, forced to practise on a bumpy pitch alongside grazing sheep in Baghdad and play their qualifying games in neutral Jordan due to security fears. Hamd insisted, however, that the escalating violence at home would give his players added incentive against China after finishing second behind group C winners Uzbekistan. You know the situation now in Iraq, he said. The players want to do something for our country in this difficult moment for the people in Iraq. In addition to the pressure of delivering a first Asian Cup title, China coach Arie Haan has a mounting injury list to worry about, with captain Li Weifeng and playmaker Shao Jiayi both nursing sore knees. The Dutchman is also without first-choice strikers Hao Haidong and Li Yi, who have ankle injuries. Group A winners China will be firm favourites in front of 65,000 in Beijing but Haan insisted they would take nothing for granted. Iraq are a very strong and complete team with lots of quality, he said. They are also a team which has nothing to lose and maybe that makes them a little bit dangerous. Uzbekistan were easily the worst team in Lebanon in 2000, the former Soviet republic losing 1-8 to eventual champions Japan and 0-5 to runners-up Saudi Arabia. However, they should have too much firepower for group A runners-up Bahrain. Led by inspirational captain Mirdjalal Kasimov, Uzbekistan won all their group C matches 1-0 and were the only team with a 100 per cent record in the first round. Kasimov, known in his country as the David Beckham of Uzbekistan because of his dead-ball prowess, has provided the spark for his side, scoring with two exquisite free-kicks. The 33-year-old insisted there was more to come from Uzbekistan, who have become adept at grinding out results. We have developed a certain stability and have done very well to defend narrow leads, he said. If we win the next game 1-0 too, it still counts and there is nothing wrong with it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Martina deserved a chance to play singles
Champion Speak John McEnroeUmpires of the world, you cannot be serious! I have waited a long time to be able to take them to task and the shenanigans surrounding Venus Williamss defeat last week provided it. Now perhaps people will understand why I used to rant at them so much! That mix-up over the scoring in the second set tie-break against Karolina Sprem was extraordinary for all sorts of reasons, not the least of which was Williamss ignorance of what was happening.One way or another the women seem to have stolen the show so far at this years Wimbledon, although Goran Ivanisevic put in a big effort on behalf of the men. The subject of returning champions seems to have dominated affairs. The controversy surrounding Martina Navratilovas decision to accept a wild card and return to Grand Slam singles at the age of 47 was only exacerbated rather than eased by the straightforward manner of her opening-round victory.People have asked me whether I would do the same, but there is a big difference between playing best of five sets and best of three. Besides, Im happy with what Im doing now and I have enough on my shoulders without adding to it by finding the time to get in good enough condition to play top-level tennis again. I wouldnt want to go and play just to say Ive played, even if I think I could scare a few players who dont have a similar sort of comfort level to me on the grass. But thats not the point. Personally, I think if someone cares as much as Martina does and wants to play that badly, she deserves the opportunity. I am glad that Roland Garros and Wimbledon afforded her it. I have said before the game doesnt always take into account the feelings of its champions, past or present, in the same classy way in which, say, golf does. As for the ease of her victory over Colombias Catalina Castano, well, there is no question that the mens depth is far superior to the womens, but there is also no question that the womens has improved. And anyway Martina knows what shes doing on grass; the other girl didnt. What people seemed to forget was that there was the possibility of a negative to all of this. She could have ended up embarrassing herself with the world watching. These players were young enough to be her daughter, in fact possibly young enough to be her granddaughter and yet she not only won her first-round match but got herself in a position to win her second round one, too.Martina has always put herself on the line. It took guts to come out and say she was a lesbian because that shut doors for her that may otherwise have been open. There are a lot of people out there who dont admit what they are. Shes taken the heat and she should be respected for that. Whether or not it was an ego trip Ive no idea, but then ex-champions  men and women  have healthy egos. We havent got where we have because we didnt think we could beat some players. Although I have to say I dont see how playing singles could help her doubles, which was the reason she has given for returning to singles. As for myself, if the grass is playing as slowly as Tim Henman says it is, it perhaps wouldnt help my game. These guys have the power to put away shots from behind the baseline, which was something I didnt have much success with late in my career. Power is the ultimate equaliser, it shuts you down in a hurry. On second thoughts, I think Ill leave it to the Henmans of this world to take it on.Speaking of which, the British No. 1 has his game heading in the right direction after a slightly dodgy start. He doesnt look as good yet as he did at Roland Garros but I thought he volleyed better in his second-round match against Ivo Heuberger. Perhaps even more importantly, after the first set, he seemed to embrace the crowd more. When he doesnt do that its like not utilising a weapon. It goes without saying how much the crowd is behind him, so when he becomes too inward and is not aware of them it has to be to his opponents advantage.Should he find a way passed Fernando Gonzalez in his delayed third-round game, Mark Philippoussis would present a formidable challenge to Henman in the round of 16. One doesnt need to look any further than last years Wimbledon to know how dangerous the big-serving Australian is. It shows you how much Wimbledon means to people like him and Ivanisevic that they have made such massive efforts to get themselves into shape for this tournament. The Croatian did it in order to say goodbye properly, whereas Flip has done it to show there is still some life in him and what better way to prove it than by beating Tim Henman at Wimbledon. Lets not forget, Tim is a Pom, so the Aussie has every incentive.Poor Goran had the misfortune to play not only back-to-back matches which more or less eliminated any chance he had of pulling off an upset, but also to face someone who is so obviously in form as Hewitt. This must be the best Hewitt has played since the Masters Cup in Shanghai in 2002. But Goran wouldnt have wanted it any other way, going out to a fellow former Wimbledon champion and on Centre Court as well. Like Martina, he deserved to have the opportunity to experience Wimbledon one more time. I wish him well in whatever direction his life now takes him.THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH Copyright

 Barry: Pakistan lack commitment
 Barry Richards Islamabad, July 8 (PTI): Pakistan fail to make it to the top of world cricket because their players lack commitment and dedication, said former South African opener Barry Richards. I give Pakistan ten out of ten as far as talent is concerned, but six out of ten for dedication and commitment, said Richards on Wednesday, after landing here for a short stint as consultant. The former batsman is in Pakistan on a week-long assignment at the national academy where he will work with youngsters and members of the national squad preparing for the Asia Cup starting next week in Sri Lanka. Richards said the way Pakistan lost the recent home series against India reflected the lack of competitive spirit in the team. The home team was unlucky that it could not win the closely fought series, but the defeat could be attributed to lack of competitive spirit in the cricketers, he was quoted as saying in a local daily. He added that Australia are No. 1 because of this competitive spirit.  Copyright

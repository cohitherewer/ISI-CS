The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No Golden goal after Euro 04
London, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Soccers law-making International Board said on Saturday that it had decided to scrap both Golden and Silver goals to end drawn matches and to revert to extra-time and penalties. The Board, the sports ultimate law-making authority, said the decision would take effect after the final of the European Championship on July 4. The Board also decided that a maximum of six substitutes would be allowed in international friendly matches from next season. The decision will end the recent practice by many European coaches of making up to 11 substitutions in friendlies. Many international coaches will be dismayed by the decision, though it is something of a compromise between Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who wanted a maximum of five substitutes, and coaches who wanted the right to make unlimited changes. The Board rejected a proposal to extend the half-time break from 15 to 20 minutes, but decided to re-introduce a yellow card for players who remove their shirts while celebrating a goal. A recent innovation in Belgium, where a coach communicated with his goalkeeper via a radio link, has been outlawed, as has the use of one-piece kits incorporating shirts and shorts.  Copyright

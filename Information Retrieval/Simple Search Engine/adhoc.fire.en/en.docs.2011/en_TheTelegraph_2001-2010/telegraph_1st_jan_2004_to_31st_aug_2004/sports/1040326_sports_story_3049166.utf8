The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pace trio on fast track to derail India
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Qadir is not pinning much hope on Kaneria, recalled to the squad for the first Test Lahore: The hurly-burly of the one-day game is over. The focus now shifts to the Test matches. Its time to rework strategies and chalk out new gameplans. Former Pakistan cricketers are putting the home team ahead because of their bowling strength. India, they feel, will have to perform a miracle despite their new-found confidence following the one-day series victory. The biggest advantage for Pakistan will be the pace trio of Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed. India do not have the strength to bowl out Pakistan twice in a match, Abdul Qadir told The Telegraph. Unlike the one-dayers, the bowlers will now have more time to rectify their mistakes. Shoaib and Sami with a little backing from Shabbir can create havoc to the famed Indian batting in slightly helpful conditions. Remember, the Indians are vulnerable to pace and this has been proved in Peshawar. The spinners will not make much impact as the Indians traditionally play spin well. Their bowling is short on quality with the only exception being Irfan Pathan. Anil Kumble can bowl long spells but hardly has the penetration to run through the side, the legendary leg-spinner noted on Thursday evening. Qadir is not pinning much hope on Danish Kaneria, who has been recalled to the squad for the first Test. He is talented but not mature enough. Apart from the Sachins, Sehwags and Dravids, Qadir has his eyes set on V.V.S. Laxman, Akash Chopra and Yuvraj Singh. Laxman is an extraordinary bat. Its unfortunate that he was dropped for the World Cup. He makes batting look so easy and Pakistan will struggle to dismiss him. Chopra is underrated. Just wait till he gets a hundred. Once he accomplishes that, he will be a different batsman. Yuvraj hasnt done enough justice to his talent. Wont Indias soaring confidence make a difference to their approach? True, Pakistan failed in all departments in the one-day final but all that will have no significance. Youve got to start from scratch in Multan, Qadir said. That was a view endorsed by former skipper Aamer Sohail as well. As the former captain puts it, the time factor the bowlers enjoy in a Test will make their task easier. The Indians dont have that strong a bowling line-up. That will stand exposed on tracks which will have some carry. The home team will obviously go for fast wickets as that will stand them in good stead. Shoaib and Sami will have the biggest advantage as they will pose tough challenges. They will not have to unduly worry about the wide and no-balls, and hence can go flat out. Pathans role will be crucial for the Indians. Zaheer Khan will not be much of a problem as he has been struggling with his fitness. Moreover he doesnt possess enough pace and swing, Sohail remarked. Younis Khan dropped Meanwhile, apart from Kaneria, batsmen Misbah-ul Haq and Asim Kamal and medium-pacer Umer Gul have been included in the Pakistan squad for the Multan Test which begins Sunday. Younis Khan has been dropped along with Shahid Afridi and Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan. THE SQUAD  Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Yusuf Youhana, Taufeeq Umer, Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Asim Kamal, Misbah-ul Haq, Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Umer Gul, Saqlain Mushtaq and Danish Kaneria.

 Streak puts on allround show
Harare: Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak followed his 10th Test half-century with an early wicket on Day II of the first Test against Bangladesh on Friday. When bad light ended play early, Bangladesh were 14 for one in reply to Zimbabwes 441. Zimbabwebuilt their handsome total on the back of six half-centuries. Allrounder Sean Ervine top-scored with a Test career best of 86 from 197 balls with 11 fours compiled in more than four hours at the crease. Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers, taking four for 121 from 57 overs. Streak batted for three-and-a-half hours, faced 178 balls and hit seven fours and a six.

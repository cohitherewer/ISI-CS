The Telegraph - Calcutta
 End of Indian challenge 
 World Under- 21 Snooker
New Delhi: The Indian challenge in the world under-21 snooker championship, being played in Carlow, Ireland, came to an end with the defeat of Aditya Mehta in the quarter finals on Wednesday. The Maharashtra cueist suffered a 4-6 defeat against top seed Gary Wilson of England who had knocked out Pankaj Advani in the pre-quarters. Leading 3-0 in the quarters, Mehta looked on course for a huge upset before his 18-year-old rival bounced back with a vengeance to level the scores, according to information received here. Mehta once again shot back into lead, only to be pegged back by some impressive show on the baize by Wilson who took the next three games to move to the semi-finals with a 48-60, 1-116, 43-72, 103-0, 71-64, 76-16, 2-78, 67-22, 85-13, 65-45 scoreline. Mehta, who finished in the fourth place in group F, had blanked Irelands Brenden Byrne 5-0 to secure his last-eight berth. In the pre-quarters played late Tuesday, Advani looked a shadow of himself, going down to Wilson 2-5. Advani struggled to find his rhythm and was trailing by three frames before he could get his name on the frame score.  (PTI)  Copyright

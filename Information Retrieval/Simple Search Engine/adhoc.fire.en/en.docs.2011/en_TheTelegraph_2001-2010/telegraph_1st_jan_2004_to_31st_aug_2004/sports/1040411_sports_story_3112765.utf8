The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ugly issue in pretty setting
 - Dropping Chopra on agenda; Nehras chances improve  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Islamabad: With boulevards, soothing greenery and designer construction, Islamabad is among the prettiest of capitals. Its here, however, that the Team India thinktank confronts an ugly issue: Dropping Akash Chopra to allow Gaddafi centurion Yuvraj Singh stay on even after Sourav Gangulys return for the Rawalpindi Test. Yuvraj, it may be recalled, played in Multan and Lahore only because the captain wasnt available. By scripting a superb century in Test No.2, though, he has landed the thinktank in more than a spot of bother. Till late Saturday, indications remained that Chopra will be dropped. However, the thinktank hasnt yet discussed it formally. As a source told The Telegraph: Eventually, its going to be Souravs call, but the coach (John Wright) and vice-captain (Rahul Dravid) will definitely have an opinion... Despite Souravs announcement earlier in the week that Yuvraj is going to keep his place  and, really, the axe then has to fall on Chopra  one member of the thinktank is distinctly uncomfortable with the idea of Yuvraj moving right up to partner Virender Sehwag. Apparently, the specialist-for-a-specialist-position line will be taken when the thinktank meets collectively, but its unlikely that Sourav is going to budge from his position. As reported in these columns, Ashish Nehra stands a good chance of replacing Ajit Agarkar. If anything, he is even better placed than he was 24 hours ago. Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Javed Miandad has acknowledged that Umar Guls non-availability just days after crippling India at the Gaddafi is a blow. Speaking exclusively at the Marriott, he said: Nobody can replace a form player, be it a batsman or bowler... Our plans have suffered because of Guls back injury... Gul, incidentally, was MoM at the Gaddafi. Miandad, though, clarified that Mohammed Sami doesnt have a major back problem as is being talked about. In fact, the quick was in a jovial mood throughout the short-haul flight from Lahore to Islamabad in the afternoon. The Indians too came on the same aircraft.  Copyright

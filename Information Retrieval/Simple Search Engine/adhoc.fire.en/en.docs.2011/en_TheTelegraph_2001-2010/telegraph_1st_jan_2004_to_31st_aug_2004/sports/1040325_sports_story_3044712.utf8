 Tendulkar dedicates win to nation
Lahore: Soon after his team registered its first-ever ODI series win on Pakistan soil, batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar dedicated the victory to the whole of India. We have been reaching the final and losing there for a while. And to do it finally in Pakistan means a lot to us. We dedicate this victory to all of India, Tendulkar said after India beat Pakistan by 40 runs in the fifth and final ODI at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday night. Moin Khan (who scored 78) batted well towards the end but we held our nerves. It was a team work, he said. The 23-year-old Irfan Pathan, who scalped eight wickets in the three matches he played, said he did not have words to express his feelings. It is a great win for us. I dont know what to say, I dont have words to describe this, he said. I knew God was with me, I knew in my mind he was helping me which gave me the confidence (to perform). I did not play in the first two matches but I knew how to bowl on the sub-continent wickets with variation, he said. Man-of-the-Match V.V.S. Laxman, who found form at the right time with an important century, said it was one of the memorable knocks as it helped the team win. I am glad that I made the runs when the team needed them most, he said. I made a conscious effort to come on the front foot today. I was going on the back foot in the previous matches, I think it was because of the influence of the Australian tour. The bowlers did a great job in containing the runs in the first 15 overs. Pathan and (Lakshmipathy) Balaji are really the find for India, Laxman said. Captain Sourav Ganguly said winning the fourth match to level the series 2-2 was crucial for his team to regain the momentum. Yes, winning the previous match was a fantastic effort, particularly after being down 95 for four. Rahul Dravid and Mohammed Kaif helped us gain the winning momentum, he said. Losing skipper and Man-of-the-Series Inzamam-ul Haq, who also bagged awards for being the highest-scorer and having the highest average, said the winning edge might have gone to India ahead of the Test series. Our boys did play well but a win always gives you confidence. I think the edge (in the Test series) might have gone Indias way, he said. The wicket was a good one and 294 was not a big total to chase. But unfortunately we lost early wickets and that made batting difficult in the end. I have been playing well, I hope to continue in the same way in the Tests and help the team win. BCCI purse Elated over the teams historic win, the BCCI announced a bonus of Rs 50 lakh for the squad. I congratulate the team for having achieved the goal, they not only played superbly to win the one-day series but they also played in the true spirit of the game. They have helped in improving the relationship between the two countries. It is because of them that the people of two countries have come closer, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said.

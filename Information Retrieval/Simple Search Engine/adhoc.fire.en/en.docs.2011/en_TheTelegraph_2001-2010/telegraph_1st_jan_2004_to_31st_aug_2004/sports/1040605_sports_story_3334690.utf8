 Harbhajan may skip fitness camp
New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh will return to action after a six-month injury lay off in a 20-overs-a-side match for English club Lashings in Kent on Tuesday. The off-spinner, out of action since aggravating a finger injury during the first Test against Australia in December, is scheduled to join Lashings on Monday on a month-long contract, the BBC said quoting a club official. The arrangement with the club means the off-spinner will not be available for the fitness camp for 26 India probables in Bangalore from June 13 to 19. The second leg of the camp is slated to begin on July 3. The BCCI, however, said it had not heard from the player in this regard, adds a report from Mumbai. (PTI)  Copyright

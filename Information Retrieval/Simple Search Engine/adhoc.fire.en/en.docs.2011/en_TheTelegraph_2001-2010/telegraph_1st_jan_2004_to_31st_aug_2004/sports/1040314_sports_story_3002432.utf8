 England reach 293/7 at tea on Day III
 - FIRST TEST - Fiery spell by Fidel Edwards; Injury scare for Brian Lara  Fidel Edwards celebrates the wicket of Marcus Trescothick on the second day of the first Test at Sabina Park on Friday. (Reuters) Kingston: England were 228 for five at lunch on Day III of the first Test against the West Indies at Sabina Park on Saturday. Overnight unbeaten batsmen Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain, along with Graham Thorpe, were dismissed in the first session. England were 293 for seven at tea, with Ashley Giles unbeaten on 11 and Matthew Hoggard on four. Tino Best and Fidel Edwards got three wickets each for the West Indies. On Friday, a record partnership between Butcher and Hussain helped England reach 154 for three at the end of a rain-hit second day. Having finished off the West Indies for 311 inside the days first two overs, England lost both openers to the fiery pace of Fidel Edwards, but Butcher and Hussain added 119 in a record third-wicket stand. Butcher, who only passed a fitness test on his injured ankle on the eve of the match, was dropped twice but batted well before finally becoming Edwards third victim, caught behind for 58 just before the close. Hussain was on 41 at the close, while Graham Thorpe was batting on one. Edwards finished with figures of three for 50. The West Indies also had a scare when captain Brian Lara was hit on his little right finger. Later, X-rays revealed no fracture. Having failed to add to their overnight total of 311 for nine when Edwards was superbly caught by Andrew Flintoff at second slip to give Matthew Hoggard his third wicket, West Indies hit back with some spirited fast bowling. England captain Michael Vaughan cracked one trademark cover drive for four, but both openers struggled against the pace of Edwards and Corey Collymore, the latter having a confident leg-before appeal against the England captain turned down. Edwards always looked the most dangerous and after ripping a bouncer past Trescothicks head, he fired the next one in at more than 150 kph and the opener, on the back foot, got an inside edge onto his stumps to be out for seven. Butcher almost did the same to his first ball but Edwards would not be denied and in his next over, claimed the important wicket of Vaughan for 15 with a delivery that moved off the seam and found the edge, with Lara taking the catch at second slip. Edwards almost got a third wicket in the morning session when Butcher edged to short leg but Ramnaresh Sarwan failed to take the sharp chance. If the morning belonged to West Indies, the afternoon session was Englands. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Last tie most exciting for Anand
 This was by far the easiest triumph for Anand in Mainz Mainz: World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand won the chess classic duel of the world champions for the fourth time on the trot after successive draws on the final day against Spaniard Alexei Shirov at the Rheingoldhalle here (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). Anand won with a 5-3 margin, same as he scored last year against Hungarian Judit Polgar and was never in trouble throughout the match after taking the lead on Day I itself. With this win, Anand stamped his authority on Mainz where this is Anands seventh title victory in all and fifth in a row. In 2000, Anand had won it in Frankfurt. This is Anands second title in the rapid chess this year after he won the rapid section of Amber tournament earlier in Monaco. The 2003 Oscar winner had also won the Corus Super Grandmasters tournament at Wijk Ann Zee, Netherlands, in January this year, and just a week before, he had cruised to an emphatic victory in the Dortmund Sparkassen chess meeting. Quite interestingly, this was by far the easiest triumph for Anand in Mainz. The Indian was stretched full distance in his last three outings here and most remarkable of them was his recovery after three slip-ups against Polgar of Hungary last year. After trailing thrice in the match, Anand had come back strong on the last day to win both games and the match. It may be recalled here that all the eight games in that were decisive, a record of sorts in high-level competitive chess these days. On Sunday, Shirovs resistance simply evaporated. Needing two victories to lead the match to tie-breaker, the author of bestseller Fire on Board, was taken to task in the Ruy Lopez by Anand, and had little chances after a flurry of exchanges led to a level opposite colour bishops endgame in the seventh game. There was hardly any reason to continue thereafter and the peace was signed in just 27 moves. The last game of the match held only academic interest as Anand already had a two-point cushion to back him. The Glek variation gave nothing to Shirov in the opening but later he was able to enter complexities after an exchange sacrifice. A lot of excitement followed as Anands king came under mortal danger and it was only resourceful defence which helped him salvage the half point in the end. The peace was signed after 63 moves with Shirov giving up on perpetual checks. After the match Anand said, it was just a very open match. Shirov had two weak moments and since he was two points down, it gave me the opportunity to just play for a draw and finish the match. In that sense I was lucky to get the lead and keep it, otherwise all the other games were going topsy turvy back and forth. The second game of the day was hard for me, I had to defend all the time. Overall, I have to say that the match was very tight. I would say that the quality of the games were very good. That was definitely one of the most exciting matches I ever played, said Anand about the last day.  (PTI)  Copyright

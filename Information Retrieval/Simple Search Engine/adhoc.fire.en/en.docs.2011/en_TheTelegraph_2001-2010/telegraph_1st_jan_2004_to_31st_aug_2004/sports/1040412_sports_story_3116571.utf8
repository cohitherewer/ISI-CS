The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara smashes 25th ton
 - FINAL TEST - Sarwan falls to Harmison after a well-made 90  Brian Lara en route to his unbeaten 86 in St Johns on Saturday .(AP) St Johns: West Indies captain Brian Lara scored his 25th Test century as the home side moved closer to avoiding a series whitewash on day two of the fourth and final Test against England. Lara treated the St Johns crowd to a superb exhibition of stroke play as he cruised to unbeaten 165 at lunch to help West Indies move to 342 for three. They had resumed at 208 for the loss of two wickets. Steve Harmison captured the only wicket to fall, that of Ramnaresh Sarwan for 90 which took his series tally to 23. If England still harboured thoughts of completing a first whitewash of West Indies in the Caribbean, these were swept away by Lara who announced his intentions by smashing the first ball of the day for four. On the same ground where he scored a then world-record 375 against England in 1994, Lara tormented the tourists bowlers on both sides of the wicket. Harmison and Matthew Hoggard had no luck on the flat pitch so England captain Michael Vaughan tried Gareth Batty and even bowled himself to eat up time before the second new ball. Lara reached his century with a cut through the covers for two runs. His only scare of the morning came when, on 127, he attempted a second run against the arm of Hoggard at third man. Although the throw was a direct hit, Lara just made his ground. Lara reached his 150 off 199 balls and by lunch had hit 18 boundaries. At the other end, Sarwan passed 50 for the 20th time in Tests and delighted the crowd with one drive for six off Batty. With the right-hander 10 runs short of his century, Harmison returned with the new ball and had Sarwan caught at first slip by Marcus Trescothick to end a partnership worth 232 runs. Ricardo Powell, called up to replace Shivnarine Chanderpaul, came in above Ryan Hinds at number five and was not out four at the break. Earlier Chris Gayle set the tone with a quickfire 69 before lunch while Sarwan was unbeaten on 41 with West Indies scoring their runs at almost four an over. England coach Duncan Fletcher said the flat nature of the pitch meant the bowlers had to be more patient if they are to stop West Indies amassing a big total. Trailing 0-3 and looking to avoid a first-ever whitewash on home soil, West Indies won the toss and decided to bat on the same St Johns ground that yielded 1,315 runs in the final Test against Australia 11 months ago. While Englands bowlers could perhaps be forgiven for not hitting the heights of the opening three Tests, West Indies batsmen at last showed the kind of spirit that had been so sorely lacking. After a slow start, the decision to bat looked a good one as Gayle punched boundaries almost at will off Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard. Harmison, needing just six wickets to set a record of 28 wickets in a series between the two sides in the Caribbean, was a little wayward early on and West Indies took advantage. Only a bowling change brought about the breakthrough for England as Andrew Flintoff trapped Daren Ganga leg before for 10.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

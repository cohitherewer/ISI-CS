The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kale given time to produce witness
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Abhijit Kale at a city hotel on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: There is no end in sight to the Abhijit Kale saga. The BCCI now hopes to come out with a clear verdict by the end of next month. National selectors Pranab Roy and Kiran More were present along with Kale at the hour-and-a-half disciplinary committee hearing on Thursday. The Maharashtra cricketer has been accused of offering an inducement to the two selectors for a Team India berth. BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, vice-presidents Kamal Morarka and Ranbir Singh Mahendra constitute the three-member disciplinary committee. BCCI secretary and committee convener S.K. Nair was also present at Thursdays hearing. According to sources, Kale has been asked to decide by Monday on whether he will produce any other evidence in the form of a witness. Kale initially said no to the proposal at the hearing, but has been given some more time. I have conveyed my side of the story in the reply to the showcause, he is reported to have told the committee. The selectors will provide witnesses at the next hearing. No decision was been taken today as we need to hold a few more meetings for hearing some witnesses, Dalmiya said later. Kale, however, expressed confidence that he would be able to prove his innocence. I am confident that I will come out clean whatever be the accusations against me, Kale remarked.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England take 223-run lead
 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who scored his 11th century, at Lords on Saturday London, July 24 (Reuters): England were 71 without loss and in total control at stumps on day three of the first Test at Lords on Saturday, after Andrew Flintoff took three wickets for no runs to help restrict West Indies for 416. Marcus Trescothick made a steady 34 and Andrew Strauss was unbeaten on 27 as the home side built a lead of 223. Earlier, Shivnarine Chanderpaul (128 not out), had calmly guided the West Indies past their follow-on target of 369 after England amassed 568 in their first innings. Flintoff, however, made sure England started their second innings with a lead of 152, finishing with three for 25 from 10. The all-rounder bowled Omari Banks off his pads for 45 before sending Tino Bests stumps flying next ball. Pedro Collins (0) easily dealt with his tame hattrick ball but could do nothing two overs later when Flintoff uprooted his off stump. Spinner Ashley Giles wrapped up the innings, bowling Fidel Edwards (5) for his fourth wicket. Ridley Jacobs earlier fell for 32, caught behind off Matthew Hoggard, having survived a difficult dropped catch by Flintoff in the slips. Banks also received two let-offs when Graham Thorpe failed to gather a diving catch at mid-on and Steve Harmison could only get a hand to a drive when Banks again went after Giles on 24. Englands only breakthrough of the morning session was the dismissal of debutant Dwayne Bravo for 44. Bravo, who took three for 74 in Englands first innings, shared a 125-run stand with Chanderpaul, a record fifth-wicket partnership for the tourists at Lords.  Copyright

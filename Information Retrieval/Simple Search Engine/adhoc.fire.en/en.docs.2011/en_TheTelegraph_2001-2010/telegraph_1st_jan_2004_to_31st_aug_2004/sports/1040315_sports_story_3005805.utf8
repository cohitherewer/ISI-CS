The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Theres much work to be done, says Dravid
 - Had it been some other day, it (the ball) may have rolled past (the stumps)  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Karachi: On the morning after, Rahul Dravid didnt recollect having been cheered by Karachiites on 99 (also the score on which he fell), but did recall the many moments when the crowd applauded Team India in the opening ODI. Obviously, any home side is going to be cheered more, but the turnout was sporting and that made for a wonderful atmosphere, Dravid told The Telegraph, from the team hotel in Islamabad. Of course, he is disappointed at falling one short of what would have been his ninth hundred, but Indias thrilling five-run win has more than offset that. Yet again, its his effort which proved invaluable. I was looking for a single, but managed an inside edge (off a slower one from Shoaib Akhtar) and the ball rolled on to the stumps... Had it been some other day, it may have rolled past. Bottomline, though, is we won... That, really, is more important, Dravid said. He added: Basically, I had been aiming to stay till the end... After all, all we needed was to consolidate on the excellent start... Incidentally, being out on 99 is a first for the vice-captain in either form of the game. However, he has been dismissed five times in the 90s in Tests and, once before, in ODIs. While Dravid is intent on cashing-in on good form, he believes Team India will have to work hard to keep the momentum going. Despite scoring 349, there were times when it seemed victory would be Pakistans. And, so, we havent taken an emphatic headstart... Theres much work to be done. Meanwhile, Dravids 99 drew high praise from (among others) Hasib Ahsan. The former Pakistan off-spinner, chief selector and manager had this to say on Sunday evening: Till recently, Id never imagined I would see a batsman on a par with (Sir) Viv Richards... But, while Dravids style is different, he is no less brilliant. Its a pity he gets underrated... According to Ahsan, who is recovering from a bypass, he left the National Stadium at the break. For me, after that superbly-crafted innings, it didnt really matter which side won... To my mind, Dravid is the worlds No. 1 and his 99 only confirmed that. Pakistan must quickly draw up plans to neutralise him. Dravid is used to accolades, but should still treasure Ahsans appreciation.  Copyright

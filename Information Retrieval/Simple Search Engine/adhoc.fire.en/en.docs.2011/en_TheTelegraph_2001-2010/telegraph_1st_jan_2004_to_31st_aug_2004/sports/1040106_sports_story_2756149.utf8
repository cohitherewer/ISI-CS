The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shoaib doubtful for second one-dayer
 - Pak manager says team has enough bowling options  Shoaib Akhtar will undergo an ultrasound scan Queenstown: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar was still in doubt on Monday for the second ODI against New Zealand, as the groin injury he suffered during a practice session appears to have worsened. The fast bowler made the mistake of not wearing a guard during batting practice last Friday and was stopped in his tracks by a delivery from leg-spinner Danish Kaneria which hit him in the groin region. He was walking gingerly on arrival here for Wednesdays match after the injury ruled him out of the opening encounter, which New Zealand won by four wickets. Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid said Akhtar would visit a local doctor here on Tuesday for an ultrasound scan. Once we get the doctors opinion we will have a better idea about what to do, Rashid said. Shoaib didnt bowl at training on Monday but was able to run around with the team during warm-ups. Rashid said their premium pacer had not yet been ruled out of Wednesdays match but if he were, there were plenty of pace bowling resources with Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Umer Gul, Abdul Razzaq and Azhar Mahmood. Its part and parcel of sporting life, but life will go on, Rashid said. You miss a key player in your side but its not the first time he would be missing. Akhtar missed the first Test against New Zealand last month because of calf and hamstring strains but returned in the second Test to wreak havoc with a haul of 11 for 78 as Pakistan won the match and the series 1-0. His absence should thus be a huge blow to Pakistan, who are fighting to draw level in the series. Not that Shoaibs replacements did too badly in the first ODI but they certainly lacked the killer punch which could have titlted the match in favour of the visitors.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zicos army runs over hapless Indians
	 - World Cup Asian qualifiers  A desperate Rennedy Singh tries to arrest the progress of Keiji Tamada at the Saitama Stadium on Wednesday Saitama: Japan thrashed India 7-0 at home in an Asian 2006 World Cup qualifier on Wednesday to make it three wins out of three for the regional champions. Defender Yuji Nakazawa scored two second-half goals as Japan completely outclassed an India team ranked 143rd in the world at the rain-swept Saitama stadium. Japan, who had struggled to beat Oman and Singapore in their previous matches, top group 3 with a maximum nine points. Oman will keep the pressure on Japan if they beat Singapore at home. Theres not a lot you can say when you lose 7-0. I had said before that Japan were going to give somebody a thrashing. I just hoped that it wasnt gonna be us, but unfortunately it was, said India coach Stephen Constantine. But the players didnt stop fighting and trying and I thought they played as well as they possibly could against Japan at home, said Constantine. Japan coach Zico was unable to call on Europe-based trio Hidetoshi Nakata (groin), Junichi Inamoto (broken fibula) and Naohiro Takahara (lung infection). However, his team was never troubled by a lightweight Indian team that last beat Japan in 1970. We took our chances very well today and that was the difference, said Zico, who had come under fire after faltering performances against Oman and Singapore. The players worked hard for their goals and deserved this result. But we still have a job to do and that is to make sure we keep producing the right results so we win this group. Striker Tatsuhiko Kubo opened the scoring with a superb left-foot volley after 13 minutes. Midfielders Takashi Fukunishi and Shunsuke Nakamura also found the net as Japan took a 3-0 halftime lead. Substitute Takayuki Suzuki added a lucky fourth goal ten minutes after the restart before Nakazawa fired home a Nakamura free-kick from close range in the 66th minute. Mitsuo Ogasawara made it 6-0 two minutes later and the dread-locked Nakazawa headed his second of the game in the 78th minute to complete the rout. We werent able to score much in previous games, said Zico. But we created many chances in this game and took advantage of those chances and the team played well. Koreans win 2-0 In Taejon, a stunning long-range strike by Ahn Jung-hwan helped group 7 leaders South Korea to a 2-0 victory against Vietnam. The home side, without a head coach since Humberto Coelho stepped down in April following a shock goalless draw against the Maldives, broke the deadlock on the half-hour when Ahn received what appeared to be an innocuous layoff from Lee Eul-yong well outside the box. The Japan-based striker coolly struck a curling shot high into the right-hand corner of the net past the flailing hands of Vietnam goalkeeper Tran Minh Quang. Vietnam managed some brief forays forward in the first half, but South Korea, the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists, increasingly took command and were denied repeatedly by the post and some desperate defending by the visitors. The second goal came in the 62nd minute after Ahn set up midfielder Kim Do-heon, who shot low and hard on the edge of the area to slot the ball in the left-hand corner. Park Ji-sung of PSV Eindhoven had an outstanding game and was a constant threat with his storming runs from midfield, although caretaker coach Park Sung-hwa will be disappointed the home side failed to put away more chances.

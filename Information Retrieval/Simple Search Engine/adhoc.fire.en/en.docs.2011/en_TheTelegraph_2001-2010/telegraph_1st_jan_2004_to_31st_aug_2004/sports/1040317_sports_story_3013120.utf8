The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhupathi wins, Paes trips
New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi advanced to the second round but Leander Paes David Rikl lost in the first round of the ATP Tennis Masters Series meet in Indian Wells, California, on Monday. According to information received here, second seeds Bhupathi and Mirnyi overcame mid-match blues to overcome Julian Knowle of Austria and Michael Kohlmann of Germany 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. Seventh seeds Paes and Rikl lost a thriller to Swiss wild cards Yves Allegro and Roger Federer 6-7 (5-7), 5-7. Paes-Rikl and Bhupathi-Mirnyi had been drawn in the same half of the draw and would have clashed in the quarter finals had they won two rounds each. Bhupathi and Paes had faced each other in the final of the Dubai Open earlier this month, the former emerging winners.  (PTI)  Copyright

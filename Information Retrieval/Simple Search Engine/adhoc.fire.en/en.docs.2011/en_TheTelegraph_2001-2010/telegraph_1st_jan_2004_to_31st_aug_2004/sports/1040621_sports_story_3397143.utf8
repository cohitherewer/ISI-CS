The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Selectors settle for experience
 - 20 probables picked for Asia Cup - Paul among support pacers at camp  Rohan Gavaskar is back in reckoning Bangalore: The national selectors on Sunday settled for experience while naming the 20 probables for the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka next month. As expected, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was included in the list paving the way for his comeback into international cricket action after a six-month injury lay-off. The selectors, who had earlier named 24 players for a fitness camp, pruned the list excluding Test opener Akash Chopra, leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule, Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir and pacer Munaf Patel. Also ruled fit and making it to the probables list was left-arm pacer Zaheer Khan. Rohan Gavaskar, who missed the Pakistan trip after making his debut in Australia early this year, has been included. The BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said the 20 shortlisted players would assemble in Chennai for a training camp from July 3 to 8. The squad for Asia Cup will be named on July 7, he informed. Nair also named eight medium-pacers as support for the probables at the Chennai camp. These bowlers, who went through a special camp for pacers earlier this month, are Munaf, Avishkar Salvi, Shib Shankar Paul, Sidharth Trivedi, S. Sreesanth, Joginder Sharma, N. C. Aiyappa and Gagandeep Singh. Nair said trainer Gregory King, who had conducted the week-long fitness camp which concluded here on Saturday, had declared all probables as fit. All the probables are fit as reported by King, he said. The BCCI secretary also said that an India A team would tour Zimbabwe and Kenya in the next two months. The A team would play three four-day games against Zimbabwe next month before proceeding in August to Nairobi, where they would take part in a tri-nation tournament involving Pakistan A and Kenya. THE PROBABLES Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V. V. S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Parthiv Patel, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik, Ramesh Powar, Hemang Badani, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Ajit Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, L. Balaji, Amit Bhandari and Rohan Gavaskar.  (PTI)  Copyright

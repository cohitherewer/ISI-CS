				 																																	Lisbon: Former Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni has been named manager of Benfica. The Portuguese club announced on their website on Monday that Trapattoni would soon be presented to the media. Trapattoni lost his job as Italy manager after his side was knocked out of Euro 2004 in the group stage last month. Benficas previous manager Jose Antonio Camacho moved to Spains Real Madrid in May. 				 																																	Buenos Aires: Boca Juniors coach Carlos Bianchi, who led the team to three Libertadores Cup titles, has surprisingly quit the club. Im leaving Boca because I believe that is the best decision for the club, Bianchi was quoted as saying. Argentine media reported that relations between Bianchi and club president Mauricio Macri were strained over the sale of players. 				 																																	Berlin: Iraqs German coach Bernd Stange said on Monday he had resigned his job with deep regrets because of the deteriorating security in Iraq after leading the team for nearly two turbulent years. Stange, who guided Iraq from the closing months of Saddam Husseins regime into the violent-filled post-war era, said he no longer felt safe in Iraq and it was becoming increasingly impossible to train a football team amid the worsening turmoil. 				 																																	Sydney: A pistol-packing grandmother is set to become Australias oldest Olympian in 28 years after earning selection in the shooting team (25-metre) for the Athens Games. The 56-year-old Annette Woodward has her finger on the trigger and her sights set on Olympic gold. I think it just shows what self-belief can do, Woodward said. South Hadley (Massachusetts): American Meg Mallon celebrated Independence Day in style, coming from three behind at the start of the day to clinch her second US Womens Open crown by two shots at the Orchards Golf Club on Sunday. The 41-year-old fired a flawless six-under-par 65 to finish at ten-under 274 and claim the first prize.Sport on Screen						Cyling, Tour de France: Live from 6.30 pm on TEN Sports Cricket, Tri-series: England vs West Indies live from 3.15 pm on ESPN

(Reuters) Bridgetown: Brian Lara has insisted he will not step down as captain despite presiding over the West Indies first home series defeat to England since 1968. Lara is under renewed pressure after England won the third Test on Saturday to take a 3-0 lead on their four-Test tour and end a 36-year wait for their first Test series victory in the Caribbean. I have got another Test match to focus on, so the time for assessing my position of captain is not now, Lara said after his teams eight-wicket defeat inside just three days. Assessment time will come, but most of all, there are a lot of people in position to make that assessment. Most importantly, I am here to play for the West Indies. It has always been my dream to play for the West Indies in whatever capacity and I will be doing that for some more time. Lara quit captaincy four years ago in similar circumstances, but he wants to see more competition from the batting to ease his workload and avoid the collapses that occurred on Saturday when his team was dismissed for just 94 in their second innings.  Brian Lara feels this is not the time to assess his position as captainWe played four series before this and for me to score the most runs in each and every series is a little bit of a concern, Lara said. I still believe we have a good group of young batsmen. Its not that they are too inadequate in technique or anything like that. Its just a lot of pressure mentally and you have to be a big man to play Test cricket. Lara also believes the lack of mental strength, when the team is under pressure, is the reason for the inexplicable batting collapses particularly in the second innings of Tests. Vivian Richards, the former West Indies captain and now chairman of the selection panel, acknowledged that the team is packed with players of immense ability. But they just have not turned up to the party, Richards said. Richards revealed there were some players that were behaving like prima donnas and they needed to get their acts together.  We are at a stage now where the players are not learning as quickly as they should. There are some individuals performing just to keep their heads above water. This is not acceptable and is a selfish attitude. If we are going to move forward, there are certain measures I believe that will have to be put in place.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

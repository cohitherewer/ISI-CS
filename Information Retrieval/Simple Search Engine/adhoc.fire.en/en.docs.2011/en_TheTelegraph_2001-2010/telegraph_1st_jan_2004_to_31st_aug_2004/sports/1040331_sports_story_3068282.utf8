India upbeat vs Oman 
- We can beat anybody in Asia: Constantine
 While Samir Naiks absence is a blow, a lot depends on Ashim Biswas (left) upfront Kochi: If the impressive win over Singapore is any indication, India are set to take the fight to highly-rated Oman in their second match of the Asian Zone group III World Cup qualifying league, here on Wednesday, with a positive frame of mind. And Indias chief coach Stephen Constantine was oozing confidence in the pre-match interaction with the media. As he said: When it comes to the game on the field on any given day, we can just beat anybody in Asia. This perhaps sums up the upbeat mood in the Indian camp in the wake of a number of good showing in recent past. Constantine admitted the recent results might not be reflected in Indias standing in the Fifa ranking, but should be viewed as a catalyst in changing the attitude towards a much-needed self-belief. Oman went down fighting 0-1 to Japan in their qualifier. However, absence of key midfielders Samir Naik and AIFF Player of the Year Tomba Singh, due to injuries, is huge blow to Constantines gameplans. Though, the first-choice goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee has recovered from the sprained neck. It is the midfield and forwardline on which India are banking against Oman. And the quicker Ashim Biswas fills in the vacuum left by I.M. Vijayans retirement the better for his country. Ashim may be struggling for Mohun Bagan, but his knack of scoring in international matches should be a motivating factor for the Bhaichung Bhutia-led team. The same assessment can also be applied to Rennedy Singh, who hit the matchwinner against Singapore. (PTI)  Copyright

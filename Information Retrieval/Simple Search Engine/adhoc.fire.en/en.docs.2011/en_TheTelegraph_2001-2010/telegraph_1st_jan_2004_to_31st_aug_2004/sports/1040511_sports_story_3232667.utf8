 Valencia seal Spanish title

Valencia won 2-0 to clinch the title. (Reuters) Madrid: Valencia clinched their second Spanish title in three seasons after goals from midfielders Vicente and Ruben Baraja sealed a 2-0 win at Sevilla on Sunday. With only two games left, the victory left Rafa Benitezs side with an unassailable seven-point lead over Real Madrid, who slumped to their third successive defeat on Saturday, 3-2 at home to Real Mallorca. It is the first time in five years that Real have finished the season without a major trophy and they now have to battle with Barcelona for the runners-up spot and an automatic Champions League place. Valencia have the chance to end their campaign with a first ever domestic and European double. They meet Olympique Marseille in the Uefa Cup final on May 19. It is incredible, said Valencia captain David Albelda. I think were deserved winners, weve worked really hard all season and been by far the most consistent side in the league. Lets see if we can now go for the Uefa Cup as well. After 36 of 38 games Valencia have 77 points, Real follow on 70, one ahead of Barcelona. Deportivo Coruna, who slipped to a 0-2 defeat at struggling Espanyol, are a further four points adrift in fourth. Valencia produced the sort of slick, disciplined performance that has helped them earn a sixth league title in the 85 years since they were founded. They took the sting out of an aggressive Sevilla side in the opening minutes and hit their opponents with a devastating counter-attack from inside their own half in the 12th minute. Diminutive forward Xisco back-heeled the ball into the path of Vicente after receiving a quick pass down on the left flank from defender Amedeo Carboni. The speedy winger, who has been outstanding all season, raced towards the area, fended off a challenge from defender Javi Navarro and drilled the ball past goalkeeper Esteban at the near post to the delight of the 3,000-strong contingent of travelling Valencia fans. Valencia made a rare defensive error when Baptistas strike partner Carlitos got ahead of centre-back Carlos Marchena late in the first half but he sent his header over the bar. It was the visitors, though, who looked to have extended their lead three minutes later when Jorge Lopez turned sharply and fired home after controlling a Vicente cross with his chest, but the goal was harshly ruled out for off-side. Sevilla also had the ball in the net before the break when Carlitos headed home an Antonio Lopez cross, but this time the Sevilla forward had begun his run from an off-side position. The Andalucians, who knew that a win would put them into a Uefa Cup berth, put Valencia under heavy pressure early in the second half and midfielder Sergio Ramos and substitute striker Antonito went close to scoring. Goalkeeper Santiago Canizares, whose team has conceded only 24 goals all season, came to the rescue when he blocked a close-range shot from Sevilla striker Dario Silva 15 minutes from time. Valencia endured a few more scares before Baraja made sure of victory when he latched on to a short pass from Xisco, darted into the area, checked inside three defenders and slotted home with his left foot.

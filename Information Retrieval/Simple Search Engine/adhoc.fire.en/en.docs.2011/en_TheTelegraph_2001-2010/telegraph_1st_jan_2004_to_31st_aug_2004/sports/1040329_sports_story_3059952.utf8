 Jockey stays on respirator 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Young jockey Amjad Khan, remains in critical condition at Woodlands hospital on Sunday. Khan, who fell from his mound Bit Of Luck at the RCTC ground on Friday and suffered serious head injury, is responding partially to the treatment, according to a medical officer at the hospital, but remains on an artificial respirator. A CAT scan carried out on Sunday revealed only a marginal improvement, though he remains in a semi-conscious state.  Copyright

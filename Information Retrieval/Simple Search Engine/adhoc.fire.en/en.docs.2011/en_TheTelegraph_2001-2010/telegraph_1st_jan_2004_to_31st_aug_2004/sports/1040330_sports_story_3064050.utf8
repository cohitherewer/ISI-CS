The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mumbai have TN on the mat 
	 - RANJI TROPHY FINAL  Bahutule put up a fine allround show Chennai: Defending champions Mumbai put themselves in an unassailable position, leaving Tamil Nadu struggling at 163 for 3 in their second innings at close after taking a 319-run lead on the penultimate day of the Ranji Trophy final on Monday. Tamil Nadu face a daunting task first to score 156 more runs to avert an innings defeat. At close, Sadagopan Ramesh (31, 4x4) and S. Badrinath (17) were at the crease adding 28 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket. Earlier, Mumbai were all out for 613 in their first innings, adding 100 runs to their overnight score, in reply to Tamil Nadus 294. Mumbais innings folded minutes before the lunch with the hosts bowlers taking five wickets in the space of 14 overs and Mumbai captain Sairaj Bahutule missing a well-deserved century by eight runs. Bahutule was in the thick of action again, taking two crucial wickets in Tamil Nadus second innings as the hosts yet again failed to build big partnerships on the batsman-friendly turf. Tamil Nadu began the second innings on a positive note with captain S. Suresh and Vidyuth Sivaramakrishnan (70, 131b, 212m, 8x4) scoring 80 runs in 24.2 overs. But, Suresh got out giving a low return catch to Bahutule shortly before tea. After S. Sriram departed for five off the bowling of Bahutule, Sivaramakrishnan, promoted to open the batting, too made his exit, stepping out to Nilesh Kulkarni only to miss the line with wicketkeeper Vinayak Samant doing the rest. Suresh and Sivaramakrishnan, who has opened the batting on a few occasions in the past, tackled new-ball bowlers Avishkar Salvi and Munaf Patel well. Wasting no time, Bahutule soon brought on experienced left-arm spinner Kulkarni in the 12th over and himself a couple of overs later. And success came their way immediately. Earlier, Mumbai overnight batsmen Bahutule (92, 182b, 11x4, 2x6) and Amol Muzumdar (146, 291b, 20x4, 1x6) extended their sixth wicket partnership to 181 runs, adding 50 runs in 17 overs despite Tamil Nadu skipper Suresh taking the second new ball in the first over itself. The duo got out in quick succession with the team score on 570 for 7, but, the lower order ensured the total crossed the 600 mark. Left-arm spinner Sivaramakrishnan bagged three wickets for 146 runs from his 42.5 overs while R. Ramkumar and C. Ganapathy shared the other two wickets to fall on Monday.  (PTI)  Copyright

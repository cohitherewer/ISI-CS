The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Teams agree to pro-league proposal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The idea of the proposed professional league has been unanimously agreed upon by representatives of the CFL Super Division clubs in a meeting convened by the IFA on Wednesday. It was decided the IFA would send circulars to the clubs elaborating the modalities of the league. If eight or less teams agree to it, then the professional league will start from this season. However, if eight or more teams agree, then well start next season, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said. In that case, the top eight teams of the Super Division will play the pro-league. The last-ranked pro-league team will be relegated to Super Division while the champion Super team will make the professional grade. Provided the professional league doesnt start this season, the Super Division will be a 14-team affair.  Copyright

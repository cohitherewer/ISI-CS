				 																																	London: English captain Michael Vaughans misery on the cricket field seems to have extended off it as well. After the defeat to the West Indies in the NatWest Series on Sunday, Vaughan found the following day that his wallet containing more than 1,000 and a Brian Lara autographed match ticket of the historic Antigua Test  where he crossed the 400-run barrier  was missing along with a valuable watch.				 																																	Vaughans teammate Darren Gough also got the shock of his life when he found that almost 300 and as many as 17 credit cards were missing from the dressing room on returning from the practice nets in Durhams Riverside ground in Chester-le-Street. 				 																																	According to a report in The Daily Telegraph, the area around the dressing room was unguarded at the time of the walk-in theft and the room was also not locked. However, the thief was caught on the circuit TV tapes. 				 																																	Johannesburg: South Africa defender Mbulelo Mabizela has been stripped of the captaincy after reporting late for training, coach Stuart Baxter said on Wednesday.				 																																	Mabizela will play against Burkina Faso in the World Cup African Zone group II qualifier in Johannesburg on Saturday but is replaced as skipper by Belgian-based centre back Aaron Mokoena. The Tottenham Hotspur player had been given the weekend off from South Africas preparations for a family celebration but was a day late returning to the teams camp in Johannesburg.. 				 																																	Jerusalem: Israeli side Hapoel Beer Sheva were thrown out of the Intertoto Cup by Uefa on Tuesday after they fielded a player who was not registered in their team list. The club had advanced to the second round after beating Albanian side Vllaznia on away goals after a 2-2 aggregate result in the two legs.				 																																	Uefas disciplinary body awarded Vllaznia a 3-0 win in the second leg in which international defender Tomer Haliva played as a substitute. Halivas name had been omitted from Beer Shevas squad list, which they submitted to Uefa prior to the game. 				 																																	Paris: The family of Cameroons Marc-Vivien Foe, who died of a heart attack a year ago during a Confederations Cup match, is suing the French soccer federation (FFF) for failing to provide adequate medical back-up.				 																																	Foes wife Marie-Louise and her lawyers want to see FFF documents regarding the medical staff and equipment in place during the semi-final against Colombia at Lyons Gerland Stadium.				 																																	Foe collapsed in the 72nd minute of the game and died. Everybody saw Foe collapse and the unbelievable delay it took for him to be carried away from the pitch and be treated inside the stadium, Foes lawyer Alain Jakubowicz said. There was no specialist doctor, no equipment, nothing, he added.				 																																	Foes death has nothing to do with fate. It is clearly established that he was a healthy man. He died of a heart attack, which can happen but the problem is the failure of the safety services when the tragedy took place. quot;				 																																	The court is expected to make a decision on July 5 and Jakubowicz said he would take the case further whatever happened. He said Marie-Louise Foe had been neglected by the soccer authorities. 				 																																	Mexico City: Former Argentina captain Oscar Ruggeri was named coach of Mexicos richest club America on Tuesday. Americas official website said Ruggeri, a rugged former central defender reached an agreement with the club after negotiations with Daniel Passarella broke down.Sport on Screen Cricket, Sri Lanka in Australia: 1st Test, Day I, live from 5.25 am on ESPN

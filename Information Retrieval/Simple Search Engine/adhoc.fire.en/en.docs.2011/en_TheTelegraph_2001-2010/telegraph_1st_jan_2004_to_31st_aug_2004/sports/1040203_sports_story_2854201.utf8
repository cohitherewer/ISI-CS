The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick may quit coaching
 - I got the showcause letter when my job was on the line  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick at a press conference in Calcutta on Monday Calcutta: Describing the IFAs two-year ban on him as a distortion of truth, a sad and frustrated Subhas Bhowmick hinted on Monday at bidding farewell to coaching next season. I came into coaching out of sheer love for this game. But something some aspects of the games organisation has left me sad and frustrated. I dont know which way the water will flow, but as of now Im not too keen on coaching from next year, Bhowmick told a packed a press conference in the evening. The East Bengal coachs statement comes at a time when his club has thrown its weight behind him. Shortly before arriving for the press conference, Bhowmick held a meeting with East Bengal officials  including president Dr Pranob Dasgupta and secretary Kalyan Majumdar  at the club tent. The officials reiterated their support for Bhowmick with the secretary even going to the extent of saying that he would frame the coachs reply to the IFA letter once it reached him. The IFA announced the Bhowmick punishment on Thursday, but strangely the association has still not managed to send the letter to him. According to a senior IFA official, Bhowmick should get the letter by Wednesday. Two days were required to complete formalities, including framing of the minutes after the disciplinary committees decision, he explained. Mondays holiday and the proposed bandh on Tuesday compounded the problem. Bhowmick, however, has already started to think of East Bengal without him (the ban takes effect from May 16). I have told my club that whoever takes charge after I go, he will always get my help. As the coach, its my duty to see to it that whatever happens to me does not affect my team in future, quipped Bhowmick. Describing his criticism of the IFA as something he had uttered for the greater interest of football, Bhowmick lamented his call for more time was overlooked by the state association. He also went on record as saying that he was showcaused at a time when his job was at stake. I got the showcause letter on December 11 and I was asked to appear before the IFA committee a couple of days later. I sent my reply the very next day, seeking for three more weeks to appeare in person. I needed time to settle down after a very disappointing (National Football League) show in Goa. Moreover, I was living on the edge and my job as East Bengal coach didnt look all that secure at that time. But the IFA didnt pay heed to my request, Bhowmick pointed out. On prospects in the forthcoming AFC Cup meet, Bhowmick hoped his team could go the distance. I believe this team has tremendous potential and can not only win the NFL, but even reach the AFC Cup final. But my first match (versus Geyland United of Singapore) is crucial. Everything depends on how we are going to play that game (on February 10 in Singapore). He further said that even a 60 per cent fit Suley Musah and M. Suresh would give his team a proper composition. The boys are pretty serious about this tournament, so are the club officials. The dream of repeating the ASEAN Club Championship show is beckoning again, Bhowmick said.  Satyajit Bagans assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee, a former India international and green-and-maroon true blue, has been appointed as Mohun Bagans assistant coach. According to club sources, a contract was signed with him on Monday and the former medio will take charge from Wednesday. He will also oversee the teams practice in absence of chief coach Aloke Mukherjee, currently assisting India coach Stephen Constantine in the national sides pre-World Cup conditioning camp in Goa.

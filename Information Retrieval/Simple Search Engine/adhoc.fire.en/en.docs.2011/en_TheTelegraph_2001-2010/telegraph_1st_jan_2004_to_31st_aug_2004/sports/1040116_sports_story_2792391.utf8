The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East pip West in thriller
 Paul took four for 36 Siliguri: East Zone beat West Zone by one wicket in a thrilling Deodhar Trophy match at Kanchenjungha Stadium on Thursday. Chasing 227 to win in overs, East made 227 for nine with just one ball to spare. Shib Shankar Paul with the ball and Kiran Powar with the bat were the main architects of Easts victory. Paul took four for 36 in nine overs, while Powar hit 56 off 52 balls including six fours and a six. For West, Hrishikesh Kanitkar top-scored with 57 and Munaf Patel took three for 31. West were still in the hunt, reducing East to 217 for nine by the 48th over, but Paul and Sourashish Lahiri added the required ten runs off 15 balls. Skipper Devang Gandhi (30 off 51 balls) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (28 off 29) were the other notable scorers for East Zone. Devang won the toss and inserted West. Paul, who has had a hugely successful Ranji season, struck in the third over, getting rid of Niranjan Godbole. Opener Vinayak Mane and No. 3 Vinod Kambli took the score to 53 when Paul dismissed the former international for 23 (25 balls, 4x5). Shukla got into the wicket-taking act in the 19th over, sending back Mane, as West slumped to 87 for three. Kanitkar and N. Shetty then added 68 runs for the fourth wicket. Kanitkars 57 came from 100 balls, including a six and three fours. Kiran broke the potentially dangerous partnership in the 37th over by dismissing Shetty. West Zone failed to stitch together any other significant partnerships and despite a quick 22 by Ramesh Powar, failed to reach what would have been a challenging total. Even the East Zone batsmen failed to carry on after getting a start, but there were these small but useful contributions from just about everywhere which eventually made the difference between the teams. It was the first match for both teams.  Copyright

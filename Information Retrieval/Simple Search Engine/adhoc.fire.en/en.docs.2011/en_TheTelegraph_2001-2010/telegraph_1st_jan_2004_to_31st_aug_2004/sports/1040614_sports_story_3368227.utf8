 Larsson boost for Swedes 
 - Bulgaria depend heavily on Dimitar Berbatov  Larsson feels he brings experience to the teamPorto: Swedens hopes of advancing from an awkward group C depend on a winning start against Bulgaria on Monday and Henrik Larsson is just the man to deliver victory. With tougher fixtures against Denmark and Italy to come, the Swedes will expect to beat a team they have had few problems with in the last 30 years. Sweden have an impressive seven wins and two draws from the past nine meetings and Bulgaria have to go back to 1967 for their last success. As if that was not enough to tilt the odds in favour of the Scandinavians, they have the considerable boost of the return of prodigious striker Larsson. The record-breaking forward has changed his mind about playing for his country after retiring two years ago and marked his return with a goal in last weeks 3-1 win over Poland. His partnership with Zlatan Ibrahimovic gives Sweden a real cutting edge and Bulgarias sometimes shaky defence will be in for a stiff test. Everybodys been welcoming me since I came back and thats very good, Larsson said. I think I bring a lot of experience but Ive never been the guy who talks about what I do or dont do. I try to do all of those things on the pitch. Ajax Amsterdams Ibrahimovic was among the many welcoming Larssons return. It means a lot, not only for me but for the Swedish team, the supporters, the whole country. Bulgarias hopes depend heavily on striker Dimitar Berbatov putting away the few chances he is likely to get but the likes of Larssons Celtic teammate Stilian Petrov might have to be more concerned with defending than setting up attacks. The Swedes have plenty of creativity in midfield, with Rennes youngster Kim Kallstrom nicely complemented by Arsenals hard running Freddie Ljungberg. Swedens only concern is defender Olof Mellberg, who is playing through the pain of an Achilles tendon injury. Bulgarias chief worry is midfielder Martin Petrov, who strained a hamstring earlier this week but is expected to play.

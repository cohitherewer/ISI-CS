 Richards pulls up Lara
London: Former great West Indies batsman Viv Richards has criticised the teams current captain Brian Lara for failing to motivate his players during the Test series against England. Brian Lara must take a long, hard look at himself, former West Indies captain Richards told a TV channel on Sunday. The side are now in a bad way and, if you have a leader who cannot motivate, you have problems. These guys are not focused enough. Weve seen some brilliance here and there but success for an hour or two isnt going to win you any Test matches. Richards added that Laras team lacked mental discipline. I believe these guys are not good thinkers. They need to be more focused, he said. We have all identified the ability factor. But if you dont think, that ability is null and void, added Richards, who scored 8,540 runs in 121 Tests,. West Indies, struggling in eighth position in the ICC championship table after dominating world cricket in the 1980s, have lost 10 of their last 20 Tests. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Lisbon: England captain David Beckhams wayward penalty in the European Championship quarter final against Portugal has ended up in northern Spain.				 																																	Englands first attempt in the shootout which followed Thursdays 2-2 draw landed in the hands of a 25-year-old Spaniard who said he was taking it home to Galicia. I play basketball and when the ball came in my direction, I jumped, caught the ball with one hand and put it under my shirt, Pablo Carral told the Portuguese sports daily A Bola on Sunday. Im keeping it as a great trophy. We were sitting in row Q. So you can imagine how much that shot missed by. Lisbon: Injured Greece midfielder Stelios Giannakopoulos looks likely to play in Greeces semi-final on Thursday, a Greek FA official said on Sunday. Giannakopoulos has missed the last two matches, including Greeces surprise 1-0 quarter final defeat of favourites France on Friday, due to a pulled leg muscle. The doctor has told us he is doing a lot better and is expected to be ready on time and today he will also train with the ball, the official said. Alcochete: Portugal defender Jorge Andrade wished Englands Wayne Rooney a quick recovery on Sunday after being involved in the incident where the teenage striker broke a bone in his foot. I had an injury like this in the past and I know how much it costs to recover, said Andrade. I wish him all the best. I hope he gets over this as quickly as possible. He was a great talent in the tournament. Berlin: Otto Rehhagel has no intention of deserting Greece to take over the poisoned chalice of German national coach. The man known as King Otto has revealed he is not going to desert Greece for the 2002 World Cup finalists, whose coach Rudi Voller resigned on Thursday after they went out in the first round. I am going to stay with the Greeks unless they say thats enough, Rehhagel said. The Germans havent called me. In any case, I will not tear up my contract. Prague: From his tiny office with its walls lined with memorabilia, Radovan Jelinek has spent the past four years and all of his money putting together the worlds first football atlas. Jelinek, a 36-year-old Czech geographer and a life-long Liverpool fan, has combined his profession with his passion to create what he claims will be the definitive guide to the game. His book maps out every football-playing nation in the world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anelka eyes an opening
Paris: Two French sayings sum up Nicolas Anelkas position as he tries to restore his image with the public just at the right moment to claim back a place in Frances squad for Euro 2004. Impossible is not French, Napoleon Bonaparte is supposed to have said. The prospect of Anelka, who will be 25 next month, playing for France under manager Jacques Santini had seemed impossible since the Manchester City striker turned down a call-up in October 2002 before qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia. Anelka was angry at being summoned only as a second choice and Santini made it clear he was closing the door on any future selection. Nicolas banned himself from the team by turning down a selection. As long as he does not change his comments and attitude on his own initiative he remains unpickable in my view, Santini said. Another Gallic saying goes: Only fools dont change their minds, and Santini might well be forced by circumstances to prove he is no fool. While Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet are the automatic first-choice strikers for the finals in Portugal, Uefas decision to uphold Djibril Cisses five-match ban for kicking an opponent in an under-21 match has given Santini a serious headache. Uefa said on Friday it had rejected Cisses appeal against the ban, which will come into effect at the start of Euro 2004. The Liverpool-bound Cisses absence leaves France with few outside choices.

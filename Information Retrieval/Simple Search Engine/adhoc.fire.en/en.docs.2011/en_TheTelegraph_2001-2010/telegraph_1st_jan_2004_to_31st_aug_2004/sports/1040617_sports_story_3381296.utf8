 Miandad wishes Woolmer luck
Karachi: Javed Miandad, who had reached an agreement with the PCB a few days ago, was aware Pakistan would have a foreigner as coach. I didnt know they were bringing in Woolmer. But I knew it was a foreign coach. I wish him the best of luck in his assignment which is going to be a tough one, Miandad said. I just hope that the team does better under Woolmer, who has got a very high profile reputation.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

Boycott will then proceed to Bangalore and spend a few days with under-19 trainees at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and also the India A players, who travel to Zimbabwe and Kenya in July-August. It has been our endeavour to bring in more and more specialists for the benefit of youngsters, Dalmiya said in a statement.

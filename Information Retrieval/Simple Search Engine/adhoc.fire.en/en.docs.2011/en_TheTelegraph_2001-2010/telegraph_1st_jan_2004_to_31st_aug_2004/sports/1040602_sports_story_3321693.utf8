The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Blind school on Steves agenda
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Steve Waugh Foundation, after winning the hearts of the children of Udayan, now plans to set up a school for the blind in the city, though the location is yet to be finalised. After the success of the foundation in Australia and India, my next project is to set up a blind school, starting with 80 children, in this city, the former Australian skipper announced at a press conference on Tuesday. Waugh, who remains busy with his family of three children and wife Linette, devotes the rest of time to social commitments after saying goodbye to the game. Apart from that, I am writing a book on my career, Waugh revealed. After reaching the city early in the morning, Waugh had a hectic day. Under the scorching sun, he reached Udayan  a shelter for children of leprosy patients in Barrackpore  to present books and toys to the children who just love him. The children, in return, presented him a cake, remembering that Waugh turns 40 on Wednesday.  Copyright

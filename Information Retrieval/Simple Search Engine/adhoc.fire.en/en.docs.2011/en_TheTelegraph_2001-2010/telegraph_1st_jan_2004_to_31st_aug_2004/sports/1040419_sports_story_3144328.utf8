The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Subrata plans survival kit
 - New Bagan TD expects no miracle vs East Bengal - Aloke to stay away  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata Bhattacharya Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharya on Sunday officially took charge of the Mohun Bagan soccer team as technical director, and will be at the ground when the derby National Football League match versus East Bengal is played. At the same time existing coach Aloke Mukherjee declared that he will not attend club practice any more. He will not resign his post, though. Special officer Justice Shyamal Sen announced this at a press conference at the club tent. Immediately after he took over, Bhattacharya had an hour-long session with the players It will be a fight for survival from now, Bhattacharya said later. He, however, said that he didnt want to dream big, especially with the current state of mind of the players (after the huge defeat to Vasco). Brazilian recruit Leonardo Monorat de Almeida sounded happy at the appointment of the new technical director. It is a good step forward by the club. Bhattacharya has given three National League titles to the club in the past and so with his induction, the team will be in better shape, the Brazilian said. Senior pro Basudeb Mondal, though, didnt want to come clear. The team is passing through a lean patch and so we will have fight it out, was all he would say. Skipper Rennedy Singh didnt wish to comment. Bhattacharya will start training from Monday. I know how to motivate players, he said. Meanwhile, veteran masseur Govindraj has been removed and a local physio is likely to be inducted. Bhattacharya is also not thinking of any miracle in the match against East Bengal on April 25. We are in the relegation zone and they are in the title race. But we will try to snatch points from them which will be important for our survival, Bhattacharya admitted. He also praised Bhowmick for his effort to make his team the best in the country. Bhattacharya was handed the one-year contract by Sen. Sen also made it clear that present coach hasnt been sacked and if he wishes he can continue. Mukherjee, when contacted later, said: The club didnt convey me anything regarding the appointment of technical director and so the question of resigning doesnt arise. I will just stop going there.

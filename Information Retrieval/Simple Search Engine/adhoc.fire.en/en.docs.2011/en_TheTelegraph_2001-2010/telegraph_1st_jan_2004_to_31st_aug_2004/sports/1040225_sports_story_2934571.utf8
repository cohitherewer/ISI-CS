The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ralf distances self from reports
	 - THREAT TO LEAVE WILLIAMS  BMW Williams Ralf Schumacher at a break during free tests at the Imola race track on Tuesday. (AFP) London: Ralf Schumacher has distanced himself from reports suggesting that he had threatened to leave Williams at the end of the Formula One season in-a-row over money. The German, who has been increasingly linked with big-spending Toyota, said on his personal website on Monday that comments he made in a Sunday newspaper interview were not to be seen as a threat. All I wanted to do was to give an idea of what was going on and to counter press reports that implied that I was only interested in money, he said. All of that has absolutely nothing to do with what we are working for at the moment. Everyones focus is only on the start of the season and the first race in which we want to achieve maximum success. Everything else will just work itself out, Im sure. Ralf, younger brother of Ferraris six-time world champion Michael Schumacher, has been at BMW-powered Williams since 1999 and is a contender for the title along with Colombian teammate Juan Pablo Montoya. Montoya is leaving for McLaren at the end of the year when Ralfs contract also expires. The German has been negotiating with Williams for an extension but team boss Frank Williams said recently that he was playing hardball in the talks, with money the principal sticking point. Ralf, who denies money is the problem, told Germanys Bild am Sonntag that he was disappointed with Williams and suggested that they might have to look for two new drivers. I think that Williams are now under a big deal of pressure in the negotiations, he said. If they lose their second driver for 2005 after Montoya, they have a real problem. Frank Williams is portraying me as greedy but I can only laugh about that. He knows that I would be ready to give up nearly half of my current wages. Thats whats in the contract that has been ready to be signed for a long time, added Ralf in the newspaper. I wanted to sign. We had set up an appointment for the seasons last race in Japan but Frank did not come and he suddenly took back the offer. That is the truth, and its not okay. I am disappointed with him (Williams) as a person. You dont say something if you cant keep your word. Williams have a history of replacing drivers who make wage demands that they deem to be excessive, regardless of how successful he may be. British world champions Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill both left the team after winning the title, as did Brazilian Nelson Piquet in 1987. I think Franks always been very firm about limits beyond which he will not go, technical director Patrick Head said recently. Its partly because of that that we are still here as opposed to being a statistic in the history of Formula One. Williams have won nine constructors titles and seven drivers crowns since 1980. Their last was with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in 1997.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

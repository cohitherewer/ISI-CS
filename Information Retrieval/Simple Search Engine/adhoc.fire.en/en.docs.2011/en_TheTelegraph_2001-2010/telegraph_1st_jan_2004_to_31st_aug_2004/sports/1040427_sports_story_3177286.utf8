 Tollygunge on top after beating EB
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami took themselves to a comfortable position in their quest to lifting the A.N. Ghosh Trophy after beating East Bengal by seven wickets at Eden Gardens on Monday. Tollygunge, who finished with 24 points from seven matches, will have to wait for the result of the last league tie between Kalighat (20 points) and East Bengal (18). If Kalighat win that match, they will be tied on points with Tollygunge and the quotient factor will come into play. Devang Gandhis unbeaten 85 propelled Tollygunge to victory. Alokendu Lahiri chipped in with 58 as Tollygunge reached the target of 174 in 38.2 overs. BRIEF SCORES East Bengal 173/9 in 45 ovs (Shib Sagar Singh 39, Saikat Mukherjee 45, Amitava Chakraborty 33). Tollygunge 174/3 in 38.2 ovs (Devang Gandhi 85 n.o., Alokendu Lahiri 58). Tollygunge won by 7 wkts.  Copyright

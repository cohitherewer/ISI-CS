The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shibram denies Bagan win 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Mohun Bagans Eduardo Coelho tries a header in front of the Calcutta Port Trust goal in their Super Division match at the Mohun Bagan ground on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, July 24: It was out and out a one-way traffic for Mohun Bagan, but they could not quite reach the destination as desired. In the end, Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) rode a brilliant performance of Shibram Dey under the bar to hold Mohun Bagan goalless in a CFL Super Division match on Saturday. This is Mohun Bagans second draw following their 1-1 verdict with East Bengal, who were also held by Eastern Railway in their previous match. Mohun Bagan are now on 11 from five, a point less than CPT. With the scoreline being a bit deceptive, Mohun Bagan had only themselves to blame as their forwards did everything but the simple one of beating Shibram throughout the match. In between, Noel Wilson missed a penalty while Basudeb Mondal and Sunil Chhetri found the woodworks coming in the way of their attempts. The match, however, kicked off with a surprise CPT move when Kaushik Prasad nearly fetched his team a first-minute lead. But that was just an aberration and Mohun Bagan soon switched gears to increase the pace and raided the opponents box from all corners of the park. Their efforts looked to be paying off in the 28th minute when Ashim Biswas side-volley hit the CPT defender Rabindranath Karmakars right hand and the referee pointed his fingers to the penalty-mark. Wilson took the shot, but Shibram anticipated it brilliantly, dived to his left and parried the danger, much to the disappointment of the home supporters. It just told a story of a tussle between the CPT custodian and Mohun Bagan forwards with the former winning the battle in style. Then a minute before the break, Basudeb, who replaced Rajesh Meetei, unleashed a 22-yarder only to find his shot ricocheting off the upright. The first-half also witnessed an interesting move from coach Subrata Bhattacharyas end when he withdrew new Brazilian recruit Reggis Carlos Montero and replaced him with Abhay Kumar in the 32nd minute. Later, the coach refused to comment on the matter. Mohun Bagan continued to attack after the breather, but the forwards lack of penetrative power was getting exposed to a heavily-guarded CPT box. Ashim, Chhetri and Tomba Singh were pressing hard for the much-needed goal as the time were wearing on, but in vain. In the 67th minute, Chhetris firm right-footer was partially saved by Shibram and the ball went on to hit the horizontal instead of going inside.

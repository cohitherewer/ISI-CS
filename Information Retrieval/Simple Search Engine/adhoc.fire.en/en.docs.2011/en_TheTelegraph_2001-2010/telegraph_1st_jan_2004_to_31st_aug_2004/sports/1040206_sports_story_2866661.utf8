The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inheriting the Srikkanth legacy
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Exceptional eyesight and aggressiveness. This is what used to characterise Krishnamachari Srikkanth as an opener. And this is also what his son, a South Zone under-19 cricketer, claims to have inherited. During his playing days, my father was known for his eyesight. He was also an aggressive batsman. And I believe I have inherited these two qualities from him, Anirudh, who may make his debut for Tamil Nadu against Mumbai in the national one-day meet here, said on Thursday. Incidentally, Kunal, son of Madanlal, is playing for Delhi in this tournament as well. Like his father, Anirudh is also an opener. Its obvious my father remains to me the ultimate inspiration. Though he hardly helps me at nets, he often advises me to focus on my mental development and enjoy the game, the class XII student of Chennais Bala Vidyamandir said. My father holds a special place in my life and will always be among the top-five cricketers. But its Viv Richards and Brian Lara I idolise, Anirudh said.  Copyright

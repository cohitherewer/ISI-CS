The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lloyd made allowance for Dravids reputation
	 - Jelly bean affair: honest mistake leaves team india vice-captain devastated  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Team India vice-captain Rahul Dravid at Sydney airport on Wednesday. (AP)  Calcutta: If it was a blade of grass in Port  Elizabeth, a jelly bean caused that stink in Brisbane. On  both occasions, the external elements encouraged an offence  amounting to changing the condition of the ball.  Yet, Mike Denness and Clive Lloyd  the respective  Match Referees  acted differently on a breach of Law 42.3  which invites penalties listed under Level 2 offences in  the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) Code of Conduct. While the former England captain triggered a controversy, nobody is questioning Lloyds action. Denness, it may be recalled, gave no weightage to Sachin Tendulkars exemplary track record and handed out a one-Test suspended sentence besides docking 75 per cent of his match fee in Port Elizabeth. That was 26 months ago. On Tuesday, Lloyd took Rahul Dravids all-clean image into account and docked just 50 per cent of his match fee in Brisbane. Lloyd, one understands, promptly accepted the Team India vice-captains explanation that (a) a partially eaten jelly bean accidentally came out with the saliva and got embedded in the ball; (b) it was removed when noticed during the act of polishing.  According to The Telegraphs  sources, the Match Referee did, however, make two points:  That the incident looked awful on TV and, secondly, he  would keep Dravids disciplinary record in mind while  determining the penalty. Lloyd kept his word. Of course, he could have matched Denness or, worse, given the maximum punishment: Docking the full match fee and/or slapping a ban which would have kept Dravid out of two ODIs. Apparently, the light penalty has brought no relief to the very pucca Dravid, who is absolutely devastated. As a confidant put it: Dravid is conscious about his image and is happy playing role model Irrespective of what happened, the ICCs records will show he got booked for ball-tampering Accepting that isnt going to be easy The gentleman added: In fact, the last thing Dravid needed was a black mark in the home stretch of what has been a great tour for him and India Hes totally devastated. Predictably, Dravid declined to speak as the Code bars him from commenting on a ruling by any Match Referee. Captain Sourav Ganguly, though, did defend his vice-captain. Look, nothing was premeditated It was an honest mistake and has been accepted as one Nothing else should be read into the incident, he insisted, when contacted at the team hotel (Rydges Jamison).  While one hopes Dravid quickly gets over this unfortunate  booking, theres a lesson for everybody: Even the most unlikeliest  candidate can make an honest mistake.  Copyright

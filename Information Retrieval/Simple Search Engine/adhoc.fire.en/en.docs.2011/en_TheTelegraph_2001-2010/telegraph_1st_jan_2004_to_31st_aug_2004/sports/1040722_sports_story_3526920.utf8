 Rebels to go into arbitration with ZCU
London: Zimbabwes 15 rebel cricketers will go into arbitration with ZCU to end their race row, the players lawyer said on Wednesday. We agreed to arbitration with the ZCU, lawyer Chris Venturas said. We have to do it to try to play some cricket. The ZCU has been put under pressure so theyve tabled this arbitration, Venturas said. The players and the ZCU have two weeks to choose their representative on the arbitration panel, and the process should then end within 52 days.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

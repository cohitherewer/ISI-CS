 Marsh not to extend contract
 Marsh doesnt want to stay till the World CupHarare: Geoff Marsh will quit as Zimbabwe coach when his contract expires in September, he said on Sunday. The former Australia opening batsman had been asked to continue until the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. But I declined, he said. I didnt want to stay that long. There is no other reason. Marsh, who has been in the job for two-and-a-half years, added: I have nothing lined up. I will just go fishing and see what happens. Marsh has refused to get embroiled in the controversy surrounding Zimbabwe cricket in the last six weeks following the sacking of former captain Heath Streak and the strike of white professionals which followed. When asked by one of the rebels why he did not support them, he responded by saying he was contracted to coach the Zimbabwe national side. And thats what I am doing. Marsh, who will not be involved in coaching ahead of the England tour to Zimbabwe in late October, suggested former West Indies batsman Phil Simmons could be called up as his successor. Simmons has been in Zimbabwe for the past several weeks coaching at the Academy in Harare. Ill be very happy to work with him until he takes over, Marsh said. Simmons played in 26 Tests. The chief executive of the ZCU, Vincent Hogg, declined to comment on Marshs resignation and whether they had approached Simmons. Rebels left out Meanwhile, none of the 15 white rebel Zimbabwe players were named in an A side to play a two-day match against Australia starting on Monday in a sign that a resolution to the crisis is no closer. The rebels declared they were unavailable for selection last month in a dispute with the ZCU over the end of Streaks tenure as captain, the composition of the selection panel and the alleged poor conduct of ZCU officials. The board fired the players on Monday after the players had accepted in principle to the boards offer of mediation. On Friday the ZCU issued a statement saying the players had 21 days to return to work, raising hopes that an end to the impasse was in sight. However, the Zimbabwe A team named by the ZCU for a two-day match against Australia in Harare on Monday and Tuesday did not include any of the rebels. The A team will be captained by Blessing Mahwire, who was left out of the current second Test against Sri Lanka in Bulawayo after he was reported for a suspect bowling action following the first Test.

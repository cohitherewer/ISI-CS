 Pak support for India
New Delhi: The Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) will support Indias bids for the 2014 Asian Games and the Olympics two years later. You will see Pakistan standing shoulder to shoulder with India, said POA secretary general Latif Butt after a meeting with his Indian counterpart on Friday. Butt also spoke about staging the Punjab Games in Patiala between December 5 and 11. The games will be between Indian Punjab and Pakistan Punjab. This event is just the beginning. We are planning to organise more such meets to improve relations between the two countries. This is just an attempt to eliminate the distrust, Butt said. (PTI)  Copyright

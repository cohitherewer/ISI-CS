The Telegraph - Calcutta
 British media hails Indian triumph
London: The British media has lauded Indias historic ODI series victory in Pakistan, saying they put to rest several ghosts by producing their finest performance of the tour in the series-decider in Lahore. If they never take another wicket or score another run in their lives, Indias players can content themselves with the fact that they performed when the stakes were at their highest, said The Times. The Daily Telegraph described it as a historic triumph for India. With a banner headline India conquer with Laxman, The Guardian said the opening leg of a momentous tour ended with India winning their first series in Pakistan. The tour, it said, has been marked by a rare bonhomie and if the Lahoris felt a deep pain at Wednesdays defeat, they did not vent it in a manner that would spoil the atmosphere of the past 12 days.

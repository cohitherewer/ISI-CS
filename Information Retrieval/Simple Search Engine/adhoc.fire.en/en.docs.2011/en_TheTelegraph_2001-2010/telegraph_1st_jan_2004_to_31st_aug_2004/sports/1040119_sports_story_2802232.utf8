 ICC inks MoU with betting firm
London: To tackle the betting menace, the ICCs Anti-corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with an online betting exchange company. Under the agreement, the ACSU will be able to request the online firm Betfair the information which will identify individuals behind activity which has given rise to strong suspicion that corruption may have taken place. The aim of the agreement is to help protect and maintain the integrity of international cricket. ACSU will now have access to a greater level of information than they were able to get from the betting exchange industry, the ICC said in a statement on Saturday. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said, This agreement is part of our on-going commitment to the eradication of corrupt practices prejudicial to the interests of the game, he said. Mark Davies, Betfairs director of communications, said: We are delighted to be able to widen the breadth of agreements we have with the governing bodies of sport... Betfair has no vested interest in the outcome of any event and our interests are absolutely in line with those who run the events. (PTI)  Copyright

 Dominiguez steals show
 Topalov makes the pre-quarters stage Tripoli: Grandmaster Lenier Dominiguez of Cuba provided the biggest sensation of the third round of the world chess championship by ousting Grandmaster Vladislav Tkachiev of France on Thursday. Top-seeded Bulgarian Grandmaster Veselin Topalovs winning spree was halted by Grandmaster Sergei Movsesian of Slovakia but the drawn result was enough to take the former to the pre-quarterfinal stage as he had won the crucial first encounter between the two. Yet again no major surprises proved that the top players in the championship have adapted themselves quite well to the new Fide time control and the knockout system. Dominiguez stole the show from even the likes of second seed Michael Adams and Topalov with his back-to-back victories over Tkachiev, a formidable opponent. Having lost the first game, it wasnt anyway easy for Tkachiev to make a come back even as he tried valiantly. As the game progressed into wild tactics, Dominiguez found Tkachieve off guard and eventually won an exchange. To add to the woes of the French, the position had simplified beyond repairs. The game lasted 33 moves. Topalov had little difficulty in securing the required draw against Movsesian who played white. Going for the Italian game, Movsesian failed to get much and signed his ouster papers after getting a slightly worse position in 27 moves. Speaking about his chances in the event now, Topalov said it was still very tough and there are many stalwarts here. On being asked about Indian performances the Bulgarian said, they all appear very good and this time I think they will be amongst medals in the Olympiad with Anand leading them. (PTI)  Copyright

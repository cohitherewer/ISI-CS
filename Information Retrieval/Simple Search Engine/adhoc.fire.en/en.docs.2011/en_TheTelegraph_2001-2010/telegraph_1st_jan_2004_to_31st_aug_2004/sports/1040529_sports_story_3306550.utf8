The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Action replay for Verkerk in Paris
 Verkerk is determined to repeat his run to the final Paris: Martin Verkerk is so determined to repeat last years run to the French Open final that he is staying in the same hotel, eating the same food and using the same rackets which helped propel him from a journeyman to an overnight sensation. The Dutchman came into Roland Garros in 2003 known only to his fellow-professionals but left two weeks later as an advertisers and sponsors dream with his contorted faces of joy and fist-pumping enthusiasm delighting the Paris crowd. Im very superstitious. I have everything the same, said the 19th seed who reached the third round on Thursday when his Romanian opponent Victor Hanescu had to retire with an injury in the final set. I do everything the same. I have the same coach as well. Never change a winning team, said Verkerk who faces Lleyton Hewitt in the third round. The 25-year-old Verkerk beat former champion Carlos Moya, Guillermo Coria and Rainer Schuettler on way to the 2003 final before running out of steam against Juan Carlos Ferrero. After that, things went steadily downhill with a first-round exit at Wimbledon, where his big service game was expected to thrive, and a failure to get beyond the third round of any tournament in the remainder of the season. This year, things have improved with quarter-final spots in Sydney, Milan, Scottsdale and a runners-up place in Munich, and he knows the reason for the transformation. I have a 45-minute tape of last years French Open and I watch it a lot especially when Im down or not playing well, he explained. It has all the small things on there. The first round, the second round, press conferences. Its very funny. It always brings a smile to my face. To watch that tape inspires me. In fact, since last year, he has been inundated with tapes and photographs. I think I have 35 tapes from everywhere. For the first two months after, photos came in from all over the world. I have so many things at home. Its very special, I shall never forget it. People say that for six months after Roland Garros, things were not so good but there are worse things in life than a tennis game, so I knew it would all come right because I have been playing really well from the first of January. Now Hewitt stands in Verkerks path to another fourth-round appearance and the 12th-seeded Australian will start as favourite having won both their career meetings on hardcourts in Sydney this year and on clay at last weeks World Team Championship in Duesseldorf. Hes a top-five player on every surface, said Verkerk who admires the Australians enthusiasm for the game, which is similar to his own. Its good to be enthusiastic. If you are not, you should stop playing.  (AFP)  Copyright

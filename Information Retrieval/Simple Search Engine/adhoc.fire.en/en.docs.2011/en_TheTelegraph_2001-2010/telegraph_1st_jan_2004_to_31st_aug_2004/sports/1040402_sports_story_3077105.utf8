The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nazir in place of Saqlain
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Multan: The Pakistan selectors have dropped the experienced Saqlain Mushtaq after just one Test. He was brought back from the cold, ostensibly because he could make a difference, but has quickly got the chop. We didnt quite like his approach here (in the first Test)... Given that he has been around for many years, we expected him to be positive... Frankly, we felt quite disappointed, chief selector Wasim Bari told The Telegraph. Saqlain went for 204 in 43 overs, managing only Akash Chopras wicket. The selectors, however, havent brought in a spinner  instead, opener Imran Nazir has been recalled. While its unlikely he will displace either Imran Farhat or Taufeeq Umar in Lahore, where the second Test begins on April 5, he may well be a contender in the Rawalpindi Test (from April 13). For now, though, the squad is just for the second Test and Danish Kaneria must be pretty pleased with Thursdays developments. Incidentally, Bari added that the panic button wasnt pressed despite the innings defeat at the hands of India. Our boys didnt play to potential... They are capable of a much better show, he pointed out. THE SQUAD Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Yusuf Youhana, Taufeeq Umar, Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Asim Kamal, Misbah-ul Haq, Imran Nazir, Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Umer Gul and Danish Kaneria.

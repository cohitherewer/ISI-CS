 Inzaghi set for surgery
Rome: AC Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi will undergo exploratory surgery on his troublesome left ankle, the Serie A club confirmed on Tuesday. The 30-year-old Italy international has not played for the Italian league leaders since coming on as a second-half substitute in Milans 4-0 away-defeat to Deportivo La Coruna on April 7. Inzaghi said he hoped to play for Milan before the season ends and to go to Portugal for the Euro 2004 this summer. Its unfortunate but its is the only solution, he said. I spoke at length with the team doctors and they told me it was best to intervene as quickly as possible. My first and only thought is to cure this problem once and for all so that I can return to action without the fear of further problems. Meanwhile in Berlin, Germanys battle of the goalkeepers is over after a meeting between Oliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann on Tuesday. Germany coach Rudi Voeller said the two had talked before flying to Bucharest, where they play Romania in a friendly. (agencies)  Copyright

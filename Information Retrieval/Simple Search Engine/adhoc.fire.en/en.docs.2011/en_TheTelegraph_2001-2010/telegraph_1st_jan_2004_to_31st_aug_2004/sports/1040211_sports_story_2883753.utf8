The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mums the word for Rusedski
 - DOPING HEARING - Tennis star cautiously optimistic and hoping for the best  British tennis star Greg Rusedski and his wife Lucy arrive for an ATP hearing on his positive drugs test in Montreal on Monday Montreal: Former US Open finalist Greg Rusedski left his doping hearing the same way he arrived  without comment. Rusedski spent eight hours on Monday at a hearing to explain why he tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a tennis tournament in Indianapolis in July. He left the session at the Ogilvy Renault law office with his wife Lucy and two lawyers. The group was then whisked away in limousines. When asked if there would be any statement on the hearing, lawyer Mark Gay said nothing today before his car sped away. The 30-year-old Rusedski faces a two-year suspension if the tribunal upholds his doping offence. The three-man panel, headed by Montreal lawyer Yves Fortier, is expected to make its decision within two weeks. The names of the two other members of the tribunal, one chosen by the ATP and the other by Rusedski, were not released. If Rusedski is found guilty, he will have 21 days to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. The Briton has denied using the drug, and contends the banned substance may have come from supplements supplied by ATP Tour trainers. He says his test result was similar to those of seven other players who tested positive for nandrolone but escaped suspension. His positive test came after the ATP instructed its training and medical staff in May to stop issuing the supplements. Back in London on Tuesday, Rusedski said he was cautiously optimistic about the outcome of the hearing. Im confident and well just have to wait and see, Rusedski said after arriving at Heathrow Airport. Were cautiously optimistic so we are just hoping for the best. I have no idea when Im going to hear the verdict. Its anywhere between three to nine days. So all I can do is sit tight at the moment. I think things went fairly but well have to wait and see.

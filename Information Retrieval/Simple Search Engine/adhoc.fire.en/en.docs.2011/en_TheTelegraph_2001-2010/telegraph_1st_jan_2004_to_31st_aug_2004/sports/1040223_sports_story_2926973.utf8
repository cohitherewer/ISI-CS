The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. officials abuse scribes
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Its a battle of survival from now, feels Aloke Mukherjee Calcutta: In a departure from their usually elated mood when they manage to hold Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting officials appeared volatile and took it out on the scribes after the National League match ended Sunday. Following a gentle enquiry whether the dues of the players have been cleared, some Mohammedan Sporting officials started abusing the scribes and charged at them. A few of their supporters also joined in and as the matter seemed to go out of control, the police intervened and took them away. The secretary, Sultan Ahmed, who was not on the spot, later criticised the action of his officials and said he will look into the matter. Mohammmedan Sporting players refused to practice on Friday alleging that their dues havent been cleared. They took the field after being assured by the officials. Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee looked a worried man after the disappointing result on Sunday. From now on, its a battle of survival for us, Mukherjee said. Though the coach didnt specify the problem areas, seniors believe it is the defence that is letting them down. Something has to be done if we have to reach some sort of respectability, a senior player preferring anonymity said. It was the lack of a supporting striker that seemed to make Mukherjee a more worried man. Ashim (Biswas) didnt get the support  He didnt have too good a day either, he said.  Copyright

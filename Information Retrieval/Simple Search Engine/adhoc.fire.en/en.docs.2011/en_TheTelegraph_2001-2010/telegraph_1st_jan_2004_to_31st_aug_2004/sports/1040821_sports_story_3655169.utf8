The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bula in seventh heaven
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Bula swam the Palk Strait in nearly 14 hours Chennai: Bula Chowdhury conquered the Palk Strait on Friday, successfully swimming the 40-km stretch from Talaimanar in Sri Lanka to Danushkoti near Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu. Bula, who left Talaimanar at 4 am, touched the sandy beach of Arichamunai in Danushkoti close to 5pm. The Arjuna Awardee thus fulfilled her dream of becoming the worlds first female swimmer to cross seven seas. Bula was received by West Bengal sports minister Subhash Chakraborty, top Tamil Nadu police officers and other officials. The event was sponsored by Sahara India Parivar. Bula has the distinction of being the first woman to cross the English Channel twice. She has also swum the Strait of Gibraltar (Punta Tarifa in Spain to Punta Sainar in Morocco), the Tyrrhenian Sea (Zannone to Sal Felice Circeo in Italy), the International Toroneus Gulf in Greece, the Catalina channel in California and the Cook Strait in New Zealand. Our Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Bula had aimed to cross the distance within 10 hours but eventually did so in 13 hours and 52 minutes. Conditions were not easy the sea was rough and it was very windy, Bulas husband and coach Sanjib Chakraborty told The Telegraph. This was the longest swim in her career.  Copyright

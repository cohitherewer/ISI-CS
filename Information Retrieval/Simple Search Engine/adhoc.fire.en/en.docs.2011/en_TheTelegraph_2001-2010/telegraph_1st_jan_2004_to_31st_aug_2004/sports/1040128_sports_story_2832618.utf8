 15000 attend Hookes funeral
Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting and his team were among an estimated 15,000 mourners who gathered to pay respect at the funeral of David Hookes at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. Former Australia batsman Hookes is best remembered for hitting England captain Tony Greig for five successive fours on his debut at the 1977 Centenary Test in Melbourne. Greig was among the mourners alongside ex-West Indies skipper Clive Lloyd, former Australia captains Richie Benaud, Mark Taylor and Ian Chappell, and Shane Warne. Former Australia players David Boon, Merv Hughes, Ian Healy and Dean Jones and ex-New Zealand captain Martin Crowe were also at the funeral. Hookes, 48, died on January 19 after suffering serious head injuries and a heart attack in an assault outside a Melbourne hotel the previous night.  I think that innings (in the Centenary Test) is so typical of David, not only of his cricket career, but his life, said Chappell. Academy Award-winning actor Russell Crowe was among other celebrities at the funeral. Hookes played 23 Tests from 1976-77 to 1985-86 and worked as a media commentator and as coach of Victoria after retirement. Three stumps were placed at one end of the pitch where Hookes scored 20 centuries and a bat was left resting against the stumps, as the left-hander had done during breaks in play, along with a red South Australia team cap.

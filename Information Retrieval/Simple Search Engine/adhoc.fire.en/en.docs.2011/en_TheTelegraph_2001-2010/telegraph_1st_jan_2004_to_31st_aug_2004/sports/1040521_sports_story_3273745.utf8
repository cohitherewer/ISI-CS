 Miandad, PCB chief clear air
Islamabad: Coach Javed Miandad was finally a happy man after he sorted out the misunderstandings with the Pakistan Cricket Board during a meeting with chairman Shaharyar Khan in Lahore. Despite the PCB saying the coach would be allowed to complete his term, Miandad was upset as he felt he was treated in an unjust manner by the board. It was a good meeting in which I made my position very clear to the chairman. He assured me that the board had never given any impression that they were planning to remove me as coach, he captain said after the 90-minute meeting at the Gaddafi Stadium premises Thursday.

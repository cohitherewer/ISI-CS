 Kenteris shocks the world again 
Athens: Greece Lightning, as Costas Kenteris came to be known, struck for the first time four years ago when he shocked the athletics world by clinching the Olympic 200 metres gold. Doping rumours, due in part to his rare appearances, have dogged the Greek sprinter since he became a national hero at the Sydney Games. The one-time journeyman 400 metres runner took a little over 20 seconds to claim his first international title in 2000, and in the wake of the win the headline question was Who the Hellas is Costas Kenteris?. The answer was an athlete from the Greek holiday island of Mytilini (also known as Lesvos) who was previously best known for having one leg slightly shorter than the other. His training partner Katerina Thanou grabbed her own Olympic headlines by finishing runner-up to Marion Jones in the womens 100 metres. Both sustained superficial injuries in a motorcycle crash just hours before they were due to attend a disciplinary hearing later to explain why they had missed doping tests. Thanou had already established herself under the tutelage of sprint coach Christos Tzekos who went on to train the pair. She earned a bronze at the European championships in 1998 and a gold at the 60m indoor world event a year later. But it was the quietly-spoken Kenteris who was propelled into stardom. The athlete said he was as shocked as everyone else as he stood trackside at Stadium Australia. He returned to Greece a household name and that name now adorns everything from street signs to a high speed ferry  Aeolos Kenteris.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

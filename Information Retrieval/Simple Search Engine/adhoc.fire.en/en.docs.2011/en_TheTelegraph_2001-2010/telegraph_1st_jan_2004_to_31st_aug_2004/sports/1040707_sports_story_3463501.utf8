8 wickets in 2nd Test unlikely: Warne

- I dont think anyone is going to get a chance once Murali gets back playing... he takes 7 or 8 wickets a game Warne sees the pacers wicket against him Cairns: Shane Warne said Tuesday he gave himself little chance of taking the eight wickets he needs in this weeks second Test to break Muttiah Muralidharans world record. Its probably doubtful Im going to take eight wickets, given this wicket generally suits the quicks a lot more than the spinners, Warne told reporters in Cairns ahead of Fridays second Test against Sri Lanka. Warne took three for 20 and none for 61 in Darwin last week as Australia clinched a 149-run win inside three days of play in the first Test of the two-match series. The leg spinner has 520 career wickets, seven short of Sri Lankas Muralidharan. The 32-year-old off spinner has withdrawn from the Australia tour for personal reasons. It was disappointing. I probably needed to get a couple of wickets in that second innings, Warne said. Hopefully the boys can hang on to a few (catches) and I can bowl well enough to get the wickets, the 34-year-old Warne said. I dont think anyone is going to get a chance once Murali gets back playing. When he plays he gets seven or eight wickets a game. If he plays for another four or five years he will be somewhere around a thousand wickets. Warne, who took 26 wickets in Australias 3-0 series win in Sri Lanka in March this year, said he still held the edge over captain Maravan Atapattus side despite taking only three wickets last week. I dont think they have improved. I probably bowled a few more bad deliveries than I normally bowl, Warne said.  It was never in doubt that we were going to win the game. They (Sri Lankas batsmen) didnt look like they had any ideas against our fast bowlers. (In the second innings) I didnt have much luck. I think Ive definitely got the wood over the Sri Lankans. Weve seen that over the last few series. All of us are playing well against Sri Lanka. If we bowl to our plans I think we can rock and roll them cheaply again, he said. Warne, rated by Wisden as one of the five cricketers of the 20th century, said he was eagerly awaiting the October 2005 six-day match in Sydney between Australia and a Rest of the World XI. The ICC announced this week Australia would play the combined team if Ricky Pontings side held the top ranking until April 1 2005. Its a great concept. Everybody would like to get a little bit of revenge on Australia and gang up on us and try and beat us, Warne said. That would be a great spectacle and it would be nice to be a part of it.

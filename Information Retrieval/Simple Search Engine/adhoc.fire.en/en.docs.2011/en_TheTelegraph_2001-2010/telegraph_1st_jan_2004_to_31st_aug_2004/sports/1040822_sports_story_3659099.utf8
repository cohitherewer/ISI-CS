The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Archers fall short again
 - Majhi, Rai, Prasad fail to cross Aussie hurdle  OUR CORRESPONDENT  Croatias Mario Ancic (right) and Ivan Ljubicic celebrate after clinching the mens doubles bronze, beating Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 16-14 , in Athens on Friday. (AP) Athens: Indian archery remained mired in its lack of ability to focus. In the mens team pre-quarter finals at the Panathinaiko Stadium here on Saturday Indians lost 236-248 to the Australians. The Australians go on to meet Chinese Taipei in the quarter finals. The Indian mens team, comprising Sawaiyan Majhi, Tarundeep Rai and Satyadev Prasad, with a FITA world ranking of eighth, made heavy weather of the second-ranked Aussies, comprising former world champion Simon Fairweather, Tim Cuddihy and David Barnes, and are 11th in the 13-country field. Majhi later complained of some problems with our timing that resulted in some bad shots. He said the team was looking forward to the next Olympics. It had been pointed out by Archery Federation of India head honcho Paresh Mukherjee, camping here, that Indians, especially Dola Banerjee, could not do well earlier because of the wildly windy weather that day. On Friday, with weather conditions perfect, no explanation was forthcoming. Fairweather said he enjoyed the match and was readying for Chinese Taipei. Cuddihy said: My teammates helped me a lot to stay focussed and shoot well. I am feeling better after the individual competition bronze. Interestingly, Mukherjee had been talking about how well equipped the Indian team was and how nobody in the world learns the game with top class equipment. He talked about the socio-economic background of archers that prohibit them to ever get accustomed to the sheer hugeness and modernism of an Olympic Games. Probably more important to the archery bosses in India would be to first assess the international situation. Fairweather has taken part in events in Calcutta as well. He has seen Indian training at close quarters. Tips from these people would go a long way in providing confidence at least.  Copyright

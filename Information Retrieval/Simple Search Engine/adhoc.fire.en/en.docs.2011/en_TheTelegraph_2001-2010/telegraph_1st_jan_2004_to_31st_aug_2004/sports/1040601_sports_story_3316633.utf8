The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Davison scalps 17
London: Canadas John Davison completed the best first-class bowling figures for 48 years during an ICC Intercontinental Cup match against the USA on Sunday. The off spinner took eight wickets for 61 runs in the first innings and followed it up with nine for 76 in the second, for a match haul of 17 wickets for 137 runs, the best since Englands Jim Laker claimed 19 for 90 in a Test match against Australia in 1956. Davison, who plays for South Australia, sprung to prominence during last years World Cup in South Africa, when he smashed a century from 67 balls against the West Indies, the fastest hundred in the tournaments history. Davison, whose bowling figures against the USA were the joint 16th best in cricket history, inspired Canada to a 104-run victory. (Reuters)  Copyright

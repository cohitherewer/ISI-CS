The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla set WI modest target
Kingstown, May 15 (AFP): Tino Best captured four wickets on his ODI debut, as Bangladesh set the West Indies 145 runs to win the first one-dayer on Saturday. Playing in his first ODI even before playing in a domestic limited-overs match for his native Barbados, Best captured four wickets for 35 runs from 10 overs as Bangladesh were restricted to 144 for eight. Mohammed Rafique hit the only six of the innings for his top score of an unbeaten 32 and Khaled Mashud scored 30 not out from 75 balls in a stand of 62, unbroken, for the ninth wicket. Best struck with the third and fourth balls of the match to remove Shahriar Hossain and Habibul Bashar. In his second spell, Best removed Mushfiqur Rahman and Khaled Mahmud.  Copyright

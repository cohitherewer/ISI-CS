The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England will be poorer for Becks return 
 - Handing in Real shirt would signal end of the stars development as a central midfielder  FROM HENRY WINTER IN LONDON  David Beckham will miss a higher-honours course in the fine art of football under French professor Zinedine Zidane Ask not whether David Beckham should return from Madrid. Ask more whether his wife should not head out to Madrid. Just turned 29, Englands captain has probably four seasons left to make his name leap from the pages of the record books. Couples often put one career first for a period, for one partners self-fulfilment. After spending the next 50 months trying to dominate the world, Beckham can spend 50 years driving his singer wife around recording studios. Beckhams private life should really remain that  private  but it is clearly impinging on his ability to deliver as one of the worlds finest midfielders. Cutting short his big Castillian adventure would mean flunking a higher-honours course in the fine arts of football under that world-renowned French professor, Zinedine Zidane. Handing in that illustrious white shirt would signal the termination of his encouraging development as a central midfielder, the ending of all those skill-stretching, mind-testing 90-minute examinations against blue-chip opposition in La Liga, the most technically and tactically advanced league on Planet Football. Just practising his free-kicks in training against that embodiment of agility, Iker Casillas, will help Beckham. And the Beckhams are throwing away all this because Victoria will not move to one of Europes most elegant cities where she would be offered her own television show, the best seats at premieres and an involvement with the most compelling show in town: Los Galacticos. How sad! Opportunity knocked on the head. Just imagine the Beckhams poring over the scrapbook in years to come. Season 2003-04: pictures of Reals No 23 arriving like a vaunted matador, El Ingles, the talk of the town scoring within minutes of his debut, entrancing the locals and then racing to the airport, having packed up his marriage troubles in a Louis Vuitton kit-bag as he flees Spain. What a waste! Such a willing, team-minded player as Beckham will doubtless excel at Chelsea, should Reals president, Florentino Perez, like the look of Roman Abramovichs lucre. Fine. Chelsea are going places under Abramovich and Peter Kenyon, right to the top when they find the right coach. (Beckham and the feisty Jose Mourinho: now that looks a lively combination.) Yet where would he play? An obvious vacancy exists in right midfield  and Beckham for Jesper Gronkjaer would be like Steffen Effenberg replacing Steffen Freund  but Englands captain wants to feature in the centre as he did so impressively for half the season with Real. Beckham is hardly going to force out Frank Lampard, who has matured over the past 18 months into one of Europes most accomplished central midfielders. Beckham the anchorman? Please. His weakness in the tackle and desire to roam upfield make him completely unsuited to the holding role. Arsenal? A right-sided opening arises. Freddie Ljungbergs best days are behind him at Highbury. Sylvain Wiltord is surplus to requirements. Jermaine Pennant, on loan at Leeds, has the potential but needs to sort out his off-field priorities. Yet Arsenals more-limited finances surely preclude competing with Chelsea. Arsenals canny coach, Arsene Wenger, may already have addressed the situation by recruiting Robin van Persie to electrify left midfield while the flexible Robert Pires switches to the right. So it looks the Bridge or bust for Beckham. And yet how much more satisfying it would be for this likeable Essex lad and all those who admire his talents for him to strut his stuff at Real. If only his wife could place her career on hold during the short period Beckham has left at the peak of his profession. And those who think Beckhams life will be quieter in London should prepare to be blinded by the battery of flashbulbs charting the stars movement around the capital. If he does swap Spain for England, the sadness will not just be felt by the man himself. Beckhams Real experience has been monitored closely by many of his English peers, talents like Steven Gerrard and Alan Smith, who have wondered what it must be like to pursue their trade in such dream factories as Bernabeu, Nou Camp and Mestalla. If Beckham limps back to Blighty, his hopes soured, others will be dissuaded from enrolling in Continental finishing schools. Beckhams England will be the poorer for him returning home.

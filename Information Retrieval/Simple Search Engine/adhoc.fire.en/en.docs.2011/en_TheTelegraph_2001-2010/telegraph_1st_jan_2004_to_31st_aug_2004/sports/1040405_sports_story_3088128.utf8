Manchester: Millwall reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their 119-year history on Sunday when they beat first division rivals Sunderland 1-0 in their semi-final at Old Trafford. Australian Tim Cahills 26th-minute goal set up a meeting with 10-time winners Manchester United in the final and it also earned the south London club a place in next seasons Uefa Cup for the first time thanks to Uniteds qualification for the Champions League through their league placing. Sunderland finished with 10 men after Jason McAteer was sent off four minutes from time as Dennis Wises team became the first club from outside the top flight to reach the FA Cup final since Sunderland in 1992. United beat holders Arsenal 1-0 in the other semi-final at Villa Park on Saturday. The north-east club almost took the lead after seven minutes when the lively John Oster curled a free-kick against the underside of the crossbar.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

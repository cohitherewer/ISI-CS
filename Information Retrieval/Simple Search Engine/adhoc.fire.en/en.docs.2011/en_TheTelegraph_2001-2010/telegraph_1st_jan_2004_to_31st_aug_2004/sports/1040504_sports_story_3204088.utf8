The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahindra eye next round
Mumbai: Mahindra United coach David Booth is confident of a good showing against Oman club Dhofar FC in Wednesdays AFC Cup match in Muscat. Before the teams departure on Monday, Booth said there was no need to change strategy against Dhofar as even a draw will see his team through. Mahindra beat Dhofar 2-1 and drew against Al Wahda at home. However, they lost the away match 1-5 to the Al Wahda. Asked about his teams performance in the National Football League, where it may finish third, Booth said: Though it is disappointing not to win, finishing third is quite creditable. Maybe with a better performance in the early stages we can do better in the next edition. (PTI)  Copyright

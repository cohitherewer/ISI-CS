The Telegraph - Calcutta
 If cricket has a God, its Sachin
	 - Even the junior-most player in the team can motivate you... nobody can motivate better than a teammate: Sehwag  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Virender Sehwag during nets at the Rawalpindi stadium on Monday. (PTI) Islamabad: Believe it or not, for a couple of seasons, Virender Sehwag wasnt considered good enough for Delhis U-19 side. Today, he is Indias sole triple centurion in Test cricket. Sehwag, who has been around in international cricket for five years, spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of the deciding Test in Rawalpindi. The following are excerptsQ. Well, how long did it take for the triple century to sink in? A. A couple of days... Specifically after we won the Multan Test and I was flooded with congratulatory calls and messages for being Man of the Match. Tab pata chala ki woh triple century meri khud ki thi... Could life change once youre back home? (Laughs) Not because of the 309, but life will definitely change as Ill be getting married (to Arti) in a couple of days after returning... Im marrying the girl Ive loved. Almost a fortnight on, how do you look back on the triple? Its going to remain a lifetime achievement... Im happy I was able to help the team record history... Theres no regret that I wasnt able to get past (Matthew) Haydens 380... In fact, I dont plan my innings. Have you proved a point to those who questioned your credentials as an opener?Mere hisab se my technique is perfect and Im not bothered by what others have to say. I havent changed my style  which is treating every ball on merit  and dont intend doing so in the future either. (After a pause) Getting past 300 isnt a small matter. Despite the middle-order being your preference, what made you open from the Lords Test (2002)? Because of a request from the captain (Sourav Ganguly) and coach (John Wright)... They said if I didnt feel comfortable, the middle-order was there... Their support gave me confidence and, as it turned out, I got 84 in the very first innings, opening with Wasim Jaffer. You were quite cut up on falling to Ashley Giles in that innings.... Yes... Having got a century on debut (105, Bloemfontein, 2001), I was keen to get one in the new role as well... And, at Lords... (Adds laughing) Today, at least, Im looked upon as the No. 1 opener! How did you approach that Test? Didnt think too much about being promoted  in any case, I was opening in the ODIs... I decided to play my natural game, without becoming conscious that, for a change, I was opening in a Test... Driven by self-belief and plenty of confidence, main successful raha. Among openers, do you have a role model? Ive just got one role model  Sachin Tendulkar. Did you speak to him before that Lords Test? Not really... However, I spoke to (V.V.S.) Laxman, who had opened in Tests in the early part of his career... Among other things, he suggested I be watchful for the first 10-15 overs and, then, go for my shots. Is a quick eye the secret of your success? Aap kuch bhi bolen... I suppose my hand-eye co-ordination is good... Perhaps, the flow of the bat, as it comes down, makes the timing sweet... Picking the length early, though, is critical... Personally, I havent analysed what makes the difference. How particular are you about the bat? Depends where Im playing... In the sub-continent, the bat will be bottom-heavy... However, for the series in Australia, it was centre-heavy to cater to the bouncy conditions. Are you tempted to get carried away after a couple of dazzling shots? No... Thats because I live ball-to-ball... As Ive told you, I dont plan. You did in Multan, though... On 295... (Laughs again) Us samah to 300 banana tha. Despite being under pressure, the boundaries didnt stop during your second innings 90 at the Gaddafi... Im never going to leave a loose ball. During that innings, Sourav remarked that you were batting like God. Whats your reaction? Im thankful for what he said, but if cricket has a God, its Sachin... Aur koi nahin. What has two-and-half years of Test cricket taught you? The importance of consistency and the benefit of staying at the wicket for as long as possible... The longer I bat, the better the teams chances of scoring quickly and giving the bowlers time to get at the opposition... My hunger has increased and a 50-60 wont satisfy me. Where do you need to improve? Eliminating loose shots, like chasing at the ones outside off... Also, I need to curb my strokeplay in pressure situations (in a Test)... Har aadmi improve kar sakta hai. Have you consciously worked on the square-cut? Never... It comes naturally and Im most confident about it. Is there one bowler who has actually troubled you? Depends on the form and flow... If Im not striking well, every bowler becomes difficult. Otherwise, they are the ones to worry. From a simple Najafgarh boy to a hero... Its been an incredible journey... Id never imagined I would get to where I have... Khushi hoti hai... Im particularly pleased for my parents (Krishna and Krishan)... Indeed, my biggest achievement is seeing them so happy... I havent let them down. Youve been as disciplined as your idol... (Interrupting) Thats because the first thing I learnt, from my parents, was the importance of discipline... Ive been brought up with certain values and, so, have stayed away from possible distractions... Main pehle jaisa hoon aur rahoonga. Have you had heroes outside cricket? I used to be fascinated by Boris Becker... His aggressive style and extraordinary body language appealed to me in a big way... I would also follow Steffi Grafs career... For years, she handled pressure quite admirably... Todays (tennis) stars dont interest me as much as Becker. How beneficial have been the sessions with Sandy Gordon? Look, even the junior-most player in the team can motivate you... At times, it may be somebody from the family or a friend... According to me, nobody can motivate better than a teammate... The other day, Parthiv Patel motivated me at the Gaddafi... The final question: At this point in time, who are you indebted most to? (Very emotionally) The late Satish Sharma, my coach... But for him, I wouldnt have got this far... Mujhe bahut dukh hai ki aaj woh hamare beech nahin hai... He did see me make my Test debut, but passed away before I began growing in stature... Im grateful to my other coach, Amar Nath Sharma, as well.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies ready for spin
 - FIRST TEST - Brett Lee doubtful starter; Vaas sole paceman in Lankan XI  Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill during a practice session in Galle on Sunday. (Reuters) Galle: Come Monday and Australias new Test captain Ricky Ponting will embark on a tough mission  a series win in Sri Lanka which had eluded his illustrious predecessor Steve Waugh. Waugh, who retired from international cricket in January, also made his captaincy debut in Sri Lanka, losing the 1999 series 0-1. Id like to win this series and Id like to win the series in India, but there are a lot of other little things youve got to achieve along the way to make sure that happens, Ponting said on the eve of the first Test here. Among the first things on Pontings agenda will be to find a way of tackling the Sri Lankan spinners. The hosts will field three specialist spinners on a bone-dry pitch which has traditionally helped the slower bowlers. Ponting agreed the Galle pitch is really dry and likely to help spin bowlers. But we have batsmen to cope with the spinners, Ponting said. We have pretty much expected them to go that way for the past week and half. Even the fact they went into a couple of one-dayers with only one quickie was a bit of an indication they might be thinking about doing that down here, said Ponting. Australia are most likely to play both leg-spinners  Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill. Warne will be playing in his first Test after serving out a 12-month doping ban. This series, in fact, has been hyped as a battle between Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan  the two men chasing Courtney Walshs world record. Australia have a problem in the sense that pace spearhead Brett Lee seems to be losing his race to be fit for the Test. He complained of soreness in his left ankle during Australias warm-up match last week and has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation. Lee had hoped to resume bowling on Sunday but was forced to miss practice for the second successive day. Ponting said Lee would be given until Monday morning to prove his fitness. If Lee misses out, he will be replaced by Michael Kasprowicz who hasnt played a Test in three years. Chaminda Vaas will, predictably, be the sole specialist paceman. The last time Sri Lanka went into a Test with one fast bowler was also in Galle, in 1998 against New Zealand, which the hosts won by innings and 16 runs.

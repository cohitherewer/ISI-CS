 Zoysa fetches consolation win
Colombo: Nuwan Zoysa inspired Sri Lanka to a dramatic three-wicket win against Australia in the fifth and final ODI on Sunday. Chasing 199 to win, Sri Lanka reached the target with 2.1 overs to spare after Russel Arnold and Zoysa shared an unbroken eighth-wicket stand of 66. Zoysa grabbed three wickets for 34 and followed it up with a sparkling 47 not out off 42 balls, hitting five fours and two sixes. Zoysa and Arnold saw the hosts through after they had slumped to 136 for seven in the 35th over. Australia, who rested four players after clinching the series 3-1, struggled after opting to bat. Arjuna versus Warne Arjuna Ranatunga has said Shane Warne should have been banned for life for taking drugs. Twelve months might seem a long time, but I dont agree with the punishment he got. If you take drugs, you should be banned for life. (Agencies)  Copyright

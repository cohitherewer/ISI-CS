 Shahid hopes for a medal
 Tirkey can help overcome inconsistency New Delhi: Legendary hockey player Mohammed Shahid has backed the country to win an Olympic medal in Athens despite the national teams unimpressive performance in the recent past. Three-time Olympian Shahid, who was a member of the team in the 1980 Moscow Games where India won their last of the eight gold medals, said the team has all the qualities needed to win at least a bronze, if not the gold. The team has a perfect balance and almost all the members of the squad are great players. This team has won some competitions which previous teams had never won, Shahid said. They won the Asia Cup for the first time last year and came close to win the Asian Games in 2002. Unfortunately the team lost to Korea in the Asian Games final despite playing so well. Shahid, a former India captain, said he had full faith on the abilities of the players, who can help the country win its ninth hockey gold in Olympics. But he added the performance needed to be a bit more consistent. I am hoping for a gold. But if we miss out on that, we can finish at least with a bronze. I feel what is lacking is consistency. One day we play well against formidable opponents but the next day we flop. But I am sure senior players like Dhanraj Pillay and Dilip Tirkey would help the side overcome this, the 44-year-old said. After a successful 2003, when the team won the Asia Cup and the inaugural Afro-Asian Games, it has struggled in all the tournaments they have played so far this year. Shahid said the recent controversies surrounding the game in the country were unlikely to affect the players. They will put behind all the controversy. All are preparing well and seem very focussed.

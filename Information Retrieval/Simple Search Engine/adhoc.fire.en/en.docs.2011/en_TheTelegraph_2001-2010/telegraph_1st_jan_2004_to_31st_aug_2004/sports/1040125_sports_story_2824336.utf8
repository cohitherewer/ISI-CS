The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Now, Laxman walks into category A
 - Thanks to delay in introducing contracts, Rohan comes into the picture  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, Jan. 24: Had the Board introduced contracts last September, as planned, V.V.S. Laxman probably wouldnt have made category A. As for Rohan Gavaskar, he wouldnt have figured even in the third tier. Now, its unthinkable that the in-magical-form Laxman wont make the top category. Equally, Rohan  who posted his maiden ODI fifty in Adelaide today and has looked comfortable on the big stage  is currently a contender for a third- tier slot. If all goes well, the contracts will be in place before Team India leaves for Pakistan in the first week of March. As announced, 20 players (shortlisted by chief selector Syed Kirmani and Co.) are going to be the beneficiaries in three categories. The top-bracket will get an annual retainership of Rs 60 lakh, those in the second tier are going to pocket Rs 30 lakh, while the remainder will each get Rs 15 lakh. According to The Telegraphs sources, back in September, only captain Sourav Ganguly, vice-captain Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble were certain to make the top-bracket, with Virender Sehwag not being too far behind. The last few months, though, have seen Laxman at his best  in both forms  and he becomes an automatic selection for category A. In fact, had the contracts been introduced when intended, Laxman would almost surely have been viewed as a Test specialist. His one-day comeback, after all, was towards the end of October. Since then, of course, Laxman has been steadily climbing the charts and embarrassing everybody associated with the 2003 World Cup selection. The past seven days, specially, have been extraordinary with three hundreds coming off his blade: 103 not out and 106 not out versus Australia; a career-best 131 against Zimbabwe. Saeed Anwar alone has done better  in October-November 1993, he cracked three hundreds in four days during the Champions Trophy in Sharjah. This period, by the way, has seen Laxman collect two MoM awards as well. Meanwhile, in recent weeks, the Board is understood to have informally interacted with a lawyer representing the players. That seems to have cleared the way for one final across-the-table meeting between the Souravs and Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya. Besides the wording of the contracts, misgivings will be thrashed out at that session. Apparently, the senior pros do have reservations on a couple of issues.  Copyright

Speaking on the occasion, Prescott, who played for the British parliamentary football team and had the unique honour of beating the German parliamentary team, lauded the effort of Leicester City in inviting the East Bengal. He said it would go a long way in forging co-operation between the UK and India. The deputy Prime Minister, who has visited India seven times during the last six years reassured Britains co-operation in working together with India in different spheres. Vaz said Leicester City would play four matches with East Bengal as part of the clubs 120th anniversary celebrations. I am extremely delighted at LCFC efforts to involve all sections of the community and proud that with the tournament they will take Indo-British relationship to a new dimension, he said.

Sir Noon lauded the effort of Vaz in organising the function to honour the East Bengal team and said it was in the true spirit of the pluralistic society of Britain where 300 languages are spoken. I welcome the team on behalf of the Indian government here, he said.

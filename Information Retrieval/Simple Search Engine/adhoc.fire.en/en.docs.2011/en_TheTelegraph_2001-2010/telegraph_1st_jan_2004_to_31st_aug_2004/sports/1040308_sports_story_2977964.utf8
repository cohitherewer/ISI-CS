The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arjun Atwal makes cut
 Atwal is now at 79th Miami: Theres been something eerie about Arjun Atwals starts on the US PGA Tour. They have been slow and tentative, inducing a very disturbing effect on the onlookers nerves. Yet, in every even that this Calcutta-born pro has taken part on this prestigious tour, he has managed to make the cut. He pulls up his socks during his rounds, as he gets to know the fairways, and in two of the four events he has played, he has made it to the money rounds by the skin of his teeth (he has made the cut in all). Like Friday, for example, at the Doral Championship at the par-72 Doral Resort and Spa here. He finished the first round Thursday at five over, dangling precariously at joint 135th. By the end of the second round, though, he had held on against the strong winds and delivered a four-under card to be the last man into the money rounds at one-over 145, despite two late bogeys Friday at Dorals Blue Monster. By Saturday, the PGA Tour rookie was at 79th (four over 220), despite a three-over third round, even as Australian Craig Parry shot a five-under-par 67 to open a one-shot lead at 13-under 203 following a round that included six birdies. He was a shot clear of Gene Sauers, who shot an eight-under 64, and Scott Verplank (65) at 12-under 204. Thursday, I didnt let it get to me, said Atwal. Ive shot enough bad rounds and I know everyone is going to make bogeys in tough conditions. When you want to throw in the towel, youve got to remember that. Jeev out  Tiger Woods recovered from an indifferent start to keep his title hopes alive in the Dubai Desert Classic Saturday, firing a three-under-par 69 in the third round. India Jeev Milkha Singh could not advance beyond the second round, missing the cut as he shot a two-over second round Friday (total 146), moving out at joint 81st. (Agencies)  Copyright

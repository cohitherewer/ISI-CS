The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan to have Barreto no more
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta: Mohun Bagans talismanic Brazilian  attacker Jose Ramirez Barreto is leaving the club with immediate  effect.  Not that Mohun Bagan were performing to any great  levels, but that was not exactly unexpected from a club  smarting under in-fighting and factionalism. Even then, Barretos decision to desert them, comes as a huge blow (one which will not be withstood) at a moment when Mohun Bagan are languishing way down the National Football League table.  I will leave them (Mohun Bagan)  as soon as possible, Barreto told The Telegraph  late on Thursday night. I have had a few problems with  the officials which cannot be sorted out very soon. They  have failed to fulfil the amount promised to me, said the  hero of many a Mohun Bagan glorious campaigns over the past  few years. Sharing his thoughts with this correspondent, Barreto said his level of displeasure cant be fathomed that easlily. Some officials can surely be blamed for this decision of mine. I am very upset and cant say whether I will ever return to this country to ply my trade, confessed Barreto, widely acknowledged as the finest foreign professional to have shown his class in India after Majid Baskar of Iran.  The Mohun Bagan camp had no knowledge of this till  late in the night.  Copyright

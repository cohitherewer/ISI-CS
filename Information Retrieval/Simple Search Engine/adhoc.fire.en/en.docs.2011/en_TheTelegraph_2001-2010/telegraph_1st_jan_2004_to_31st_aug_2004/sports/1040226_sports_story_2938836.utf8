The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan hopes to end WI drought
 Vaughan feels Lara will have a huge influence on the series Gatwick (England): Michael Vaughan insisted here that his England side could be the first in 36 years to win a Test series in the West Indies. Vaughan told reporters before departing for the West Indies on Wednesday: We can only control what happens in the next two-and-a-half months. I dont think any of our players were born 36 years ago. But weve got a fantastic chance of going out there and doing really well. West Indies have just lost 0-3 in South Africa but on their home soil they are hard to beat, warned the England skipper. Vaughan, hoping to become the first England captain since Colin Cowdrey in 1968 to win a Test series in the West Indies, said home skipper Brian Lara would have a huge influence upon the four-match campaign. I think he averages something like 75 against England in the Caribbean. He had a fantastic series in South Africa but his team lost 0-3. We have to accept that hes a great player and on any one day may get on top of us. But weve also got to have plans for him. England head to the Caribbean with a relatively inexperienced pace attack of James Anderson, Stephen Harmison and Simon Jones  the first time Vaughan has had all three fast bowlers at his disposal. Glamorgan quick Jones has not played for England since suffering an horrific knee injury in the first Ashes Test 15 months ago and was sidelined from all first-class cricket in England last season. But he has proved his fitness during the ongoing England A tour of India and was called up for the Caribbean. Weve got an experienced batting line-up but a relatively inexperienced bowling line-up... But its exciting to have a couple of guys around the 90mph mark, Vaughan added. England have only three survivors Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain and Graham Thorpe  from their last Caribbean tour in 1997-98 when they lost the Test series 1-3. Vaughan said he would be counting on them all. Their experience is going to be crucial. All the top six are very experienced and its going to take a good player to knock one of them out, the Yorkshire opener added. The first Test starts in Jamaica on March 11.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Dravid comment fired up Yasir
Lahore: Rahul Dravid could not have imagined in his wildest dreams that his failure to recognise Yasir Hameed at Rawalpindi, would serve as a wake-up call for the young opener who has emerged the hero of the ODI series. Hameed was irked when Dravid mistook him for a nets bowler before the Pindi match. Hameed was in the same lift with Dravid when the Indian vice-captain asked him whether he was the same bowler who had bowled to the Indians in the nets. He didnt recognise me and I didnt say anything. But yes, it was a sort of wake-up call for me. I wanted to score runs and stay long enough at the wicket to enable the Indians to recognise me throughout the series, he told a Pakistani newspaper.  (PTI)  Copyright

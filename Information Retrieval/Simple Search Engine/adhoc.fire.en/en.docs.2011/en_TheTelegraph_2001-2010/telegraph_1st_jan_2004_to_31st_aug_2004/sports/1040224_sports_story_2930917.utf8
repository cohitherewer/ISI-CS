 Dion Ebrahim drops a catch off Monjural Islam on the fifth day of the first Test in Harare on Monday. (Reuters) Harare: Left-arm spinner Ray Price took four wickets as Zimbabwe beat Bangladesh by 183 runs in the first Test at Harare Sports Club on Monday to record their first win for more than two years. Price finished with four for 61 as the visitors were skittled for 169 in their second innings. Bangladesh, who made 331 in the first innings, have lost a record 21 Tests in a row, while it was Zimbabwes first victory in 14 games. Their last success came against the same opponents in November 2001 in Chittagong. Former captain Khaled Mashud, batting at eight, top-scored for Bangladesh with a fighting 61, his highest Test score which included nine fours and a six. The visitors had resumed on 25 for five  they had been 14 for five at one stage on Sunday after a hattrick by fast bowler Andy Blignaut  and Rajin Saleh and debutant Manjural Islam Rana batted sensibly to put on 67. But Saleh then tried to heave Price over mid-wicket and was easily stumped by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu for 47. Price struck again when Rana top-edged a sweep to Trevor Gripper at square-leg to depart for 31. Lunch was taken when Tapash Baisya, on two, edged Price on to his pad and into the hands of Gavin Ewing at silly mid-off. Price had taken three for 39 from 13.1 overs in the morning session. Blignaut ruled out Blignaut was ruled out of the second and final Test in Bulawayo starting Thursday. The allrounder has injured a thigh muscle and did not bowl on the final day.

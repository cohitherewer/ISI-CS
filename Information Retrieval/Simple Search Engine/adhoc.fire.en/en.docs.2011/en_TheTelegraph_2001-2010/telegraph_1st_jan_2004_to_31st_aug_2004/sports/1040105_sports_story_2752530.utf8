The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3 Tests, 5 ODIs for India in Pak
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Team India will play three Tests and five one-day Internationals during their tour of Pakistan from the first week of March to mid-April. As desired by the players, the tour will start with the one-dayers. The Indians were keen on starting that way as they will be ending the Australia tour with the triangular series on February 10. The players can get some days rest before travelling to Pakistan, Board of Control for Cricket In India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said after the working committee meeting on Sunday. The details of the itinerary, including the venues, are still being worked out. Let them propose the venues first was how Dalmiya put it. It is learnt that once the Pakistan Cricket Board proposes the itinerary, the BCCI will seek the governments ratification on the venues before giving the green signal. The security aspect will also have to be cleared by the government. The Indians will tour Bangladesh after the Pakistan series for two Tests and three ODIs. Next comes the Asia Cup in July. Pakistan were to host the tournament but it is likely that the tournament will now be held in Colombo. India, Pakistan and Australia will take part in a triangular meet in August in Europe. The exact venue has not been finalised, but either Scotland, Ireland or Holland will be the hosts. As part of their preparations for the ICC Champions Trophy, the Indians will also play three one-dayers versus England on September 1, 3 and 5. The working committee also decided to allow England A, who will be touring India in February-March, to participate in the Duleep Trophy which will be held in North Zone. The final round of the ongoing Cooch Behar Trophy will be shifted from North Zone to West Zone in view of the prevailing climatic conditions. While increasing the match fees for domestic cricketers, the Board also ratified that the non-playing members will get half the amount in the senior circuit. The BCCI had earlier announced that it would offer 26 per cent of its gross earnings to the cricketers. Out of these 13 per cent was for international cricketers, 10.6 per cent for senior domestic cricketers and 2.4 per cent for the juniors. The senior domestic cricketers would receive a total of about Rs 30,000-35,000 per match, out of which Rs 16,000 would be given to them in hand while the balance would be kept in their benevolent fund accounts. This has been done to enhance performance of the players, Dalmiya informed. However, at the junior level, all members of a team will be paid uniform fees. The BCCI also decided that the match fees for India A on their tours abroad would be Rs 6,000 per match day, while for India Under-19, it would be Rs 1,500 per match day. In case of home matches against any touring side, the India A players would get Rs 4,000 per match day. The working committee decided that India would propose China as an affiliate member of ICC in its next annual conference. The alternative site for the National Cricket Academy in the outskirts of Bangalore was also approved by the committee and construction would commence soon. The BCCI has also decided to review the elite panel of umpires in the domestic circuit.  Copyright

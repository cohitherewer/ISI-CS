The Telegraph - Calcutta
Conversion errors put Italy in a fix 
Talking Tactics P.K. BanerjeeIts trimming time in Euro 2004 and there are big names near the blade. Some results in groups A and B have surprised many and I didnt imagine that all the last set matches in these two groups would be so decisive.Things were complicated from the start in groups C and D, and so its no surprise that final matches here will have a big impact on the quarter final pairings. At least two teams will be eliminated, which could match many in the eventual last eight.In group C, Italy shouldnt have problems in beating Bulgaria, but their passage is not guaranteed. They will hope that the Sweden-Denmark match throws up a winner and there is no doubt that this adds excitement to the Scandinavian duel. I dont rule out the possibility of a result.That will help Italy, though reaching the quarters without a win over Sweden or Denmark will not be the most dignified way of moving up.Italians are known to be slow starters. Somewhat against this notion, they produced a fantastic performance against Sweden on Friday night. It was the match of the tournament till Friday, and by a distance.The pace of the game was breathtaking and the direct approach of the teams made it entertaining. It will be a pity if either of these two stops before the quarters, because both have the technique and temperament needed in a big match in a major tournament.It was evident that Italy called the shots in the first half and Sweden wrested back the initiative later. Italy could have killed the contest during the period they dominated, had Christian Vieri not missed everything. Unlike in the first match against Denmark, the Inter Milan striker got plenty of support and supply, but must have left his heading skills in the dressing room. Italy could have killed the contest against Sweden had Christian Vieri not missed everythingIt was a classic example of the brand of football Italy specialise in. The road leading to their goal gets narrower with distance and the opposition gets drawn into this cone before being dispossessed at one of the several layers of cover. Usually, they catch the opponents by utter surprise on the break. Friday was different, considering this, and rather than playing the waiting game, Italy started asking the early questions.Most of the thrust in their attacks came from the side-backs, Panucci and Zambrotta. Del Piero appeared neat and organised down the middle, though he has always lacked the power and burst that makes the telling difference.It was looking imminent that the Swedish resistance would crumble, because of the collective pressure Italy were exerting. They showed great character in turning the tide. Ibrahimovich was a nuisance for the Italians in front of the box and the Swedes were moving up in waves.It was an exhibition of the amazing level of endurance achieved by the Europeans and also their fierce urge to fight. We have already seen a few late goals in this competition and it seems as if there is more in store.The Swedish equaliser showed once again that however solid the Italian defence may be, it cant soak up sustained pressure towards the end as consistently as it used to. I noticed it four years earlier, and was convinced when Croatia and South Korea scored late winners against Italy in the last World Cup.That doesnt undermine Ibrahimovichs presence of mind, peripheral vision and athleticism. It was sheer poachers instinct and we will see more of this striker in the future.My gut feeling is Italy will gain from the outcome of the Sweden-Denmark match, which means they will be in the quarters. Sweden, for my money, are better equipped than Denmark.Its a lot more difficult for Portugal at the moment. They have to beat Spain, which is a Himalayan task. Scolaris team has been the biggest disappointment of the tournament and on the basis of their first two matches, their ouster will not be a shock for me any more.On current form, Cristiano Ronaldos outrageous assist for Rui Costa in the Russia match notwithstanding, Spain hold a 52-48 advantage over Portugal. I have not seen the integrity and discipline in this Portuguese lot that characterise a big team. Copyright

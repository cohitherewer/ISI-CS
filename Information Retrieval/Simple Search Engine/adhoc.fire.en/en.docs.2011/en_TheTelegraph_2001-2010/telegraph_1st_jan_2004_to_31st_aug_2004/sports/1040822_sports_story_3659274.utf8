The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sampanis pleads innocence
Athens: Greeces first medallist Leonidas Sampanis here on Saturday denied taking banned substances despite testing positive for the male hormone testosterone. The IOC will announce on Sunday whether it will strip the weightlifter of his bronze medal, which sent the host nation into a delirium of delight on Monday. Sampanis positive test, which still needs to be confirmed by analysis of a B sample, has fuelled Greek frustration after seeing their two top sprinters  both Sydney medallists  quit the Games before facing expulsion for missing a drug test. Sampanis said he did not know why he tested positive. I swear, honestly I have never taken any banned substances, I swear on the lives of my two angels, my children, Sampanis, in tears, said.

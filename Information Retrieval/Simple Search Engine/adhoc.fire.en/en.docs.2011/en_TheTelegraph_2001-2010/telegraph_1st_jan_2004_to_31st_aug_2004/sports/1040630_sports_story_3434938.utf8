 Franklin helps NZ crush England 
London: New Zealand eased to a seven wicket victory in the fourth triangular one-day International at Chester-le-Street on Tuesday after James Franklins five wickets helped humble England for 101 all out. Scott Styris with 23 not out hit the winning runs in the day-night clash to seal victory in 17.2 overs. Stephen Fleming top scored with 31. Earlier, opener Marcus Trescothick was the top-scorer for England with 14. England have now failed to win a one-dayer batting first since the World Cup in February 2003. New Zealand gained six points for the win and now lead the standings with 12 points. West Indies are second with nine and England trail with three.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

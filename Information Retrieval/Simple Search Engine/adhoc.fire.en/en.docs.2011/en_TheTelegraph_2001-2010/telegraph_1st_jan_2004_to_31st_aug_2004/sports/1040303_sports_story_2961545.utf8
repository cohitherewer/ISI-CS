The Telegraph - Calcutta
 South Africa, Pakistan top offenders
 - CODE OF CONDUCT VIOLATION 
- ICC pleased with decline in number of charges  Gavaskar says the new code is yielding results Andrew Hall drew a big penaltyLondon: South Africa and Pakistan have had the most disciplinary complaints made against them since the revised Code of Conduct was introduced in April 2002, the ICC said on Monday. There was an overall drop in reported on-field incidents from 52 in the two years before the new code to 31 since its introduction and four of those complaints were not upheld. Both South Africa and Pakistan faced six charges although one complaint against each was not upheld. Seven charges were laid during South Africas tour of Pakistan last October, the most for a single series. The West Indies had no charges brought against any of their players in the same period. There are four Indian entries in the list. Three of these charges were laid during the recent Australian series where captain Sourav Ganguly was fined for slow over-rate, Rahul Dravid for applying illegal substance on the ball and Irfan Pathan for mocking a rival player. Harbhajan Singh was fined last year for making abusive comment in a ODI against South Africa in Dhaka. Nevertheless, ICC bosses said the general trend was towards improved behaviour and former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, among those who had spoken out against declining standards, said the new code was having a positive effect. Prior to the new code, I was one of many people in the game who were concerned about this issue. But over the past two years, I think the introduction of this code and the greater awareness of the issue amongst the players have resulted in considerable improvement in this area, said Gavaskar. The chairman of ICCs Cricket Committee (Playing) added: The code reflects the reality that players have a responsibility to not just their teams but to all those youngsters watching the game. This trend is a strong indication of the improvement that has taken place. Of the incidents that saw South African players charged, five took place in last Octobers ill-tempered series in Pakistan. Allrounder Andrew Hall was twice found guilty of offences during the same ODI in Lahore, following altercations with Pakistan batsman Yusuf Youhana. Hall was banned for one ODI and two Tests by Match Referee Clive Lloyd. Overall, the ODI and Test series between Pakistan and South Africa was rated the worst in disciplinary terms with seven charges arising, Proteas captain Graeme Smith and Pakistan paceman Shoaib Akhtar among those found guilty. The ICC insisted that overall player behaviour was improving. In a statement issued from its Lords headquarters, the ICC also said that improved procedures had given players a better chance to defend themselves with four of the 31 acquitted compared to the preceding 52 out of 52 guilty verdicts. The ICCs Australian chief executive Malcolm Speed has repeatedly voiced concerns about the issue of dissent in a sport which has traditionally prided itself on players not questioning umpires decisions. But Speed said: Particularly pleasing is the drop in the number of charges for dissent which have fallen from 18 in the two years prior to the code to just six since it was introduced, one of which was subsequently not proven. Meanwhile, ICC general manager David Richardson said Match Referees  Lloyd, Ranjan Madugalle, Gundappa Viswanath, Mike Procter and Wasim Raja  were all ideally placed to make judgments about on-field issues and the actions and reactions of players. Richardson also praised the decision taken by world champions Australia last year to introduce their own Code of Conduct even though that move was widely dismissed as a meaningless motherhood statement by the Australian media. I think that the initiative shown by the Australian team last year in publicly committing to this ideal is indicative of the desire of the players to play the game in the right spirit and this is borne out in fewer reports, Richardson said.

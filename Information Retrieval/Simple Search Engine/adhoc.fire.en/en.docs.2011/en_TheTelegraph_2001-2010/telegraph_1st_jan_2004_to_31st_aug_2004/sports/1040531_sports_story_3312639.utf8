(AFP)Agueda: First half goals gave Portugal a 3-0 win over Luxembourg on Saturday in their penultimate run-out before Euro 2004. Midfielder Luis Figo opened the scoring from a 20-metre free kick 14 minutes into the match. Striker Nuno Gomes doubled the lead after 28 minutes with a shot inside the box after a neat pass by Rui Costa. Costa made it 3-0 with a 30-metre low shot eight minutes from the break, his 24th goal for the Portuguese team. In the second half, Portugal played at walking pace but substitute playmaker Deco Sousa missed two good chances to increase the lead. Portugal went through the first half without six members of the Porto team who were crowned European champions in Germany on Wednesday, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari calling on them only after the interval. Short on form In Eindhoven, the Netherlands were well short of the form they will need for a shot at the Euro title in an embarrassing 0-1 defeat by Belgium. Captain Bart Goor converted a penalty 12 minutes from time to seal Belgiums first win against the Dutch since the 1994 World Cup finals in the US after defender Johnny Heitinga fouled striker Mbo Mpenza. The Dutch were without the injured Mark van Bommel and Rafael van der Vaart, while coach Dick Advocaat started with Ruud van Nistelrooy and Roy Makaay on the bench. The Dutch controlled the match in the first half but hardly convinced as their 4-4-2 line-up, with two central strikers in Patrick Kluivert and Pierre van Hooijdonk, failed to trouble the tight Belgian defence. On the stroke of halftime, Giovanni van Bronckhorst had a shot from a deflected corner cleared off the line by Sven Vermant. Advocaat changed his tactics to 4-3-3 after the interval and brought on Andy van der Meyde in place of Kluivert while Zenden was posted on the left flank. Five minutes into the second half a superb volley from Wesley Sneijder came back off the bar. Despite the changes, the Dutch continued to lack inspiration while the defensive Belgians bet on a successful counter-attack with maximum results after 78 minutes. The Netherlands will play the Faroe Islands on Tuesday and Ireland on Saturday in further warm-ups. Greece slip Poland, meanwhile, Greece a 1-0 defeat in a lacklustre friendly in Szczecin. The winner was scored in the 16th minute from a 35-metre free kick by midfielder Jackek Krzynowek whose looping shot was deflected into the net by defender Michalis Kapsis. It was Polands ninth victory in 13 matches against Greece, who produced a largely restrained performance. In Rijeka, Croatia beat a lacklustre Slovakia 1-0 through a Ivica Olic close range header in the 29th minute.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

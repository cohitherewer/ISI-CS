The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Determination, devotion have paid off
	 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
- ACE Jaspal Rana salutes Rajyavardhan Rathore  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Jaspal Rana with one of his gold medals at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester Calcutta: Till Rajyavardhan Rathore trapped the history-scripting silver in Athens, Jaspal Rana was the (glamorous) icon of shooting in India. On Tuesday evening, though, Rana wasnt displeased that Rathore had toppled him. I was pretty certain he would return with a medal Like other Indians, main bahut proud hoon In fact, I expected medals from Anjali (Bhagwat) and (Abhinav) Bindra as well, Rana told The Telegraph, while driving his Bolero from Dehra Dun to New Delhi. Asked what made him so confident, he answered: Rathores determination to make a mark His devotion to shooting Everything has paid off... He has always been the serious type and, as important, not one to take shit from anybody. Of course, Rana too would have been in Athens had the Olympics featured his events  standard pistol and centre-fire pistol. Its a regret, yes, but I cant do anything about it At the moment, then, Im content rejoicing in Rathores success, Rana, who became a teenaged hero by winning the World Junior Championship in Milan a decade ago, remarked. Elaborating on Rathore being the serious type, he said: In the build-up to any competition, you wont find him joking or lazing around Instead, you will probably find him listening to Raag Bhairavi Idea being to keep calm Hes the different sort and draws much strength from raagas. But, henceforth, isnt Rathore going to be under greater pressure? I dont think so Mentally, hes tough and capable of handling whatever pressure is there Frankly, its the dumb sportsmen who succumb (to pressure) Rathore is smart, came Ranas affectionate reply. Given that the shooters usually have a string of grievances, will Rathores silver make a difference? Well, I hope it does Those in authority have this habit of taking criticism to heart They feel its a personal attack Ill be pleased if at least this attitude changes, Rana emphasised. He continued (after pausing to negotiate a bend on the demanding drive): Actually, we shooters should be happy that the Media gives us exposure and, thereby, we are in a position to be heard Many sportsmen, on the other hand, get stifled Incidentally, having added to his awesome golden collection at the SAF Games in Islamabad, earlier this year, Rana is now focusing on next years Asian Championship. Sure, Im into a lot of things (including being associated with the BJP, of which he is co-convenor of the sports cell), but shooting remains a priority, Rana signed off. We believe him.  Copyright

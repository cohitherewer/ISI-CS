 CAB XIs tie called off 
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: CAB XIs opening match against Hyderabad XI was called off after the first session owing to unplayable condition of the wicket in the KSCA-organised meet on Wednesday. The match will start afresh at the RAC ground on Thursday. According to information received from Bangalore, Hyderabad XI were 81 for three at the time of abandonment. Ranadeb Bose, Sanjib Sanyal and Sourasish Lahiri scalped one wicket apiece. Meanwhile, the CAB authorities have sought state urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharyyas help for retaining Railway employee Shib Shankar Paul in the Bengal side. The CAB fears Pauls employers Eastern Railway may force him to play for themselves in the national level tournaments.  Copyright

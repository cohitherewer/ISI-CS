The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Contracts issue top of agenda
New Delhi, July 17 (PTI): The contentious contracts issue will top the agenda at the BCCI working committee meeting on Sunday and Monday. Selecting venues for the home series against Australia and South Africa is among other important issues to be discussed. To be Chaired by BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya and attended by ten members, the meeting assumes added significance because it will be attended by ICC president Ehsan Mani and chief executive Malcolm Speed. The duo will attend the first days proceedings in their attempt to come closer to the committee members while also addressing other concerns. The contracts system has run into rough weather and while it is difficult to blame any one party for the delay in its introduction, the onus is on the BCCI to take the initiative and give it a final shape. While the dates for the four-Test series against Australia have already been announced, the venues are yet to be decided. The Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) officials have finally accepted that Feroz Shah Kotla will not be ready to host any match in the October-November series. Calcutta is likely to benefit from it. DDCA vice-president and former Test opener Chetan Chauhan had said a few days ago that the Kotla would be ready in time for the Australia series. The 25-point agenda drawn up for the meeting includes a report on Indias recent tour of Pakistan and considering the recommendation for setting up the Col C.K. Nayudu Awards committee. The meeting will discuss at length the recommendations of Ranji Trophy captains and coaches and also decide on prize money for senior and junior domestic tournaments.  Copyright

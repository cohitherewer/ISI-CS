 Paes, Bhupathi clinch title
	 - ATP TORONTO MASTERS New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi marked their reunion after a gap of more than two years by winning the doubles title at the $2.5 million ATP tennis Masters series in Toronto on Sunday night. Paes and Bhupathi, ranked world number one at their peak in 1999 when they won the French Open and Wimbledon titles, defeated Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Belarussian Max Mirnyi 6-4, 6-2 in the final, according to information received here on Monday. After going down a break in the second game, the Indian Express bounced back with a double break in the third and seventh games to take the first set. The pair gained a break in the very first game of the second set before extending the lead to 5-2 with another break in the seventh to wrap up the title. It was the 23rd title for Paes and Bhupathi together and their fifth Masters title. Interestingly, their first Masters title came at the same venue seven years ago. Individually, it was Bhupathis 36th career title and Paes 30th. Bhupathi was also the defending champion, having won last year with Mirnyi. The duo showed brilliant form in the tournament and gobbled up three top-10 pairs  including Mark Knowles of Bahamas and Canadian Daniel Nestor  on their way to the title and the win should make them a strong contender for the Olympics gold at Athens. The Toronto win gives the duo 500 ATP points each and will push Paes up to number 20 on the doubles entry ranking. Bhupathis ranking will stay at his current number 5. Mirnyi, who won the US Open doubles crown with Bhupathi in 2002, caused a flutter when he said at the presentation ceremony, congratulations to the dark boys over there! but Paes diffused a potentially explosive situation with his sense of humour: Max, this is North America. I can probably sue you for discrimination. The Indian duo will now proceed to Cincinnati in US where they play another Masters event before flying to Athens for the Olympics beginning on August 13.

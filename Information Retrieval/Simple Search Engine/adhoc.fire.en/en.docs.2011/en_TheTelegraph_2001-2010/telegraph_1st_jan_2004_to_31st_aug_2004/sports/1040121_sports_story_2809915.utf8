The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan in no mood to forget Barreto issue
 BYA STAFF REPORTER  Barreto Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are all set to suspend their former Brazilian star Jose Ramirez Barreto. It was learnt that the Mohun Bagan authorities are not happy with the answer Barreto gave to the show-cause letter. The letter is being drafted by the special officers and will be sent to the concerned authorities very soon, a senior Mohun Bagan official informed. Barreto, meanwhile left the city early Tuesday on a Thai Airways flight. A one-year suspension is being mulled which will prohibit him from taking part in any competitive tournament around the world. He has let us down, we wont let him go, the official said. Barreto, however, had wished all the players luck before his departure and had some special tips for Eduardo and Leonardo for the derby on Thursday. He told us repeatedly that this game will be like a final and we should try to give everything, Eduardo said. Barreto said this is the opportunity for us to establish ourselves in India and well go all out, he added. The Brazilian said Barretos words of inspiration will surely be a big boost for them. He also told us that Mohun Bagan is a great club and we should try our best to keep the flag flying. Bagan, on the other hand, have failed to acquire the International Transfer Certificate of their Zimbabwe recruit Noel Tafadzwa Kaseka till Tuesday. Therefore, he is ruled out for their match against East Bengal. Also, the visa of Mohun Bagans Brazilian physio Robson Mattos de Oliviera terminates on January 24 and his contract will not be renewed.  Copyright

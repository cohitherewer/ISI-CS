The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. trounce JCT 3-1
 - National League - City debutants finish first leg with nine points  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dipendu Biswas congrautales Rahim Nabi after the latter scored his first NFL goal this season at the Howrah Stadium on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: A sparkling display from Mohammedan Sporting within the opening quarter of the match proved too hot for JCT as the home team cruised to a 3-1 triumph in their National Football League (NFL) encounter at Howrah Municipal Stadium on Monday. Rahim Nabi opened his NFL account with a brace while Dipendu Biswas converted a penalty inside 19 minutes as the black-and-white brigade simply bulldozed a hapless JCT defence. JCTs response to such an unexpected ambush came too late  in the 78th minute, via a penalty conversion from Jo Paul Ancheri  but it never threatened to spoil Mohammedan Sportings celebration of their second win in the tournament. The debutants from the city, thus, finished the first leg of the NFL with nine points while the visitors from Punjab remained at 18. Incidentally, Sukhwinder Singhs team had lost by a big margin (1-4) to another debutant, Haywards Sporting Club of Goa. The match kicked off and was effectively finished within the first 20 minutes. Nabi started the onslaught with a brilliant execution in the sixth minute. Dipendu pushed a ball to Nabi after receiving a high ball from Abu Bakar Godwin. And the Mohammedan Sporting No. 8 utilised the space given to him by rival defenders and came up with a sharp, powerful left-footer. Within eight minutes, Dipendu made it 2-0, despite some tense moments preceding the goal. A clever one-two with Bhuvan Joshi on the top of the box made Dipendu clear inside the box. Jagjit Randhawa was forced to tackle him from behind and the referee M.K. Roy promptly awarded a penalty-kick, ignoring the JCT players protest. Dipendu converted easily, but the referee asked him to retake his shot owing to players movements behind him. This time, goalkeeper Mansuru Mohammed guessed right but his outstretched hands failed to stop the ball from rolling in. The first two goals simply shattered JCTs composure and their frustration to lose a battle in such a quick time was evident while conceding the third. In the 19th minute, when a Godwin across-the-field centre found Nabi near the right pocket of the box, the latter never looked a threat to the JCT defence. But a dreadful miscommunication between Randhawa and Mansuru  both players were left home and dry in their respective positions  allowed Nabi to collect the ball gleefully and place it past the JCT custodian. Struggling to get over the early shocks, JCT made first clear-cut goalmouth move in the 24th minute when a diving Gumpe Rime saved Charanjit Singhs left-footed volley. On the other hand, Rimes adventurism in claiming the ball after coming out of his line could have led to disaster for Mohammedan Sporting. But the JCT forwards failed to cash in on his short stature during aerial battles. The move to push Ancheri up in the second half also failed to yield required results for the JCT coach as Mohammedan Sporting players were able to close the gap among themselves, thanks to partly a shorter ground and an aged JCT forward line. Ancheri did reduce the margin from the spot when a Manjit header brushed Odafas hands. However, with I.M. Vijayan leaving the field with a twisted left ankle five minutes from the first half, a fight back from the visitors looked unlikely. Meanwhile, with the confidence in the JCT backline hitting a low, Edeh Chidi and Nabi found themselves clear in the box once too often. Their hurry and lack of finishing skills did not make the scoreline more sparkling for the home team.

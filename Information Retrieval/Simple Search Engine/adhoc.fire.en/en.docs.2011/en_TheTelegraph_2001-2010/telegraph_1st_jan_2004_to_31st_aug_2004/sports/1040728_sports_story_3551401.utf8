 Sizzling Sasi beats Ponomariov
	 - BIEL CHESS Biel: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran was in sizzling form as he defeated former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in the seventh round of the Grandmasters section of 37th Biel International Chess Festival on Tuesday. Top seed and defending champion Alkexander Morozevich of Russia kept pace with Sasikiran and defeated GM Etienne Bacrot of France, albeit with a little help from his opponent. As things stand now, both Morozevich and Sasikiran have five points from seven games. Ponomariov, who is 1.5 points behind, follows them. Local hope Yannick Pelletier is occupying the fourth spot with three points. He is followed by Bacrot on 2.5 and English GM Luke Mcshane with two points. Three rounds remain in this category-18 event on Fide charts. The game was spectacular as Sasikiran crashed through the defences in style with white pieces. Ponomariov opted for the Semi Slav and showed that he was ready for a full-blooded battle by inviting the ultra sharp Botvinnik Variation, known for high tactical games. Sasikiran went for a popular deviation in the opening and surprised Ponomariov with a knight sacrifice quite early to rip open blacks king side. Ponomariov was taken aback and decided to return the favour just a few moves later but by then the die was already cast. It was a spontaneous decision to sacrifice the knight on f-7, a move more in tune with my mood to fight, said Sasikiran after the game, looking happy and contented. As the endgame arrived almost abruptly from the middle game, Ponomariovs pieces were tied down and as soon as Sasikiran started his pawn march to glory, the Ukrainian called it a day. The game lasted 33 moves. In the masters section, R. R. Vasudevan came close to his maiden IM norm by holding GM Ciric Draglojub of Croatia to a creditable draw. GM Christian Bauer (six points) kept his half-a-point lead after he split points with Andrei Shariyazdanov of Russia. Among other Indians in the fray, Asian junior champion P. Magesh Chandran moved to 4.5 after scoring over Buss Ralph of Switzerland. Former national champion P. Konguvel continued to struggle and went down to Avni Ermeni of Kosovo while national sub-junior champion Parimarjan Negi defeated Ditzler Jurg of Switzerland.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Agarkar enjoying the competition
 - Mumbai medium-pacer says Pathan, Balaji keep him on his toes Bangalore: Ajit Agarkar is enjoying the competition among Indias fast bowlers, even though it means he has to sit out at times. The Mumbai medium-pacer said on Wednesday, the emergence of new fast bowlers motivates him to get back into the squad. Agarkar, here to attend the fitness camp for fast bowlers, said he is working hard and enjoying it. Its not up to me whether I get picked or not. My job is to do what I can do best and try to improve. Thats what I am trying. The wiry bowler made his international debut in 1998 and has struggled to seal his place in the XI. He has been in and out, mainly because of the fact that his performance has never been consistent. Asked if he felt overshadowed by youngsters like L. Balaji or Irfan Pathan, he said: Competition is always healthy. I have gained a lot of confidence after the Australian trip and I am looking to carry that forward. In Australia, Agarkar was expected to be an inseparable part of the three-pronged pace attack also featuring left-armers Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra. As it so happened, injury ruled out Zaheer after the first Test and Patahn and Balaji emerged the two leading bowlers towards the end of the tour. I guess when you are not in the team, that gives you the extra motivation to do well and get back. Probably prove to yourself that you are good enough. Competition is always good for the team, there are five or six guys who are fighting to get into the team. It keeps you on your toes, Agarkar said. Probably he was right, for he has been in and out of the team for so long. And this camp should be of paramount importance for Agarkar, who has been injury-prone right since the start of his international career. Its always nice. They (Balaji and Pathan) have done fantastically since the Australia trip. It only helps the side if more players perform. Agarkar, who said he is completely fit, said he has lots of personal goals for the coming season but would keep them to himself. With Team India physical trainer Gregory Allen King announcing that the emphasis will be on endurance and injury-prevention, Agarkar should be one of those to benefit most from this camp.

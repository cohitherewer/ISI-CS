 Sinclair, Cairns prop up NZ
 - THIRD TEST - Kallis side strain a blow to South African bowling  Martin van Jaarsveld gets out of the way of a Mathew Sinclair shot on Day I of the third Test in Wellington on Friday. Sinclair made 74 before falling leg-before to Nicky Boje. (AFP) Wellington: Mathew Sinclair, playing a Test match for the first time in 10 months, hit 74 to help New Zealand reach 248 for six at close on the first day of the third and final Test against South Africa at Basin Reserve here on Friday. Brendon McCullum chipped in with 55 while Chris Cairns made an unbeaten 60 after the home team was put in to bat by Graeme Smith. Sinclair, whose previous Test appearance was in Sri Lanka last May, was called into the side as a late replacement after Craig McMillan went down with food poisoning. The New Zealand middle-order batsman, who made 214 on this ground against the West Indies in December 1999, struck several glorious cover-drives and two sixes over long-on off left-arm spinner Nicky Boje. But Boje, who finished with figures of three for 61, had the final say when he trapped Sinclair leg-before attempting to sweep. Shaun Pollock had McCullum leg-before with the penultimate ball of the day. If you get an opportunity youve got to make the most of it, said Sinclair, who scored 99 and 17 for Central Districts against South Africa in the tour match in Napier before the Test series began. They bowled pretty well. Pretty much right throughout the day they bowled challenging ones and for me anyway, it was just a waiting game to be honest. Sinclair and McCullum put on 66 for the fifth wicket before McCullum and Cairns shared a partnership of 85 for the sixth. Cairns 60-ball half-century followed his 158 in the second Test. Earlier, Boje had New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming caught at slip by Pollock for 30. Flemings dismissal brought second-Test centurion Scott Styris to the crease but he was soon bowled by Boje for one. Openers Michael Papps (7) and Mark Richardson (14) fell in the morning session. Papps was lbw to a Makhaya Ntini yorker while Richardson was caught-behind by Mark Boucher slashing at Jacques Kallis. Kallis took one for four in seven overs, with five maidens, before leaving the field with an abdominal strain. But the South African camp feared they had lost the bowling services of allrounder Kallis for the remainder of the third Test. Kallis left the field early with a side strain  when he had impressive figures of one for four off seven overs  and Smith was not confident he would bowl again in the match. Hes not good, I think its quite a bad side strain, Smith said. The Kallis injury apart, South Africa had arguably their best day in the field on tour. Their bowlers hit the right lines from the first delivery.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

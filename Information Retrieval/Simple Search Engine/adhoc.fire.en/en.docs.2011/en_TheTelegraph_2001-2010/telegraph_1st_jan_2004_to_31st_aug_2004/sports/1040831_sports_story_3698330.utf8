 PCB washes hands off Bari remark
Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has distanced itself from an outburst directed by its chief selector Wasim Bari at veteran English umpire David Shepherd. Bari lashed out at the 63-year-old Shepherd, blaming him for two contentious decisions in the tri-series final in The Netherlands that Pakistan lost to Australia. Bari said Shepherd was too old and needed to be replaced on the ICCs elite panel of umpires. We have no comment to offer on this issue. Whatever Bari has said are his personal views and dont reflect that of the board, PCB spokesman Abbas Zaidi said on Monday. (Reuters)  Copyright

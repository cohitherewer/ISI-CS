The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Netherlands tri-series from August 22
New Delhi: World champions Australia will take on India and Pakistan in a high-profile limited-overs series to be played in the Netherlands in August, it was announced on Thursday. The series will be held in Amsterdam between August 22-29. Each team will play the other once in the preliminary league with the top two advancing to the final, BCCI joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty said. The Netherlands, an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), hosted a World Cup match in 1999, but this will be the first multi-nation series to be played there. Australia, India and Pakistan will use the series to prepare for the 12-nation Champions Trophy to be held in England in September. (AFP)  Copyright

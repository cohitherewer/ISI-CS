The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rajasthan no match for Bengal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Devang Gandhi at the Eden on Friday Calcutta: Bengal had it easy against Rajasthan in the national one-day meet tie at Salt Lakes Jadavpur University campus ground on Friday. Insufficient light caused a delay in proceedings and the match was reduced to 37 overs per side. There was never any doubt about the outcome once the visitors made 154 for eight after electing to bat. The total was well below par even on a wicket where the bounce was unpredictable. Rajasthan were no match for Bengal as far as bowling resources to exploit this wicket were concerned and the home team knocked off the runs with eight wickets and five overs to spare. There was still a dissatisfactory note in Bengals win as they didnt go for the bonus point. They had to reach the target in 29.4 overs to bag it and needed 68 off 58 balls with eight wickets in hand after the completion of the 20th over. It looked easy in the end but going for shots on this wicket was a bit tricky. We wanted to ensure the win rather than risking it while going for the bonus, captain Devang Gandhi and coach Karsan Ghavri said. Fridays was Bengals second win in as many games (eight points) and the clash for the title seems to have boiled down to a contest between Bengal and Mumbai, who have bagged nine points including a bonus. Rajasthan never recovered after losing captain Gagan Khoda for a first-ball duck to the happening pace of Shib Shankar Paul. It was the third ball of the match and the resistance of opener Dishant Yagnik and allrounder P. Krishnakumar thereafter was not enough. Nikhil Haldipur and Arindam Das started well and the former looked in good nick before perishing for a 13-ball 21. It was a loose swipe at one well outside off, but Arindam showed no such impetuosity. The right-hander followed up his patient 67 against Delhi with an impressive 46. He looks the orthodox kind with a steady head and has been consistent this season. An attempted drive through covers against off-spinner Kanwat with a big gap between bat and pad cost him his wicket. Devang and Deep Dasgupta took charge after this. The skipper packed genuine power in three straight-driven fours, two against the seamers and one off left-arm spinner Anup Dave. He cut loose towards the end and finished it off with a straight six to remain unbeaten on 59 (72 balls, 2x6, 6x4). Deep had an eventful outing. After being taunted in the initial moments of the match by a cheerful crowd consisting mostly of university students and local folks, the wicketkeeper walked up to them after the first innings and gave them a piece of his mind.  Sabir, Shib Sagar in Sabir Ali replaced Paul in the squad for the remaining two matches. Paul left the squad to join the India A team in Chennai. Shib Sagar Singh came into the squad as the 15th member.  Copyright

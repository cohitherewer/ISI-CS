The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Acclimatisation Aussies worry 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: While the big boys will fight it out under lights at the MCG, the ones aspiring to reach that stage will also lock horns at the Eden Gardens in a preparatory game for the under-19 World Cup in Dhaka. Their first meeting in Cuttack went in favour of India but the Australians will definitely leave no stones unturned to square the series on Friday before the final match on Sunday. The visitors biggest impediment, however, has been the conditions, specifically the slow and low wickets in these parts, during their short stay here. The pitch has been the biggest hurdle. This side has lot of skill and ability but adapting to the conditions will be the key, said coach Bennet King. The squad  which includes three boys from the Australian academy (skipper Tim Paine, Callum Ferguson and Adam Crosthwaite)  did not have any conditioning camp prior to the tour and the coach is hoping the team gains momentum with time. Weve got two weeks to acclimatise and dont know how much we are going to manage it, King, who is head coach at the Australian academy, said. Tasmanian Paine, who idolises Ricky Ponting, also stressed on the adjustment factor. India coach Robin Singh seems to be in an experimental mode in the lead up to the World Cup and is looking to give everyone a chance to test how the youngsters handle the pressure. Robin, who sounded very confident about the team, said: The good thing is that there is a lot of allrounders in the side and most of the boys are reasonably good fielders. But we need to improve in certain areas as the side looked a bit rusty in Cuttack. Winning is a habit and we have to get used to it. Win in all three matches will put us in good stead mentally before Dhaka, he explained. BCCIs chief Talent and Research Development Officer and consultant to the side, Dilip Vengsarkar also put it: The next generation of cricketers are promising and coming up in a big way. With the kind of resources we have at the junior level, we can easily match Australia and South Africa.

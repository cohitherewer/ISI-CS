Lisbon: Portugal could impose border checks as a security measure during the European soccer championships starting in June, interior minister Antonio Figueiredo Lopes said on Tuesday.				 																																	If it becomes necessary frontier (controls) will be set up, not only on land borders but on the air and sea borders, Figueiredo Lopes said. Right now, a decision has not been taken. This possibility is being weighed.				 																																	With police forces being expanded for the tournament, some officers could be deployed to help check the passports of some of the half-a-million fans expected to attend, he said.

Lehmann, who has since apologised, also made no secret of his difficult relationship with Kahn.

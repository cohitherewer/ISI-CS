 Dias tips India to topple Australia
 Sourav is a great captain, feels Roy Dias Bangalore: The current Indian team has the best batting line-up in the world and the potential to replace Australia as the top Test outfit, says former Sri Lankan batsman Roy Dias. This Indian team is very, very close to Australia. I can say may be better than them. I think this side will remain for some time, while the Australians are getting older, said Dias. Asked if he thought India could dethrone Australia from the top, he said: Very soon, India will be on top. Batting-wise they are the best. Now you have young fast bowlers and if you find a partner for Anil Kumble, I think that will be a winning side. Noting that India played well Down Under, Dias said Australias upcoming trip to India will determine which team is No. 1 in the world. Pointing out that many of the top Australian players are in the 30s, Dias said even the West Indies had to relinquish the top position after the Eighties once their leading players quit together. Dias, coach of Nepal, said India had a great blend of attacking and defensive batsmen. Thats a nice combination to have. Sourav Ganguly must be very happy and lucky to have a batting side like this. Comparing Souravs captaincy with that of Arjuna Ranatunga, Dias said: Sourav gets the best out of his players and I think the players believe in him. No doubt, he is a strong guy, mentally. He can be rated as the best captain now. Asked whom he rated as the best batsman in the world currently, Dias said: The first one is Sachin Tendulkar, no doubt about it. Rahul Dravid is just one step behind him. Brian Lara, Maravan Atappattu and Matthew Hayden. However, Dias refused to single out anyone as the best. Dias was here with the Nepal team which is preparing for the ACC Trophy to be held in Malaysia from June 12-22.  (PTI)  Copyright

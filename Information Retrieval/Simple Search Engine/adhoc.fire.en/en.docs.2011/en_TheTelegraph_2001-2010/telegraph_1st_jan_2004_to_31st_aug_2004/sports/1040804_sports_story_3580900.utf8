The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali factor at the back of SA minds
 - High-flying Lanka ready for the battle of Galle  Kumar Sangakkara at the Galle Stadium on Tuesday Galle: South Africa face a major challenge when they take on a jubilant Sri Lanka side in the first Test starting on Wednesday at spin-friendly Galle. The South Africans only had one three-day game to acclimatise to Sri Lankas slow, turning pitches, scorching temperatures and shirt-drenching humidity. The hosts, meanwhile, arrived in Galle with a fully fit squad buoyed by their Asia Cup triumph and battle-hardened after a recent series in Australia. The Sri Lankans also welcome back off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who pulled out of the two-Test series in Australia after controversy over his bowling action. Muralidharan will not be able to bowl his controversial doosra delivery but South Africa captain Graeme Smith still expects him to be a handful. We all know what a world-class performer Muralidharan is and even without it (doosra) he is going to be a handful, Smith told newsmen. Smith said he was satisfied with the teams warm-up match against a Board Presidents XI, although he has called on his players to now raise the intensity. We had a few mishaps through the game with a bit of sickness and a few niggles that came up, but overall I am pretty happy, he said. The match got a few thought-processes going for the Test and we now need to raise the intensity. South Africas main selection dilemma surrounds Smiths opening partner, with Herschelle Gibbs ruled out because of an ankle injury. Andrew Puttick, an uncapped left-hander, was drafted into the squad but both Boeta Dippenaar and Martin van Jaarsveld could move up the order. Fast bowler Andre Nel is struggling with a back injury and South Africa are likely to pick Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini and Nantie Hayward in a three-pronged seam attack. Sri Lanka will persevere with Romesh Kaluwitharana as wicketkeeper so that Kumar Sangakkara can concentrate on his batting. I believe Sanga is our best batsman at the moment and it is important that we get the maximum out of him so we will be giving the gloves to Kalu, captain Maravan Atapattu said. Sri Lanka are expected to play a more balanced attack with two fast bowlers, probably Chaminda Vaas and Nuwan Zoysa, plus two or three specialist spinners. Leg-spinner Upul Chandana is expected to partner Muralidharan though Rangana Herath is also an option.

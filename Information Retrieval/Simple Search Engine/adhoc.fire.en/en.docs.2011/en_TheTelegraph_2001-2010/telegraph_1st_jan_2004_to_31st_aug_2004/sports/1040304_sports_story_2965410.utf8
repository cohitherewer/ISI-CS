 Its 50-50: Akram
 - Shoaib will be our trump card, feels Youhana  Wasim Akram offers tips to Shoaib Akhtar in Lahore on Wednesday. (AFP) Lahore: Wasim Akram feels it will be 50-50 when India take on Pakistan in the revival series starting March 13. The former captain visited Pakistans warm-up camp at the Gaddafi Stadium Wednesday to give a three-hour motivation lecture to the 24 probables. I think its 50-50  Indias batting is very formidable while the Pakistan bowlers are good and it will all boil down to how well Pakistan bat and Indians bowl, said Akram. Basically it was a pep-talk and I tried to convey to the players that they must enjoy the honour of playing against India. They will savour this moment in the years to come.  My knowledge of the game is for every young player and I told them to enjoy the pressure associated with Indo-Pak cricket, Akram said. The best should come out when you are subjected to pressure and each time I played India, I was told by Imran (Khan) and (Javed) Miandad to be mentally tough. Pakistan have inducted two promising left-arm pacers in the camp  Mohammed Khalil and Zahid Saeed and Akram sounded impressed with both of them. Shoaib (Akhtar) is the key but Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed are also very good, he said. Meanwhile, Pakistan vice-captain Yousuf Youhana Wednesday endorsed experts opinion that Shoaib will hold the trump card. Shoaibs hurricane spells hold the trump card and we look to him to give us breakthroughs in both one-day and Tests, he said. I know the Indians piled runs in Australia and their confidence must be soaring but our bowling attack is superior than the Aussies. He was excited at the prospect of taking on India in Test matches after five years. I am happy that the series is finally taking place and the cricket ties have been revived after a long time, he said. The 29-year-old was part of the Pakistan team which toured India in 1998-99 but wants to improve on his showing. I know the level of excitement in an Indo-Pak series because I was part of the Pakistan team which toured India in 1998-99. But in the coming series, I want to improve my showing. I know my responsibility and would do best to score as much as possible. Youhana has scored 3458 runs in 48 Tests with an average of 47.70, while in the 159 one-dayers, he has 5461 runs. We had good work outs at the tune-up camps and most of our players have been playing first-class cricket. Youhana agreed India will miss the services of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. Both Kumble and Harbhajan are experienced. They will be missed by India and its up to us to exploit that.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Valencia clinch Uefa Cup
	 - Spanish champions strike twice after Barthez ouster  Referee Pierluigi Collina flashes the red card to Fabien Barthez (left) of Olympique Marseille during the Uefa Cup final against Valencia in Gothenburg on Wednesday. (Reuters) Gothenburg: Valencia won the UEFA Cup for the first time with an efficient 2-0 victory over 10-man Olympique Marseille in the final on Wednesday. Marseille goalkeeper Fabien Barthez was sent off for a two-footed lunge in first-half injury time and after Vicente converted the resulting penalty the Spanish champions eased to their second major trophy of the season. Spain winger Vicente turned provider for Mista to fire the second goal past substitute keeper Jeremy Gavanon in the 58th minute, effectively killing off the French side as one half of the Nya Ullevi Stadium vibrated in a sea of orange. Valencias first major European trophy since their Cup Winners Cup triumph of 1980 capped a superb campaign for Rafa Benitezs side and made up for the Spaniards double heartbreak of losing successive Champions League finals in 2000 and 2001. I would like to dedicate this victory to all the Valencia fans that have made the trip to see us here, said Benitez. The first half was even. We found it hard to get behind them but the sending-off opened up the game for us and after that we took control. We might even have added another goal in the second half. The Valencia coach made it clear that his sights will now be set on finally claiming the Champions League trophy next season. First we want to enjoy this moment but you have to keep pushing your limits forward and look to more difficult goals. Im proud of what my players have achieved but I want to set my limits higher. The last three finals had produced 19 goals but this one was never going to be a goal feast with the sides having kept 14 clean sheets between them in the competition. Barthezs dismissal came at the end of an otherwise disjointed first half, with creative football not helped by a stiff breeze. Marseille coach Jose Anigo said the dismissal of France keeper Barthez had changed the game but insisted he had no problems with referee Pierluigi Collinas decision. We wont cry over spilt milk, he said. There are rules and Mr Collina applied them. I think it was a bit harsh, it spoiled the final but Fabien got in the way of their player who was going for goal. Valencias defenders were quick to stamp their mark on Marseille dangerman Didier Drogba, with the Ivory Coast international, a major injury doubt for the final, the victim of hefty challenges that went unpunished by Collina. The Spanish side threatened on seven minutes when captain David Albeldas deflected shot into the ground forced Barthez to dive to his left to parry. Marseille, UEFA Cup runners-up in 1999, responded with playmaker Camel Meriem picking out Steve Marlet in the penalty area but the strikers header flew high and wide. The influential Meriem blasted wide from the edge of the box before turning creator again on 22 minutes, his free kick, awarded for another foul on Drogba, picking out Habib Beye who put his header off target. Neither side were able to gain a foothold in the game until the half ended in explosive fashion. Mista chested down a cross inside the area from Curro Torres and as he was about to shoot Barthez, who re-joined Marseille in January from Manchester United, hauled down the striker with a wild lunge and was sent off. It was a penalty but not a red card, a disappointed Barthez told reporters. Marseille coach Jose Anigo opted to sacrifice Meriem for Gavanon but the keeper could not stop Vicentes clinical spot-kick. Forced to chase the game, Marseille were left exposed at the back and paid the price when Vicente crossed into the middle for Mista to chest down unopposed and fire home from 10 metres. Drogba, with 11 goals in Europe this season, did finally test Valencia keeper Santiago Canizares in the 64th minute, forcing him to punch away a fiercely struck free kick. However, Valencia hung on comfortably to add the UEFA Cup to their 1962 and 1963 triumphs in the old Fairs Cup. They joined Barcelona, Inter Milan, Liverpool and Juventus as record three-times winners of the competition.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

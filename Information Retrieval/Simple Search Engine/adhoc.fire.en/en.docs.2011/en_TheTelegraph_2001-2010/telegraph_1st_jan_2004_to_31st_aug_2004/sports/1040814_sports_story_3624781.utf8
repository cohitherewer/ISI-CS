The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Striving to beat the heat 
 - Athens sun a big headache  Hockey players sweat it out bare-bodied in Athens. (Reuters) Athens: Olympic competitors have been forced to adopt a host of cool measures to beat the soaring summer temperatures which will rocket to over 30 degrees over the next two weeks. Special suits and protective headgear as well as suggestions that competitors should stay away from the marathon of the Opening Ceremony have all been aired. Even horses taking part in the equestrian programme are getting into the act. Germanys Ulla Salzgeber put her dressage horse rusty under a sun lamp with the 16-year-old gelding spending 30 days soaking up the artificial rays in the stables. The British Eventing team acclimatised their horses by draping them under thick, heavy police cloaks, neck cover included, to make them sweat a lot in preparation for their outing under the fierce Greek sun. Meanwhile, Australian Olympic team-doctor Brian Sando has advised athletes competing in the first few days of the Olympics not to march in the Opening Ceremony. Sando said it would be unwise for athletes to stand for long periods over what would be an eight-hour exercise. Athletes are very fit people who use a lot of dynamic muscles and larger muscle groups to propel themselves in their sport... Theyre not used to this sort of workload, and that provides other aches and pains that takes two or three days to overcome in many instances. Sando said it would be totally inappropriate for athletes involved in the first day of competition to consider marching. Sandos directive echoes the one given to legendary Aussie swimmer Dawn Fraser at the 1964 Tokyo Games. Fraser ignored the advice and sneaked into the ceremony anyway  before winning gold in the 100m freestyle. Two of the American beach volleyballers have taken a leaf out of Sandos book. Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs are skipping the Opening Ceremony. Dutch rower Dirk Lippits will don a futuristic-looking helmet, designed to help keep his head temperature as low as possible, when he opens his campaign on the waters of the Schinias rowing and canoeing centre on Saturday. The helmet is made from a single piece of nylon and coated white to reflect the intense rays of the Athens sun which is designed to give him a handsome advantage over his bareheaded rivals. At the Melbourne Games in 1956, British walker Don Thompson had been in sight of a gold with just 5000 metres to go but collapsed with the finish line in sight. So to acclimatise to the heat of Rome four years later, he would spent hour after hour exercising in his bathroom into which he had packed heaters, hot water bottles and boiling kettles.

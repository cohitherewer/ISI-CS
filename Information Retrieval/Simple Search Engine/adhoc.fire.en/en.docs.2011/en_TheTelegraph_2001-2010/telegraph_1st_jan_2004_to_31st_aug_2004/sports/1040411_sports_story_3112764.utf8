The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PCB to hire PR firm
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Rameez says the brief was still being worked upon Islamabad: Worried over not getting due recognition for everything positive thats being done, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to hire a PR agency. Four-five firms have already been interviewed, but the contract may not be awarded in the very near future, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph on Saturday. Contacted in Lahore, he added: Its not that something is wrong with the PCBs image.... However, for whatever reason, our achievements arent being projected in the ideal manner. So, like big business everywhere, weve now decided to hire a PR firm... It makes sense to have pros handling an important aspect... Rameez, though, pointed out that the brief was still being worked upon. Pakistan fined for slow over-rate Meanwhile, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle has penalised Pakistan for being two overs short in the Gaddafi Test. While captain Inzamam-ul Haq has been docked 20 per cent of his match fee, the rest of the team lost ten per cent. Inzamam would have been in big trouble had the deficit been more than five. That, then, would have constituted a breach of the Code of Conduct for the second time in recent weeks. Inzamam, after all, was hauled up in the Rawalpindi ODI.  Copyright

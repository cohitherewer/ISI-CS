 Lara to miss two ODIs
St Johns: The West Indies skipper Brian Lara looks certain to miss the first two ODIs against England because of a finger injury. Lara has been advised to rest for ten days to recover from a fracture to the little finger on his right hand, which he hurt in the first Test in Jamaica. Ramnaresh Sarwan will lead the side in Laras absence, with Sundays opening game of the seven-match series. A board statement said Lara had suffered persistent pain which forced him to seek medical attention during the final day of the fourth Test. (AFP)  Copyright

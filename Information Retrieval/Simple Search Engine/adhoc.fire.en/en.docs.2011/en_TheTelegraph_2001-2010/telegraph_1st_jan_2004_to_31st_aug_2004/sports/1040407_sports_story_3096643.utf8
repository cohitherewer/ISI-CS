The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav ready for Rawalpindi Test
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Ganguly at the Eastern Railway Sports Complex on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly has been given the all-clear to join the Indian squad in Pakistan on Wednesday. The Team India captain was issued the fitness certificate by Dr Kalyan Mukherjee, the orthopaedic surgeon who treated him, this morning. Souravs medical reports were also sent to BCCI consultant Dr Anant Joshi for his approval on Tuesday. He has given his consent to Souravs going to Pakistan, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya informed. Sourav went through the customary jogging and stretching sessions at the ERSA complex at Behala in the evening. Just wait and see, Im confident of playing the third Test in Rawalpindi, he said. I have faced no problem in going through the weight training programme and stretching exercises as prescribed by the doctor. I am absolutely okay and in no discomfort, he declared. Sourav felt that Pakistan had batted well on the second day of the second Test. We will need to fight back into the game. The bowlers have performed well throughout this tour and we can always bounce back, he said. Sourav was also all praise for first Test triple centurion Virender Sehwag. Sehwag is showing maturity as a Test player. The skipper added that Yuvraj Singh, his replacement in the XI, will retain his place. Yes, Yuvi will play the third Test. I will think and decide about the team combination once I reach Pakistan. Dr Mukherjee was confident about Souravs chances of leading the side in Rawalpindi. I spoke to him this morning and he says he is 100 per cent okay. A physio who saw him also says he is completely fit. His pain has completely vanished. The stiffness has gone. Mobility is perfect. He is now raring to go. Dr Mukherjee is also likely to accompany Sourav on Wednesday up to New Delhi on his way back to Pakistan as requested by the cricketer and his family.  Copyright

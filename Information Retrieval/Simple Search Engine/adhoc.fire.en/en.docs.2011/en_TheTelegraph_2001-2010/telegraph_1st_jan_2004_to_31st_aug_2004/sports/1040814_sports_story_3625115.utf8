 Dhoni stars in win
Nairobi: India A bounced back from their shock defeat to Kenya to beat Pakistan A by four wickets in the third match of the Nairobi tri-nation series on Friday. On Thursday, India A slumped to a 20-run defeat against Kenya despite Ramesh Powars unbeaten 80 and Shib Shankar Pauls three for 33. Chasing 223 to win, the Indians reached home with two balls to spare thanks mainly to a brilliant knock of 70 by opener Mahender Singh Dhoni. The wicketkeeper-batsman was declared the Man of the Match. India A take on Kenya in the fourth match of the series at the Nairobi Gymkhana club on Saturday.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ghavri seems to live in the past: Utpal
	 - In life certain areas are fulfilled, while few remain vacant  BY INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  A change in motivation level led to Utpals quitting Calcutta: Even a day after informing the CAB of his decision to quit first-class cricket, Utpal Chatterjee remained the talking point in the Maidan. The response varied from right decision to should have completed 500 wickets. Utpal, however, appeared calm and relaxed in his office in the citys office area. Having finally been able to make the tough decision has made him offload a huge responsibility. He spoke to The Telegraph for close to an hour. The following are excerpts: Q You always said a youngster has to earn his place and you wont make any sacrifices. Then why this sudden decision? A I noticed a sudden change in my motivation from the middle of last season. The feel-good factor and satisfaction I derived from the game was suddenly missing. I decided my time was up and did not wish to earmark any particular match or moment to call it quits. Thats why even Jagmohan Dalmiyas request did not change my decision. Karsan Ghavris criticism also suddenly made me realise that people had started to focus on some of the negative aspects of my game. My performance and fitness was being scrutinised. It pained me even more since the coach had encouraged me to bowl and be part of the team once I fractured my finger. No quality left-arm spinner has impressed in the recent past. Dont you think this has exposed the limitations in Bengal cricket? The logic is simple  if your team has two quality openers and they continue for a number of years there is bound to be a gap between them and the second string of openers. The same thing has happened in the case of left-arm spinner. If you notice closely, there has been several off spinners and pacers moving in and out of the side because none of them performed exceptionally for a long period. There was a time when you were considered among the best in the country. Still you failed to make the Test grade. Do you feel deprived? Thats a closed chapter for me. I dont think I was born at the wrong time. Maybe, that is why I have been able to play first-class cricket for 20 long years. How many people get that opportunity? Life is such that certain areas are always fulfilled while few remain vacant. Not all wishes and desires are met with in this short period. You had to remain satisfied with only three ODIs. Its no use asking me alone. You should ask the captain, coach or the selectors. Personally, I cannot decide my fate. There are people to pass a judgement on this. If they feel, Im not worth it, then let it be so Do you think you didnt get the backing of the captain and the selectors? It matters little as to what I think on this. What my fellow players, the selectors, the spectators feel and say is what is more important. Does that mean you lost their faith? That is for you to judge. I am no one to make a comment on that. Lets talk about something else. Having played for 20 years, how do you compare different generation of cricketers? Like social changes, the approach to the game has changed a lot. The mentality and lifestyle of players have changed. Thanks to scientific gadgets, the thinking has undergone a vast change. The monetary factor has also brought about a transformation. The quality or talent doesnt change. What happens is a shift in the mental aspect that goes into the game. If that is so, then why doesnt the state get another Sourav Ganguly? When did we have five players playing for India from Bengal? There was one Pankaj Roy and Ambar Roy, then we had Dilip Doshi, Pranab Roy, Arun Lal and Sourav. Weve also had Devang Gandhi and Deep Dasgupta making it to the India side. There have been wide gaps in between and only two managed to permanently seal their places  Pankajda and Sourav. This gap always existed. Now at least we have more players being considered for selection. Whats your opinion on outstation coaches in Bengal? I like this concept. This interaction of ideas helps in the progress of the game. But what I hate is the amateurish approach of some who come to earn money. The main thing is understanding the players, the infrastructure and try and minimise the communication gap with the players. The mental approach of our players will differ when compared to other states. An outstation coach has to delve into that and bring out the best in a player. Only then can he achieve success. How would you compare W.V. Raman and Karsan Ghavri? Raman, undoubtedly, is far superior. We made it to the Ranji semis under his tutelage and he was well versed with modern cricket. He used to treat all players at a par and there was no differentiation among the seniors and juniors. He was very confident and followed a definite guideline. On the contrary, Ghavris approach is not conducive to modern cricket. He played the game some 25 years back and still seems to live in the past. He has no idea as to which way the game is progressing. Is money and glamour affecting todays youngsters? Glamour was always there. Money has only now come into first-class cricket. What is bad is the attitude of some of the youngsters to achieve success in a short span of time. That is why I always stress on love for the game as that will expand your career. Instant success is never possible. One last question, will life change after retirement? I dont think it will. Life will flow as usual  the morning workout at Deshbandhu Park is part of a ritual which will be followed by office, where I guess I will have to devote more time. The day will end with the usual round of adda at Hedua till 11 in the night. Maybe, once the Ranji season gets underway I might feel the difference.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Islands FC not harbouring high hopes vs East Bengal
 - AFC CUP - Visitors from the Maldives arrive to face rampaging hosts  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Islands FC at a city hotel after their arrival on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The Islands FC team from Maldives, due to take on East Bengal in Wednesdays AFC Cup match, arrived in the city on Monday afternoon. The visitors from Male are the whipping boys in group E, currently headed by East Bengal, as they have lost all three matches so far and conceded 13 goals, scoring just one. They know the task here will be anything but easy. East Bengal is the best team in this group. The results make that clear. We are hoping to snatch a point, said Islands FCs Romanian coach Prodan Zaharia. Unlike East Bengal, Islands FC are not the reigning league champions and qualified for this meet by virtue of winning the Maldivian federation cup last season. Zaharia has been in charge for just over a month. We were hardly prepared when I took over and our results show that (they lost 0-5 to Geylang United of Singapore and 0-6 to Malaysias Negeri Sembilan). But we are improving now, said the coach. Zaharia may have a point here because his players produced their best performance in the third match after the big defeats  a 1-2 loss against East Bengal in Male on April 7. We are capable of springing a few surprises as we did against East Bengal in that game. Our players can operate at good pace and our aim will be to minimise mistakes, said the coach. It will be a surprise indeed if Islands FC snatch a point from East Bengal but their national team caused a bigger flutter recently, by holding mighty South Korea 0-0 in a World Cup qualifier at home. This outfit, which came fourth in the league last season, has seven players from that national team including captain Seai Llou, who is a striker. Apart from Llou, other players to watch in their team are attacking midfielder Astaf Lutfi and Mali striker Ali Omar  the only foreigner in Islands FCs line-up. However, the prevailing feeling, 48 hours before the match, is that it will take a Herculean effort for Islands FC to put East Bengal in a spot of bother. Considering the home teams recent record, this impression is not unsubstantiated. East Bengal have beaten foreign teams in seven successive matches and are looking increasingly eager to do well beyond Indian shores. With a quarter-final berth in the second tier of Asias premier club championship beckoning, East Bengal will try to seal that with a win over Islands FC in front of home fans. They will be at full strength too with all those who missed the away match in Male  striker Cristiano Junior, defender Dipak Mondal, medio Subhas Chakraborty  available for selection. Zaharia is aware of this. He must devise something very, very special to halt the East Bengal juggernaut.  Copyright

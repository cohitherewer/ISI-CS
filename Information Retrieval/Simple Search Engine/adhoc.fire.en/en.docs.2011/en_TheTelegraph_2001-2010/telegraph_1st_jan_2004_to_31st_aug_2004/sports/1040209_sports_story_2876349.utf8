The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Safety issue worries Sourav
Sydney: India captain Sourav Ganguly said on Sunday his team was worried about the safety factor on the tour of Pakistan beginning next month and that the matter would be discussed with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). We are not worried about the Pakistan tour, we are worried about the security there, said Sourav. We are concerned because we have families at home and it is not going to be easy. We have to go back and talk to the BCCI and get a clearer picture, he said. The captain denied that the players had already made up their minds on the visit to Pakistan. I have heard some reports that players are not going to tour Pakistan, which is untrue. Our only worry is security. Any further comment wont be fair at this stage, Sourav said. India are scheduled to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals in March-April. Meanwhile, BCCIs three-member recce delegation leaves for Pakistan on Monday and will visit Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Karachi and Faisalabad. The high-level team will be in that country for a week.  (PTI)  Copyright

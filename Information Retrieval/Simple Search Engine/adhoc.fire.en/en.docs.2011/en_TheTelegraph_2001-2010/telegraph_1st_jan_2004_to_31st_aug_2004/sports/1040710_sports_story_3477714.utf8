 Mongias parting gift to Lancs
 Mongias allround show helped Lancs to win London: Indian allrounder Dinesh Mongia bade farewell after his three-week stint as a replacement for the injured Carl Hooper of the West Indies by taking centrestage in Lancashires first victory in ten games last evening. Mongias canny variations of pace and flight fetched him figures of two for 15 as Derbyshire made a laboured progress to 142 for four in the 20-overs match. The Indian followed it up with two sixes and five fours in his 50 from 34 balls to claim victory for his side with 17 deliveries to spare, in a game made possible by the work of ground staff after 15 hours of rain. Derbyshires innings began at a gallop with Jon Moss hitting a six and five fours in his 39 off 26 balls but collapsed against spinners Mongia and Gary Keedy. Mal Loye launched Lancashires cruise to victory with five fours in his 32 off 23 balls while Mongia hit out in his final game for the County side. (PTI)  Copyright

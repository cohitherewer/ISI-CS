 PCB rebuke harsh: Shoaib
 Shoaib Akhtar Islamabad: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar on Tuesday termed as harsh the reprimand issued to him by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) last week, but thanked PCB chief Shaharyar Khan for believing about his injury, which prevented him from bowling in the later stages of the final cricket Test against India last month. The 28-year-old fast bowler, who was let off with a mild warning by the PCB, said: Even now I feel the board has been somewhat harsh by issuing a warning to me and asking me to show more commitment to the team, but I can honestly say commitment for the team has never been an issue for me. Shoaib, who left for England to join Durham, thanked Khan for believing him. The chairman has been very fair to me. I am relieved that the medical commission has also accepted that I did sustain an injury during the final Test against India due to which I could not bowl, he said prior to his departure. I have bowled in the past with niggling injuries. I have never backed out from a challenge, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

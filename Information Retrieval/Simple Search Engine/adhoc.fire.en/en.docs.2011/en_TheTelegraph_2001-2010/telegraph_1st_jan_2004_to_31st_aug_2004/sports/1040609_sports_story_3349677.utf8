The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Test for Glenn
Sydney: Australias two-Test series against Sri Lanka next month is crucial for Glenn McGrath, chief selector Trevor Hohns said on Tuesday. Out of Test cricket for almost a year with ankle problems, McGrath made an unflattering return to one-day International cricket in Zimbabwe last month. National selection panel chairman Trevor Hohns admitted McGrath was facing an important series to get back into Test cricket. Hes not so much under pressure, Hohns said on Tuesday. But its an important one for him... we certainly need to find out whats left there. If McGrath cannot trouble Sri Lankas batsmen in Darwin and Cairns in early July, his Test future will be in serious doubt. In 95 Tests McGrath has taken 430 wickets  second only to leg-spinner Shane Warne (517) among Australians, and sixth on the all-time list. Brad Williams came home early from the tour of Zimbabwe with a back strain. Scans cleared him of any serious damage but hes no certainty to play against Sri Lanka. If Williams isnt passed fit, it would open the door for quick Shaun Tait. (AFP)  Copyright

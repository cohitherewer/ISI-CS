The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India lose 0-3 in final
Canberra: Australia overcame a brave defensive effort from injury-hit India to win the first leg of the four-nation hockey tournament here on Sunday. They won 3-0 in the final. India had little choice but to play defensively as one of the leading strikers, Prabhjot Singh was injured and defenders Kanwalpreet Singh and Viren Rasquinha were also not available. Travis Brooks, Andrew Smith and Michael McCann scored for Australia, who led 1-0 at half-time. Australia took the lead in the 31st minute. Michael Boyce broke through Indias defence with an angled pass into the circle from the left sideline where Brooks was unmarked and got a touch under Devesh Chauhan who had charged up from the cage. Indian coach Rajinder Singh said the injuries dictated the way his team played but took some positives from the tournament. Missing three main players on the field has an effect on the team, but we have definitely learned something here. We came to improve the team and still we have to work a lot to fight in the Olympics, Singh said. South Africa beat Malaysia 2-1 in to finish third. The Indian team will move to Sydney, where the second and final leg of this four-nation meet will be played. This is probably Indias last major foreign tournament before the long camp starts for the Athens Olympics and it is essential that India make the best use of this meet. Australia, who did not need to play in the qualifiers in Madrid because they qualified from the Oceania zone, are using this tournament to best effect.  (AFP)  Copyright

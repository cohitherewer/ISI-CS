The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea eye new players 
 Nakata may play for Bologna next season Paris: Chelseas Russian billionaire boss Roman Abramovich will be looking to complete the revolution which he hopes will stake his claim to the Premiership title next summer as the transfer window opens for a month on Thursday. Abramovich will be looking to bolster the Londoners who are third in the Premiership. Their campaign has been given a huge boost this season by the  111 million that oil tycoon Abramovich has poured into the club, and the spending could continue this month. Abramovichs hunger for a title could benefit Spanish side Valencia whose Argentine defender Roberto Ayala is being eyed to bolster out-of-favour captain and French international Marcel Desailly. The names of Inter Milans Christian Vieri and Frances David Trezeguet, who has still not extended his deal with Juventus, are also being touted with a move to Chelsea, with Arsenal having already rejected an offer for Thierry Henry. Real Madrids Portuguese midfield star Luis Figo has also brushed aside talk of negotiations with Abramovich. Manchester United, meanwhile, are also in the hunt for a striker to back up Ruud Van Nistelrooy, and have already indicated their interest in Fulhams French forward Louis Saha. Manager Chris Coleman has turned down a  5.5-million bid from the champions but the west London clubs resolve is likely to be severely tested if United come back with a bigger offer. United boss Alex Ferguson has identified Saha as his number one target as he seeks to ensure he has cover for Nistelrooy. If Fulham hold out, Ferguson is expected to turn his attention to either Leeds Mark Viduka or West Hams Jermain Defoe. Skipper Roy Keane believes United are in good shape to retain their Premiership title, but could still do with a couple of new players in the squad. In France, Marseille are poised to finalise the signing of Manchester United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Japanese international midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, who is the Italian clubs biggest salary, could find himself playing in the colours of rivals Bologna next season. (AFP)  Copyright

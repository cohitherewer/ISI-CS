 Dalmiya is power-mad, says Bacher
Mumbai: Former South African captain and cricket board chief Ali Bacher has praised Jagmohan Dalmiya for marketing the game in a big way but also said the former ICC president is power-mad. Praising Dalmiya for making BCCI one of the richest boards in the world, Bacher said: Indias economic boom among the cricket playing nations is commendable and Dalmiya is responsible for bringing in cash to the tune of $200 million. At the same time, I have never known anyone who did not know the meaning of the word no for an answer and is power-mad, he said on Friday. Bacher, here to launch his autobiography, heaped praise on Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly. I met Sachin in 1991 and the last I met him was during the 2003 World Cup. He has not changed one bit. He is respectful and very humble as he was 13 years ago as a youngster. Sourav has helped build the present Indian team. He is mentally tough and has installed that toughness among his team members. Indian cricket is bound to get stronger and stronger in the near future, Bacher said. Bacher praised ICC for penalising teams for refusing to go to Zimbabwe during the World Cup. I think the ICC was quite right about the moral issue as the South African police had assured all the teams security and safety during their stay. On the South African team under new captain Grame Smith, Bacher said: The unification of South African cricket has been remarkable and I think Smith is an outstanding captain at the age of 22.

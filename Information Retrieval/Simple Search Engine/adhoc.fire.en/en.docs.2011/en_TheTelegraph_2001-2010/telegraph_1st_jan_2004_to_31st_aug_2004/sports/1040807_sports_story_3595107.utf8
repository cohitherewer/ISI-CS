 IOC looks to beat Greek hiccups
 IOC president Jacques Rogge undergoes a security check at an Olympic venue in Thessaloniki, northern Greece, on Thursday. (AFP) Athens: The legacy of Athens Olympics may prove to be more enduring than anything Greek organisers could have planned for. Years of internal argument, delays and a testy relationship between the IOC and Athens officials have plagued the organisation of the Games. Successive Olympic presidents have been forced to cross swords with lackadaisical Greek organisers as first Juan Antonio Samaranch and then his successor Jacques Rogge issued blunt warnings. Former Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis was dragged into the melee as organisers were accused of dragging their feet. At least three years of preparation was reckoned to be wasted through in-fighting and bureaucracy. In 2002 Rogge, then in charge of co-ordinating the organisation of the Games, highlighted those problems. We need a sense of urgency and to understand the scope of the Games, he said. The entire episode proved less than dignified and it is unlikely the IOC will risk a similar situation in the future. The constant internal wrangles left Athens facing a desperate race against time to get their sports facilities, transportation and accommodation in place. The need for round-the-clock construction had hiked the bill for the Games considerably higher than the 4.6-billion euro budget, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said in April. Now Rogge is president of the IOC, it seems unlikely promises and plans will be enough in the future for any city to be awarded the Games. Firm foundations and facilities in place are likely to be the main criteria. Athens must also contend with being the first city forced to face up to the burden of a heightened global security situation. The need for increased security will be a key consideration when awarding the honour of hosting the Games in future. Certainly the five cities in the running for 2012 all seem to fit the bill. London, Paris, New York, Madrid and Moscow were selected as candidate cities in May. (Reuters)  Copyright

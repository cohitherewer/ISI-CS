 Diego to be discharged soon
Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona, recovering from a life-threatening heart and lung ailment, is set to leave hospital for the second time soon, sources said on Friday. Maradona, who initially spent 11 days in the Suizo-Argentina clinic last month before being readmitted on Wednesday, is thought to be going to a drugs rehabilitation centre but that has yet to be officially confirmed. His departure has been delayed because of discussions between his family, who want him to check out immediately, and hospital staff, who would prefer he stayed longer to bring about a complete recovery. Maradona, however, is said to want to return to the luxurious residence at General Rodriguez, 50km to the north west of Buenos Aires, where he spent his time between hospital stays. Meanwhile, a friend of the player, quoted in the local press, gave an insight into Maradonas hedonistic lifestyle since his earlier release. Diego was very anxious and wanted to leave. They even had to hide all the keys of the cars around the place to stop him escaping, the friend said. Soon after his release, Maradona was reportedly tucking into a diet of grills and pasta, washed down with red wine, and welcoming a stream of visitors between stints of playing golf and football.

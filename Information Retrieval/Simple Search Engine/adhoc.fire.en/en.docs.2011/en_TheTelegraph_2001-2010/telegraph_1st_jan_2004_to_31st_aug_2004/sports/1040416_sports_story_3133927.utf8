 Thorpe for 400m if Stevens pulls out
 The convoluted Thorpe issue ends Sydney: Ian Thorpe has finally been cleared to defend his 400 m freestyle at the Athens Olympics if his Australian teammate Craig Stevens pulls out of the event as expected. Stevens has still not made a decision on whether he will withdraw, but has said he is thinking about it and expects to make an announcement in the next few days. Thorpe, the 400m world record holder, was thrown out of his signature event at last months Olympic qualifiers after he slipped off the blocks and fell in the water while waiting for his heat to start. The 21-year-old protested at his disqualification, saying he lost his balance and tumbled in when he heard a noise in the crowd, but lost his appeal. Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) officials, concerned about any possible legal challenges, sought advice on whether Thorpe would be allowed to replace Stevens if he did stand aside. There was speculation that another swimmer, Josh Krogh, may replace Stevens, but the AOC announced Thursday that their lawyers had found that Thorpe was next in line. Alan Sullivan, one of two barristers who looked at the case, said in a statement released by the AOC: In my opinion it is Mr Thorpe and not Mr Krogh or any other swimmer who satisfies the nomination criteria. With Stevens expected to make an announcement within days, Coates said the AOC wanted to clarify their legal position to head off any challenges. Thorpe was the obvious choice to replace Stevens but there were claims that Krogh, who finished third in the Australian Olympic trials final behind Grant Hackett and Stevens, was next in line. We wanted to be sure the course of action taken by Australian Swimming is not going to be appealed, Coates said. Krogh, a training partner of Stevens at the Australian Institute of Sport, immediately released his own statement saying he would not challenge the ruling.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

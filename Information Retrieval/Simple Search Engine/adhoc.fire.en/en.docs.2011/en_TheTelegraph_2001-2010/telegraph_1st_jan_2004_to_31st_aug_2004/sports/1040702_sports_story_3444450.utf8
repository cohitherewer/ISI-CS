 Four gold, one silver for India
New Delhi: Led by the quarter milers, India won four gold, one silver and two bronze medals in the third and final leg of the 2004 Asian Grand Prix series in Manila, Philippines on Thursday. Chitra K. Soman (womens 400m) and Navpreet Singh (mens shot put) won individual gold medals, before the mens and womens 4x400m relay teams added to Indias gold tally. K. M. Binu picked up the lone silver in mens 400m while the mens 4x100m relay team and Rajwinder Kaur (womens 400) won bronze medals. The womens 400m saw Rajwinder challenging Chitra. But in the end Rajwinder faded away as Chitra, who achieved the Olympic A qualification mark by clocking 51.30 seconds in Chennai last month, won in 52.84 seconds, ahead of Svetlana Bodristkaya of Kazakhstan (53.47). Rajwinder picked up the bronze finishing in 53.53 seconds. In the mens shot put, Navpreet Singh won his second gold in three legs with a heave of 18.83m, according to information received here on Thursday. In the 4x400m relay, both the mens and womens teams returned poor timings despite clinching gold medals. While the womens quartet, which set a new national record (3:27.35s) in Colombo on Sunday, came home in 3:31.94s, the mens team won in 3:05.03 seconds. The men continued their downward slide after clocking 3:03.15 and 3:04.30 in the first two legs at Songkla, Thailand and Colombo, respectively. In the mens quarter mile, Binu, who qualified for the Athens Olympics clocking 45.59 seconds in the first circuit meet in Delhi, failed to beat Sri Lankan Rohan Pradeep Kumara, who performed a hattrick, winning all three legs. Binu settled for the silver in 46.98 seconds behind Rohan who won in 46.22 seconds. In the shorter relay, the Indian men won a bronze, finishing in 40.44 seconds behind Saudi Arabia (40.13) and Thailand (40.26).  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Im proving a point to myself only: Laxman

 - I must live with the disappointment of not being picked for the World Cup 
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 
 Calcutta: V.V.S.Laxman is accustomed to compliments, 
 but Ricky Pontings if somebody can tell us how to curb 
 him, he can join our coaching side salute on Thursday will 
 be counted as very, very special. 
 Yet, somewhat characteristically, Laxman himself treated 
 that as nice only. Again, typically, he added: Ive just 
 been doing my job 
The newest Nizam has really been fantastic throughout this season  something reflected in his figures: A phenomenal average of 96-plus in Tests; an exceptional 52-plus in the ODIs. 
 More than anything else, being 
 positive and staying relaxed has made a difference In fact, 
 you can only play your natural game when relaxed, Laxman 
 told The Telegraph on Friday. 
Of course, he insisted proving-a-point wasnt on his agenda, but accepted that the disappointment of being ignored for last years World Cup hasnt gone away. 
If Im proving a point to anybody, its just to me That Im adept in both forms That I can improve That Im capable of taking control in difficult situations That I can build a one-day innings But, yes, the (World Cup) disappointment is something I must live with 
Its not that Ive been brooding If I was, I wouldnt be relaxed and wouldnt be batting well Over the years, Ive grown to be positive and that has helped during the tough moments Not being picked did hurt, but I was confident of another chance Since my recall (in the tri-series at home), Ive given my top shot, Laxman pointed out, a shade emotionally. 
Asked whether he was batting at his best, Laxman replied: I wouldnt say Ive peaked For, then, I may stagnate I think its fair to say Im consistently batting well and scoring in difficult situations Personally, my run in the 2000-2001 series at home (against Australia) was as satisfying Surely, though, I can  and will  get better 
He continued: Actually, weve been doing well as a team  often, weve been brilliant  and, so, Ive had support from teammates In Brisbane, for instance (last Sunday), everybody contributed in that great win over Australia From No.1 to 11 Everybody played a handsome part. 
Reflecting on his last-ball hundred (an unbeaten 103) in that match, Laxman said: I knew I only had one ball to However, I was more interested in getting India past 300 It so happened that I got my hundred and the team scored over 300 (303 for four) 
Incidentally, all four of his hundreds in ODIs have been at Australias expense. Pontings desperation (and John Buchanans anxiety) is understandable. 
In his eighth season of international cricket, Laxman continues to aim for the perfect-10. Also, he isnt deviating from an old practice of largely setting small goals  his explanation being: Once you start achieving small goals, getting to the bigger ones becomes easy. 
The season wont conclude with the Australia tour (second week of February) but, for a few days, nobody will grudge a change in Laxmans priorities. He is, after all, tying the knot before the high-profile trip to Pakistan. 
Given Laxmans upbringing and the values he cherishes, its no surprise that the alliance with Shailaja is an arranged one. No surprise, too, that the engagement was a hush-hush affair. 
 The talking is done by Laxmans bat.

 Ancheri blow 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Former captain Jo Paul Ancheri suffered a serious injury on his right knee during practice on Friday and might be ruled out. Im yet to know the exact extent of the damage, but it looked serious and its a blow to me, said Constantine. Ancheri also said it would be difficult for him to get back in practice immediately. Freddy Mascarenhas, M. Suresh and Vimal Pariyar missed the camp due to injury and are now out of contention for the Vietnam-bound team.  Copyright

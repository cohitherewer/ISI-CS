 ICC aid for Kenya
Nairobi: The ICC has announced a $2 million, five-year sponsorship package for Kenya and urged the sports management in the country to improve professional standards. The sponsorship was announced by ICC president Ehsan Mani and chief executive Malcolm Speed at the end of a three-day visit to Kenya. The officials held discussions with the Kenyan Cricket Association and government officials and toured cricket facilities. A million dollars of the sponsorship funds will be used to finance initiatives such as high performance programme development, governance and strategic planning, Mani said. However, these initiatives will only be successful if there is unity of purpose within Kenya  a governance structure that is transparent  and infrastructure, both in terms of facilities and resources that are sustainable, he said. At the moment there is still much to be done, he added. Speed said the ICC had set Kenya several milestones, which have to be met before the country can be a self-reliant associate member of the ICC. This includes drawing up a new constitution and establishing a permanent secretariat to run the sport.  (AFP)  Copyright

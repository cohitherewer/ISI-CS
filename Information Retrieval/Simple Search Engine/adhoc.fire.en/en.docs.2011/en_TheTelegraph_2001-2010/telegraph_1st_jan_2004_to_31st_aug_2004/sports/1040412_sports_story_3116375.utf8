The Telegraph - Calcutta
EB to resume title-chase
- Tollygunge harbour little hope against leaders
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: National Football League leaders East Bengal will be without the services of goalie Sangram Mukherjee, defender Dipak Mondal and medio Subhas Chakraborty when they resume their campaign in the 17th round tie against lowly-placed Tollygunge Agragami at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick is, however, confident of keeping the momentum going and taking it match-by-match from here. If we want to become the champions, we will have to take the pressure, Bhowmick said. According to the coach, it will now be a matter of keeping their cool and getting the basics right. East Bengal are oozing confidence having won against Islands FC in the AFC Cup in Maldives recently. Bhowmick has already warned the players not to get carried away by the success and instead focus on the job at hand. Tollygunge coach Kishnendu Roy, on the other hand, seemed wary of East Bengals strength and considers them to be the best side of the country.  They are on one side and the rest are on the other. So I dont have any expectations from this match, Roy said after training on Sunday. We are instead thinking of the next match against JCT, he added. East Bengal are on 34 points from 16 matches while Tollygunge have only 17 in as many outings.  Copyright

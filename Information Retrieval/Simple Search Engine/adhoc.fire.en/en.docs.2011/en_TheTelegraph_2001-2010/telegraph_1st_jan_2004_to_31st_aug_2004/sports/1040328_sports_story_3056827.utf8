The Telegraph - Calcutta
Momentum is with India
- Absence of part-time bowlers will affect Pakistan 
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasWith the euphoria of their historic win in the one-day series somewhat lost by the injury to Sourav Ganguly, the Indians would enter the first Test in Multan in a mental state that could have been much better had the captain not been injured.But in terms of team momentum, there can be little doubt that the Indians are way ahead of Pakistan for whom it will take some doing to avoid conceding an early lead to India in a short rubber where it is difficult to come from behind. Not impossible, but terribly difficult.It is not as much the 2-3 loss in the one-day series as it is the manner and margin of their last two defeats that will surely play on their minds. There is a lot of mental junk and excess baggage to be shed by the hosts.The changes made in the two camps for the Test series are also an indication of the respective mindsets. India have called in their regulars Anil Kumble, Ajit Agarkar and Akash Chopra, while Pakistan had to drop seniors Yunis Khan and Shahid Afridi, and replace them with the inexperienced Asim Kamal and Misbah-ul Haq. They also recalled leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and paceman Umar Gul.At least two of these four recruits will not get a chance in this series, which relegates them to the status of joy-riders. It also suggests there is confusion in the team management about the actual team composition.The problem for Pakistan is that the top five players in the team more or less select themselves  Taufiq Umer, Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Inzamam and Yusuf Youhana, but none of them offers even a part-time bowling option which naturally puts pressure on the sixth spot in the line-up.

This may be very useful, especially in the hot and dry weather conditions that Multan is known for.If past record of Tests played in Multan is anything to go by, there will be a decision and the clear picture will emerge on Day 5. The toss may become a major factor. While Inzamam showed a bit of naivete during the one-dayers in terms of field placements, bowling changes and mental toughness, his major success as captain during the ODIs came at the time of the toss where he made a clean sweep. If he continues in that vein, it might come handy in Multan where the team batting first generally struggles, as the track eases out gradually.Not many matches have been played here, but the playing surface has proven to be result-oriented, offering equal help to bowlers and batsmen. In fact, there have been just two games here, both against Bangladesh, and the margins show an interesting contrast.Pakistan won the first match in 2001 by an innings and 264 runs, and the second in 2003 by just one wicket. It was won single-handedly by Inzamam, otherwise the Bangladeshis had almost clinched their first victory in the Test arena. If Bangladesh could force Pakistan into a tight spot on this cricket-friendly wicket, one does not have to be a genius to infer that India can do it more effectively.Going into the first Test, and that too on a result-oriented track, the visitors will be feeling much more confident than the hosts. And rightly so. Copyright

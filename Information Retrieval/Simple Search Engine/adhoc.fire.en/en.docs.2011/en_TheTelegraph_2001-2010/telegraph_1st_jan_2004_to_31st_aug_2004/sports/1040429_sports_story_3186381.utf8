New Delhi: One of Indias brightest medal prospects in the Athens Games, rifle shooter Anjali Vedpathak Bhagwat on Wednesday crashed out in the qualification round of womens 50m rifle three position event in the World Cup, held as an Olympics test event. Anjali, ranked No. 9 in the world, finished a dismal 43rd in the preliminary round, even behind compatriot Deepali Deshpande (37th). The CISF officer, who had earlier finished joint 15th in her pet event  10m air rifle  here, returned scores of 193 (97, 96) in prone, 191 (99, 92) in standing and 185 (92, 93) in kneeling for a total of 569, according to information received here.

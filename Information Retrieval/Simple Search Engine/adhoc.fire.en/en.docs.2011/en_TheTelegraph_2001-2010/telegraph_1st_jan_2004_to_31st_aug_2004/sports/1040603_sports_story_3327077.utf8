The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Van Basten saga
Ruud Gullit (left) and Frank Rijkaard celebrate Hollands 2-1 semi-final win over Germany on June 22, 1988, in HamburgHaving won the title in 1972 and 1980, West Germany played host to the 1988 European championships with Spain, Italy, Denmark, the USSR, Holland, England and Ireland taking part. Title-holders France failed to make it past the qualifiers, and were the only major absentee at a tournament soured somewhat by battles between German and English hooligans. In group I, West Germany and Italy sailed through to the semi-finals. As a finalists in 1984, Spain could only manage third place and packed their bags early. In group II, Valeri Lobanovskis USSR team led the table ahead of Holland, who they had beaten England 1-0 helping to eliminate Bobby Robsons team. The semi-finals proved an exciting affair and effectively saved the tournament. In Hamburg, the Orange, led by the unforgettable Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit, put on a show to beat Franz Beckenbauers West Germany 2-1. The Germans were considered a team still under-construction, but a Ronald Koeman penalty and a strike from Van Basten were enough to overcome Lothar Matthaeus early penalty and took Holland to their first ever European championship final. The other semi-final, featuring USSR against an equally composed Italian squad, provided the match of the tournament, with the two Soviet goals coming from Litovchenko and Protassov in the space of three second-half minutes. The final between Holland and the USSR, staged at the Munich Olympic stadium, was thus qualified as a revenge match due to the Soviet victory in the first round. Revenge or not, Rinus Michels Dutch squad had more than a few tricks up its sleeve. Ruud Gullit opened their account on the half-hour , but it was Van Basten who provided one of the most memorable goals in tournament history by scoring a spectacular right-foot volley (54) from a near-impossible angle inside the area. Beyond the 2-0 victory of a Dutch master-class containing the combined talents of Gullit, Van Basten, Frank Rijkaard, and Koeman, this particular competition belonged to the giant Marco. Not only had the AC Milan striker demonstrated his full array of technical wares, but he also provided proof of his terrifying efficiency. Top scorer in the competition with five goals, Van Basten just about handed his countrymen the title on a plate. SIDE-KICKS The tournament was soured by battles between German and English hooligansHOOLIGANS: 3,500 West German police were given the task of making sure the final went off without a hitch. On June 25 in Munich, this brigade was backed up by a second unit of customs officers. SUDDEN DEATH: A Dutch tourist on holiday in Benidorm on the north east coast of Spain, died from a heart attack while watching Marco van Basten score his spectacular goal in the final against the USSR. CONFUSION: Denmark were given a 1,000 Swiss franc fine by the Uefa for having infringed on the rule regarding the wearing of shirts against Spain. Defender John Sivebaek, wearing the No. 2 shirt, had in fact changed during the half-time interval, returning with the No. 12 shirt. The same No. 12 was also later worn by substitute Lars Olsen. BONUSES: Financially, the Italian players were among the most rewarded during the tournament. For reaching the final they would each have received approximately 85,000 euros. The English, Germans, Spanish, Dutch and Danish were not in the same price bracket, although all were within a reasonable range, offered between 36,000 and 42,000 euros to win the European title. The Irish were given 10,000 euros per match, while the money made from sales of a record they recorded with Irish rock group U2 allowed them to end their sojourn with a luxury holiday. THEFT: Following German defender Manfred Kaltz, the victim of a theft during the 1980 tournament, it was the turn of the Italian substitute goalkeeper Stefano Tacconi to experience the same fate eight years later. The result was the theft of 29,000 euros worth of articles. We simply must win this tournament, said a seemingly gutted Tacconi, since the bonuses we have earned up until now will have to be used to buy all the things that were stolen from me. THE STARS Lothar Matthaeus Evergreen Lothar Matthaeus holds the European record of international appearances, having played an astonishing 150 times for Germany. It could have been 180 had national team coach Bertie Vogts not decided controversially to leave him on the sidelines on many occasions.  Brought into the national team at the age of 19 for the European championship-winning side in Italy (1980), Matthaeus promising club career began at Bayern Munich. Of all the German players who left to play in Italy during the 1990s, it was Matthaeus who most profited from his time in the Serie A. Within two seasons at Inter Milan Matthaeus became another player altogether, more skilful and with greater vision and subtlety. Suddenly he was indispensable to the Nationalmannschaft. Beckenbauer, Germanys coach at the time, was quick to recognise the successful transition and named him captain for the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Berti Vogts called him into the national squad for the 1998 World Cup in France, where an ageing German side fell victim to the inspired Croatians in the quarter finals (0-3). His international career came to an end after a disappointing European Championships in 2000, when in the last group A match against Portugal (0-3) he notched up his 150th cap. Marco van Basten During a league encounter between Nijmegen and Ajax an 18-year-old called Marco van Basten strode on to the pitch, to replace the great Johan Cruyff. This was a moment of immense significance, marking the end of one era and the beginning of another in the rich history of Dutch football. If Cruyff was the footballing artist whose deft strokes encapsulated the game during the 1970s, Van Basten marked the 1980s in his own spectacular style and fashion. Sadly, his only appearance at the World Cup, in 1990, brought him nothing but frustration as Holland slumped to a 1-2 defeat against West Germany. Both Cruyff and van Basten were remarkably similar, yet individual in their own style. Van Basten was taller and more athletically-built, but both were extremely fast with technical skills to match and deadly in front of goal. The young prodigy from Utrecht had a short career but still managed to score 295 goals. He was forced to retire after a series of debilitating ankle injuries. On May 26, 1993, Van Basten played his last game in the Champions League final against Marseille.Just over two years later, on August 17, 1995, after undergoing a series of operations and attempts at rehabilitation, Van Basten announced his enforced retirement.

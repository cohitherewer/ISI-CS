The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stars and Stripes a no-show in Village
Athens: A rare sight draws the eye at the athletes Village on the eve of the Olympic Games. Fluttering gently in the Athens breeze, the Stars and Stripes hangs side by side with the flags of the other nations contesting the 28th Olympics. But elsewhere in the Village and around the Greek capital the US standard is a conspicuous absentee. It is symbolic of a confidence crisis that appears to be afflicting the usually ultra-patriotic nation in the wake of last years US-led Iraq war, the legitimacy of which has divided world opinion. Security fears in Athens are sky-high and, with US track and field athletes also currently engulfed in a drugs scandal, Team USA has been ordered to tone down exuberant displays of national fervour at the Games. So while athletes from other competing nations have draped their flags over balconies in the village, the Americans have been told by concerned team officials to refrain. We have asked them not to hang the flag all over the place, confirmed Jim Scherr, chief executive of USOC. Scherr and his colleagues are also desperate to avoid a repeat of the controversial behaviour of the American 4x100m relay team after they took gold at the last Olympics. In Sydney four years ago the victorious US team, anchored by Maurice Greene who will try to defend his 100m title in Athens, took off their vests and wrapped themselves in the US flag in a celebration seen by many as over the top. That was absolutely improper and something we have taken great measures to have our athletes not do, said Scherr. They didnt mean any disrespect. They were excited (but) I think those athletes would do things differently now. Athletes can display it on their victory laps, its just the flag is not a headband or a turban. Greene, whose preening and posturing are an integral part of his on-track persona, said: This doesnt just go for American athletes, it goes for every athlete competing. You dont know what they will do after winning a gold medal. Nothing is planned, its done on emotion, you have no control.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Anand to take on Shirov in Round VI
 Anand faces a stiff challenge Wijk Aan Zee, Jan. 17 (PTI): Vladimir Kramnik and Viswanathan Anand face a tough challenge to annex the Corus chess title with five players tied for the top spot after five rounds. With eight rounds still remaining in this 14-player category-19 event, Anand, Kramnik of Russia, Peter Leko of Hungary, Michael Adams of England and Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria form the leading pack with three points. Just half-a-point behind are local star Loek Van Wely, Vladimir Akopian of Armenia and Russian duo of Evgeny Bareev and Peter Svidler. Viktor Bologan of Moldova, Alexei Shirov of Spain, Zhang Zhong of China and Dutchmen Ivan Sokolov and Jan Timman are on two each. Friday was the second of the three rest days and the event will resume with Anand taking on an off-form Alexei Shirov with white. It has been good going for Anand so far, apart from the one winning move he missed against Bologan in the fourth round. Discounting that miss, the Indian stalwart has been impeccable in his handling of the remaining games. Leko could not do much against Anand in the first round while Akopian was mauled in the second game.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Survey team completes job
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The route charters/surveyors for the inaugural India-Asean Car Rally finally reached Bangkok Saturday, covering about 6,000 km of road and dirt track. This isnt the rally proper, but their travel itself creates history, finding a land route that will son be motorable, from India and through five Asean nations. According to information reaching here, the charters, who are preparing a route for the rally to be held in November, travelled in a surge of adrenaline and in a security net provided in areas so far thought too risky to be motorable, especially in Myanmar. The countries covered were Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. The team now returns, and the long preparation for the rally begins.  Copyright

 Johl fulcrum in Asian body
 Johl among five brewing rebel tour New Delhi: Frustrated by a protracted legal battle between the Asian PGA Tour and its marketing company ATL, the Asian PGA Tour players have taken matters in their own hands and have completed the required paperwork to pave the way for setting up of a new tournament players association. The new association will be run by a board controlled by the players and will become the sanctioning body for professional golf in Asia with immediate effect, informed Amandeep Johl, one of the five members in-charge of the body. Johl, who recently returned here after a spate of meetings between the players and various other bodies in Singapore, also informed that the move had received support from the European PGA Tour. Ken Schoffield, the executive director of the European PGA Tour, endorsed the move in a letter to the new players body, the official name of which is to be announced within a month. We wholeheartedly support the Asian players initiative, an ever-increasing number of whom have become respected members of the European Tour, Schoffield was quoted as saying in a press release here. As of now, Johl, along with Kyi Hla Han (Myanmar), Rick Gibson (Philippines), Mardan Mamat (Singapore) and Hendrik Buhrmann (South Africa) have been appointed to look after the functioning of the body. A complete board is expected to be set up when the players meet in Bangkok during the Thailand Open. The players voted unanimously to take control of their destiny after their careers and the game got stymied by political infighting within the Asian PGA Tour. The marketing arm of the Tour, a joint-venture called ATL, had made sponsors extremely nervous with injunctions and litigation between the partners. Many events were lost and players payments delayed. There is no problem with the Asian PGA, but the marketing arm was controlling them and now that an injunction has been slapped on the Tour body, it was not in the best interests of the players, said Johl.

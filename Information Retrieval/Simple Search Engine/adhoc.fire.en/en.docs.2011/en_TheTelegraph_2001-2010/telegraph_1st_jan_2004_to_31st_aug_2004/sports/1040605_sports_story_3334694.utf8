 Proposal to do away with toss
Mumbai: Novel suggestions ranging from doing away with the toss to avoid first-class fixtures in North Zone centres in December-January were aired at the conclave of captains and coaches organised by the BCCI on Friday. BCCIs technical committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar said the idea to do away with the toss to prevent home teams from preparing pitches in their favour came from the boards side. BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said there were suggestions for the number of teams promoted to the Elite division and demoted to the Plate division in Ranji Trophy be increased from two to four. The North Zone representatives felt because of the fog in December-January leading to truncated matches, no first-class fixtures should be scheduled. (PTI)  Copyright

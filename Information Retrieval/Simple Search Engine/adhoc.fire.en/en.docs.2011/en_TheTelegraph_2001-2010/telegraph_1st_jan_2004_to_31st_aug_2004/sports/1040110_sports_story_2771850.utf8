The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Saturday, January 10, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Melbourne: Australian police have warned beer wenches  scantily-clad women hired by cricket fans to queue at the bar for alcohol  that they would not be welcome at the one-day international series.				 																																	Fans pay the women up to $70 an hour to buy drinks so they can concentrate on the game but police fear the practice contributes to binge drinking and drunkenness.				 																																	The women first appeared at Test matches last year and police believe they will be offering their services at the one-dayers, which traditionally attract a more rowdy crowd than the five-day version of the game.				 																																	While authorities are powerless to ban the women outright, they can prosecute them if they are found to be serving alcohol to anyone who is intoxicated.				 																																	London: Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri accused striker Hernan Crespo of being unprofessional after the Argentine insisted on playing against Liverpool on Wednesday and then limped off 10 minutes into the game.				 																																	It is sad. Hernan said he was okay but he will now be out for three weeks. He was unprofessional but he wanted to play, Ranieri told British newspapers.				 																																	Crespo had told Ranieri of a calf injury the day before Chelseas 1-0 home defeat by Liverpool but had assured him he was fit to play, the coach said.				 																																	Berlin: Players at struggling Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin have offered to pay fans travel and ticket costs to away games for the rest of the season to make up for their poor performances so far.				 																																	The daily newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported on Thursday that senior players had proposed the squad put up around 1.0 million euros ($1.27 million) to pay for fans to attend the clubs remaining eight away games of the season.				 																																	The report said the proposal was a response to demands from executive manager Dieter Hoeness for players to accept a 25 per cent pay cut.				 																																	Milan: Saadi Gaddafi, son of the Libyan leader and a player for Serie As Perugia, was given a three month suspension by the Italian soccer league for doping. 				 																																	Inter Milans reserve striker Mohammed Kallon, meanwhile, was handed an eight-month ban by the disciplinary commission. Gaddafi was temporarily suspended in November after he tested positive for the performance-enhancing steroid norandrosterone in an Oct. 5 match. 				 																																	London: Renault will assess the aerodynamics of the innovative nose on Williams new Formula One car and could copy it, according to the teams director of engineering. The Williams appears interesting and logical, said Pat Symonds at the Autosport International show in Birmingham on Thursday where he was speaking in a motorsport industry debate.				 																																	Jerusalem: Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has made an Israeli Arab soccer club happy this week by pledging to come up with money to help rebuild a stadium so they can begin hosting rivals again. It was a big surprise, but we are very pleased,  Bnei Sakhnin club chairman Mazen Ghnaim said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, January 04, 2004  5 potential challengers 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 										Calcutta, Jan. 3: Psychic Flame was complete stranger until the Razeen-Eminence daughter earned her maiden winning bracket  the Calcutta 1,000 Guineas. She added another classic under her belt when she gave a galloping lesson to her male counterparts in the 2000.. She is a courageous filly and capable of defying all odds.				 										Aretino qualified as a potential Derby challenger after the Vijay Singh-trainee finished less than a length behind Psychic Flame in the 2000. The horse is expected to stay the Derby trip and also possesses class and speed.				 										Own Vision has so far fulfilled what the she was required to do  win classic. She won the Oaks by a street but beating nothing much.				 										Red Chief was sent by the South India Baron MAM Ramaswamy for the biggers classics. The Daniel David-ward is yet to do anything notable..				 										Devils Own, stable-mate of Psychic Flame, is the dark in the field. He had placed a faraway fourth but may do better over the Derby trip.

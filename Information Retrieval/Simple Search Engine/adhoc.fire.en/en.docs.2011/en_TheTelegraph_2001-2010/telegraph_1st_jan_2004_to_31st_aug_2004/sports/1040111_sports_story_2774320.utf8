The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Surya wins, Sandipan held
Mumbai, Jan. 10 (PTI): R. R. Laxman stunned GM Koneru Humpy in Round I of the Commonwealth chess meet today. The day otherwise proved quite good for the huge Indian contingent as seasoned IM Sudhakar Babu was lucky to register an upset victory over Grandmaster Marat Dzhumaev of Uzbekistan. Surya Sekhar Ganguly won against Deep Sengupta while Sandipan Chanda drew with Ravi Hegde. Saptarshi Roy shared the honours with Neelotpal Das. T S Ravi earned a creditable draw with GM Saidali Iuldachev of Uzbekistan and WIM Dronavalli Harika accounted for much higher rated IM Lanka Ravi. Also making a good effort were IM Ravi Hegde, IM Anup Deshmukh, B S Shivananda and M Srinivasa Rao who all held Grandmaster oppositions to a draw.  Copyright

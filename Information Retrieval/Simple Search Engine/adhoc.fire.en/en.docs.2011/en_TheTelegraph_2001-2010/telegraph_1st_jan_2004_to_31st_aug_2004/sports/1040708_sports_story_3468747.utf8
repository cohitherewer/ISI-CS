 Sanath challenges Aussies
 - SECOND TEST l We are all behind Warnes record attempt: Kasprowicz  Ricky Ponting at nets in Cairns on Wednesday. (Reuters) Cairns: Opening batsman Sanath Jayasuriya has challenged Australias bowlers to adopt short-pitched bowling in this weeks second Test against Sri Lanka. We are quite used to it. We dont have to worry about those things, thats part of the game, Jayasuriya told reporters on Wednesday. Glenn McGrath took five for 37 last week in Sri Lankas first innings of 97 in the first Test and Michael Kasprowicz claimed seven for 39 in their second innings of 162 as Australia clinched a 149-run win inside three days in Darwin. The second Test starts on Friday in the tropical north Queensland city of Cairns. The wicket has a covering of grass but is expected to favour Australias pace trio of McGrath, Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie. Australian players Matthew Hayden and Shane Warne say the Sri Lankans will be on the receiving end of some ferocious fast bowling. It looks a good wicket. We need to be positive, Jayasuriya said. We should do our thing and just go out there and bat. Jayasuriya made eight and 16 in Darwin, falling leg before wicket to McGrath twice. Jayasuriya, who scored 131 in Kandy in March in the second Test against Australia, said he was not concerned about McGraths public statements that he would be focussing on Jayasuriya in this series. Glenn has been bowling well for the last game and he bowled in the right areas, the 35-year-old left-hander said. Im not worried about if he wants to go after a batsman. Thats his way of thinking. I go and play my natural game. The opener said Sri Lanka must look at building batting partnerships. What we lack right now are good partnerships, the players have realised what went wrong in the last game and that we need strong partnerships, he said. Australia are bowling well, you can see that from the last game, they bowled in the right areas most of the time, thats the difference and we know they bowled well but what we want is for someone to go in and score big runs. He said he had confidence that Kumar Sangakkara would bounce back from his two poor scores in the Darwin Test. Kumar has the experience to come back, hes a class cricketer. I am confident he will perform at his best, Jayasuriya said. He was unlucky in his last game to be run out in the second innings. Jayasuriya said there will be changes to the Sri Lankan XI, but would say no more. There will be some changes for this weeks test, but I am not sure about who will come in or who will go out. Im not the captain. About Warnes possibility of overhauling Muralidharans world mark, the opener said: It depends how he bowls and how much turn is in the wicket. Most of the boys know what to do basically, just see him off most of the time, whenever he comes on. But we just play him as another bowler. We dont worry about his getting the record (from Muralidharan). Meanwhile, Kaswprowicz has laughed off a suggestion that Warne was unhappy with the paceman taking so many Sri Lankan wickets in the first test. Warne took 3-20 and 0-61 in the Darwin Test. Warne said this week he felt an eight-wicket haul in Cairns in the second Test may be beyond him, given the pitch is expected to suit fast bowling. Ha ha. No, not at all (was Warne unhappy). I think thats the beauty of this team, Kasprowicz told reporters on Wednesday. Everyone is out there playing for one another just to get the job done, the 32-year-old Queenslander added. I know Shanes pretty keen to get that record. Ultimately its all about the team and winning the series. However, Kasprowicz said all the Australian players would love to help Warne set a world record before Muralidharan returns to action later this year and continues taking big hauls of wickets. Being part of the team thats involved in history is important to everyone in the team, Kasprowicz said. Being involved in a game where Shane Warne got a record would be something that everyone would certainly remember. Kasprowicz said the Australians would be trying to avoid the trap of bowling too short on a bouncy wicket, but would still be sending down plenty of short stuff to test the touring teams batting line-up. The Sri Lankans are used to wickets playing a bit lower, the tall right-armer said. Our bowlers are blessed with a bit more height than theirs. If there is going to be some bounce there, well probably find it.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

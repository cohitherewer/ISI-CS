The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI fall to Ashleys guile
 - Second Test l England race to 256-run victory with a day to spare  Marcus Trescothick celebrates his second century of the match at Edgbaston on Sunday London: Spinner Ashley Giles took another five-wicket haul to lead England to a 256-run victory in the second Test against the West Indies at Edgbaston on Sunday. England won with a day to spare and retained the Wisden Trophy after bowling out the West Indies for 222 and taking an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Resurgent Giles, who took four for 65 in the first innings after scooping nine wickets in Englands first Test win at Lords, continued his remarkable form with five for 57 to give England their eighth win in nine Tests. It has been an impressive year so far, said England captain Michael Vaughan. The way in which some of my players are playing makes my job very easy. Giles scalps included three bat pad catches to snare Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan and opener Chris Gayle, who offered some resistance with 82. The slow left-armer also trapped Shivnarine Chanderpaul for 43 and bowled Dwayne Bravo with a carbon copy of his dismissal in the first innings with a ball that pitched on leg and hit off stump. James Anderson also took a memorable one-handed jumping catch at mid off to dismiss Ridley Jacobs for a pair off the bowling of Matthew Hoggard. Lara, criticised by former West Indies great Viv Richards for lacking leadership, said he would stay in charge for the remainder of the series and had no intention of stepping down. It is impossible to even think about that (quitting) right now, he said. I have been given a job to do until the fourth Test at the Oval and that is what I am going to do. My employers decide when I step down or if I continue or not. I am always committed to West Indies cricket, he added. I have been asked back to do this job and have been doing the best I can. The pitch got dusty and cut up, he added. We are still batting well but we have just got to restrict England... weve got to get them under three runs an over. Earlier Marcus Trescothick emulated Vaughans feat at Lords in the first Test by completing his second century of the match  the first batsman to do so in a Test at Edgbaston. England lost seven wickets for 100 runs in the morning session as off spinner Gayle claimed five for 34 but West Indies were still set a mammoth 479 to win. Opener Trescothick perished soon after reaching his century, run out for 107 by a direct hit from Sarwan. Graham Thorpe was stumped for 54 after coming down the pitch to Gayle. England beat West Indies 3-0 in a four-match series in the Caribbean earlier this year in which strike bowler Steve Harmison took 23 wickets. However, Giles has taken centre stage in this series with Harmison only netting three wickets so far.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

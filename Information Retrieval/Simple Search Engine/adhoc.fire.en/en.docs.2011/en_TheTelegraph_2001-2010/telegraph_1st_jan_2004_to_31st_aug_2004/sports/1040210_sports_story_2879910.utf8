The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mongia (116), Sriram (92) star in easy win 
Bangalore: Dinesh Mongia (116) and Sridharan Sriram (92) steered India A to a 55-run victory over England A in the first of the three-match one-day series on Monday. A 209-run second wicket partnership between Mongia and Sriram enabled the hosts pile up 324 for the loss of only four wickets in 50 overs after being put into bat at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. In reply, England A finished on 269 for 9 in 50 overs. The visitors made early inroads as opener Gautam Gambhir (13) departed early but Mongia, who hit 12 fours in his 131-ball knock and Sriram whose 99-ball innings was studded with eight fours and one six, frustrated the rival attack which lacked sting. Sajid Mahmood picked up two wickets for 58 runs, while Kevin Pietersen and Graham Wagg got one each. Mithun Minhas remained unbeaten on 42 and Jai Prakash Yadav contributed 30 as the Indians scored at a brisk pace. England went into the encounter with a depleted side as captain Alex Gidman and Test discard Simon Jones missed the tie due to injuries. England A started the chase on a promising note as openers Ed Smith (30) and Matthew Prior (41) stitched a 73-run partnership. But thereafter the tourists lost direction with wickets falling at regular intervals. They were 175 for seven in the 38th over. Stand-in-captain James Tredwell struck a quick-fire 48 off 43 balls and added 75 runs for the eighth wicket with Graham Napier, who top-scored for his side with 61 off 62 balls with two fours and three sixes. The visitors ended up with 269 for 9 in 50 overs. India A skipper Sairaj Bahutule was the most successful bowler taking three wickets for 49 runs. (PTI)  Copyright

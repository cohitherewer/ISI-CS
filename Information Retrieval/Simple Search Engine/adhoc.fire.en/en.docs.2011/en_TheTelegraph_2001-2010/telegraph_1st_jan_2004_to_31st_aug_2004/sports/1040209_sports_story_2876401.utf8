 India batsmen ran out of puff: Ponting
 - We're tired but that's no excuse: Sourav
 Ricky Ponting with the trophy in Sydney on Sunday. (AP) Sydney: Australia captain Ricky Ponting attributed his teams crushing win over India on Sunday to their superior mental strength, saying the tourists had failed to raise their game when it mattered most. Ponting added that the Indian players had run out of puff during the best-of-three finals series, allowing the world champions to cruise to a 208-run victory in the second final. When the big games come around, the character of this side really stands up, he said. If you look back at the series, our batting was superior to Indias and, in the last two games, it was chalk and cheese. Indias batsmen just ran out of puff. Ponting said India had played above themselves during the drawn Test series but had been unable to sustain the high standards during the tri-series ODIs. Its been a very tough tour for them, he said. They played as well as they can, especially their batsmen in the Tests and the start of the one-day series, but you just cant keep playing that well on a two-and-a-half-month tour. We didnt see too many weaknesses in their batting at all but, as the series went on, we made some adjustments that helped us, Ponting added. We probably played as well as we can in the last two matches, Ponting said. I thought wed get around 300 today but I never thought wed get to 359. we timed our run to perfection. I think we had the momentum on our side going into the finals, and momentum is a big thing in cricket. Sourav Ganguly said his players were jaded after such a long tour but could not use fatigue as an excuse. Weve played well all tour but we just didnt play well in the finals, he said. They lifted their game but we just didnt perform. We are tired but thats not an excuse, they played the same amount of cricket as us.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

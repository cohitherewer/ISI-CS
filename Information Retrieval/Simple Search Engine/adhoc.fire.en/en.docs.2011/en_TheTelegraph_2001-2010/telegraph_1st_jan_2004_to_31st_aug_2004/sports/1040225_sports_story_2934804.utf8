The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB want sixth foreign scalp 
 - AFC CUP 
- Overconfidence may be a worry, feels Subhas Bhowmick  BY ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY Negeri Sembilans Duke Efyong, who went through a tough fitness test, in a tussle with captain Khairul Bahrum. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Cristiano Junior sharpens his shooting skills under Subhas Bhowmicks supervision on TuesdayCalcutta: There was a leisurely mood in the way the city observed another bandh on Tuesday. The reality, though, was different for some  this fresh and hungry bunch of dreamers to represent East Bengal in Wednesdays Salt Lake showdown against Negeri Sembilan of Malaysia. It is a group E clash of the AFC Cup  the second tier of Asias premier club championship, wearing a sleek look after dividing the competition into three segments. The classification process followed international rankings and National League champions East Bengal began with what they think was a bang  a 3-2 win on the road over Singapores Geylang United. Coming back to the present, people wandered through a day spared of words like wake up, get ready go to school. Things were so easy-paced, free of reminders. That was when the home team woke up early, for the second match and sweated it out for over an hour at the Salt Lake Stadium where the sound of ball against metal goalposts reverberated on empty stands. The odd onlooker was reminded of the resolve  ensure a quarter final berth first and then prove that Indian football is no mean force as far as the power and skill of countries taking part in this division of the championship are concerned. The difference in ranking can only be bridged by playing more frequently. The visitors got their first taste of the Salt Lake Stadium greens at a closed-to the media afternoon training session. They were keen to check the fitness of Nigerian striker Duke Efyong, who scored a hattrick in the 6-0 win over Island FC of Maldives  Negeris first appearance at an Asian-level competition. Coach Kuppuswamy Devan said his fitness will be assessed again on the morning of what they think will be a very difficult match. Sources later said the back strain may keep Efyong out. They added that Mohammed Ekpoki  the other Nigerian marksman  isnt fully fit either. Even without confirming this, Devan said: East Bengal are favourites and we are underdogs. He had a reason. We think we can, not we might, was the essence of what Subhas Bhowmick, star striker Bhaichung Bhutia and the rest of the lot have been saying over the last few days. Difference in standards between these teams is not difficult to erase. One has to be fit, positive and not overconfident. The East Bengal coach knows these Malaysians come from a superior system, but they can certainly be tamed, given his teams good performance in international outings and the belief that stems from it. We are very positive. The chance of being overconfident is the only concern, Bhowmick felt. He had a reason too. East Bengal have won five consecutive international matches  the winning run starting from the group league match against Army XI of the Philippines in Jakarta in July. Indonesian sides Persita, Petrokimia and Thailands BEC Tero Sasana bowed after that before East Bengal opened their next Asian campaign with the win in Singapore. We want to set a target for the next generation, by beating six foreign clubs on the trot, thats our motivation. Having said that, we will be under pressure to achieve it. So it wont be easy, Bhowmick said. Negeri may be placed in the second tier of the Malaysian league, but they have recently got into this habit of surprising those rated superior on paper. They upset first-division teams en route to victory in the Malaysian Cup, which earned them a ticket to this competition. We have changed about 50 per cent of that team, keeping in mind this tournament and also brought in an extra foreigner, said Devan. He added this third foreigner is a goalkeeper, who is difficult to beat. But he admits the challenge confronting his team on Thursday will still be stiff. Bhowmick says his players are in fine shape, fresh, hungry and high on morale, knowing that beating this team is not beyond their reach. He will get back M. Suresh in defence after missing him in Singapore and pack the midfield with the players he has harnessed with motherly care for such tests. He believes the players share his dream and are ready to grind Negeri out of the match. TEAMS East Bengal (likely): Sangram Mukherjee; M.

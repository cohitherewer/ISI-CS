The Telegraph - Calcutta
CESC a draw away from title
- SAI slip in last tie
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: A bad day in office could well cost SAI Training Centre the BHA first division league championship. Having won nine and drawn two games before Friday, SAI stumbled to a 0-3 defeat against Calcutta Customs in their 12th match. They thus finished their campaign with 29 points. CESC have an identical tally, but with a match in hand. They need just a draw versus CC amp;FC on Saturday to be crowned champions. That shouldnt be a tough ask, given CESCs current form. They are the only unbeaten team in the league and look well placed to clinch their third title in the last four years. CC amp;FC, currently on 24 points, will finish third even if they lose. Against SAI, Customss I. Ahmed scored a brace and Pradip Jena got the other. The second match at the East Bengal ground was an inconsequential one vis--vis championship stakes, but there was no dearth of excitement or drama. FCI survived some tense final moments to get the better of ERSA by the odd goal in three. There was an incident. A moment of madness saw ERSAs P.B. Thapa strike Sukhen Burman a painful blow on the ankle. As the young FCI forward writhed in pain, his teammates rushed towards Thapa to teach him a lesson. Some officials and railway players joined in the action and play was held up for five minutes as the umpires watched helplessly. Good sense finally prevailed and the game restarted after Thapa and Pintu Debnath of FCI were shown the yellow card.  Copyright

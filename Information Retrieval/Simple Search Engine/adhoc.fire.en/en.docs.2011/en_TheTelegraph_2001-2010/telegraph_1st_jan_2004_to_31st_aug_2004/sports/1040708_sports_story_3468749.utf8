 BCCI to set up umpires academy
Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced on Wednesday setting up of an academy for umpires on the lines of the National Cricket Academy for players and an insurance policy for them while travelling to officiate. In another development, it has also been made mandatory for all the umpires to officiate in at least ten local matches and obtain a certificate to this effect from the state association to which they belong, prior to standing in board-conducted tournaments and matches. The BCCI has come up with a dress code for umpires and has assured them of free kits, but warned that any violation of the dress code would be viewed seriously, according to sources. The BCCI has also assured the umpires of its full backing for whatever actions they take on the ground and promised to conduct workshops for them and match referees at regular intervals, the source added. Insurance cover The players contracted to the BCCI will have insurance cover for permanent or temporary disablement, medical expenses for which would be paid by the BCCI. A cricketer will also be required to clear a medical test before the contract becomes operational, according to BCCI sources. (PTI)  Copyright

 Schumi wraps up 7th world title
Spa-Francorchamps: Michael Schumacher wrapped up his seventh world championship despite finishing second behind Kimi Raikkonen in an incident-filled Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday. The Ferrari driver was unable to make it 13 wins out of 14 Grands Prix this season, and had to end up two points ahead of teammate Rubens Barrichello to seal the title. The Brazilian came back from a tough start to place third. Schumachers fifth consecutive title came at the track where he made his Formula One debut in 1991. The race was highlighted by a series of collisions, with Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso, Takumo Sato and Mark Webber among those crashing out and the safety car having to be deployed on several occasions. Ferrari won their sixth consecutive constructors championship after a one-two finish for Schumacher and Barrichello, their seventh of the season, at the last race in Hungary two weeks ago.

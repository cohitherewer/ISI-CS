 Safin: Tennis doesnt need the Olympics
 For Safin, nothing is bigger than the Grand Slams London: Former world number one Marat Safin said on Tuesday that tennis does not need the Olympics. After being knocked out in the first round at Wimbledon, the Russian said he would be going to compete in the Athens Olympics in August  but with a heavy heart. Tennis doesnt need the Olympic Games, he said. We have four Grand Slams. We have (the Masters Series). We have a lot of tournaments. We have a pretty tough schedule. And now we are going to have the Olympics. I have to (go). But it is not my goal in life to win the Olympic Games. Ask Marc Rosset, he said of the Swiss player who won an Olympic gold at the 1992 Games in Barcelona. He will tell you the same. He won it. He is not really proud of it and just saying I won the Olympic Games. Its great. It feels unbelievable and its the best thing that will happen in his life. Of course you are more playing for your country than for yourself, Safin said. But Im not excited at all to go there. I think for tennis players there is nothing bigger than the Grand Slams, added the 24-year-old, who said he had given up on Wimbledon after his shock first round defeat by compatriot Dmitry Tursunov on Tuesday. And nothing will be bigger than that, not even the Masters at the end of the year. Of course its huge. But you are most known for Grand Slams. Thats how it was, how it is and how it will be. If you are going to play well in the Olympic Games, you might not play very well in the US Open. Wayne Ferreira, appearing here in a record 55th consecutive Grand Slam event, disagreed entirely with Safin. Ferreira rated his Olympic silver medal for doubles in Barcelona as a career high. He was South Africas first Olympic medalist in 32 years. For us it was a huge thing to be back in the Olympics... Very important, he said. But then, you take a guy like Yevgeny Kafelnikov who throughout his whole career always said he would never play for nothing  money was the most important thing If you ask him now one of his greatest moments, I think he might even put the Olympics ahead of winning a Grand Slam.

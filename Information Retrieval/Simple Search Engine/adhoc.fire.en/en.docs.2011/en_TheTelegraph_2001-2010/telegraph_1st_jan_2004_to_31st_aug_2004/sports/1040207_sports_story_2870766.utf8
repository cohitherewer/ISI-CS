The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roger Federer was a joy to watch
 - It is time for Paes to put aside sentiment and find a  younger mixed doubles partner
 Serve amp;Volley - Naresh Kumar Marat Safins spectacular comeback  was one of the  highlights of the championships The Australian Open provided a  fascinating fortnight of great tennis. Roger Federer the  22-year-old Swiss champion, riding on his surfboard of abundant  talent, rode the high rollers with rare aplomb and majesty.  His classical style with a single-handed  backhand unveiled a complete array of shots hit with slice,  topspin and flat. The explosive power came not from rippling  muscles but by hitting an early ball with perfect timing.  The harder you hit to Federer the faster the ball comes  back. Like in judo he mostly uses the aggressors power.  An amazing 40 winners off both  flanks, like a stream of arrows, left Safin bewildered and  flatfooted. It was a great joy to watch Federer, who mastered  his emotions with a calm reminiscent of an Alpine meadow.  In sharp contrast the giant bear-like Russian Safin, a like-able  free spirited character, was unable to control his emotions.  He fumed, fretted and even smashed  his racket. Pitted against Federer in full song with no  gas in his tank one can understand Safins frustration.  After 27 bitterly contested sets,  Safin had left in his wake the seasoned warrior Todd Martin,  sexy young hopeful of the US James Blake, top gun and top  seed Andy Roddick and the loveable kiss-blowing 33-year-old  gladiator Andre Agassi looking for yet another Grand Slam.  Safins problem after winning the US Open in 2000 was not  so much in his game, but an almost fatal attraction for  the high life. Happily for him and tennis, he  has reined in his flamboyant ways and returned to the Spartan  focus required at the top most levels of the game. Safins  spectacular comeback was one of the highlights of the championships. At one stage it looked like Roddick  would bludgeon his way to the title. Demolishing his opponents  with his power-packed serve and lethal forehand he showed  a measure of maturity, no doubt instilled by his wily coach  Brad Gilbert. He kept the ball in play till he was in a  position to hit a winner. In my view his reluctance to go  to the net and volley relieves the pressure on his opponents.  Roddicks baseline game is forehand-oriented and he plays  most rallies from close to the backhand corner.  The gap left on the forehand court  makes him vulnerable to a good backhand down the line and  an angled short cross-court forehand. In comparison, Federer  has more balance and a far better position as he plays more  from the centre of the baseline.  I read with much amusement about  the incident after the mens doubles final when the French  winners Santoro and Llodra, after throwing their wrist bands,  shirts, shoes and socks into the crowd, were egged on to  go one step further. Without a roll of the drums and trumpets  the players took off their shorts and threw them into the  crowd amidst a crescendo of cheering. I didnt believe it  till I saw the photograph in the newspapers. They did not  seem to be a threat to Schwarznegger, nor will they be signed  up by the Moulin Rogue, but they could blow the roof off  at Wimbledon. Continuing on the same note, one  could describe the womens singles as topless! The absence  of Serena Williams, Jennifer Capriati, Mary Pierce, Jelena  Dokic and Monica Seles due to injury was compounded by Venus  Williams early loss and the tearful withdrawal of Mauresmo.  Mauresmo was in top form and would have posed a real threat  to Justine Henin-Hardenne in the semi-finals. The womens final, though, was  well-contested. Henin-Hardenne with her wiry frame now muscular  enough to thump down a serve at over 170 kmph was a worthy  champion. She has a flawless all-court game and is very  quick with strong legs. Intensely competitive, she struts  around with a swagger, sizing up the opposition with her  darting eyes. A single-handed backhand hit with abandon,  especially the down-the-line adorns her game. In contrast  Kim Clijsters looks like a good-natured comely bustling  housewife. Her looks belie the great depth and power in  her ground shots, with which she grinds the opposition into  the ground. Just a shade behind Henin-Hardenne she has a  robust constitution and could well tilt the delicate balance  in her favour by developing a net game. How can I finish without mentioning  Paes and Navratilova. The avalanche of well-deserved guilded  accolades have said it all and I have nothing to add. But  the sand in the hourglass seems to have run out and it is  time for Paes to put aside sentiment and find a new young  mixed doubles partner who plays on the left court. Believe  me, the way Paes is playing now he could well pick up many  more Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. Copyright

 Mills to be heard for excessive appealing
Wellington: New Zealand bowler Kyle Mills has been cited by Match Referee Chris Broad for excessive appealing in Wednesdays fourth one-day International against Pakistan. Mills had Pakistan batsman Saleem Elahi caught behind for 11, but failed to look back to check umpire Daryl Hairs decision before celebrating and will face a hearing at noon on Friday in Wellington. The International Cricket Council has recently clamped down on excessive appealing and players are expected to wait for the umpires decision before celebrating. New Zealand took a 3-1 lead in the five-match series with Wednesdays eight-wicket victory.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

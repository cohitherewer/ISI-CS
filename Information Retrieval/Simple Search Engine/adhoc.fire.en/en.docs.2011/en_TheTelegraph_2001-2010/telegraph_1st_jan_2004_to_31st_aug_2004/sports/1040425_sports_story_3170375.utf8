 Murali can dodge test: Ponting
Sydney, April 24 (AFP): Australian captain Ricky Ponting feels it would have been easy for Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan to bowl with a straighter arm than normal while being tested for throwing. The Australian skipper believes the ICC needs to view footage of Muralidharan bowling in match conditions before making a proper assessment of his action when he delivers his controversial doosra. Ponting said on Saturday that there was no guarantee Muralidharan bowled the same way during recent testing by biomechanics at the University of Western Australia as he did during a match. Thats the thing with it -if you look at the way they are doing that testing, there probably could be ways around it all the time, Ponting said in a radio interview on Saturday. I think they have to look at the actual video footage from when hes bowling in Test matches to get a real idea and understanding of whats going on. I actually mentioned to him after the recent series in Sri Lanka that I thought he bowled that delivery too much and it was actually becoming pretty easy for a lot of the batsmen to pick because we were seeing it so often, he said.

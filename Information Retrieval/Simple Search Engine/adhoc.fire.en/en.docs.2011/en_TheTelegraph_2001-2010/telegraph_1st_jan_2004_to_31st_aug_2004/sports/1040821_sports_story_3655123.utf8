 The Olympic hosts are winning rave reviews after the first week of the Athens Games, with foreign visitors expressing delight with the friendly, clean and well-organised Greek capital. These are qualities rarely associated with the sprawling metropolis of four million which suffered a steady dose of bad publicity in the run-up to the Games because of construction chaos, ballooning costs and security concerns. They can be very proud. Everything is perfect, so well organised. Just perfect, said Daniel Nilsson, 32, a financial adviser from Stockholm. Olympic gold-medallist Amanda Beard will continue to pose for glossy magazines besides creating ripples in the pool. Swimmings version of tennis diva Anna Kournikova, the 22-year-old American has done several magazine shoots in recent months. Ill do them as long as they want me to, giggled Beard, who won the womens 200 breaststroke in Athens to end an eight-year wait for her second Olympic gold. I have fun with it. It gives me something to do outside swimming. It mixes things up for me. The Californian burst on to the scene as a 14-year-old at the 1996 Atlanta Games and stole hearts when she collected a relay gold clutching her favourite teddy bear. The Games organisers tried to ban this months Greek edition of Playboy, objecting to an article featuring naked women, sports equipment, the Olympic rings and headlines like Go For A Sexathlon Gold. The magazines lawyer said on Friday a Greek court had refused an injunction which Games organisers said they sought to protect their trademarked symbols and a suggestive reworking of the Olympic motto Faster, Higher, Stronger. The magazine remains on sale at Athens newsstands. There is no case of us ridiculing the Games or the Olympic symbols. In actual fact we dedicate many serious articles to the event in the magazine We are just having a bit of fun, explained editor-in-chief Giorgos Kyparissis. A spy-in-the-sky airship guarding the Games was briefly grounded in Athens because of a technical problem, police said on Friday. The blimp, carrying a battery of equipment from spy cameras to chemical agent detectors, is part of the biggest security operation ever mounted in peacetime Europe, protecting the first summer Games since the September 11 attacks in 2001. There was a problem it has been repaired and is flying again, a police spokeswoman said, insisting the grounding had not compromised security. That is not good news for some Athenians, who object to its intrusion into their private lives and call it Big Brother. A court this week dismissed a request for an injunction from citizens groups who said the blimp violated their civil rights. Technology is playing an ever greater role in sport but the Argentine womens hockey team probably didnt think a webcam would help them win. Warming up in Spain before the Olympics, experienced Argentine striker Vanina Oneto was about to abandon the idea of going to her third Games because she missed her baby so much. I tell you, I almost gave my ticket back. It was too long to be away from her, said the 31-year-old Oneto, Argentinas top scorer who netted her 145th goal on Friday. But since we came to Athens its been okay because now I have a webcam and I can see her.every day and she can see me. I sing her songs and lullabies down the line and she recognises my voice. Technology is great.

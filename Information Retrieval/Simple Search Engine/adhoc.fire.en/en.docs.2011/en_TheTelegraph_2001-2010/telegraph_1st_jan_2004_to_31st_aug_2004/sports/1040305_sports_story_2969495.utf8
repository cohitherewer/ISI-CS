 No retest for Parthiv, Pathan
Ahmedabad: The Gujarat government Thursday ruled out any possibility of allowing the Indian cricket players  wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel and pace sensation Irfan Pathan  to sit for their 12th standard examinations later. Both of them will miss the exams, which start from March 15, because they have been selected for the Pakistan tour beginning next week. There is no such provision in the Regulation Act or the examination manual, which enables retest for a student not able to take the exams, sources in the state education department said Thursday. When contacted, state education minister Anandiben Patel said, Why is the media so worried about the retest when they (Parthiv and Pathan) are not? Why dont you go and ask them whether they want to take the exams or not? Patel, who had scored 61 per cent in the SSC exams three years back, would be missing the examinations for the third consecutive year. In case any special provision is made for these young cricketers, lot of other students may queue up citing various reasons other than sports, sources said. Meanwhile, Patels family said: Parthiv had completed all formalities for taking the board exams, but it is not possible now after his selection.  (PTI)  Copyright

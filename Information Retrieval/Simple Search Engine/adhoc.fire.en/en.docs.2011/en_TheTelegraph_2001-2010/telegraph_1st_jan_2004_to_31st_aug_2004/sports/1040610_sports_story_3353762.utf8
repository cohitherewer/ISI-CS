 Hicham feels hell be third time lucky
Zaragoza (Spain): Moroccan middle distance great Hicham El-Guerrouj believes his bid to land the 1500m Olympic gold medal will be realised at the third time of asking in Athens in August. Despite being favourite for the title in the past two Olympics, El-Guerrouj was beaten for gold in 2000 by Kenyas Noah Ngeny, having fallen at the bell in the 1996 final. But the four-time world champion served notice of his intentions once again by snatching victory in his maiden outing of the season here Tuesday. God willing, I hope that this time will be the right one, the 29-year-old El-Guerrouj said. Past expectations have weighed heavily on the shoulders of the athlete treated as a hero in Morocco. This time he believes he has found the right formula. I feel relieved compared to previous years. Im training for the joy of it, I run for my own pleasure. It will be third time lucky at the Games, El-Guerrouj explained. Im not particularly happy with the time but for a first outing the most important thing is to win. In Athens he will run the 1500m and 5000m double. Its now 10 years that Ive dominated over 1500m. God willing ..., added the 2003 mens athlete of the year.  (AFP)  Copyright

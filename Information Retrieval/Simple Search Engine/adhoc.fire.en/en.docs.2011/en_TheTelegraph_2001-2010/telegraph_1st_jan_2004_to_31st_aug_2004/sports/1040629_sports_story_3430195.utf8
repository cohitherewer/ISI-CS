 Peoples Sunday a must: Henman
 Henman says he will bring in the middle Sunday when he is chairman London: If Tim Henman had it his way, Wimbledon would stage a Peoples Sunday every year. Britains sole hope for glory at the grasscourt Grand Slam rode a wave of patriotic support past Hicham Arazi and into the fourth round on what was supposed to be a rest day on Sunday. Now he wants the club to play 14 days out of 14 every year. Its absolutely phenomenal. Im fortunate with the atmosphere, when I play here on the show courts, its great. But this is different, theres no doubting that, he said. Ill bring in the middle Sunday when Im chairman, he laughed. For the first time since 1997  and only the third time in the history of the tournament  Wimbledon organisers were forced to schedule play on the middle Sunday because of a backlog of games caused by two days lost to rain in the first week. Tickets were sold at the gate on a first-come, first-served basis so the more staid dignitary and corporate element of the weekday crowd was not present to dampen enthusiasm. Henman revelled in the atmosphere. Im so fortunate that Ive had that opportunity twice. I played in 97 and, you know, that was a pretty amazing match to win 14-12 in the fifth. And, likewise, today, you know, theyre true fans to be out there queuing. It was packed from the word go. Im sure theres going to be debate whether this should happen every year. And I can see from the clubs point of view that its a difficult thing to organise at the last minute, but from a playing point of view, its a privilege. I think its great. Im not in any way criticising the fans that come and support the other 13 days. But when you give those people the opportunity, and theyve queued, theyve paid, and, you know, they are obviously passionate about the game and supporting me, as it was, today, I think its something that I think could be capitalised on, to give them the opportunity of coming to the most prestigious tournament in the world. Everybody knows its not easy to get tickets for this event. I think its something thats worked unbelievably well. You know, unfortunately at the moment, its not for me to make the decision. But... when Im chairman, Ill bring it in, he smiled. Throughout the history of this tournament theres always been a tradition of the queuing, and it starts on Friday before the tournament. I think for the Sunday, it would be no different. In Paris they have a Kids Day on Wednesdays and they get a phenomenal turnout. Im sure its a good thing for the game over there. Perhaps this is something that we could use. However not everyone was thrilled by the atmosphere. As fans clamoured to get onto Centre Court to watch Henman beat Arazi, other courts were left sparsely populated. South Africas Wayne Ferreira was one who was disappointed, playing in his final Wimbledon. It was really disappointing there werent that many people out there, he said after losing on Court VII. What can you do about it? Even Court I was no way near full. Yeah, its strange, said womens fourth seed Amelie Mauresmo after beating Ludmila Cervanova. But I guess people maybe were not ready to come today and were not expecting that day to be a tennis day here at Wimbledon. So, pretty strange ...  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Verdict in a week
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Abhijit Kale in the city on SaturdayCalcutta, May 15: The disciplinary committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) concluded its hearing on the Abhijit Kale case after a marathon nine-hour session on Saturday. With one member (Kamal Morarka) of the three-man committee  the others being BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya and Ranbir Singh Mahendra  being absent, the panel didnt arrive at a verdict. A decision will be taken within a week. The committee will meet again either in person or through video or tele-conferencing and take a decision within seven days, said Dalmiya. Kale has been accused of bribing national selectors Pranab Roy and Kiran More to gain a Team India berth. The BCCI had asked the complainants, Roy and More, as well as Kale to produce witnesses at the next hearing. Kale was given an opportunity to cross-examine Roy and More and vice-versa, the BCCI president said after Saturdays hearing. More brought his wife as witness and Roy produced his friend Rajiv Gupta who resides in Mumbai. Both parties were examined and cross-examined, Dalmiya explained. A visibly tired Kale, who didnt bring any witness, refused to divulge details of the hearing. I have been asked not to speak. All I can say is I am satisfied with what happened. I am still confident of coming out of this.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Montgomery allowed to take part in US trials 
 Tim Montgomery believes he will not be treated fairly Sacramento (California): World 100m record holder Tim Montgomery and five other American athletes charged with doping offences can compete in this weeks US Olympic trials, the US Track amp; Field (USATF) said on Tuesday. The law of the United States is quite clear, USATF chief executive officer Craig Masback said during a teleconference. It says that unless someone has received a full due-process hearing and found to be ineligible, they must be allowed to compete. We do not intend to prevent them from competing in the trials. Montgomery, Olympic 400m silver medallist Alvin Harrison, former world indoor 200m champion Michelle Collins and former Olympic relay medallist Chrystie Gaines have been charged by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) with doping offences. None has failed a doping test. The charges are part of an investigation into BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), whose owners face charges of distributing drugs, including the designer steroid THG (tetrahydrogestrinone), to top-class sportsmen and women. World indoor 1,500-metre record holder Regina Jacobs failed a test for the previously undetectable THG, while Olympic 4x400-metre relay gold medallist Calvin Harrison tested positive for the stimulant modafinil, the US Olympic Committee (USOC) announced in January. All are awaiting hearings on the charges. Until those hearings, the six athletes remain eligible to compete for a spot on the US Olympic team. The team will be chosen during the American trials, which begin on Friday in Sacramento and end on July 18. The top three in each event will be eligible for the U.S. team, provided they have met Olympic qualifying standards. Under current policy, USATF will submit four names in each event to the US Olympic Committee (USOC) by July 19 for certification. The USOC must submit its roster for all sports to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by July 21. It will then be up to the IOC and, in the case of athletics, the IAAF to determine who will be allowed to compete in Athens. Meanwhile, the USADA has opted to take the case of Montgomery before the international Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The request comes a week after Montgomery, facing a possible lifetime ban, said that he would prefer that the case be examined directly by CAS and skip a US appeal. Montgomery believes that he would not be treated fairly by a US appeal after criticising the repeated leaking of confidential information, and what he claims are the USADAs changing standards of proof. He becomes the first athlete in USADAs three years of existence to skip the agencys arbitration system and go directly to the court of last appeal. USADA has modified American Arbitration Association rules to trim the list of arbitrators to 32 that are paid by USADA. CAS arbitrators are selected from among more than 150 arbitrators from 55 nations. USADAs arbitration system is being pressed on several fronts by athletes who face charges of doping based upon collected evidence rather than positive doping tests in the wake of a previously undetectable steroid being discovered.

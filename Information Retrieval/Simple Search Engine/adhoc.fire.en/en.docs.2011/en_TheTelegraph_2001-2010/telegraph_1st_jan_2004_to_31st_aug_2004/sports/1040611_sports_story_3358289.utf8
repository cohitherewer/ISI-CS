 Fleming completes 7th ton
 - FINAL TEST 
- Harmison brings England back in match after solid start by New Zealand  Stephen Fleming pushes one through the on side at Trent Bridge on Thursday London: Stephen Harmison took two wickets in two balls as England checked New Zealands progress in the third Test at Trent Bridge on Thursday. At stumps on the first day, New Zealand were still reasonably well-placed at 295 for four after winning the toss with captain Stephen Fleming making 117  his seventh Test century. Left-handed opener Mark Richardson weighed in with 73 while, at close, Scott Styris was unbeaten on 60 along with Jacob Oram on ten. England already have the series wrapped up at 2-0 after a seven-wicket victory at Lords and a nine-wicket win at Headingley. New Zealand are trying to avoid the fate of their 1978 predecessors who lost 3-0 in England  the last time England achieved a clean-sweep in a major Test series. Harmison, the spearhead of Englands attack with 15 wickets in the series already before play Thursday, pegged New Zealand back with the second new ball. He had dangerman Nathan Astle playing on for 15. Next ball, 272 for three became 273 for four when Craig McMillan, returning from a finger injury, was leg-before. That was the last ball of Harmisons over and he was on a hattrick at the start of his next when Styris almost edged a drive through to wicketkeeper Geraint Jones. New Zealand began the final session on 196 for one with Fleming 107 not out and Styris unbeaten on 12. But Fleming added just ten more before he edged allrounder Andrew Flintoff through to Graham Thorpe in the slips. England came back well and picked up some wickets but at the start of the day we would have settled for having almost 300 on the board by stumps, said Fleming who believes his teams defeat in the first two Tests are not a true reflection of the series. They have played extremely well and we havent underestimated them. I dont think we are too far off the pace. Its just at crucial times they have played a lot better. Fleming put on 62 with Styris to leave New Zealand 225 for two. But Styris carried on to a chanceless 50 off 86 balls with five fours. In four previous series innings Styris had managed a mere 44 runs. Up until Harmisons double strike, it had been a largely frustrating day for England with several appeals rejected by Australian umpires Simon Taufel and Daryl Harper. Harmison thought he had Richardson for 54 with a full-length ball that hit the batsmans back leg but Taufel was unmoved with New Zealand on 119. The tourists had added seven runs to their total when Flintoff had a leg-before shout against Fleming (64) playing no stroke also turned down by Taufel. Fleming then on-drove Giles for four and lofted him for six off successive balls to bring up New Zealands 150. England captain Michael Vaughan, an occasional off-spinner, brought himself on in a bid to break the partnership. But it was as a fielder that Vaughan ended the stand when Richardson chipped a catch straight to him at short mid-on off Giles. It was an unusually soft dismissal for the obdurate Richardson who had now batted for over 20 hours in the series. On Thursday he faced 169 balls with 11 fours, putting on 163 for the first wicket with Fleming. His captain kept going and reached his seventh Test hundred by turning Martin Saggers off his legs for six. Fleming, who faced 161 balls with two sixes and 12 fours, celebrated by punching the air having come close to a century with 97 in the second Test. England missed a chance for an early breakthrough when short-leg Strauss failed to hold on to a right-handed chance offered by Richardson off Harmison when New Zealand were 11 without loss.

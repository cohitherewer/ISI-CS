The Telegraph - Calcutta
I have not changed much
- Sachin turns 31 today
 Sachin Tendulkar, who will turn 31 on Saturday, arrives to inaugurate a school in Mumbai on Friday. (Reuters)Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar, who turns 31 on Saturday, said on the eve of his birthday that he has not changed his game much nor has age affected his approach towards it. I dont think I have changed much. Maybe a little bit here and there as you cannot change the original game you have, he told reporters. The batting maestro, who has played 447 international matches in his 15-year career so far, called reporters at his residence at short notice and cut a cake on his birthday-eve. On his performance in the just-concluded series against Pakistan, he said: Probably I could have performed better. But as a whole I am satisfied with the performance as the team won both the one-day and Test series. I still feel young like when I started of as a Test player. But it is a sort of in-between age (31), neither young nor old, Tendulkar said. He thanked his fans for their support and said the fact, that his birthday was celebrated in such a manner every year, was a great feeling. I am really surprised that each year April 24 is made out to be an event. But it is a great feeling and I would take this opportunity to thank my fans.  (PTI)  Copyright

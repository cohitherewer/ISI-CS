The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak media praises India 
Islamabad: Dubbed as chokers before arriving in Pakistan, the Indian cricketers on Sunday were praised by the Pakistan media for holding their nerves. Pakistan team captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, meanwhile, was both showered with brickbats for putting India in to bat and lauded for his superb century. After the first encounter between the two sides in almost a year, one thing was quite obvious: this Indian side does not panic even when it is pushed to the wall. That perhaps explains its improved success rate and enhanced reputation, said The Nation about Saturdays first ODI in Karachi. It said that it was some remarkable bowling by India in the final overs that saw Pakistan lose. Had Pakistan won, it would have been a world record. No team has made as many runs batting second in a one-day International. But that was not to be, the paper added. The newspaper bemoaned the failure of wicketkeeper-batsman Moin Khan to repeat history by hitting the last ball for a six  Javed Miandad did just that in Sharjah, 1986. Like Miandad who lifted Indian medium pacer, Chetan Sharma in Sharjah to give Pakistan an unbelievable victory, Moin Khan also tried to heave the last ball from Ashish Nehra out of the ground but he only succeeded in ballooning it to Zaheer Khan to herald the victory celebrations in the Indian camp, the paper said. The Nation also came down hard on Inzamam  who made amends with a brilliant 122  for opting to bowl on a beauty of a batting wicket. India posted 349 for seven after Inzamam blundered by inviting the opponent to take the first use of a placid wicket after winning the toss, it said. The newspaper also castigated Shoaib Akthar and Mohammed Sami for their failure to make early inroads into the Indian batting. (PTI)  Copyright

 Missing Masters stars face cash cut
 Roddick cited schedule incompatibility for his last-minute pullout Monaco: Mens tennis superstars could be hit where it hurts most  in the pocket  if the big names continue to snub the games top meets. Tournament chiefs are to meet to discuss changes to the rules governing player participation in the elite nine Masters events, the next stage down from the four Grand Slams. The idea was prompted here by the absence of some of the sports top draw cards. World No. 1 Roger Federer and veteran Andre Agassi both announced before the start of the Monte Carlo Masters they would not take part. Then, on the morning of the first day, it was confirmed that US Open champion Andy Roddick, who was to be top seed, would also be skipping the event citing schedule incompatibility. His place in the draw was taken by 33-year-old Australian Wayne Arthurs who couldnt even make it through the qualifying rounds. I was sure Roddick wouldnt come, said Patrice Dominguez, the deputy tournament director here who also sits on the ATP Board of Directors. Roddick was playing in Houston the week before Monte Carlo and was joined on the sidelines by fellow Americans Mardy Fish and James Blake, their places also filled by qualifying flops. We believe that the rule which obliges players to register in a Masters Series six weeks before should be changed and we will have a meeting with the Players Council at the French Open next month,added Dominguez. We have failed to convince all of the players to support the best events. The time will come when our reaction will have to be: We are entertainment producers. If I did the Woodstock rock festival and I paid for ten bands and only five came, Id pay only for five not ten. My proposal would be if the top ten players are missing, we will reduce the prize money. So lets make a deal. How many players should play the Masters Series? Eight? Nine? Ten out of ten is difficult. You can have a real injury, I respect that. But lets say seven. If the agreement was eight or nine, then we pay $100,000 less. We always commit ourselves to put the prize money on the table; the players dont commit themselves. We have to find a fair balance to the calendar, we have to work on the format. As well as prize money reduction, its understood another idea discussed was to prevent a player from taking part in the highly-lucrative, season-ending Masters Cup if they have skipped three of the nine Masters events. Look at Michael Schumacher in motor racing, added Dominguez. He may be world champion in August but he still races in September and October because he has a commitment. For the money we are putting on, I think the commitment must be accepted by everyone. The players do whatever they want because there is no penalty. Thats a pity because we should protect the best events. For TV, this is crucial.  (AFP)  Copyright

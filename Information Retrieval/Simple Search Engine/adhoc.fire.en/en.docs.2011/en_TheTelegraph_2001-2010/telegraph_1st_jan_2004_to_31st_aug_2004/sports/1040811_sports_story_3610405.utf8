 Fischer shifted to new centre
 Bobby Fischer Tokyo: US chess master Bobby Fischer has been transferred to a new longer-term detention centre in Japan as his bid to avoid deportation to the United States drags on, officials and his lawyer said on Tuesday. Fischer, 61, has been held in a temporary detention centre at Tokyos Narita airport since July 13 after trying to board a flight to the Philippines using a passport which US officials said had been revoked. The Narita immigration facility is for short-term detainees. So Mr Fischer is being moved to another centre, where a longer-term stay is allowed, Masako Suzuki, the lawyer representing Fischer said. Fischer was moved to an immigration facility in Ushiku, 60 kilometres northeast of Tokyo, an immigration official at Narita confirmed. The chess genius has appealed against deportation to Japans justice minister, while separately seeking refugee status from Japan. Washington has sought to arrest Fischer since 1992 when he defied an international embargo on travel to the former Yugoslavia to earn more than $ 3 million for defeating his Russian-born chess arch-rival Boris Spassky. The US issued a notice dated December 11, 2003, from its Manila embassy saying Fischers passport had been revoked. But Fischer did not know about the letter and so missed a deadline to appeal, his supporters have said. On July 13 the immigration office at Japans Narita airport retroactively cancelled the entry permit it had given Fischer on April 15.  (AFP)  Copyright

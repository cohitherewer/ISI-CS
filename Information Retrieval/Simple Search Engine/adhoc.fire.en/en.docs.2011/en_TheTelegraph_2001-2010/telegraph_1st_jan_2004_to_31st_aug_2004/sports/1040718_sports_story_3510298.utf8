		 Sunday, July 18, 2004  Star Of Windsor for Leger 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore, July 17: The three horses most likely to be involved at the finish for the 2,800m Bangalore St. Leger here tomorrow, a terms affair for four-year-olds in the last classic of the season, are Star Of Windsor, Road Runner and Own Vision. However, going by Star Of Windsors last run when he came from far back to be placed a good third to Adrian in the Maharajas Cup, the S. Ganapathy-ward with Mark Gallagher in the saddle, is tipped to win the trophy.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2 pm: Sweet Victory 1. Saoirse 2.

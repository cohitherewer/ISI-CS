The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Top talents to lock horns
 - STATE ATHLETICS - 950 competitors in fray from 35 teams  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Soma Biswas Calcutta: Top athletes of the state, like Soma Biswas, Mukti Saha, Pinki Pramanik, Manisha Mondal, Aruna Devi, Sanjay Rai and Hari Shankar Roy will be seen in action in the 54th state athletics championships to be held at the SAI, Eastern Centre and the Salt Lake Stadium from June 3 to 6. Even with sprinters Saraswati Saha and Amit Saha away at the national camp for the Olympic Games, the meet will showcase ample talent. Soma, incidentally, is still going hard for a heptathlon berth. There will also be a clutch of pretty talented juniors who could shine on the national athletic horizon in the years to come. Among them are Pinki, Susmita Singha Roy, Bachu Durlav and others. There will be as many as 950 athletes in fray from 35 teams, in 147 events (including 16 relays) in ten age-groups, it was announced at a press meet here Monday. The meet is being sponsored, among others, by ABP Pvt. Ltd, Allahabad Bank, Anmol Biscuits, Sintex Industries and Taratala Soft Drinks, making up most of the Rs 5 lakh budget. The throw events, as usual, will be held at the SAI, the football ground at the Salt Lake Stadium remaining untouchable. That will again break up the championships, a situation that the organisers, Amateur Athletic Association, West Bengal, wanted to avoid. Last year East Bengal, with 144 points, were the mens champions, while Eastern Railway, with 96 points, were the womens toppers. The boys (U-20) section was the mainstay of North 24 Parganas, while girls U-20 was ruled by The City Athletic Club and North 25 Parganas. Testing facility Meanwhile, Mr Arun Banerjee, vice-president of the AAFI, said that he expects that the Indian dope testing laboratory will soon be recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations. That is far from being an accredited testing centre, but is it is a first step towards it, especially with India hosting the Commonwealth Games. Last year, we had, overall, around 450 athletes on the suspension list (all age-groups and categories combined), he said. Last season itself, we had suspended 52 (of who some are back in fray). Banerjee believes that by the time the last trial (the inter-state meet in Chennai from July 18 to 20), nobody in the Indian contingent will be left untested, and that it will be a clean contingent. Testing in Athens will be extremely strict, especially with the recent exposes of Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery (after Kelli White) in scandals.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stevens stands down for Thorpe
 Thorpe free to defend 400m title Sydney: Ian Thorpe will be free to defend his 400m freestyle title at the Athens Olympics after teammate Craig Stevens announced on Monday he was pulling out of the event. In one of the worst-kept secrets in Australian sport, Stevens confirmed he was giving up his spot to Thorpe so he could concentrate on his other events. My decision is to stand aside in the 400m, Stevens said in an interview on Monday. The decision thats been made has come from the heart. Thorpes hopes of swimming the 400m appeared to have sunk when he was disqualified for a false start after slipping off the blocks during last months Australian trials.He lost an appeal against his disqualification but was thrown an unexpected lifeline when his friend Stevens, who finished second to Grant Hackett at the trials, said he would consider surrendering his place. Stevens had also qualified for his specialist event, the 1500m, as well as the 4x200 relay, and said he wanted to concentrate on those races. I was just hoping to qualify for one event at the Olympic Games so three was something I didnt expect, he said. This has been a difficult decision...and theres been a lot of stress and a lot of assumptions. But he (Thorpe) said to me, its up to you, its your choice, Ill support you whatever you do. Hes not the sort of person who would put pressure on anyone. The saga dragged on for almost a month with opinion split on what Stevens should do. Australian Olympic officials consulted their lawyers and Stevens management team negotiated an exclusive deal to make the announcement live on Australian television. There was no immediate response from Thorpe after Stevens made his decision public but Australian swimming officials said he was likely to hold a news conference on Tuesday. Thorpe also qualified for the 100m and 20m as well as the three relays but the 400m is his best event and he is considered a near-certainty to win in Athens. A national hero after winning three gold medals at Sydney Games, Thorpe is the reigning Olympic and world 400m champion and has not been beaten for seven years. (Reuters)  Copyright

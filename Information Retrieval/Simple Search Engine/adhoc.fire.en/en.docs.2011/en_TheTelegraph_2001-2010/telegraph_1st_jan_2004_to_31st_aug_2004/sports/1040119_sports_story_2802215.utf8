The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Top-seed jinx in even field
 - Many to challenge Roddick l Clijsters joins race to emerge new champion  World No. 1 Andy Roddick during a practice session in Melbourne on Sunday. (Reuters) Melbourne: Andy Roddick must defy the curse of top-seed status to land back-to-back Grand Slam titles at the Australian Open, getting underway on Monday. The exciting 21-year-old American broke down in tears after winning the US Open overwhelming Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final for his first Grand Slam title last September. He became the youngest American to finish world No. 1 and second only to Australian Lleyton Hewitt (20 years), but with it comes increasing pressure to perform. Roddick may be one of the hottest players in mens tennis, but A-Rod must triumph against the odds to carry off the Australian Open crown. Of the 35 Australian Opens since the start of the open era in 1969, only ten top seeds have won the years first Grand Slam tournament, the last being Andre Agassi, when he beat Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 2000. Roddick is also attempting to become the first player since Agassi in 2000 to win consecutive Grand Slam meets. Agassi won the US Open and Australian Open back-to-back in 1999-2000. Roddick was one of three first-time Grand Slam winners last year  Ferrero at the French Open and Roger Federer at Wimbledon champion  and along with an in-form Hewitt, the former world No. 1, and Argentinian David Nalbandian, there is a real buzz about mens singles this year. Nalbandian, who is nursing a wrist injury, burst into calculations with a 6-2, 6-3 rout of Agassi to take the Kooyong International title on Saturday, while Hewitt won the Sydney International. Roddick, who will face Chiles Fernando Gonzalez in the first round, has flowered under the guidance of one of the master craftsmen of tennis, Brad Gilbert, former coach of Agassi. The pair hooked up after a painful first-round defeat at Roland Garros, with Roddick proceeding to run down the opposition on hardcourts with back-to-back Masters Series titles capped by his US Open victory. If anything, the year I just had has inspired me more, said Roddick, who won 72 matches while losing only 19 on the way to his first Grand Slam trophy along with five other titles. Agassi, with four Australian Open titles in seven visits, is the one for the younger guns to beat, but there are more quality contenders gunning for the 33-year-old American great than in recent years. Hes won his last three Australian Opens and is on an unbeaten 21-match streak in this tournament. Only five players in history have won more Grand Slam titles than Agassis eight  Pete Sampras tops it with 14 followed by Roy Emerson (12), Bjorn Borg (11), Rod Laver (11) and Bill Tilden (10).

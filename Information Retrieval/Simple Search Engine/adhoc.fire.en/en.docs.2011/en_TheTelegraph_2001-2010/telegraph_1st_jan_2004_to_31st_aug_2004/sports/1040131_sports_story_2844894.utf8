The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shaharyar talks, BCCI mum
	 - ISSUE OF INDIA PLAYING IN KARACHI AND PESHAWAR  BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: While the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may eventually ask for one or two changes in the itinerary for the forthcoming tour forwarded by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) last week, it has consciously been maintaining a no comments position on the issue. The PCB chairman, Shaharyar Khan, though, appears to have complicated things by accepting that there could be differences over two venues  Karachi and Peshawar. Khan said as much to a news agency in Islamabad on Friday. According to The Telegraphs sources, the BCCI had specifically asked the PCB not to talk about the itinerary till it was mutually approved. For now, that has been breached. Not surprisingly, however, the BCCI presidents office (in Calcutta) said: There was no immediate comment. In any case, a three-member delegation will soon be visiting Pakistan to assess (among other things) security. PTI adds from Islamabad: Khan, meanwhile, brushed aside criticism over the delay in working out the schedule, discounting reports that no schedule has been worked out so far. Khan said it had been tentatively decided that the Indian team would arrive on March 3. They would play a three-day practice match before the first Test, expected to be played on March 11. The remaining two Tests would be played after a three-day break in between, followed by ODIs. The issue of Karachi and Peshawar came up and Khan conceded there could be some differences over these venues vis--vis security. Karachi and Peshawar have been deprived of cricket and should get their due. What we would like to absolutely make it clear is that Karachi and Peshawar have not had had any cricket, Khan said. People there (in India) are rightly concerned. But in our discussions with the Indian security team we will adjust in a spirit of give and take. That is another reason why the schedule has not been announced, he said. Once again promising to accord the level of security being provided to US President George Bush and President Pervez Musharraf to the Indian cricketers, Khan said this was one aspect which was being looked into by PCB in earnest. They will be accorded VVIP security. The only flip side to it is that they cannot go shopping and sight-seeing. I can understand your boys feeling nervous. Our boys are nervous too. Let your team come here and see I am sure they will relaxed, he said while recounting how the Pakistan team overcame anxiety when it last visited India in 1999 amid threats of Shiv Sena disrupting the series. But the moment we landed at Palam Airport, we realised the level of security. The security was so tight that Indian security officials dressed in Pakistani blazers travelled in dummy bus through the normal route while our cricketers were taken through a different route, said Khan who had accompanied the team as manager. After seeing all this our boys felt very relaxed. The Indian team will feel the same way when it arrives here. I can assure you. Khan also promised to prevail on the Pakistan government to allow Indian fans to cross over from Wagah border.  Copyright

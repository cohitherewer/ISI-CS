 Weve matured since Korea: Vieri
Lisbon, June 12 (Reuters): Christian Vieri thinks Italys defensive reputation is history and that the current Azzurri squad has matured since their World Cup disappointment in 2002. We are not a defensive side. We play with two strikers and two wide men who are effectively strikers as well. We will be playing to win, on the attack but attacking in the right way, the striker said on Saturday. Italy, who were knocked out of the World Cup in the second round by South Korea two years ago, face Denmark in their Group C opener on Monday. We are in good shape and after Korea we have matured a lot. Weve been training well and we are fired up and ready for a good championship, he said. Asked what counted as a good result in the meet for Italy, Vieri said expectations were always high. Every time we are at a European Championship or World Cup, we have to win. From our part there is no problem with being among the favourites, he added. Vieri has endured five winless years with Inter Milan unlike his Juventus and AC Milan teammates, who have claimed Italian and European honours but the striker said all the Azzurri squad were in the same boat at international level. None of us has won anything with the national side, so in that sense we are all on the same level and we all have a great desire to do well, said Vieri. The Inter forwards partnership with Francesco Totti is key to Italys chances and when the pair has played together in friendlies and qualifying matches they have shown a great understanding. Vieri said it mattered little to him exactly where Totti played because the Roma man had licence to find space to exploit.  Copyright

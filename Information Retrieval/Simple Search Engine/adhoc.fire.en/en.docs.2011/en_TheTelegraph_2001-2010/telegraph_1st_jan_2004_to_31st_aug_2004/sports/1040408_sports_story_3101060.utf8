 Mahindra hold Al Wahda
 Kalyan Chowbey made at least three good saves Margao: A brilliant Kalyan Chowbey under the bar and a dogged spirit in the rearguard helped former Durand Cup champions Mahindra United hold Syrian club Al Wahda goalless in their AFC Cup clash here on Wednesday. Al Wahda, who had more of the ball, came close to scoring on several occasions but were thwarted by Mahindra custodian Kalyan Chowbey, who made at least three good saves. The post also came to the home teams rescue in the second half as Moutassem Alayas shot hit the cross bar before defender Covan Lawerence made a goalline save off Whalid Al Sharif in injury time. Mahindra, who had beaten Dhoffar of Oman in their earlier match, now have four points from two matches. Al Wahda, who drew against Dhoffar, have collected two points from two outings.Both teams looked on a par in the first half. Al Wahda appeared more penetrative as Maher Alsayed and Nabil Alshehmeh combined well to trouble the rival defence frequently. The Syrian club had the first clear chance in the 18th minute when Maher Alsayed and Mousa Traqouri split the defence with a wall pass before the former shot straight to Chowbey from close range. Mahindra, who relied more on counter attacks, tried to break into the rival defence with long overhead passes and had two close chances. Felix failed to control his shot and ended up firing over and later, Patrons shot was blocked by Al Wahda keeper custodian Badderddin Azowar. Al Wahda kept up the pressure and got another chance to score in the dying minutes of the first half but Chowbey blocked Maher Alsayeds shot. (PTI)  Copyright

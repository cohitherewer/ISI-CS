The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. eye full points today 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: A draw against Mohun Bagan has done Mohammedan Sporting footballers a world of good. Their confidence has suddenly shot up and you can sense a spring in their steps. The footballers seem dead serious about the task on hand on the eve of their National League return leg tie against Indian Bank on Thursday. A win is must for the hosts to stay in contention for a berth in the elite division next season. Both Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami have 10 points and are languishing at the bottom half, just above Indian Bank. Tollygunge, however, enjoy a better goal difference and are placed 10th. The teams first-leg encounter had ended in goalless. The team spirit is good and after managing to hold Mohun Bagan we are determined not to look back, Dipendu Biswas said on Wednesday. Coach Jamshed Nassiri is also looking to capitalise on the teams new-found confidence level and eyes a win. Abu Bakar Godwin and Okoli Onyeka Odafa will also be available. Last-ranked Indian Bank have two points from 12 games.  Copyright

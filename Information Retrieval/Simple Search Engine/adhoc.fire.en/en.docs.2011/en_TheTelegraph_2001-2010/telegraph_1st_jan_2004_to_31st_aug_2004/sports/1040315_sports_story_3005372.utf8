The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Title for Lin Dan
Birmingham: Chinas Lin Dan won the All-England badminton title on Sunday for the first time, beating 1999 champion Peter Gade 9-15, 15-5, 15-8 in a high-class final. The womens singles title went to former world champion Gong Ruina, who beat defending champion Zhou Mi 11-7, 11-7. Lin struggled to find a rhythm early on but powered through the second set and then led 14-3 in the decider as Gade battled to keep pace. The Dane managed to stave off one match point at 14-4 and then staged a mini-rally but Lin finished it off in 77 minutes with a cross-court smash. Gade, 27, getting close to his best after a serious knee injury which kept him out of the sport for more than a year, was far from disgraced and both men look to be serious medal contenders at Augusts Olympics in Athens. A sell-out crowd of 4,500 thrilled to the tussle but were disappointed to learn the womens doubles later in the day would be a walkover. In an all-Chinese final, top seeds Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen were due to meet titleholders Gao Ling and Huang Sui but Zhang pulled out with a hamstring injury. It was the third time Gao and Huang had benefited from the same opponents in such a way in a major final in the last six months, most recently a week ago in the Swiss Open.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal back on top 
 - Oliveira hattrick as Valencia drub Malaga 6-1 London: Arsenal returned to the top of the Premier League with a hard-fought 2-1 home win over Manchester City on Sunday as Chelsea kept up the pressure on the leaders with a 3-2 victory at Blackburn Rovers. An own goal by City defender Michael Tarnat and a sumptuous late strike by Thierry Henry left Arsenal two points ahead of United, with Chelsea just four points further back in third place following Glen Johnsons spectacular winner. Arsenal dominated a rain-swept match at Highbury and broke the deadlock after 39 minutes when Henrys teasing cross was turned in from close range by Tarnat, under pressure from Freddie Ljungberg. City, without a victory in 12 Premier League games and lying 15th in the table, defended bravely but rarely threatened Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann. Citys French striker Nicolas Anelka pulled a goal back in the dying seconds but was immediately sent off against his former club following an altercation with Ashley Cole. On Saturday, Aston Villa scored five goals to thrash Leicester City 5-0 away on Saturday. It was a bad day all round for Leicester keeper Ian Walker, who was involved in an incident in the second half when he shoved a Leicester fan to the ground after he ran onto the pitch and towards the England man just after Darius Vassell got the third in the 60th minute. Louis Saha scored on his Manchester United debut as the champions beat Southampton 3-2 at Old Trafford. In Primera Liga, Brazilian striker Ricardo Oliveira grabbed his second hattrick of the season as Valencia made a spectacular return to form with a 6-1 win at Malaga that sent them to the top of the table on Saturday. Valencia, who lost 0-1 at home last weekend to Osasuna and were then dumped out of the Kings Cup by Real Madrid, lead the standings by a point from Real. Deportivo Coruna are a further six points back, while Atletico Madrid retained the final Champions League berth after scrambling to a late 1-1 draw at home to Osasuna, who remain in fifth. At the other end of the table, Celta Vigo slipped to a 0-1 defeat at Real Betis that leaves them just a point above the danger zone.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

Leading is Gaurav Gill (64 points), followed by Ghosh (49), Rayomand Banajee (37) and Gaurav Dalal (36), according to information reaching here. With Ghosh pulling away from the rest of the field in the first race, Gill from Delhi and last years champion Dalal from Chennai fought it out for second and third positions.

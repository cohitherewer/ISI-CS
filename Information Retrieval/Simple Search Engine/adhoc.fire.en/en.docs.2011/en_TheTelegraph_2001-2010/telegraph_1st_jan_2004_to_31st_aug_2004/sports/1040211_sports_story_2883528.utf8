 Asprilla planning move to China
 Asprilla is hoping to revive career Shanghai: Flamboyant Colombian striker Faustino Asprilla is due in Shanghai this week for tryouts with Chinese teams, the latest ageing soccer star who hopes to revive a flagging career by playing in China. A veteran of Columbias 1994 and 1998 World Cup finals appearances, Asprilla planned to arrive in Chinas commercial hub Wednesday, according to US Sports Management, which is representing the player. During his stay, he will train, undergo physical exams and discuss a potential contract with Chinese clubs, the company said. Asprilla, 34, played with Chilean side Universidad de Chile for six months last year, but has since been without a team. A 2002 agreement to play with British third-division side Darlington fell apart when Asprilla suddenly left the country to take up a more lucrative offer with a team in Saudi Arabia. The inconsistent but sometimes brilliant striker played for Parma then spent two seasons with Newcastle before moving on to a series of Latin American teams, including Mexican side Atlante. In 2000, Brazilian club Palmeiras rescinded Asprillas contract after he was arrested and accused of possessing and firing an illegal weapon. Five years earlier, he grabbed headlines for pumping several pistol rounds into the air outside a disco in the Caribbean resort of Cartagena.  (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara may play second ODI
Port-of-Spain: West Indies captain Brian Lara may return from injury earlier than expected to lead his team against England in this weekends back-to-back one-day Internationals. Lara dislocated the little finger on his right hand in the first Test six weeks ago, but continued playing and hit a record 400 not out in the final Test in Antigua 10 days ago. Doctors advised Lara to rest the injury for a further 10 days, ruling him out of the first one-day game in Guyana last Sunday and making him doubtful for both games in his home country of Trinidad. However, after three days spent accepting numerous accolades for his achievements in Antigua, he joined his colleagues for training on Wednesday morning. Although he did not bat, he could now return for Saturdays second game. Brian is very hopeful of playing in both games, West Indies media liaison Imran Khan said, adding that a final decision on his fitness would be made on Friday morning, 24 hours before the second game in the seven-match series. Lara was expected to play in a charity golf tournament on Wednesday with players from West Indies and England, a commitment criticised by former West Indies fast bowler Colin Croft.

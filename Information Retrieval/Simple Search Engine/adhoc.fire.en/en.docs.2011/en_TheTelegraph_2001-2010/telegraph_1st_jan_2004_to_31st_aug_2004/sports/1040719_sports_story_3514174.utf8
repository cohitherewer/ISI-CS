 Tired Marion vows to prove form
 Marion Jones announces her reasons for pulling out of the womens 200m in Sacramento on Saturday. (AFP) Sacramento: Marion Jones stopped running and started talking here, putting a happy face upon a disappointing season that remains clouded by an ongoing doping investigation. Reigning Olympic champion Jones withdrew from the 200m semi-finals at the United States Olympic athletics trials. She qualified for the Athens Games only in the long jump after placing fifth in 11.14 seconds in the 100m final. Im extremely disappointed, Jones said. You are supposed to run your best when its most important. But Jones, who is eligible for relays, warns that she plans on winning multiple medals at Athens and returning to the form that brought five medals at the 2000 Sydney Games, including gold at 100m, 200m and the 4x400m relay. Im extremely optimistic that when this year is over and I end on a high note with gold medals, I can regroup and come back better, Jones said. This down year will provide me motivation to prove to the world I still have it, that Im not this old, shriveled-up mother that can only run 11.14, that Im still able to get it done. Jones plans to run July 30 at Crystal Palace but will skip next weekends meet in Paris. She also said she plans to run another European meet that she would not name, but it is likely the August 6 Golden League meet in Zurich. Jones, 28, broke a week of silence after ending her hopes of defending the 200m crown, saying she was too tired to run well. My reasoning for pulling out of the 200 is simply fatigue, Jones said. There is no other issue. There are no other reasons. I woke up this morning and I was tired. If I cant give 100 per cent Im not going out there. Jones said the mental stress of being investigated by the USADA for doping violations, was not a factor. I understand there has been a lot going on, she said. (AFP)  Copyright

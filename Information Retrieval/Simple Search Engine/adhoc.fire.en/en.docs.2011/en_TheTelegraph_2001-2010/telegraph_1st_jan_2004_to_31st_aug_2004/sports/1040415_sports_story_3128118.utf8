The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Neville hits the winner
London: Gary Neville was Manchester Uniteds unlikely match-winner as they laboured to beat lowly Leicester City 1-0 and edge closer to second-placed Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday. The 29-year-old defender drilled the ball home from close range early in the second half at Old Trafford after a defensive mix-up. United remained third with 68 points, with Chelsea on 71 and leaders Arsenal on 78. Alex Fergusons side, however, have six matches left to Chelseas five. Leicester remained one off the bottom. I think some of us had our boots on the wrong feet tonight, Neville told Sky Sports after his sides disappointing display. But Im just delighted we won  we want to get as near as Arsenal as we can. Tuesdays other match between Leeds United, also stuck in the relegation zone, and Everton ended 1-1. Manchester United, without injured skipper Roy Keane, lacked any real fire for most of the game and almost gifted the visitors the lead in the second minute when keeper Roy Carroll cleared a back pass from John OShea straight to Muzzy Izzet inside the box. The Leicester midfielder was so surprised, however, that he dragged his shot wide when it looked easier to score. The home sides best early chance came after 16 minutes when Louis Saha chested down a neat chip from Neville but then, the hard work done, blasted well wide. The game finally came to life on 56 minutes. Ronaldo, unmarked on the left, dragged a weak shot across goal only for the ball to bounce off defender Nikos Dabizas and pop up invitingly for Neville to fire the ball low into the net. The England internationals last Premier League goal was against Aston Villa in January, 2001. Asked if he could remember that strike, he said: Was it against Aston Villa? It was a bit of an own goal as well. At Elland Road, Wayne Rooney put Everton in front after 13 minutes with a right-foot shot from around 20 metres and they held on to that lead after keeper Nigel Martyn denied Alan Smith with two fine saves just before the break. James Milner equalised, however, five minutes into the second half with another long-range shot.  (Reuters)  Copyright

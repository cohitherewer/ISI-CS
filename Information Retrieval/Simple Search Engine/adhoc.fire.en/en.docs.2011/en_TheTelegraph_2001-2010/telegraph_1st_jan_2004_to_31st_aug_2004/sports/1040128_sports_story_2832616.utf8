The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East lift Deodhar Trophy
 - Central crash to 142-run defeat as Dhoni, Shukla make merry  FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Sourashish provided three vital breakthroughs Jamshedpur: Excellent knock by opener M.S. Dhoni, coupled with a few good spells by Sanjib Sanyal and Sourashish Lahiri helped East Zone crush Central by 142 runs and clinch the Deodhar Trophy at the Keenan Stadium on Tuesday. East emerged champion by virtue of winning all their four matches. Electing to bat first after winning the toss, East Zone rode an excellent opening partnership of 108 runs of 89 balls to post a record total of 324 for four. Openers Nikhil Haldipur and Dhoni scored 52 and 114 runs respectively. They were well supported by Devang Gandhi (31), L.R. Shukla (55 n.o.,) and Kiran Pawar (35). Easts total surpassed the previous highest of 320 for four in 47.4 overs scored by West Zone against East in 1999/2000. Central were never in the picture once they were reduced to 88 for four after 15 overs. Railways allrounder J.P. Yadav resisted the East onslaught with a 65-ball 50 that included four boundaries. Yadav collected valuable 41 runs for the fourth wicket with Devendra Bundela (29). Bundela hit six fours during his 24-ball knock, before medium-pacer Laxmi Ratan Shukla bowled him. Yadav then added 33 runs with Alind Naidu (13) for the fifth wicket, before being caught by R Satish off Lahiri. Sanyal and Lahiri maintianed a superb line and length to fetch three wickets each. Central Zone, having earned three points from three matches, would play against West on January 31 at Agartala to complete the league chart. Earlier, Nikhil Haldipur (52) and Dhoni (114, 12x4, 3x6) confidently negotiated the opposition attack led by Sumit Mathur and J.P. Yadav. Haldipur, at the other end, gave Dhoni ample support before the former dragged a delivery from seamer C.S. Atram on to his stumps. Haldipurs 52 came of 49 balls and was studded with ten hits to the fence. Skipper Devang Gandhi then joined Dhoni but failed to last long as he misread a delivery off J.P. Yadav and returned a simple catch. Gandhi scored 31 including four hits to the ropes facing 37 deliveries. Central employed as many as six bowlers to restrict Easts onslaught but could not contain the free-scoring Dhoni. Dhoni and Kiran Pawar, who stepped in after Gandhis departure, put together 61 runs for the third wicket before Pawar holed out a simple catch to Yadav off Abbas Ali. Pawar contributed 35 off 36 balls, which included four boundaries. Dhoni then put on 74 runs for the fourth wicket with Laxmi Ratan Shukla who scored an unbeaten 55 off 50 balls with five boundaries.  Munaf wrecks North Fine spells by Munaf Patel (three for 23) and Nilesh Kulkarni (two for 18) helped West Zone beat North by six wickets in another match at the S.M. Dev Stadium on Tuesday, adds PTI from Silchar. Electing to bat after winning the toss, North Zone made 160 for eight in 50 overs. West were hardly pressed as they cruised to the target in just 37.5 overs for the loss of four wickets. North, led by Ajay Jadeja and with the likes of Akash Chopra in their team, presented a pathetic batting display on an unpredictable pitch. Chopra could muster only 11 runs while Jadeja, back to cricket after a long wait, scored only one. Patel and Kulkarni were the pick of the West Zone bowlers while spinner Ramesh Pawar chipped in with a valuable 45/2. Mithun Minhas was the highest scorer for North with 44. Replying to Norths 160, West Zone had a solid start before for off spinner Sarandeep Singh had both the openers Satyajit Parab (38) and Vinayak Mane (29), but Niraj Patel (33 n.o.,) and Ranjit Khirid (30 n.o.,) ensured that there were no hiccups for their side and overtook the score in only 37.5 overs. BRIEF SCORES: North Zone 160/ 8 in 50 ovs (Minhas 44, Ratra 36; Singh 2/26). West Zone 161/4 in 37.5 ovs (Patel 33 n.o., Parab 38; Patel 3/23, Kulkarni 2/18). West Zone won by 6 wkts.  Copyright

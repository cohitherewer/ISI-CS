 Muralis feat will fire up Warne: Buchanan
 The battle between Murali and Warne is exhilarating stuff, feels Buchanan Brisbane: Muttiah Muralidharans world record number of wickets has fired up Australian Shane Warne to seize it off him, Australian coach John Buchanan said on Monday. The Sri Lankan off-spinner set a new world record of 521 Test wickets last week against Zimbabwe in Harare to break the previous mark of 519 set by West Indian paceman Courtney Walsh. Buchanan said he expected Muralis record will further fuel the fire of Warne, currently playing in England with Hampshire. Hes just an exciting player as weve seen in the recent Sri Lankan-Australia series, Buchanan said of Murali. The battle between him and Warne and our batsmen is exhilarating stuff. Once our series (in Zimbabwe) is finished, hopefully there will be another head-to-head in Darwin and Cairns (in July). Buchanan, who has supported Muralis suspect bowling action in the past, defended the rubber-wristed bowlers right to use the doosra in a six-week non-reporting period. The delivery, which turns away from right-handed batsmen, was scientifically deemed a throw last month after tests in Perth where it was found that Murali straightened his bent arm by ten degrees. That is twice the limit tolerated for spinners under International Cricket Council (ICC) by-laws governing throwing. Hes a class bowler and class bowlers should be able to bowl how they see fit, Buchanan said during a three-day Australian preparation camp for the Zimbabwe tour. The ICC has cleared him from any suspect action. Obviously they have reviewed him recently but thats been more of a grease and oil change more then anything else. Buchanan said the Australian side, to play two Tests and three one-day Internationals, would conduct their four-week tour with a clear conscience despite the fragile political climate in Zimbabwe. Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill did not make himself available on moral grounds for the tour and senior batsman Darren Lehmann has admitted the Australian players have concerns about touring. But Buchanan played down the concerns. I wouldnt think there is any concern, Buchanan said. Cricket Australia and virtually all the information we have from a security point of view has allayed all fears. Im sure every player and all of us think about the issues and have come their own conclusions but in the end were invited there as cricketers. The ten home-based members of the Australian Test team leave on Thursday for Zimbabwe where they will meet up with Warne, Lehmann and Michael Kasprowicz, who will travel from England where they are playing county cricket.

 Nothing went right for us, rues Paes
 Bhupathi and Paes during their semi-final against Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schuettler on Thursday Athens: Disappointment was writ large on Leander Paes visage. Carrying the golden hopes of over a billion, he and Mahesh Bhupathi suffered an unexpected straight-set loss against Germans Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schuettler in the mens doubles semi-final on Thursday night. Nothing went right for us We just could not get going. It is hugely disappointing as we had been playing well in the last three matches, Paes said at the post-match conference after the 2-6, 3-6 defeat. We have to accept that we did not play well today and they deserved to win. Bhupathi said: The goal was to get the gold but now we have to try and get something. It was a disappointing day for us, we just could not get going. It happens sometimes. The fifth seeds, who own three Grand Slam doubles titles as a pair, were knocked out by the unseeded German duo in an hour and six minutes. The Indians will face Croatians Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic in the bronze-medal match. Having won all their three matches in straight sets, the Indians went into the semi-final as clear favourites. But it was clear from the outset that they were not in good touch. Bhupathis serve came under pressure in the sixth game and the Germans broke through for a 4-2 lead. It was the first service loss for the Indians in the competition.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Upbeat Pak hope to maintain momentum
 - TRI-SERIES 
- High-voltage final promised, weather permitting  Australias Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee cast their glance on the trophy in Amsterdam on Friday, the eve of the tri-series final against Pakistan. (PTI) Amsterdam: Pakistan have made rapid strides towards regaining top form. Australia are the world champions. The tri-series final at the picturesque VRA ground on Saturday, therefore, promises fireworks  weather permitting. Rains have played havoc with all the three league matches of what was billed to be a lead-up tournament to the ICC Champions Trophy, starting in a fortnights time in England, and it remains to be seen if the weather gods relent to allow a full game on the morrow. The weather has been clear for the past 48 hours but the scene can change any minute here. India, the third side, will watch the action from the sidelines, after their opening game defeat to Pakistan and subsequent rain-abandoned match against Australia. Pakistan have been a vastly improved and determined side since Bob Woolmers induction as coach. They beat arch-rivals India twice in a row  in the Asia Cup and here  and would be determined to stretch their winning streak against the Aussies. If Pakistan are able to hold their ground against Australia, it would mean a great deal to a largely young side which has relied on the likes of captain Inzamam-ul Haq, his deputy Yousuf Youhana, veteran wicketkeeper Moin Khan and paceman Shoaib Akhtar. Shoaib Malik has made the biggest difference in the way he has batted at number three and bowled his off-spinners to go with his electric fielding. Pakistans bowling has also acquired a new discipline and humility in recent weeks and the best example has been superstar Shoaib Akhtar who did not mind ploughing in as first change against India, not letting his personal ego and reputation come in the way of teams good. Australia, if anything, would be better than they were against India in the game which was aborted at the halfway stage on Monday. They now have an idea how to bat on this pitch where the ball arrives ever so slowly and then it also affords wicked turn. TEAMS Australia (from): Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Andrew Symonds, Michael Clarke, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath and Brad Haddin.

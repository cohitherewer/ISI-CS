				 																																	Bangalore: Medium-pacer Jhulan Goswami has returned to the Indian womens cricket squad for the tri-series to be played in Sri Lanka. Pakistan is the third team in the tournament, which pits India against Sri Lanka in the first match on Saturday. Jhulan, the lone representative of Bengal in the squad, had skipped the recent home series against the West Indies because of academic commitments.				 																																	THE SQUAD				 																																	Mamatha Maben (captain), Mithali Raj (vice-captain), Anju Jain, Anjum Chopra, Hemalata Kala, Jaya Sharma, Neetu David, Deepa Kulkarni, Noosheen-al Khadeer, Arundhati Kirkire, Amita Sharma, Jhulan Goswami, Diana David, Karuna Jain, Sunetra Paranjpe.				 																																	Paris: Olympique Lyon midfielder Vikash Dhorasoo will join AC Milan next season after signing a two-year contract with the Serie A leaders. Lyon have not confirmed the departure of the 30-year-old, who was voted the French champions best player last season. Dhorasoo, whose contract ends in June, will leave after a difficult season with Lyon.				 																																	He was sidelined for most of the winter and only earned his place back in the team after Malis Mahammadou Diarra left to play in the African Nations Cup. Dhorasoo, who has two France caps, signed for Lyon in 1998 from Le Havre and spent a season on loan at Girondins Bordeaux in 2001-2002.				 																																	La Paz: Ramiro Blacut took over as coach of Bolivia for the third time and said he was confident his team still had a chance of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup. The 60-year-old replaced Chilean Nelson Acosta, who was fired last week following a 0-2 home defeat by Chile in a World Cup qualifier. 				 																																	The defeat left Bolivia bottom of the single South American group with three points from five matches. Acosta resigned after a difficult nine months in charge in which he clashed with local club directors over the release of players and complained that Bolivian domestic football was too slow and uncompetitive. The defeat was an especially bitter blow as Bolivia traditionally depend heavily on the advantage of playing home matches in La Paz at 3,600 metres above sea level.				 																																	Madrid: Celta Vigo midfielder Vagner has been given a seven-month suspended prison sentence by a court and fined $4,275 for resisting arrest. The 31-year-old Brazil-born player had been convicted over an incident in October 2001 before a match against Valencia. The player, who had not been selected to play in the game, was stopped by two police officers as he drove towards the VIP parking area because he was talking on his mobile phone. A scuffle followed when he tried to force his way in. An officer was off work for 46 days as a result of injuries he sustained.				 																																	Bucharest: Viorel Hizo has returned to coach Rapid Bucharest for the fourth time, replacing Dan Petrescu who resigned after Wednesdays 1-3 defeat at Universitatea Craiova. Rapid are third in the Romanian first division, eight points behind leaders Steaua Bucharest and Dinamo Bucharest, who both have 45 points with nine matches left.				 																																	New Delhi: The Sports Authority of India (SAI) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Western Australia for advanced courses in training for athletes and coaches. A series of workshops focussing on sports science, coaching, infrastructure planning and development across the country in July will be the first collaborative activity of the MoU. The MoU, valid for four years, will cover areas concerning training and exchange of coaches, sports scientists, athletes and sports teams.Sport on Screen Cricket, India vs Pakistan, 3rd Test, Day 4, live from 10.30 am on TEN Sports

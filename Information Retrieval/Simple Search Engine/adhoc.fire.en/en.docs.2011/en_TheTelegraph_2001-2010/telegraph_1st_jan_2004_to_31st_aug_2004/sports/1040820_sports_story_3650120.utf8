 Ramesh triumphs
Abu Dhabi: GM R. B. Ramesh defeated third seed GM Artyom Timofeev of Russia in the fifth round of the 14th Abu Dhabi chess festival here. GM P. Harikrishna missed out on a good opportunity to join the leading pack as he could not put it across GM Artashes Minasian of Armenia after being on top. At the half-way stage, five players emerged leaders with four points. They are GMs Ashot Anastasian, Ghaem Maghami Ehsan, Pavel Kotsur, Mikhail Kobalia and Evgeny Gleizerov. Harikrishna, Ramesh and GM Tejas Bakre (3.5 each), share the sixth spot with top seed GM Evgeny Vladimirov, GM Marat Dzhumaev, GM Minasian and IM Imad Hakki. Among other Indians, IM S. Kidambi drew with compatriot Tania Sachdev while IM Neelotpal Das and WGM Nisha Mohota also achieved the same result. (PTI)  Copyright

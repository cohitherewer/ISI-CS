 Tsitsiashvilis yearning
Ashdod (Israel): It is not hard to pin down Gocha Tsitsiashvili. The Greco-Roman wrestler is a friendly, open man who may also be Israels best hope for its first Olympic gold. Tsitsiashvili was born in Georgia but considers himself Israeli since his migration a decade ago. I only want to represent my country. I am Jewish and very proud of it, I would never have wanted to represent any other country, he said. (reuters)  Copyright

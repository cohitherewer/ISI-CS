 Fulham slam bully Ferguson
 Louis Saha is disgusted with his clubs stand London: Fulham manager Chris Coleman has accused Manchester United of trying to bully the London Premier League side into selling striker Louis Saha to the reigning champions. In comments published in British newspapers on Wednesday, Coleman vented his anger at what he felt were attempts to unsettle his sides leading goalscorer. After rejecting an offer from Alex Ferguson for the 25-year-old Frenchman last month, the Fulham manager has vowed to stand firm against a renewed approach  believed to be for around 8 million  for the striker. You get that feeling that we are being bullied into selling one of our players, Coleman was quoted in several newspapers as saying. I dont like bullies and I dont like being bullied, that is why we are determined to hang onto Louis Saha. When someone asks you if a player is available and you say no and they make a bid and you say no and they keep coming back, and it is in the newspapers and they come back again, thats disappointing. Saha, on the other hand, said he is disgusted at his club for rejecting the offer. I was told they didnt want to let me go. Im really disgusted, stunned, the 25 year-old said. A move to Manchester United was a good deal for everybody. United were offering 8 million ($14.52 million). It was a very good deal for Fulham. Its not as if Im Ronaldo, he said. I dont understand the position of (Fulham chairman) Mohamed Al Fayed. I thought I deserved something as I have given a lot to Fulham, he said. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Teams rhythm is back: Bhowmick 
 - Juniors man-marking besides scoring against Geylang pleases East Bengal coach  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals (from  left) Alvito DCunha, Kulothungan, Mahesh Gawli and  Shylo Malsawmtluanga arrive at the city airport early  Thursday morning. Picture by Santosh Ghosh  Bhowmick doesn't  want to speculate on NFL fateCalcutta: Subhas Bhowmick is not jumping in joy at having opened the AFC Cup campaign with a creditable away win. But he is surely counting the positives from the 3-2 triumph over Geylang United FC in Singapore. The best thing is that the rhythm we had lost is back, the East Bengal coach remarked on Thursday afternoon. The boys showed the same flow, coordination and determination that made us a strong unit earlier in the season. The red-and-brigade contingent returned to the city past midnight on Wednesday. Within a few hours, nine of them  Bhaichung Bhutia, Sangram Mukherjee, Sandip Nandy, Mahesh Gawli, M. Suresh, Alvito DCunha, Debjit Ghosh, Dipak Mondal and Subhas Chakraborty  took a flight to Mumbai en route to Goa to join the national team. India take on Singapore in a pre-World Cup game at Fatordas Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. Bhowmick was happy to see his players carrying out most of his instructions on Tuesday night. He made special mention of Cristiano Junior, who was assigned to mark the tall Milan Blagojevic in the middle of the park. He (Junior) did a fine man-marking job besides carrying out his primary duty of scoring, observed the coach. Junior hit a brace to take his tally for East Bengal to nine goals from as many games. Bhowmick, though, didnt want to compare Junior with any other foreign striker who has made a name playing club soccer in India. I never make comparisons Ill just say that Junior was my choice and Im not at all surprised at the way he has been performing. East Bengals next engagement in the AFC Cup is a home tie against Malaysias Negri Sembilan on February 25. East Bengals preparation for that game begins on Friday itself. I have asked all the players who are here to report for practice tomorrow morning Theres enough time, Ill start my homework on the Malaysians on Sunday, said Bhowmick. It will be after the Negri match that East Bengal launch the second phase of their National Football League (NFL) campaign, against Salgaocar at home on February 29. But the coach is not looking so far ahead. I dont want to speculate about what may happen in the NFL, but I can tell you that if we play at 60 per cent of our Singapore level, we should do well rest of the season.  IFA letter Meanwhile, Bhowmick on Thursday got the IFAs letter informing the coach of the two-year suspension  coming into effect on May 16. Im sending a copy of the letter to the club for the officials perusal as per their request, Bhowmick said, refusing to say whether he would appeal against the decision or move court.  Copyright

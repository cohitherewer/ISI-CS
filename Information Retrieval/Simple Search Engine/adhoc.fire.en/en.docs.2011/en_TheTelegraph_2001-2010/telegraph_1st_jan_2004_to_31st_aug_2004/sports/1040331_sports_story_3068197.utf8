 Gavaskar defends ICC move
 Muralidharan London: Former captain and chairman of the International Cricket Councils cricket committee, Sunil Gavaskar has jumped to the defence of the games governing body in the controversy surrounding Muttiah Muralidharans suspect bowling action. In a statement released by the ICC here on Tuesday, Gavaskar claimed that the system helped not only to detect potentially flawed actions but also ensured the bowler involved could resume playing after getting his action corrected. The ICC has overhauled the way in which it deals with suspect actions and the revised system that is in place provides a sensible way of dealing with this issue, said Gavaskar. In the case of Muralidharan too, this assessment will take place over the coming six weeks as he works with a suitable expert group to address the concerns that have been raised and addresses any concerns that are identified. The Sri Lankan off-spinner was reported to the ICC during the three-Test series against Australia by Match Referee Chris Broad who said the bowlers doosra  the away going delivery  was not in accordance with the laws of cricket. Gavaskar said a Match Referee was within his right to report on a bowler without being informed by the on-field umpires. Match officials are well within their rights to report actions or deliveries that are of concern to them, he said. We have already seen three bowlers reported over the past 12 months, all of whom are now back after making technical adjustments to their actions. Meanwhile, ICC president Ehsan Mani on Tuesday rejected reports of a conspiracy against Muralidharan. I am not going to make any comment on the action of any bowler but all I can say is that match officials are well within their rights to raise any concerns about any delivery from any bowler. The rules say it, the playing conditions demand it and every Test-playing country has agreed to it, he said in a statement. (PTI)  Copyright

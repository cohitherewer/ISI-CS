The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stage set for todays tee-off
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Thirty-six teams will take part in The Telegraph Merchants Cup golf tournament to be played at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club from Tuesday to Friday. In addition, for corporate houses unable to field a full side, there will be the Challenge Cup and 33 teams are in the fray in this section. The scoring format for the Merchants Cup (four players per side) is four rounds of open strokeplay while the Challenge Cup has a more generous format wherein three out of four scores on an abridged handicap stableford format will count. Eveready Industries are the defending champions and will be led by former Asian Games gold medallist Lakshman Singh. Aditya Khaitan is another member of the team. They will face stiff competition from Tata Steel, led by Alan Singh, a former national champion. Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman is also likely to take part.  Copyright

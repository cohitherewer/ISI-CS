				 																																	Dhaka: Referees have refused to officiate at matches in Dhakas premier soccer league after fans, angered by a disputed goal, attacked their associations office, burning furniture and a referees effigy. We fear for our lives, said Ibrahim Nasser, secretary of the referees association. We feel totally insecure at grounds these days as we are frequently being attacked by players, officials and supporters.				 																																	The trouble flared after a match between Mohammedan Sporting Club and Muktijoddah Sangsad last Thursday when referee Ramkrishna Ghosh awarded Muktijoddah a disputed equaliser six minutes from time. 				 																																	The Mohammedan players refused to play on and the match was abandoned with the score at 1-1. The league committee awarded Muktijoddah the match 2-0 and docked one point from Mohammedans record.

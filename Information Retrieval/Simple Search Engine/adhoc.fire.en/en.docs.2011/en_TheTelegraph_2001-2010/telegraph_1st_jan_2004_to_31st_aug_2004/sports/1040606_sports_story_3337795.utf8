 Leadership doubts cloud Kahn
 The added pressure has affected Kahn Berlin, June 5 (AFP): Germany have had some inspirational captains in the past with Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Lothar Matthaeus and Juergen Klinsmann all standing out for their ability to drive the team forward when things got tough. Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, 34, is Germanys captain heading into the 2004 European championships in Portugal but his leadership skills have come under close scrutiny. Kahn took over the role from Oliver Bierhoff in 2002 and led by example as Germany reached the World Cup final before falling to a 0-2 defeat against Brazil. But while Kahn is undoubtedly one of the key players in Rudi Voellers team there is a feeling his influence is limited due to the fact that he plays in goal. Kahn can save a last-minute penalty or stop a 35-yard shot from nestling in the top corner of the net but  despite his bellowing voice  it is difficult for him to directly influence his midfielders and strikers who are often at the other end. Most top nations have an outfield captain with England having talisman David Beckham, France the experienced Marcel Desailly, while Pavel Nedved pulls the strings for the Czech Republic. Giant custodian Kahn is also captain at Bayern and several players have come out and claimed that a lack of leadership has caused their recent downturn. We have not had a leader since Stefan Effenberg left two years ago, explained Frenchman Willy Sagnol. If I have to take less responsibility to do my job well again I will do it, explained Kahn. I have to consider what can be changed and that includes the captaincy. Bayern persuaded Kahn to stay on as skipper but it is clear the added pressure is affecting his performances. I have been playing under pressure since the World Cup final, confessed Kahn. Perhaps I put myself under too much pressure.  Copyright

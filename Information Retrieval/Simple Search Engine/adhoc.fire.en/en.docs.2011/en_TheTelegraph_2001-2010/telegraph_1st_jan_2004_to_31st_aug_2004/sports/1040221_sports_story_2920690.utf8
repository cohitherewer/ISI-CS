The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, February 21, 2004  Ivory for Governors Trophy 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore: The Sathish Narredu-ward Rare Ivory, to be partnered by Mallesh Narredu, looks good to lift the 1,600m Governors Trophy, a terms affair, which takes the centrestage in the eight-event-card here on Saturday. The Penine Ridge-Anchorage colt was an eye-catching third to Pricewise in his previous start.				 										Flightingale, a winner in her last start and City Zip look best to fight out the issue against Rare Ivory but going by Ivorys blazing trials and over the present trip, he will take some beating.

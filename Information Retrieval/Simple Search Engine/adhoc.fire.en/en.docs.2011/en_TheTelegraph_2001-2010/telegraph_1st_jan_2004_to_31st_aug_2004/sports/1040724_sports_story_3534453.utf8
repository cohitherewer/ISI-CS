The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians believe they can beat anybody anywhere: Ranatunga
	 - I get the feeling somebody in SLC itself doesnt want Murali to play... Im distressed at the way he has been handled  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Colombo: A Personal Security Officer (PSO) isnt ever many feet away from Arjuna Ranatunga, now Sri Lankas deputy minister for industry, tourism and investment promotion. Then, his cellphone keeps ringing incessantly... Well, within a few months, life has changed for the 1996 World Cup-winning captain. Ranatunga, however, took around half-an-hour off to candidly speak to The Telegraph at the Premadasa Stadium on Friday afternoon. The following are excerpts Q The family is grumbling about your spending even less time at home... A (Laughs) Its not deliberate, but most of the functions related to the tourism ministry are held in the evening and, so, Ive got to put in appearances... Being shadowed by a PSO apart, how has life altered after joining the government? Even though Im a deputy minister, Ive got three important ministries... Theres lots to do and, therefore, time is at a premium... As when I was captain, decisions have to be taken quickly. Why were you initially reluctant to handle the ministries allotted to you? Because my heart is in sport, specifically cricket, and I would have been happier with the sports ministry... The President (Chandrika Kumaratunga), however, explained this is a bigger challenge and I could do more outside sport. Incidentally, I didnt join politics to become a deputy minister or minister. Whats your priority? Making tourism the No. 1 money earner... India, for instance, is a huge market but most of the tourists come from the South. So, now, weve got to reach out to North India and make that region aware of everything offered by Sri Lanka. Towards that end, Ill be seeking to promote tourism with the help of sportspersons. Are you, again, going to contest elections for the top post in Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC)? Something needs to be quickly done as the situation is getting from bad to worse... As for contesting, I may lose again because the present set-up is such that an outsider wont be welcome. To my mind, SLC is the most corrupt body in the country and, thanks to the previous government, you could do anything  even get away with murder in daylight  if you had money. Youre talking somewhat like Imran Khan... But, thats the stage we reached. Actually, its difficult believing that despite being so close to the President, you cant change the status quo in SLC... Not many will buy that... Look, even if the President decides to contest, she may lose because of manipulation within SLC... (After a pause) Ill act... In fact, I intend getting our Bribery Commission to probe a good many things done by SLC... For example, I dont see why millions were spent on building a stadium in Dambulla... Then, indoor facilities have come up in places where no first class cricket is played... Somebody has to be accountable... I know of people who struggled to get a two-wheeler but, currently, are in a Mercedes. A one-time associate, Duleep Mendis, is the chief executive. Have you spoken to him about your misgivings? I respected Duleep as my captain and manager. Having said that, I dont have to agree with whatever he is doing at SLC. I wouldnt like to say more. Is it for tactical reasons that you arent naming the person largely responsible for bringing about corruption, as you put it? Theres a court case, so... But the Sri Lankan team hasnt been doing badly... At this moment, yes... But, believe me, we could begin losing to the minnows as a second-string isnt there. Who do we have after Sanath (Jayasuriya), (Muttiah) Muralidharan and Chaminda (Vaas)? (Again, after a pause) Moreover, at times, I get the impression that everybody doesnt exhibit the desired level of commitment. Are you happy with Maravan Atapattus captaincy? Ive been impressed and he is just focussing on the cricket aspect... Hes not looking at the administrative side and its going to be wonderful if he and chief selector Asantha de Mel form a partnership. Maravan reads the game well. Does he interact with you? Once in a while... My doors are open, but you wont find me trying to impose myself on anybody. John Dysons appointment as coach, last year, did raise eyebrows... I suppose hes doing his best... I dont wish to run him down, but I was told that Greg Chappell was keen on coming over... If thats true, the one reason I can think of not appointing him is his high profile. The SLC brass wouldnt have liked it. Has the Murali issue been well handled by SLC? (Agitatedly) Absolutely not... The ICC has a step-by-step process for bowlers whose actions are suspect. Why didnt SLC follow that after (Match Referee) Chris Broad reported Murali? What was the need to rush him to Australia for a sophisticated test? Why this hurry and jumping the gun? Indeed, I get the feeling somebody in SLC itself doesnt want Murali to play... Im distressed at the way he has been handled. With the doosra banned, whats the future you see for Murali? He should reach 800 wickets... Possibly, even 1,000 if he doesnt get injured. Murali is pretty close to you... What did you tell him when the latest controversy erupted? That he must focus on his job, that he should realise the country is behind him... That he must keep aiming higher. To talk of Indian cricket, whats the difference between this team and the ones of a different era? Aggression, commitment and self-belief... Your boys believe they can beat anybody anywhere  its a fantastic characteristic. The final question: How impressed have you been with Sourav Gangulys leadership? Ill give him very high marks  Sourav and Stephen Fleming, who understands the game superbly, are the two present-day captains I admire... Sourav is aggressive, is committed and demands respect from his own players and the opposition. That, for me, is important.  Copyright

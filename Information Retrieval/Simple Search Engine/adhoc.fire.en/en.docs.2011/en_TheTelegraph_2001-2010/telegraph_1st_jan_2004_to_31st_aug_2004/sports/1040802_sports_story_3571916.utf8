The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Over and out, as Iron Mike melts
 - Baddest man on planet wasnt even baddest man in Louisville  IN A CORNER: Mike Tyson, whose loss to Danny Williams could bring a turbulent career to an end, receives treatment for a cut over his eye during the fight in Louisville on Friday Louisville: So this is how it all ends for Mike Tyson. Broke and bloodied, fighting in the same arena where Muhammad Ali made his pro debut 44 years ago, Tyson is knocked silly by the kind of British heavyweight he used to frighten into near paralysis merely by stepping into the ring. The entourage already left when the money ran out. Now, the fans will leave because the mystique is finally gone, too. It disappeared in the fourth round when the baddest man on the planet was knocked down with a savage flurry. It disappeared when Tyson looked around, blood streaming down his face, and decided he didnt want to get up. This was the baddest man on the planet? On Friday night he wasnt even the baddest man in Louisville. Tyson was planning to fight his way out of $ 38 million in debt, but the comeback lasted only 11 minutes and 51 seconds. Its hard to imagine anyone paying much to see him fight again, and even harder to imagine Tyson wanting to take this kind of punishment again. What good is all the money in the world if you cant count it? asked Tysons trainer, Freddie Roach. For once, someone in Tysons camp was making sense. The excuse from the others is Tyson tore a ligament in his left knee late in the first round and couldnt throw his right hand because of it. At the age of 38, though, the truth is Tyson no longer has the speed or stamina to go more than a round or two with anyone who can punch back. He hasnt really beaten a top fighter since Razor Ruddock 13 years ago, or Michael Spinks two years before that. Hes made tens of millions from memories, the kind fans cant bear to give up until the reality finally becomes so evident they cant avoid seeing it. Taking a beating from Lennox Lewis was excusable. Getting beaten up by Danny Williams, who sometimes cries in his dressing room before fights, wasnt. People forget this isnt a peak Mike Tyson. This was a Mike Tyson who was 38 years old, Williams said. People did forget because they wanted desperately to believe that this was somehow the Iron Mike of old. They wanted to believe this was the Tyson from so many years ago who was so devastating before a rape conviction sent him to prison for three years. Some 17,000 of them believed so much they spent hundreds, even thousands, of dollars on tickets to see him fight Friday at Freedom Hall. They got their moneys worth, but not in the way any of them would have imagined. Tyson went all out in the opening round, trying from his first punch to knock Williams out. For a few minutes, it looked as if he would do just that, landing some big left hooks and uppercuts . But Williams showed something Tysons handlers didnt think he had when they hand-picked him as an opponent  a chin. Maybe they shouldnt have been so cheap and picked Williams because he worked for half the $ 500,000 that their first choice as an opponent demanded. Late in the second round, Williams did something else Tysons handlers didnt bank on  he began fighting back. Williams fought back so well he cut Tyson in the third round, then began battering the tiring former champion in the fourth. The end came with a flurry of punches and a big right hand that sent Tyson sprawling into the ropes. Tyson left without making any excuses. He left without talking at all. (AP)  Copyright

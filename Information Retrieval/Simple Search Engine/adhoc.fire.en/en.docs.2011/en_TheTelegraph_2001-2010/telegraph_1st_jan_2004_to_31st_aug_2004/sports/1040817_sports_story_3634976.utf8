The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Phelps eight-gold dream shattered
Athens: US basketball suffered its first Olympic defeat in 16 years on Sunday, to Puerto Rico, and American swimmer Michael Phelps dream of eight gold medals evaporated. The men from the US Caribbean territory handed their mainland American cousins a 92-73 upset on the basketball court in a preliminary match that cast gloom over the successors to the Dream Team triple Olympic gold medallists. A rash public bid for a record clutch of eight golds by teenage swimming phenomenon Phelps proved a medal too far after only two events when the South African quartet scored a stunning victory in the mens 4x100m freestyle final. The South African triumph in the 400m individual medley on Saturday was achieved in world record time. His arch-rival Ian Thorpe of Australia earlier won round one of a duel with Phelps in the 200m freestyle. But the reigning Olympic champion from The Netherlands, Pieter van den Hoogenband, outpaced both to qualify fastest for the final. Teenager Laure Manaudou won the womens 400m freestyle to give France its first gold in Athens, becoming the first Frenchwoman to win an Olympic swimming title in the process. In soccer, Iraq beat Costa Rica 2-0 to reach the quarter finals while Italy and Portugal recovered from shock results to win their second games and stay in contention. Portugal beat Morocco 2-1 to stay in contention for a place in the last eight. Alberto Gilardino scored twice as Italy beat Japan 3-2 in a thriller in Volos.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

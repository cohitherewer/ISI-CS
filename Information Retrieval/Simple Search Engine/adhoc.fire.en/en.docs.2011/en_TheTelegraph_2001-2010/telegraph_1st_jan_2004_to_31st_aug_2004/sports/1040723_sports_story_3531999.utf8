The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Keshav sniffing title, Kapil at 5th
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Keshav Mishra who returned a record card of nine-under par 63 Wednesday, is all set to claim the Royal Challenge Indian Golf Tours inaugural event, the Northern Indian Amateur title. The 26-year-old played another scintillating round of three-under 69 to extend his lead to ten strokes after the third round at the Army Golf Course in New Delhi Thursday. Keshavs three-day total reads at 11-under 205, according to information reaching here. Accompanying Keshav in the leadergroup for the final round Friday will be Ranjit Singh of the RCGC and three-time Sri Lankan Open winner Simarjeet Singh, with the former occupying the sole second position at one-under 215 while the latter was tied for third along with Vikrant Chopra at level-par 216. Kapil Dev submitted a card of one-under 71 Thursday to share the fifth position along with Vikramjit Singh. The duo has a 54-total of two-over 218. Ranjit met with fluctuating fortunes today, bogies interfering with his schedule. He made up ground with an eagle on the par-5 12th. A good driver and a 7-iron iron left him with a 15-footer for the eagle. Simarjeet Singh also had a similar round. An unfortunate loss of ball on the par-5 eighth saw him lose three strokes. Now he shares third position overall.  Copyright

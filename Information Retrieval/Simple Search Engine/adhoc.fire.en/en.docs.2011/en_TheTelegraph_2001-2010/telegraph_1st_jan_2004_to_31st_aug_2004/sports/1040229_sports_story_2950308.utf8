The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Protocol stalls appointment
 - Sourav, Wright may now bring up bowling coach issue on Monday  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Jawagal Srinath Calcutta, Feb. 28: With neither captain Sourav Ganguly nor coach John Wright formally asking the Board for a bowling coach, before todays working committee meeting in New Delhi, its likely that Team India will leave for Pakistan without one. A representation should have been made and, in turn, that had to be discussed (by the working committee). Now, no matter what Sourav Gangulys views, making an appointment is going to be difficult, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. Sourav, who went on record the other day saying the team would have a bowling coach before leaving for Pakistan (March 10), was expected to personally speak to the Board president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, this morning. That didnt come about  one possible reason being that Sourav had to leave for Mumbai and couldnt link up before the meeting  and, with Wright too not interacting, there will be protocol problems. In any case, the next working committee meeting wont be before the teams departure. Of course, both the captain and coach (who is back from New Zealand) could make a representation on Monday, when the ODI squad is picked here. Dalmiya, after all, is going to be in the city and there will be an opportunity for Sourav and Wright to have a closed-door session with him. If an exception is made on the protocol front, Jawagal Srinath is going to be the one to join the support staff. Even if the working committee didnt talk about Bruce Reids successor, it appointed joint secretary Prof. Ratnakar Shetty as manager. Given that the tour is sensitive, the choice couldnt have been better. More important, Prof. Shetty was recently in Pakistan (as head of the delegation reviewing arrangements) and, so, has acclimatised himself. Meanwhile, according to Board secretary S.K. Nair, the squad for the three Tests will probably be picked after the fourth ODI (Lahore, March 21). The first Test, in Multan, begins on March 28. The competitive part of the tour commences on March 13, with ODI No. 1 in Karachi.  Copyright

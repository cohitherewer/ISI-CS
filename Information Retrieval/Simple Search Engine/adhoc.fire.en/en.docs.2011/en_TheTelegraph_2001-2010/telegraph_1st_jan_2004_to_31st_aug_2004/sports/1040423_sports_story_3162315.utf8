 Surya Sekhar slips to second spot
 Surya was held by a lower-rated player Dubai: Second seed Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran and national champion GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly slid to joint second spot after the third round of Dubai international chess championship here. Top seed GM Liviu-Dieter Nisipenau of Romania, Tamaz Gelashvili of Georgia, world junior champion Shakhriyaz Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan and International Master Nelson Mariano of Philippines now share the lead with three points each from as many rounds. A pack of 22 players including national champion Surya, P. Harikrishna, Sasikiran and IM S. Satyapragyan share the second spot a half point behind the leaders in this us$ 41000 prize money tournament. Sasikiran was held to a quick draw by GM Vugar Gashimov of Azerbaijan. Surya and Harikrishna were held to draws by lower rated Nadera Barlo of Philippines and Elshan Moradiabadi of Iran, respectively, while R. B. Ramesh went down to Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine. S. Satyapragyan drew with GM Izoria Zviad of Georgia while national under-11 champion Parimarjan Negi drew with IM El Arousy Abdul Hameed of Egypt. Among other Indians in the fray, Abhijeet Gupta moved ahead after beating compatriot Manthan Chokshi while IM Deepan Chakravarthy put it across Cristine Rose Mariano of Philippines. IM D. V. Prasad was held to a draw by Shihab Khaled of Libya while Women Grandmaster Aarthie Ramaswamy and IM Rahul Shetty suffered defeats at the hands of Nidjat Mamedov of Azerbaijan and GM Mikhail Ulibin of Russia, respectively. Sasikiran could not do much as his opponent went for a safer route against the Sicilian defence and employed the Alapin variation. After a few quick exchanges the truce was signed in just 16 moves. Harikrishna tried hard to make inroads against the solid defences of Moradiabadi but the later kept his cool in the endgame to earn the half point. Employing the classical set against the Kings Indian defence as white, Harikrishna seized the initiative after his opponent was left with a bad bishop in the endgame but missed out on his chances and signed the truce after 67 moves. Also mishandling a better position was Surya, who overlooked a tactical move against Barlo arising out of an English opening where the former played white. Upon realising the dangers that now faced him, Surya proposed a draw that was immediately accepted. Eljanov gradually outplayed Ramesh in a Queens Indian defence game. The middle game gave Eljanov a position with immense potential to build a kingside attack and he did that with precision, keeping in check Rameshs counterattack on the other wing and romped home in 53 moves. Nisipeanu defeated GM Goloshchapov Alexander of Ukraine in 78 moves.  (PTI)  Copyright

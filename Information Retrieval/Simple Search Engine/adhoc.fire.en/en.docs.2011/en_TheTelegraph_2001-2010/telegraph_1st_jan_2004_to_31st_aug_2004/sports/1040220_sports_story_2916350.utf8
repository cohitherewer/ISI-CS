The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Progress made, says Dalmiya
London: Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Thursday some progress had been made in the BCCIs efforts to have the World Cup guarantee money released from the ICC. There has been progress but I would not like to say anything more on it, he said after a three-day meeting of ICCs contracts sub-committee, shortly before leaving for Calcutta. According to an ICC spokesman, no meeting of the contracts sub-committee was scheduled here. But we continue to hold discussions to resolve the issue, he said. ICC has withheld $ 6.5 million of Indias share of World Cup profits pending resolution of the cricketers contracts dispute with the event sponsors.  (PTI)  Copyright

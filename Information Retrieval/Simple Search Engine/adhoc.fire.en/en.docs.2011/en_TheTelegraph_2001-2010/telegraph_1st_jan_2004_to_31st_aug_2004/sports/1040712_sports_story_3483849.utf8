 Sidhu wants Sehwag and Chopra to open
Thiruvananthapuram: Former Test cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday said he was in favour of Akash Chopra being retained as the opening partner of Virender Sehwag in Tests. He said with Yuvraj Singh in the team, the management could take appropriate decisions on the second opener looking at the turns in each game. Sidhu, now a BJP MP and a cricket commentator, said he feels Rahul Dravid was not enjoying his role as wicketkeeper in one-dayers and said Parthiv Patel should be groomed for that role. We need a batsman-cum-specialist keeper like Adam Gilchrist. With more exposure, Patel can fit that mould, he said. On the contract system for cricketers, he said while fixing grades, performance should also be counted along with seniority. Grading should not be based merely on age and experience, he said.

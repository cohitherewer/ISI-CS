The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harmison, Gough included
London: England called up fast bowlers Steve Harmison and Darren Gough for the seven-match one-day series against West Indies on Tuesday. Chairman of selectors David Graveney said: Stephen was a member of our World Cup squad last winter. He has performed superbly against the West Indies in the Test series and we hope that he can carry this rich vein of form into the one-day arena. Harmison has been Englands major success on tour, winning the Man-of-the-Match awards in the first two Tests. England lead the four-match series 2-0. Gough, 33, has played in 121 one-dayers but has been out of the England frame since July 2003 following a string of knee problems. The first one-dayer will be in Georgetown on April 18.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Historic 9-wicket win for NZ
 - 2nd test - Cairns joins 200 club, Martin takes 11 in match Auckland: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming hit a whirlwind 31 to ease the home side to a nine-wicket victory on the final afternoon of the second Test against South Africa on Monday. A towering six by Fleming ended a 72-year wait for New Zealand as they pulled off their first home Test victory against South Africa. Set a victory target of 51 after dismissing South Africa for 349, Fleming came to the crease when Mark Richardson was caught by Nicky Boje for ten after misjudging a Makhaya Ntini bouncer. The skipper hit 17 off Ntinis next over, his 31 containing six fours and a six. He thus picked up his 20th win in 57 matches as captain. The hosts lead the series 1-0 after a drawn opening Test in Hamilton. The final match starts in Wellington on Friday. The victory was New Zealands first against South Africa on home soil and just their fourth in 29 encounters, although Fleming could not be tempted into agreeing that the historic win was the Black Caps most complete Test cricket win. It is pretty big but Im not sure where it fits, and Im not sure if I want to rank it. Each time we do something special, it has the same characteristic, he said. Certainly England (a 2-1 series win in 1999) was great but the nature of this beast is that we havent done it before at home against South Africa. Earlier, Chris Cairns claimed his 200th Test wicket to help dismiss the Proteas in the first session of the final day. Recalled fast-medium bowler Chris Martin also played a key role, removing Shaun Pollock to register his second five-wicket haul of the match. Despite a heroic knock of 154 not out by Jacques Rudolph, New Zealand always looked in control of the outcome once they had compiled a daunting 595 first innings total. After scoring his 3,000th Test run on way to a brutal 158 on Saturday, Cairns picked up his landmark wicket when Boje edged to Brendon McCullum. Cairns added two more to his tally to close the innings. In passing the milestone, Cairns became the sixth all-rounder to take 200 wickets and score 3,000 Test runs. He is the second New Zealander to attain the double after Sir Richard Hadlee and joins an illustrious list containing Sir Garfield Sobers, Ian Botham, Kapil Dev and Imran Khan. Its just nice to go to Wellington without anything on my mind. Im really looking forward to just getting out there and playing, Cairns said. Trailing by 299 after the first innings, South Africa resumed on 277 for six and quickly lost Pollock when he edged a rampant Martin to Fleming. Pollocks wicket was Martins 11th of the match after his six for 76 in the first innings. His 11 for 180 is a new record for his country against South Africa and earned him Man of the Match award. This was probably the biggest beating weve had since Ive been in charge and we deserved the beating after the way we performed in most facets of the game, South African skipper Graeme Smith said. Mason, Mills included New Zealand have included pace bowlers Michael Mason and Kyle Mills in the squad for final Test. Daryl Tuffey pulled out of the team after sustaining severe bruising to his thigh while fielding in the second Test.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

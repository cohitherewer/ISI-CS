The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly dreams drown in rain
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Dempo withstand early pressure to secure precious win  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge Agragami defender Ebi Bar Bar checks the progress of Dempos R.C. Prakash in their NFL clash at Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Dempo survived a spirited Tollygunge Agragami challenge and a near washout to keep themselves in the hunt for a maiden National Football League (NFL) crown. The Goans won 2-1, the fast-paced match at Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday witnessing an unseasonal squall, a spell of blinding rain and three Tollygunge appeals to call off play in the final ten minutes. Dempo thus caught up with East Bengal on 27 points, though the Goans have played a match more (14) than the city outfit. Tollygunge remain on 13 after 14 outings. The first 67 minutes didnt produce a goal, but the next ten saw the ball beating the goalkeeper thrice. Dempo, who took a long time to get their neat passing game in place, struck first, thanks to a Tollygunge blunder. Sunday Seahs push, following a Stanley Colaco floater from the right, was partially cleared by custodian Rajnarayan Mukherjee. The ball fell in side-back Temzen Kibangs path, but he made a mess of the clearance and Clifford Miranda was quick to pounce on the opportunity. With darkness descending rapidly, the lights had to be switched on. It provided Tollygunge substitute Gouranga Dutta  who replaced Biman Mondal barely a minute earlier  just the spark to produce a dazzling angular left-footer after Sandip Das had split open the Dempo defence with a clever square pass. Blustery winds sent billboards around the ground flying, the heavens opened up, but Dempo couldnt care less. They pressed for the winning goal and got it too, albeit again with some help from the opposition. A Miranda through pass had R.C. Prakash and Tollygunge central defender Ebi Bar Bar battling for possession. As the ball ran loose, Rajnarayan left charge but failed to pick it up and the opportunistic Wilton Gomes blasted home a right-footer from close range. The sharp shower had left a few puddles and the ball wasnt rolling on some pockets of the ground. Tollygunge coach Krishnendu Roy drew the attention of the fourth referee, some of his players appealed to the man with the whistle. Three stoppages ensued, but the game wasnt called off. The fact that less than a quarter of an hour was left perhaps influenced the officials decision to carry on. Tollygunge may have felt a little hard done by, but the fact is, the city has seen several matches under messier conditions than Wednesdays. On the basis of their performance, though, Tollygunge deserved at least a point. They were the more organised side for most of the opening session and came close to breaking the deadlock four times. Sheikh Habeeb Ali couldnt connect after Akeem Abolanle had set him up with an inviting centre. An Akeem cross saw Biman Mondal directing the ball towards the second post with a clever glancing header, only to be kicked away from the goalline by Filip Gomes. Akeem did put the ball into the Dempo net once, but the flag had gone up a moment before for an infringement inside the box. Just before half-time, Habeeb took too long to control a Sandip pass and managed a weak shot. Seah, who had a low-key game, wasted the two chances that came Dempos way in the first 45 minutes. After change of ends, the Goan side was well served by Nigerian medio Mohammed Ghaffari, Miranda and Silveira, resulting in a wave of attacks. Tollygunge would still have avoided defeat if the last line of defence had done the basics right in crunch situations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Toiling Bagan get past Wari
 - SUPER DIVISION - Basudeb Mondal and Sunil Chhetri ensure 2-0 victory in opener  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya shows little emotion as he lauds one of his goalscorers, veteran Basudeb Mondal, after their Super Division match at home on Friday. Mohun Bagan won 2-0. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: The way Mohun Bagan went through their lung-opener in the Calcutta Leagues Super Division at home on Friday, might have fetched the green-maroon brigade three points, but failed to satisfy coach Subrata Bhattacharya. Bagan had to break sweat to get past the hurdle of Wari AC 2-0. The goals were scored by Basudeb Mondal, deep into the stoppage time of the first session, and Sunil Chhetri in the 82nd minute. Mohun Bagan started the game well, but lacked the finesse to convert the moves into goals till the stroke of half time. Bagan launched their first attack in the ninth minute through Ashim Biswas solo effort from the right. But he failed to provide the finishing touch. After that it was wayward football from both sides, especially Mohun Bagan, who tried to penetrate from the middle. Later on, better sense prevailed and they used the flanks to some effect. New recruit Tomba Singh appeared the best of the lot. Though he floated the ball in from the flanks  producing a lot of worry for the Wari defence  Bagan players failed to come up with anything productive. Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan coach brought veteran Basudeb Mondal in place of captain Mehtab Hussain. The move seemed to have worked as Bagan started building the game as a cohesive unitIn the 26th minute, Mondal tried a 20-yarder, which, though, missed the target. Just as everyone was waiting for the first session to end, Brazilian Eduardo sailed the ball for advancing Chhetri, who set it up for Mondal. He unleashed a strong right footer to pierce the net. Eight minutes from time, Chhetri, however, sealed the fate of the match. Mondal delivered an accurate forward pass for Tomba, who passed it on to the better-placed Chhetri on the left. The latter made no mistake in finding the target with his right footer. Meanwhile, in another Super Division match at the Central Park in Salt Lake, Ever-Ready Association defeated Peerless SC 1-0 by a Ratan Das strike.

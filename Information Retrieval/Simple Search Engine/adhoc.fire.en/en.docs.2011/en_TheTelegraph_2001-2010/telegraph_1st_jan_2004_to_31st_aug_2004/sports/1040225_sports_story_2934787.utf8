The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Blind Indian scores 200 
Karachi: Blind Indian cricketer Rajinder Verma drew comparisons with sighted batting star Sachin Tendulkar Tuesday as he hit a record unbeaten 200 against Pakistan, guiding the tourists to a 161-run victory. Verma, who is completely blind, hit four boundaries to compile the highest ever score by an Indian in this version of the game. India compiled a huge 409 for two in their 50 overs. Pakistan managed 248 in 29 overs in reply with eight of their batsmen run out, giving India their first win after two defeats in the five-match series.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Chelsea draw a boost for Arsenal 
London: Arsenals Premier League title bid was given a significant boost without Arsene Wengers men kicking a ball on Saturday as second-placed Chelsea were held to a 0-0 home draw by mid-table Middlesbrough. Chelsea, seven points behind Arsenal after the Londoners 4-2 win over Liverpool on Friday, could only close that gap by one point after well organised Middlesbrough comfortably contained them in a disappointing game. The Blues have only six games left but Arsene Wengers side can go further clear if they beat Newcastle United on Sunday at St James Park. Chelsea found Boros defence far harder to open when they won 2-1 and only a John Terry first half header and an earlier Joe Cole drive seriously threatened Mark Schwarzers goal. Manchester United, in third, looked in trouble at Birmingham City after going behind to a first-half goal through Martin Graingers free-kick. But they levelled as Louis Saha were brushed aside by referee Dermot Gallagher before substitute Cristiano Ronaldo headed perfectly inside the post.  Saha headed another at 78th minute to move 12 points behind Arsenal. (REUTERS)  Copyright

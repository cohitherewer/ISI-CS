 Sunny feels flexion degree not definite
New Delhi: Former India captain and ICC Cricket Committee (Playing) chairman Sunil Gavaskar has said the degree of flexion with regard to legal bowling action is not definite. The ICC after conducting a study with the help of bio-mechanics noticed there was certain amount of flexion in most (bowlers) actions when seen in slow motion. So they felt some degree of flexion should be allowed. There are certain numbers for spinners and quick bowlers. But I do not think it is a definite thing, Gavaskar said at a press conference on Wednesday. The batting legends comments came hours after the ICC deemed as illegal Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharans doosra, the delivery that spins away from right-handers. The ICC said the bio-mechanics report has clearly mentioned that Muralidharan straightened his arm beyond the permissible degree of five for a slow bowler while delivering the controversial delivery. Gavaskar clarified that on-field umpires are still empowered to no-ball a bowler if they were 100 per cent sure that his action was illegal. But when he is not cent per cent sure, he  and even the Match Referee  can call for video evidence. (PTI)  Copyright

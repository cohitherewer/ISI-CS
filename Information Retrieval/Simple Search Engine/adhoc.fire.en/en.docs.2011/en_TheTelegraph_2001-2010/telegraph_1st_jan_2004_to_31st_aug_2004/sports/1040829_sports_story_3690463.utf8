		 Sunday, August 29, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
 Irans official sporting body has awarded $ 120,000 to its world judo champion Arash Miresmaeili for refusing to fight an Israeli during the Olympics, a report said on Saturday.				 																																	Miresmaeilis act was extremely valuable, and therefore we are awarding him the gold medallist award, the head of the Iranian physical education organisation, Mohsen Mehralizadeh, was quoted as saying in the official Daily Iran.				 																																	The sum is the same amount awarded to Hossein Rezazadeh, who won a gold in weightlifting. The paper said the Iranian national Olympics committee had also given Miresmaeli its gold medallist cash pay-out of $ 5,000 for what they also termed as a valuable action.  Although one of the most ancient sports, wrestling is looking to its future, a leading official says.				 																																	The sport is innovating and embracing modern technology to ensure transparency and fairness, Mario Saletnig, vice president of the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles, or FILA, said. 				 																																	We decided to use video replays to assist us in clarifying unclear situations ... we do this because its good for our sport, Saletnig, a Canadian, said.				 																																	Saletnig said that under old rules results could be reversed overnight and it was not good to leave wrestlers, teams and the media in suspense.  Puerto Rican wrestler Mabel Fonseca and Hungarian weightlifting silver medallist Ferenc Gyurkovics were thrown out of the Olympics on Saturday after failing drugs test, officials said. Fonseca, 32, tested positive for banned steroid stanozolol after competing in the womens freestyle wrestling 55kg competition where she finished fifth.				 																																	Gyurkovics was stripped of his medal from the 105kg weightlifting competition after traces of the anabolic steroid oxandrolone were found in his system after a test on August 24. American Olympic synchronised swimmer Tammy Crow, who is to serve a prison sentence for a fatal car accident, will always have the support of her teammates, fellow swimmer Anna Kozlova says.				 																																	Crow was a member of the US octet which took bronze in the team event on Friday. She is due to begin a 90-day jail sentence in the US on October 25 after pleading no contest to a vehicular manslaughter charge following an accident last February in which her boyfriend and a 12-year-old boy were killed in the car she was driving. 				 																																	Crow was a non-swimming reserve in Thursdays technical routine but swam in Fridays free routine and was on the Olympic victory podium to receive her medal.

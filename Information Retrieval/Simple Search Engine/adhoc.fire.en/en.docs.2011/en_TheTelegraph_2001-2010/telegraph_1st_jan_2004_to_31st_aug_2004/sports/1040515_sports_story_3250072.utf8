 Subhas let off by IFA
 - Two-year ban becomes suspended sentence  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick Calcutta: What started with a big bang has faded out into a whimper. After having threatened to suspend East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick for two years, the IFA has finally ended up slapping a six-month suspended sentence on him. It has been decided, after a meeting of the office bearers on Friday, to suspend the sentence pronounced by the disciplinary sub-committee for six months during which Bhowmick will be under strict observation. If he makes any derogatory remarks against the association during this period, the sentence shall be imposed on him, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said. The IFA disciplinary committee, at its January 29 meeting, had decided to debar Bhowmick from sitting in the technical area, reserve bench or inside-fence at any IFA-organised meet for a period of two years, beginning May 16, for making derogatory remarks against the association. Bhowmick had appealed against the harsh punishment and explained before the governing body as to what he exactly meant. The governing body subsequently had empowered the secretary to take a decision on the issue. Reacting to the suspended sentence, Bhowmick said it was a dead subject as far as he was concerned. Its a dead issue for me. I convinced the IFA governing body that what I had said was right. I have never tried to belittle any person or organisation, Bhowmick clarified. Dutta didnt agree that the suspended sentence was a climbdown for the IFA. When Bhowmick appeared before the governing body he had made it clear that he did not want to insult or disgrace the association. He had termed the governing body as ignorant which was subsequently misinterpreted as illiterate in a section of the media. He also said that he failed to appear before the governing body on the first occasion because his side was struggling and his job was at stake. He reiterated his respect for the body and even congratulated it for all the good work in the best interest of the game over the years. He had concluded by saying that if his words had unintentionally hurt anyone he offered his apologies. All the allegations against him got neutralised once he made it clear that at no point did he wish to imply that he did not accept the authority of the governing body, Dutta explained.  Copyright

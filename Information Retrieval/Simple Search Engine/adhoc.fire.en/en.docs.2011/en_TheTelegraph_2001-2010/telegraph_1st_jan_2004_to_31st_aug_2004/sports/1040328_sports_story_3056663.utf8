The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Olmo sole leader
 Olmo has a three-stroke lead New Delhi: Pablo del Olmo kept the Mexican flag flying high with a three-stroke sole lead after Round III at the Royal Challenge Indian Open golf meet on Saturday. The 34-year old played brilliantly for a five-under 67 with six birdies and two bogies. He missed another birdie on the 18th. I am very happy. I was very lucky to have got the breaks I got, it seemed as if some eagle caught the ball and threw it back on the fairway, he said. Sharing the second spot at an overall 11-under 205 were Mardan Mamat of Singapore and South African Keith Horne who both turned in a card of 70. Mamat had an eagle on the par-five 14th. Among the Indians, Mukesh Kumar retained his joint seventh spot with a card of 71 while Firoz Ali jumped to 12th at 211 with a 69. But the biggest mover among the home contenders was Digvijay Singh whose 67 took him to joint 13th position. After an ordinary first two rounds, the Indian had a stupendous outing with eight birdies. His final score would have been better but was spoilt by a bogey on the ninth and a double bogey at the 11th. My putting was very good today. Thats what was missing in the first two rounds, said Digvijay who revealed that he was having sleepless nights with a tight back and was coping with the help of physiotherapy. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Eriksson gets support from FA
 Sven-Goran Eriksson London: David Davies, the new acting chief executive of the Football Association (FA), gave strong backing to England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson on Monday, saying the organisation wanted to move on from recent controversies. Erikssons future is still uncertain after the resignation of chief executive Mark Palios on Sunday following days of speculation over the two mens relationship with FA secretary Faria Alam. It is likely to be settled when the Swede faces an FA Board meeting on Thursday, though it looks increasingly unlikely that he will be forced out of his 4 million ($7.32 million)-a-year job. Davies, the FAs executive director and former head of communications, was quick to back Eriksson when he faced the media outside the ruling bodys headquarters on Monday. Sven has a consistent track record of success everywhere he has worked and is popular and highly respected by his players. He is one of the outstanding coaches in the world, Davies said. That is why so many people want to hire him. It is right to say he wants to be coach of the senior England team and he will be coming back to work today. The coach is due to give his version of events at Thursdays meeting but Davies tried to divert attention away from the current problems and towards the future. When the staff come in we will be saying lets get on with the important business, he said. With them my job will be to ensure we go forward to bring people together in what is a very difficult time. No one person is greater than the game we are here to serve and football is more important than some of the stuff we have had to put up with in recent weeks. We have to be positive with a new season days away.  Mark PaliosOn Sunday, Palios resigned as chief executive of the FA saying it was important that he took ultimate responsibility for everything the FA has done in good times and bad. The FA and Palios, who took over Englands ruling body in July last year, had come under increasing pressure after it was revealed that he and England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had an affair with the same women, FA secretary Faria Alam. I have resigned this evening as chief executive of the FA, Palios said in a statement on the FA website. Personally, I do not accept that I have been guilty of any wrongdoing. But it has been clear to me that my action tonight is essential to enable the FA to begin to return to normality. Executive director David Davies has been put in temporary charge of the FA with immediate effect. The latest twist in the saga came after Sundays News of the World reported that the FA tried to broker a deal with the newspaper to protect Palios over his affair with Alam.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

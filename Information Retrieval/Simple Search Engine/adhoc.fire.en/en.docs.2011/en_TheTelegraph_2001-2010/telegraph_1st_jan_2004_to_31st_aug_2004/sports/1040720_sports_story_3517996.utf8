 Sunny, Kapil on voting panel
New Delhi: Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev have been included in the voting academy for the ICC awards. Besides the Indian legends, the ICC on Monday announced names of eight other former players who have been included so far in the legends and media group that holds 25 votes in a pool of 50. The other 25 will be the captains of the ten Test playing nations, eight umpires from the ICC Elite Panel and seven Match Referees, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said. The awards will be presented on September 7 at the Alexandra Palace in London. Speed said the awards will become an annual feature and an integral part of the international cricket calendar. These awards will become one of the traditions of the game, he said, adding that the ICC plans to take the awards function to all Test playing nations. The list of former players on the voting panel announced on Monday doesnt include anyone from Pakistan and Bangladesh. Apart from Gavaskar and Kapil, others on the list are Michael Atherton (England), Martin Crowe (New Zealand), Ian Healy (Australia), David Houghton (Zimbabwe), Graeme Pollock (South Africa), Barry Richards (South Africa), Sidath Wettimuny (Sri Lanka) and Michael Holding (West Indies). This years awards will take into account performance of the players between August 1 last year and July 1, 2004. Awards will be given in individual and team categories. In the individual section, there will be awards for the best Test player of the year, best ODI player, emerging player and cricketer of the year. For the team awards, a separate five-member panel will pick the best 11 Test players and 11 ODI players to form the best Test and ODI teams of the year. There will also be a Spirit of Cricket award to be judged by umpires and Match Referees. It will be judged by umpires and referees and given to a team which has consistently shown best awareness of the spirit of the game, Speed said. The emerging player of the year award will be given to an individual who is less than 26 and has played less than five Tests and/or ten ODIs at the start of the voting period. Speed said the awards function may be held in India two years later. It could come to India in 2006 when hopefully India will get to host the Champions Trophy. The ICC intends to keep an element of surprise regarding what exactly will comprise the awards and if they will have any monetary benefits as well. The strength of the awards rests on the selection process. The voting procedure will be independent of ICC. Members of the academy will complete the forms which will be sealed and passed on to auditors before being placed in safes. (PTI)  Copyright

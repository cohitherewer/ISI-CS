 Streak sorts out farming issues
Harare: Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak met with a government representative on Sunday, not to determine his cricketing future but rather his familys farming interests. Streak was removed as team captain last month after he demanded changes to the national selection panel. When that were rejected, Zimbabwe Cricket Union chairman Peter Chingoka announced a decision to remove Streak by accepting his resignation. Streak, though, insists he has not resigned. On Sunday, Streak joined his father Dennis and a group of farmers at the Turk Mine Sports Club about 40 km north of Bulawayo to meet up with Robert Mugabes governor for the Matabeleland area where they live. Details of the talks were not available but discussions dealt with Streaks farming, ranching and hunting safari operations. Their Robins farm and Entsokozweni safari camp have been occupied by a large number of local settlers since Mugabe began his land reform programme in 2000. Streak, 30 will play for Warwickshire in July, August and early September. (Reuters)  Copyright

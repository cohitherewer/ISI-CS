 Pound wants to take revenge, alleges Lewis
New York: Nine-time Olympic gold medallist Carl Lewis lashed out at World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chief Richard Pound for his revenge-driven attacks on American athletes. Lewis hinted that the Canadian-based Pounds regular assaults on USA Track and Field (USATF) may be his way of trying to get even for Ben Johnson having lost his gold medal in 1988 to Carl Lewis, after the Canadian sprinter was caught using steroids. I am going to stand up and say something for all American athletes. I am tired of Dick Pound doing all his talking, Lewis said at a news conference here. To Lewis, some of Pounds zealousness stems from the disqualification of Johnson, following a positive test for steroid use, a day after his apparent victory in the 100m dash at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. Lewis, who finished second, was awarded the gold. Remember that Ben (the Johnson episode) happened on his (Pounds) watch, said Lewis. Pound was a member of the IOCs executive committee at the time. I think its a little disingenuous of him to keep on attacking American athletes now, to act as if hes holier-than-thou. (AFP)  Copyright

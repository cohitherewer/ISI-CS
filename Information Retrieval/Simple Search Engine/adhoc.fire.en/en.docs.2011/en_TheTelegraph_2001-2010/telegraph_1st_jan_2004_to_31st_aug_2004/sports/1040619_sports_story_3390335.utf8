 Jones passes lie detector test
San Francisco: Triple Olympic champion Marion Jones has passed a privately-administered lie detector test in which she said she had never used performance-enhancing drugs, her lawyer said on Thursday. Joe Burton said in a teleconference that the polygraph test, administered at his office in San Francisco on Wednesday, asked two questions  did you ever personally use performance-enhancing drugs? and are you now lying about any personal use of performance-enhancing drugs? Burton said Jones no to both questions passed the test.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

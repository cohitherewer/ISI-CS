The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Muralidharan has nothing against Aussie public
 Muralidharan at a press conference in Colombo on Friday. Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan insists his decision to skip the Australia tour stands, though he has no ill feelings towards Australians. The off-spinner said on Friday he has no problem with visiting Australia as a tourist in the future. I have no hatred towards the Australian people. People have to put these things behind and get going. Sure, I will go to Australia. About Shane Warnes statement describing him as thin-skinned for opting out of the tour, Murali said: It is easy for them to say that. Only I know what I have gone through. Cricketers can say anything. Whatever I have achieved has come with great difficulty. Sri Lankas World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga has accused John Howard of forcing Muralidharan to take such a drastic step. It was their Prime Minister who created the whole problem, and the Australian public should tackle him in the next elections, Ranatunga said. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal on Friday granted bail to the countrys former cricket chief and the head of the main telecommunications company, Thilanga Sumathipala. (Agencies)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A new beginning: Holyfield
New York: Evander Holyfield, who is preparing for a return to the ring, wants to take the heavyweight division back to the glory days when the best fighters fought each other on a regular basis. The (heavyweight division) is wide open with everyone looking for a big pay day and not fighting challengers, said Holyfield. At a news conference on Monday, Holyfield, 41, said he plans to become the next undisputed world heavyweight champion. I have a new team. This is a new beginning and I have the right team to go back into the ring, said Holyfield. I know I can be the new undisputed heavyweight champion. If I didnt think I could do it, then I wouldnt be fighting, he said. This is not about history, but about being the heavyweight champion, he said. Holyfield, who said he would retire if he lost in a title fight, also has a new management team. Holyfield said he had a clean bill of health and was ready to fight either Chris Byrd or John Ruiz in a title bout. Over the years he has been advised by friends and experts to retire because of his health, which included problems with his heart and shoulder. But each time he has been passed fit  sometimes on a second opinion  to fight, he said. I get tested (medically) more than anyone else in boxing, said Holyfield, who prevailed twice over Mike Tyson and has a 38-7-2 record, including 25 KOs. Holyfield made the announcement on the 33rd anniversary of the classic Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier undisputed heavyweight bout at Madison Square Garden, which Frazier won. Holyfield, who began his professional career 20 years ago with a win over Lionel Byarm in New York, has not fought since he lost to James Toney on a TKO in the ninth in Las Vegas in October, 2003.

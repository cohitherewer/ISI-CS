The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004  Compassionate may come good 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: With a feather weight of 47 kg to carry, Compassionate may come good in the 2,000m Delhi Race Club Cup on Wednesday. The Javed Khan-trained filly is now in Class II as she has always been a trier since the handicapper slapped about a class penalty on her after she won in Class IV. Significantly, the Tirol-Compassion four-year-old has been downed by the Singh brothers  Vijay and Bharaths  wards in her subsequent four starts. Being youngest in the field of six and weight in her favour, she may take the likes of LAvenirs, Lockers Parks and Indian Golds in her stride. Race card and selections				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Serena return next week
 Serena is determined to reclaim top spot Indian Wells (California): Serena Williams confirmed she would make her long-awaited comeback following knee surgery at the Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami next week. It means a lot to me to come back because Ive been in a lot of pain watching others play while Ive been out, Serena said in a teleconference on Tuesday. I want to give it my all. Ive been feeling the hunger for quite some time. The American has not played competitively since winning the Wimbledon crown last July. She underwent knee surgery in August and has been sidelined since then due to her slow rehabilitation. She was unable to defend both her US and Australian Open titles and during her absence, she lost her world No. 1 ranking. Now ranked seventh in the world, the six-times Grand Slam champion said she was determined to reclaim the top spot from Belgiums Justine Henin-Hardenne. Maybe I have to work harder to get back to number one but I do like being there and dont like to see a different number next to my name, the 22-year-old said. Serena admitted she might be nervous when she steps on court next week but doubts she will be sitting outside of the top five for too long. Its going to be an adjustment, she said. Ive been away for some time and it would be naive to say there will be no adjustment. But If I didnt feel confident that I could get back to my level again, I would have no business returning. Of her main rivals on the tour, Serena said that Henin-Hardennes rise to the top had not surprised her. Shes been playing really well, Serena said. Justine is a great player but I still believe that you cant just look at one person, there lots of kids coming up, lots of good players out there. It was very discouraging to be in my position, she admitted. I wanted to play but the doctors said I should be focusing on my long-term career. I had to make a grown up decision not to go. I feel like Im in a little better shape now and am certainly looking better physically. Meanwhile, Kim Clijsters has been fitted with a brace for her injured left wrist and will apparently miss the tournament. Clijsters said on her website that an MRI showed she has a tendon tear on her left wrist. She is taking anti-inflammatory pills to keep the swelling down. I cant even manage to type in my diary, she said. I am trying to keep my form, but running with my brace on isnt easy. I have to be careful not to slip of course.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

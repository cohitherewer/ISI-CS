The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal soars to joint 21st finish
 - CALIFORNIA MEET 
 - Vijai coasts to 3-shot win  Atwal has earned $ 66,888 from just two outings on the USPGA Tour Pebble Beach (California): Arjun Atwal of Calcutta Sunday earned his best position yet in his short stay so far on the USPGA Tour, when he finished a very creditable joint 21st in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am meet. World number two Vijai Singh birdied the first three holes to forge clear of the field and then coasted to a three-shot victory. With a final-round 69, Singh completed the tournament on 16-under-par 272, three strokes in front of Jeff Maggert. Atwal collected a paycheque of $ 57,240 from the $ 5.3-million tourney at the Pebble Beach Golf Links, Poppy Hills Golf Course and Spyglass Hill Golf Course. For a rookie on the tour, this was not only his best finish, it was also his second consecutive cut in two starts. His fourth round was a two under par 70, that incorporated four birdies which offset his two bogeys and added to his other parred holes from his tenth-tee start. Atwal will now go over to San Diego to play in the Buick Invitational, to be played from February 12 to 15. Interestingly, in this short period, Atwal has moved to within the 126th to 150th rank in money winners on the Tour. So far he has earned $ 66,888 on the Tour, a small indication as to how much the USPGA Tour returns to the aspirant. Daniel Chopra, the India-born Swede, who had a good start, slipped in the final round to log a three over, finishing joint 25th at 285. Phil Mickelson finished alone in third place, a shot behind Maggert. Canadas Mike Weir, South Koreas K.J. Choi and third-round joint-leader Arron Oberholser tied for fourth on 279. Singh, who earned $ 954,000 for the victory, extended his streak of top-10 finishes to 12 tournaments dating back last Augusts WGC-NEC invitational. Jack Nicklaus holds the PGA Tour record of 14, a mark set in 1977. The Fijian has three victories and six other top-five finishes in the streak, is a combined 146-under-par and $ 5,016,683 richer. Singh has already earned $1,966,000 in the 2004 season. Im playing pretty good, Singh said. Im more concerned with how Im playing week-in and week-out. I want to be number one before I finish, but its hard to take Tiger (Woods) off the top. Singh gets his shot at Woods in the Buick Invitational on Thursday which will also feature Atwal.

				 																																	New Delhi: World amateur snooker champion Pankaj Advani, national champion Alok Kumar and Yasin Merchant registered their third straight wins to ensure a place in the knock-out phase of the Asian snooker championship being played at Aqaba, Jordan. Advani defeated Imram Shahzad of Pakistan 4-2 while Alok Kumar defeated Chih-Wei Ku of Chinese Taipei to book a place in the pre-quarter finals, according to information received here on Tuesday.				 																																	Former Asian champion Merchant had no problems blanking Sadr Idin Hussein of Iraq 4-0. 				 																																	Madrid: English champions Arsenal are poised to sign Celta Vigo goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, a spokesman for the Spanish club said on Tuesday.				 																																	Celta spokesman Sabino Lopez told sports daily Marca that the 27-year-old, who played on loan at Albacete in the Primera Liga last season, would join Arsenal, subject to a brief trial at the club.				 																																	Im really proud that a side like Arsenal have picked me out, Almunia told Marca. I knew that there had been some contact between the clubs, but I never expected this because I was convinced I would be playing with Celta in the second division next season.				 																																	San Jose: Jimmy Pedro retired from judo after a fifth-place showing at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but the 33-year-old American made a comeback that has resulted in a fourth try at Olympic gold.				 																																	Pedro qualified for the Athens Games here Saturday, claiming a berth at 73kg just 15 months after ending his two-and-a-half year retirement. The 1996 Olympic bronze medalist and 1999 world champion has gone 70-4 in his return to the mat.				 																																	Im on a mission. I have a purpose, Pedro said. If Athens plays out the way I hope, I will be utterly fulfilled.				 																																	London: An appeal by Danes against disqualification and relegation from the Davis Cup after security fears caused them to boycott a match in Algeria has been thrown out, tennis chiefs said on Monday.				 																																	The International Tennis Federations board of directors said it had considered the appeal by the Danish Tennis Federation of the sanctions imposed by the ITF Davis Cup Committee following Denmarks unjustified failure to compete in their second round tie against Algeria in April.				 																																	The Danes pulled out of their Davis Cup first round tie in Algiers due to what they considered poor security in the north African country and an increased risk towards Danes after the Iraq war, the Danish Tennis Association said at the time.				 																																	However the ITF ruled that the Danes be relegated to Group III in 2005. They also barred Denmark from the mens team competition for the rest of the 2004 season and that Denmark compensate Algeria for the costs incurred to stage the tie.				 																																	London: Greg Rusedski has been given a wildcard into the Wimbledon championships later this month, organisers said on Monday.				 																																	Rusedski, who was cleared of any doping offence in March despite having tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone, was one of four Britons given a place in the mens draw. Lee Childs, Jonathan Marray and Alex Bogdanovic were the other British men to have gained berths in the main draw.				 																																	In womens field, Switzerlands Patty Schnyder was handed an invite for the tournament which begins on June 21.Sport on ScreenSoccer: The Road to Euro 2004 from 8.30 am on STAR Sports

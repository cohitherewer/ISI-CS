The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Serena, Venus sent packing
 - Its Myskina vs Capriati, Dementieva vs Suarez in semis; Henman sets up date with Coria  Jennifer Capriati in full flow during her quarter final with Serena Williams on Tuesday. Capriati won 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 Paris: The Williams roadshow rumbled out of Roland Garros Tuesday after Venus and Serena were beaten in the French Open quarter finals. The sisters were unable to get going on a drizzly, dark day in the French capital. Serena, winner of that 2002 final, was beaten by fellow American Jennifer Capriati 3-6, 6-2, 3-6 in a tense match on centre court. Injured for much of the last year, the last time she failed to reach a Grand Slam semi-final was at Wimbledon in 2001. That wasnt professional  I was an amateur today, the former world No.1 and second seed said. Venus felt no better after losing to Anastasia Myskina and third seed Amelie Mauresmo was bitterly disappointed after crippling nerves in front of her home crowd handed victory to Elena Dementieva. It is the first time two Russian women have been in the semi-finals of a Grand Slam since tennis turned professional in 1968. Russian joy contrasted sharply with Williams despondency. I am so disappointed I could not at least get to the semis, but what can I say? Serena said. I mean, Im alive, Im breathing, Im healthy. Things could be worse. But obviously Im not happy. I guess we will both be on the same flight tomorrow, she added, referring to fourth seed Venus who lost her error-strewn match 3-6, 4-6. Were gonna pack our bags and leave, Venus agreed. Theres nothing left for us here anymore. Were going home. Myskina, beaten in the Australian Open quarters in January, will now face seventh seed Capriati in her first Grand Slam semi-final. In the other half of the draw, Argentine Paola Suarez thrashed Maria Sharapova of Russia 6-1, 6-3. She will face Dementieva for a place in the final. Ninth seed Dementieva beat local favourite Amelie Mauresmo 6-4, 6-3. The 22-year-old, a US Open semi-finalist in 2000, was more consistent than her opponent in a one-sided quarter final. Capriati, French champion in 2001, was delighted with her victory over Serena. Its about time, frankly, that I won one of these matches, she grinned. It wasnt the greatest quality match. We were both nervous but I just played a little bit better than she did. It was not hard. Serena never got going. She returned to the circuit only in March after an eight-month knee injury lay-off and signs of rust have been evident ever since. While she took to the court looking every bit a champion  resplendent in a pink cropped-top with a brilliant diamond flashing in her navel  her on-court craft could never live up to her showmanship. Both started tentatively and rather than the nerves settling, they got worse as the rain-interrupted match wore on. Having lost eight times in a row to Serena, Capriati beat her in the semi-finals of the Rome Masters in May.  Paola Suarez during her match against Maria Sharapova at Roland Garros.

Back on level terms, it was Serenas turn to disintegrate and she sloped off court, bitterly disappointed by a dismal display. I think this year I made it really tough on myself by not performing and by making a lot of errors and by just not keeping the ball in play, she said. Just basically not doing anything at a professional level. Venus could have felt no happier after a very poor performance against Myskina, playing in her first French quarter final. Despite her advantage in terms of experience, it was Venus who fell apart and the sixth-seeded Russian sealed victory in one hour 12 minutes. Mens quarter finals Defying all odds, on a dank and drizzly day, Tim Henman became the first British man in more than 40 years to reach the French Open semis when he beat 22nd seed Juan Ignacio Chela (Argentina) 6-2, 6-4, 6-4. He will meet another Argentine, third seed Guillermo Coria, who confirmed his status as favourite after ousting former champion Carlos Moya 7-5, 7-6, 6-3 to reach the last four. (Reuters)  Copyright

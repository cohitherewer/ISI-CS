The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Holland test a boon for India
 Stickwork / Gurbux Singh This three-Test series versus  Holland (in Hyderabad on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday)  is a god-sent opportunity for us. Just about a month away  are the Madrid Olympic qualifiers, and here we are able  to test our mettle against one of the strongest European  teams, also one of the teams in the qualifiers, though in  a different group. This is an opportunity to really  try and get the complement of 21 that the Indian Hockey  Federation has announced for the series. We should be able  to test all these players in different combinations in the  matches, without the compulsion that we must win, because  this is not a tournament. All old-timers except the injured  are back in the 21. We will miss seniors like Baljit Singh  Saini, Dhanraj Pillay and Deepak Thakur  while we keep  missing the spirit of Jugraj Singh  but it is from these  Tests that we will have to make up our minds on the composition  for the qualifiers as well as for the Olympics proper. We  need to take this series as a preparation for the Olympic  Games proper, so that the best team goes to the qualifiers. The best of whomever we will send  to the qualifiers will have to form the nucleus of our Olympic  team, and there is little scope for any Azlan Shah-like  experimentation. For one, I am happy that we will  be taking on a good opposition. Holland are bringing their  full team, which shows how serious they are about this series.  Their coach is the famous Terry Walsh, and as if that were  not enough, the legendary Ties Kruize is coming too. They  are taking no chances. If they find India worth testing  against, it is surely a boost for our hockey. We will see in India one of the  best penalty corner specialists of the world in Bram Lomans,  who along with Sohail Abbas and Jorge Lombi of Argentina  rate way above anybody else today.  Other stars include Karel Klaver,  who is also a penalty corner specialist and prolific scorers  Toun de Nooije and Jeroen Delmere. Holland play in the traditional  European style and in the 1-3-3-3 formation, along with  Germany. However, unlike Germany and Britain, this super-fit  team plays attacking, open hockey, as do Spain.  Germany and Britain are more on  the defensive side. This makes the Holland team a delight  to watch. Comparatively, you dont really enjoy German hockey. India havent performed too badly  against Holland in the recent past, including the last Champions  Trophy where we were actually into a big lead before the  Dutch struck back. It is because the Dutch format allows  you to play. Their open hockey lets you in far while they  go out in attack. They have a great deal of confidence in  their attack. The Netherlands, arguably, is  the only country in Europe which attaches great importance  to hockey, its popularity lies just somewhere below that  of soccer. In Amsterdam itself there are at least 32 astroturfs.  No other country in the world, except to an extent Australia,  promotes hockey so much. India and Pakistan are nowhere  close to that. Holland also dont have this body-play  as the South Koreans do, and they admire Indian hockey. The Aussies play Indian style  attacking hockey and they are fit. Same way, Holland are  fit and play European style attacking hockey. After the disastrous Kuala Lumpur  trip we need to regroup and reassess our strength for the  Olympics.  Coach Rajinder Singh has proved  himself successful in traditional attacking hockey. Let  the same style or system continue. It is too late or risky  now to try and change the style. Ninety per cent of the  boys Rajinder has been coaching with the senior team (since  2002) he had trained when he was coach at the junior World  Cup. The boys have a great rapport with him and he knows  the boys only too well. The seniors have adjusted too. It  is an association of more than three-four years old. That  is good. There are a few areas we need  to look into, though. Firstly, we must strengthen our defence.  Lately, we have conceded too many late goals (despite taking  early leads), ruining our chances in key matches. Secondly, with ace drag-flicker  Jugraj out of action, we must find a solution to the penalty  corner conversion rate. One of the best in hitting is Dilip  Tirkey, and in this 21, Len Ayappa and Dhillon are the drag  flickers who are somewhat okay. Jugraj had earned a reputation  that put fear into the opponents. It will be better for  the coach to try more variations of the indirect. Maybe  these Tests are a good time to try that. Indias field goal conversion  has been more than satisfactory, so this indirect method  just might click. Here, again, Thakur will be missed in  the Tests. Also, if we can strengthen the midfield, a lot  of problems will be solved. Lastly, we must not get carried  away with arguments. A player out with a yellow card simply  does not help.  We should attempt to make the  most of this home Test series. We can take foreign trips  by the dozens, but a home series gets you far closer to  reality. After all, the Olympics is the final goal.

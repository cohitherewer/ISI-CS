 India to opt for attack vs Aussies 
 - AZLAN SHAH MEET - We have not done all that badly, insists coach Harendra  Baljit Singh Dhillon doesnt want to aggravate his injury Kuala Lumpur: An overwhelming desire to prove their detractors wrong should be a motivation enough for a youthful Indian team that will go up against a tough Australian side in the seven-nation Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here on Tuesday. A lot of people wrote this team off saying it was a second string and a junior side. But if you were to go by the results, then I think it shows that despite the two narrow defeats and a draw in three games, we have not done all that badly, said coach Harendra Singh as the Indian players enjoyed a days break. Of course, we were disappointed that we could not beat Malaysia last night despite being in a winning position. And though a draw is better than a defeat, I thought we had the game in our grasp. But we let it slip, the coach lamented. Looking ahead to the game against Australia, Harendra said: Previously, we used to get nervous at the prospect of playing against a big team like Australia. But this bunch of Indian players has little regard for the reputation of their opponents, and their body language reflects their confidence. The Aussies, who are without several key players, especially Jamie Dwyer and Paul Gaudoin, due to injuries, have looked a below-par side in this tournament, and the Indians are only too aware of it. We know for a fact that the Australians have not been playing as well as we expected, but still they are a tough side. I expect another close match, like it was against Germany and Pakistan whom the critics had predicted would beat us by big margins, Harendra said. He felt that a win against Malaysia would have made a huge difference, but said a couple of mistakes in the defence helped the home team draw level. But against Australia, we will continue to play attacking hockey. We are aware that the Aussies always like to score early and seize the initiative. So, our tactics would be much the same, he said. Australian coach Barry Dancer has been saying at every opportunity that he was not too concerned about the results in this tournament. We are still in the process of carrying out experiments as our main target is to win the gold medal at the Athens Olympics this August. I am giving all the 18 players a chance to play here so that I will be able to assess them and then shortlist a contingent for the Olympics.  Injured Dhillon out Meanwhile, Indias top forward Baljit Singh Dhillon is unlikely to take any further part in the meet after suffering a fracture in his nose during the game against Malaysia. Harendra said on Monday that though the doctors have left the choice to Dhillon, he was not inclined to risk aggravation of the injury by playing in any of the remaining three matches.

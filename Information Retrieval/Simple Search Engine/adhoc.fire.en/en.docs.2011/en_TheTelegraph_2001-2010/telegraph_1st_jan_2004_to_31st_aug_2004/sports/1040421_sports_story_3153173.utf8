The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pakistan drub Singapore 9-0
Karachi: Hosts Pakistan and Malaysia registered thumping wins on the opening day of the ten-nation Junior Asia Cup hockey tournament on Tuesday. Penalty-corner specialist Imran Warsi scored four goals including the first hattrick of the tournament in Pakistans 9-0 demolition of Singapore in Group A while Malaysia downed Sri Lanka 6-0 in Group B at the Pakistan Hockey Club. China rallied to draw 2-2 against Bangladesh in Group B. India, placed in Group B, will open their campaign in the tournament against China on Wednesday. The event serves as the regional qualifying tournament from where top three teams will get berths in next years Junior World Cup in Amstelveen, Netherlands. The Pakistan match saw the hosts opening through Wasri in the 14th minute but squander as many as six golden chances to score in the first half. Pakistan led 4-0 in the first half with one more goal from Warsi and one each from Tariq Aziz and Yasir Islam. We need to do better on penalty corners in tough matches, especially against South Korea and India, Pakistan coach Asif Bajwa said. Pakistan were on the rampage in the second half, scoring five with Warsi hitting two more in 57th and 65th minute. Tariq Aziz, Akhtar Ali and Kashif Yaqoob completed the rout as Singapore failed to stop the Pakistanis.

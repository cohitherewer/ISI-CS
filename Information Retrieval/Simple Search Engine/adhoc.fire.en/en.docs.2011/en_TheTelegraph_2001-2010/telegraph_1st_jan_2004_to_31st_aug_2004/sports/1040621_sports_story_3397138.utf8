 Harika upsets Prakash
Vijayawada: Awaiting her Womens Grandmaster title, countrys youngest ever Womens International Master D. Harika of Andhra Pradesh sprang a major surprise in defeating triple GM norm holder G. B. Prakash in the fifth round of 42nd national B chess championship here Sunday. Harika now shares the lead with G. N. Gopal of Kerala and B. S. Shivanandan of Karnataka, who all are on 5 points from their five games. As many as eight players including top seed GM R. B. Ramesh of Petroleum Sports Control Board and former champion IM Sriram Jha of LIC are close on the heels of leaders with 4.5 points each in their kitty. Seven more rounds remain in this prestigious event that will select 14 qualifiers to the next national A chess championship. Harika took full advantage of a pawn sacrificed by Prakash, who is waiting to touch 2,500 on elo rating list to become a GM. Taking control of the proceedings, Harika, certainly the biggest sensation of the state since the advent of Koneru Humpy, made no mistakes to romp home. Youngster G. N. Gopal continued with his dream run and outmanoeuvred IM norm holder Abhijit Gupta.  (PTI)  Copyright

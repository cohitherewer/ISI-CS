 Senator wants Khan, Bari exit
Islamabad: After the resignation of Rameez Raja as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive, demand for the head of chairman Shaharyar Khan and chief selector Wasim Bari is gaining ground. Senator Muhammad Enver Baig has called upon the two officials to follow in the footsteps of Rameez and step down, saying managing cricket was beyond them. Shaharyar and Bari should quit because this is the demand of the people of Pakistan, he was quoted as saying in local daily Dawn. Rameez quit his post on Saturday, citing pressing commitments as a TV commentator in the season ahead. Baig urged the PCB patron and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to appoint a fresh team of officials who know the technicalities of the game. If he wants to see allround improvement, he should bring in new people. (PTI)  Copyright

 Revolt against cruel policies of Rameez
Islamabad: Slamming the cruel policies of Rameez Raja, six local associations have served an ultimatum to the PCB to begin negotiations for redressal of their grievances by May 21 or face an agitation. At a joint press conference here on Tuesday, the representatives of the six came down on the chief executive and demanded restoration of general body and the rights they enjoyed three years ago. Rameezs policies have reduced the associations to mere dummies, said the representatives, who claimed support of 90 per cent of the associations. If the PCB does not settle our issues, we would meet the President of Pakistan and stage a sit-in in front of the PCB headquarter besides moving court, a local daily quoted them as saying.

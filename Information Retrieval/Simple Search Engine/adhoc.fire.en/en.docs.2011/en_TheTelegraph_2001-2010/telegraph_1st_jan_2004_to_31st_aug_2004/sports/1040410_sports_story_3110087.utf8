The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wont treat Rawalpindi differently: Sourav
 - 3RD TEST - Yuvraj set to open in place of Chopra; Nehra may replace Agarkar  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav says hes most happy when busy with strategy Lahore: Come Tuesday and Sourav Gangulys forced two-Test break from the captaincy ends. The restlessness  driven by a desire to be in the thick of action  is also going to end in Rawalpindi. Ive always been comfortable with the captaincy and Im most happy when busy with strategy, Sourav told The Telegraph on Friday evening. However, he disagreed that the third and final Test, four days from now, could become the toughest in four years as captain. Just earlier this year, it was 1-1 before Sydney and that Test turned out to be extraordinarily competitive... So, I dont think Rawalpindi should be treated very differently, Sourav pointed out. While theres no formula to beat Pakistan, the Team India captain feels runs on the board will make a big difference. As he put it: The story here (in the second Test) would have been different had we got at least 400 in the first innings... We didnt and paid the price. Endorsing Rahul Dravids decision to bat, Sourav said: I would have done the same... Batting is our strength and the captain must back that. All we had to do was weather the opening two hours. Thereafter, Pakistan would have had done all the running... Besides Yuvraj Singh (revelation of this Test series), Sourav praised Virender Sehwag (he has climbed one step more towards greatness), Parthiv Patel (plenty of character), Irfan Pathan (continues to impress) and Lakshmipathy Balaji (our workhorse). He declined to speak about the change as he returns to the XI, but sources confirmed that Akash Chopra is set to be dropped and Yuvraj is going to open (with Sehwag). Moreover, theres a possibility of Ashish Nehra replacing Ajit Agarkar. Incidentally, in the afternoon, Sourav had two sessions with the bowling machine at the National Cricket Academys Indoor School. In between, he spent 45 minutes at the gym. Though it was a day off, V.V.S. Laxman and Mohammed Kaif also worked out at the state-of-art facility. Pakistan, of course, dont intend losing the momentum after drawing level in such emphatic fashion. And, towards that end, had a full nets session at the Gaddafi  something which certainly impressed Sourav. What? Dont tell me the Pakistan team is here... he exclaimed in disbelief, on turning up at the Pakistan Cricket Board HQ after two hours at the Academy. Now, perhaps, Sourav will be fired up that much more. Meanwhile, according to Board chief executive Rameez Raja, former captain Waqar Younis is going to be given a farewell on the eve of the Rawalpindi Test. Details are being finalised, but the send-off is likely to be over lunch. Balaji a superhit Believe it or not, Balaji was a superhit (to quote Rameez) at an interactive session organised by the high-profile Lahore University of Management Sciences on Friday afternoon. The turnout kept chanting his name and... Rameez, himself quite taken aback, informed. Among those upstaged, by the way, was Dravid. Well, believe it or not.  Copyright

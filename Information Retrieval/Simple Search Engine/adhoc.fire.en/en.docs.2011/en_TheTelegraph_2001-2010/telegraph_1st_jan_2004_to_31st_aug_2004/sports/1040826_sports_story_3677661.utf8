The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Holland beat Germany to final
Athens: Holland overcame a fighting Germany 3-2 in the semi-final to set themselves on course for a hattrick of Olympic mens hockey titles on Wednesday. Holland, gold medallists in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and 2000 Sydney Games, rallied back superbly after being a goal down as early in the third minute to move into the final. Proving their superiority in the clash of the European powerhouses, Holland slammed home through Teake Taekema (6th minute), Marten Eikelboom (47th) and Teun de Nooijer (51st). Germanys spirited challenge was made possible thorugh the strikes of Matthias Witthaus, who gave them the lead early on, and Christoph Bechmann (59th). The semi-final got to a shocking start with Germany taking the lead in the third minute when they slammed home from their very first move into the opposition circle. The celebrations following the Witthaus goal had hardly died down when Holland struck back through a penalty stroke which they earned when German skipper Florian Kunj was hit on the leg on the goalline from the first penalty corner of the match. A defensive approach made the forwards work hard to penetrate into each others circle, which was finally broken when Holland took the lead following Eikelbooms field goal 12 minutes into the second half. An attack down the right saw Holland getting a free hit on the right backline and then the hit across was mis-trapped by German defenders which was swept in by Eikelboom. Four minutes later, Holland stretched the lead when De Nooijer after a fine move on the left in combination with Eikelboom slammed home to put his side in the box seat. Germany bounced back when Bechmann reduced the margin following some sloppy defensive work by the Dutch defenders. Bechmann was left unmarked in the circle on the left post and a long pass found him alone for an easy, but well executed tap in. Earlier, in classification ties, Britain got the better of Argentina 4-1, while South Africa beat Egypt 5-1 in the 9-12 play-offs.  (PTI)  Copyright

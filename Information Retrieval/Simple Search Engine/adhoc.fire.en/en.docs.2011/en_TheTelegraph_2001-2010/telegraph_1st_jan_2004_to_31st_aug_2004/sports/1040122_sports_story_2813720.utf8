The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Innocent mistake, says Wright
 John Wright Sydney: Coach John Wright and former teammate Jawagal Srinath jumped to the support of Rahul Dravid on Wednesday, after the Indian vice-captain was fined half of his match fees for changing the condition of the ball during Tuesdays tri-series match against Zimbabwe.  John Wright: It was an innocent mistake. During  the drinks break the players have these energy sweets. Rahul  was shining the ball with saliva, at the same time as eating  a sweet. He didnt realise that until he looked down and  saw that yellow stain on the ball. Thats when he tried  to wipe it out. And then you saw him wipe the ball. Actually he tried to remove that substance. He is upset about it because he is a man of integrity. I have worked with Rahul for about four years now and he is what cricket is all about. Everyone knows what Rahul Dravid is all about and what he stands for. Its the day and age of referees, we have to accept their judgements and cope with it. When you have rules, I suppose they were in a situation where they have to act. We are behind Rahul.  Jawagal Srinath: He was just trying to clean  the ball. There was absolutely nothing wrong in what he  did. I think its total exaggeration. It (the penalty) was  definitely not called for. Youve got to see the intent  of the player, not just the action. His intentions were  harmless. Knowing that he is a gentleman, I think it was too harsh. Weve had a similar incident before with Sachin Tendulkar. If you look at those two and the way they have played the game over the years, its not their style.  Ricky Ponting: There have  been a lot of these issues coming up over the last couple  of years, different players have been suspended and fined.  Its one thing we are very conscious of, I dont think youll  see us do anything like that. (PTI)  Copyright

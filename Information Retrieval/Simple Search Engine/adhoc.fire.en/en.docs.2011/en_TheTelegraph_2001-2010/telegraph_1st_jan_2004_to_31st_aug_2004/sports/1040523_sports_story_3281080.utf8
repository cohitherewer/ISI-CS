The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussains days may be numbered
 FROM MARTIN JOHNSON IN LONDON  Nasser Hussain is under pressure after Strauss century Most people would regard his double century at The Oval in 1976, against Michael Holding and Andy Roberts in their pomp, as the highlight of Dennis Amiss Test career, but the man himself would probably single out his 138 not out against New Zealand at Trent Bridge three years earlier. Greater achievement hath no man than to be involved in a run-out with Geoffrey Boycott and be the perpetrator rather than the victim. It is alleged, as Boycott sat smouldering on the balcony watching Amiss tucking into a pretty ordinary attack, that Boycs spent the entire innings muttering: Its ma bloody roons hes scoring out there. Ma bloody roons. It brought tears to the eyes of everyone in the England dressing room, and one or two were probably clutching their ribs as well. Friday at Lords, under slightly different circumstances, Andrew Strauss gratefully helped himself to the runs that might otherwise have belonged to Michael Vaughan, and on the basis that it will be tough to get rid of a man who has just made a century in his maiden Test innings, Vaughan can now be pensioned off with grateful thanks for his services, and best wishes for his new career with Yorkshire. Vaughans 13 matches in charge dont exactly qualify as an era, but its 12 more than Christopher Cowdrey was given, and poor old Derek Pringle lasted only 2 1/2 sessions when England, in the summer of 1988, were more or less offering the captaincy as a prize on Jimll Fix It. Its also about time Vaughan was given a chance to play for Yorkshire again, as the only way to get a game for your county nowadays is to get yourself dropped from the England team. The player who is really at risk from Strauss innings, of course, is Nasser Hussain, who was at pains to point out recently his record of coming in to rescue his team with the scoreboard reading something like 10 for two. But the gritty nudge and push is not quite so crucial when youre striding in (as he would have been on Friday but for the employment of a nightwatchman) at 239 for two. Besides which, Robert Key is knocking at the door again with three centuries in a week, and there also whispers around the circuit about a promising youngster at Worcester by the name of Hick. And if England win this Test match, what about Marcus Trescothick? The stand-in captain has barely put a foot wrong here, which makes a change from critics of his batting complaining that he barely puts a foot anywhere. When Strauss makes a century, the word waltz rarely fails to make it into the headline, but if Trescothick attempted an evening of waltzing, there would be a lengthy queue outside the chiropodist the following morning. Trescothick played pretty well for his 86, but once someone gets a label, its hard to shake off. Which is why hell just have to grin and bear it, and even make a few bob from it when his Test career is over by signing up for a remake of Reach For The Sky, in Kenneth Mores Douglas Bader role.

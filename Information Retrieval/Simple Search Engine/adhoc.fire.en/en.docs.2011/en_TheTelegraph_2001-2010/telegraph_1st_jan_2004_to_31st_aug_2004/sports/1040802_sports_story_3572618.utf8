The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dalmiya appears headed for patrons chair
 - BCCI constitution has provision for post  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Colombo: Jagmohan Dalmiya, it seems, is going to be given the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) patrons chair when his three-year term as president ends next month. The post, though, wont be ornamental and he will be given the job of representing the country at the International Cricket Council (ICC). Dalmiya is a former world body chief and currently heads the Asian Cricket Council. According to The Telegraphs sources, the BCCIs constitution (actually, the Memorandum and Regulations) has provision for a patron  only, nobody could confirm whether, in the distant past, somebody actually held that post. In recent times, of course, there has been no patron. Thanks to that provision, an amendment to the constitution wont be necessary. However, Dalmiyas responsibilities are going to be spelt out, possibly at a special general meeting ahead of the AGM. The appointment, though, will be at the AGM. That theres a move to reward and honour Dalmiya, arguably the sub continents most powerful sports administrator, was first reported in these columns almost two months ago. Incidentally, the initiative has been taken by the Assam Cricket Association. Sources indicated that everything should be clear at the next working committee meeting, in a fortnights time.

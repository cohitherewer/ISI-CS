The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Melbourne desperate to get on par with the other Slams
 - Time will come when the Open gets shifted to a more player-friendly time  FROM MARTIN JOHNSON IN SYDNEY  Martina Hingis was almost barbecued alive in the womens final three years ago The Australian Open tennis championship, like the US PGA in golf, is the least prestigious of the four Majors, largely because it is too close to Christmas and too far from anywhere. The players are not at their sharpest, and the title occasionally goes to someone with all the charisma and box-office appeal of Thomas Johansson. It is difficult to imagine it happening to Andre Agassi or Lleyton Hewitt, but two years ago Johanssons courtesy car failed to turn up to ferry him to the final and he had to phone for a taxi. The players themselves complain that they are too tired after a long season to give this tournament their best, but before we reach for the Kleenex the fact is that no one has to play for more than 25 weeks a year for ranking purposes, and the fatigue is more the result of being unable to resist the ludicrous money on offer from the glut of Mickey Mouse invitational. Melbourne is constantly being lobbied to move to a more player-friendly time of year, but has so far resisted. After all, Down Under this is the equivalent of mid-July, but one day they will shift it because the annual withdrawal of high-profile names (mostly in the womens draw this year) does not sit comfortably with Australias insatiable craving for international recognition. It comes with the geography, but it irks them beyond measure that they barely rate a mention in the wider world unless a bush fire is engulfing Sydney Harbour Bridge, or some television wildlife celebrity is dangling his new-born child directly above the jaws of a salt-water crocodile. However, if the Australian Open were to be moved from the height of their summer, it would have the tragic effect of removing one of sports most fascinating innovations. We are talking, of course, about the wet bulbglobe temperature, which is a device intended to prevent players requiring more serious medical attention than a cold flannel in the St John Ambulance tent. The wet bulb globe is described as a combination of the ambient air temperature, humidity, intensity of solar radiation, and wind speed and comes into play when the mercury hits 35C or above. No one is quite sure whether the data comes from a human, or a machine manned by a manic, Magnus Pike-type boffin on the Melbourne Park roof, but it came in after Jennifer Capriati and Martina Hingis were almost barbecued alive in the womens final three years ago. There is nothing like this at Wimbledon, where weather alerts consist of nothing more sophisticated than Alan Mills peering up at the sky for a potential cloudburst, but the oddity of the wet bulb globe is that it only comes into play before a match begins. Ergo, once someone has served at 0-0 and 15-love in the opening set, they carry on even if conditions become such that a lizard would be persuaded to wear a corked hat. Many of the players put on ice-jackets between changeovers, though it is cooler for the floodlit evening sessions, when the equivalent of the Wimbledon Centre Court pigeon is an invasion of moths. These creatures are not intelligent enough to steer clear of the heavyweight matches, and in a game between Lindsay Davenport and Amelie Mauresmo, the audible crunch of squashed insect is not for the squeamish. There are many other differences compared with Wimbledon, not least the more liberal attitude to advertising. They are proud of their tennis heroes to have named the Centre Court after Rod Laver, but not so immune to the lure of cash to have been able to resist naming their No. 1 Court after a mobile-phone company. Another contrast is the decorum of spectators. While the All England Club in June will reverberate to nothing more raucous than a collective cry of Cmon Tim!, Open crowds will let the line judges have it if they are not on their game. Last year, after one of the officials had remained motionless for a succession of balls that looked to be out, there was an anguished cry of: Someone wake the bugger up! They will be at their most animated, of course, when Hewitt is on court. Australian patriotism is one of the most virulent viruses known to man, as an American journalist discovered at the Sydney Olympics when a packed commuter train  having been informed that Australia had won the gold in the water polo  burst into a spontaneous chorus of Waltzing Matilda. One thing you dont have to worry about at the Australian Open, though, is rain. If the forecast is bad, they just shut the roof, which precludes any possibility of the crowd having to spend an afternoon listening to Rolf Harris and his didgeridoo. Which is why Wimbledon has commissioned a roof of its own. After the duet between Sir Cliff and Martina, it was a European Commission directive on humanitarian grounds.

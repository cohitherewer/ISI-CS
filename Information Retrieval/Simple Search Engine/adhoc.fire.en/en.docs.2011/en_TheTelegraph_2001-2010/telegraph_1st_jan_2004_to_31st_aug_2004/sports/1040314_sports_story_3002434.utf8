 Oram hits maiden ton
 New Zealands Jacob Oram celebrates his century on the fourth day of the first Test against South Africa in Hamilton on Saturday. (Reuters) Hamilton: Jacob Oram hit his maiden Test century as New Zealand scored 509, a first innings lead of 50, before South Africa checked their progress on the fourth day of the first Test on Saturday. South Africa arrested the slide with a partnership of 92 between Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis and at close of play, with Gibbs out, they were 134 for three, a lead of 84. Kallis was unbeaten on 56 and Neil McKenzie on 11. Oram finished unbeaten on 119 when New Zealand were all out early in the afternoon session in reply to South Africas first innings total of 459. He reached his first Test hundred off 191 balls in 276 minutes and hit 16 fours on a pitch that had an awkward crumbling patch at one end. Its the toughest Ive ever had to play spinners, Oram said. That area of the pitch cuts down the number of shots youd like to play against someone like Paul Adams, and you had to be very watchful. Oram said he thought New Zealand could still win the Test. If we get a couple of wickets in the morning anything can happen. If it comes down to a chase then I would back us to do it. South Africa were quickly in trouble in their second innings when they lost captain Graeme Smith, who waved at a ball from Daryl Tuffey and got a faint edge to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum for five. One run later, left-hander Jacques Rudolph was bowled by Chris Cairns and Gibbs and Kallis came together with South Africa reeling at 16 for two. The pair batted commendably as they attempted to wrest the initiative away from New Zealand. Gibbs finally succumbed for 47 to the off-spin of Paul Wiseman, getting an edge through to McCullum, who juggled twice before securing the catch. Kallis reached his second half-century of the match and soon after survived a caught-behind off Craig McMillans bowling when on 52 in the penultimate over of the day. A number of records fell during the day with New Zealands total of 509 their biggest against South Africa, beating the 505 scored at Cape Town in 1953-54. Shaun Pollocks two wickets in two balls to end the innings equalled Alan Donalds record for South Africa of 330.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia brace in 3-1 win
 - NFL - East Bengal move atop standings; Salgaocar duo among three red-carded  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia is congratulated by Bijen Singh after his first goal versus Salgaocar at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Picture bySantosh Ghosh Calcutta: Savio Madiera was wary of the dazzling East Bengal trio  and it was proved beyond doubt on Sunday that his fears were not misplaced. Salgaocar had no answer to the brilliance of Bhaichung Bhutia, Mike Okoro and Cristiano Junior  getting thrashed 1-3 in their first return-leg match of the National Football League at Salt Lake Stadium. Bhutia was at his opportunistic best, scoring two, while Subhas Chakraborty put the icing on the cake. Bello Rassaq scored the consolation goal for the Goa side. The win took East Bengal to the top of the table with 24 points from 12 games following Dempos draw in Margao. Salgaocar stay on 17. This victory ended East Bengals three-match losing streak against Salgaocar. The city giants were without some of their stars, but as always, the strong reserve bench saw them through. Sunday too, Mahesh Gawli fitted in beautifully to the role of defensive screen, thus blunting most of the Salgaocar moves. Also, Felix Ibrebu, their star striker, got involved in a scuffle with Dipak Mondal in the seventh minute itself and the duo was red-carded. East Bengal managed to cover Mondals absence, but Ibrebu was too big a loss for the Goa side. They lacked the penetration in attack and once they conceded the second goal, it was a battle uphill for them. To add to Salgaocars woes, Rassaq was sent off in the 70th minute for hitting Bhutia on his forehead. The red-and-gold brigade had Junior and Okoro operating from a little deep. Bhutia played as the single striker, but East Bengal excelled in the way they increased men in attack. More often than not, they were numerically superior in the penetrative zone, making life difficult for the Goa side. East Bengal took the lead in the fifth minute itself, courtesy, a horrible fumble by Rajat Ghosh Dastidar. Okoros powerful right-footer popped out of Ghosh Dastidars hands and Bhutia had the presence of mind to follow the ball and tap in. Salgaocar were lucky not to concede another, but they slowly started to make their presence felt. After failing to get in through the space created by Mondals absence in the defence, they started to stretch the game through the wings. Dharamjit Singh was quite a livewire, shuffling his position and sending in floaters. In fact, it was a Dharamjit centre from the right that resulted in the equaliser in the 40th minute. He curled the ball in and Rassaq sneaked in behind the defenders to head in. They could have conceded another three minutes later when Dharamjits cross from the left found Jules Aliba in the clear, but the Chad player missed an open net. East Bengal reclaimed the lead in the 45th minute itself, Junior being the supplier. His through caught the Salgaocar defence in one line and Bhutia was prompt enough to put the ball in over an onrushing Ghosh Dastidars head. East Bengal cut off the Salgaocar supply-line to great effect in the second half, and their defence was hardly tested. Okoro and Junior combined excellently in the middle-third and the steady flow of attacks always put the rival defence on the tenterhooks. Okoros touch-play and the utilisation of free-zone lit up the afternoon  and the third goal was always coming. Chakraborty got a pass from the Nigerian just outside the box and his right-footer took a wicked deflection to beat the rival keeper on the far post. Douglas da Silva came in as a substitute in the 85th minute of the second session, to the applause of the 40,000 odd who had gathered at the stadium. He returned to action after more than two months, following an injury in his right knee. Bhutia, who had three stiches on his forehead following his scuffle with Rassaq, said after the match that it is the team effort which is taking East Bengal through. Were really playing as a team. I hope this continues, Bhutia said. The dope tests that the AIFF has initiated for the NFL is a step in the right direction, feels the Indian captain. People shouldnt get away with cheatingIts for the betterment of the game, he said. Incidentally, Gurjinder Singh of Salgaocar and M. Suresh of East Bengal were called for dope tests on Sunday after the match. TEAMS East Bengal: Sangram Mukherjee, Dipak Mondal, M. Suresh, Sur Kumar Singh, S.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Im not on mission to help Indians
	 - AKRAMS PRESENCE IN AUSTRALIA  Akram says the charges amuse him Adelaide, Jan. 24 (PTI): Legendary fast bowler Wasim Akram is amused at the hell that has broken out in Pakistan over his helping out left-armer Irfan Pathan and other Indian bowlers in recent times. Akram said it was laughable even to think he would be teaching Indians the secrets of the reverse-swing. As a senior cricketer if somebody comes to me for tips, I am not going to turn him away. I did the same with Australias Nathan Bracken so why helping Pathan is being turned into an issue? Akram asked on Saturday. The latest controversy emerges from concerns of former cricketer Javed Miandad, who expressed worries that Akram could be letting out trade secrets by helping Indians ahead of their historic tour of Pakistan. Look what I am worried about is that he doesnt give them tips on how to play the reverse-swing. I hope he is not doing it, Miandad was quoted in a Pakistan daily. An exasperated Akram said he was only helping a budding cricketer and things about nationalities and other such matters were farthest from his mind. I am only helping a budding cricketer, a young fast bowler, who has shown promise and is keen to learn. Its not as if I am on a mission or I am being paid for my services. Akram asserted: I take pride in having played for Pakistan and served my nation to the best of my ability. But I am no longer active and have to carry on living as I deem fit. There is no intention or motive in my actions other than helping out those who approach me for bowling tips, he said On Miandads fears Akram said: This is stretching the matter too far. I am not on a mission to help out the Indians.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Adaptation the key: Oltmans
 SUJIT BHAR  Gerhard Rach instructs his wards Athens: There has been a lot of talk as to how much and what one needs for Indian hockey to be able to stand on its own feet again. Astroturf is a problem that needs to be overcome, and this is the burning issue. But more importantly, it seems better organisation can bring about solid upgradation. Things are getting curiouser and curiouser. The Dutch have an Australian coach  Terry Walsh. Pakistan have a Dutch coach  Oltmans Roelant. India have a German coach  Gerhard Rach. But the basics have remained the same. Rule changes are good, because many of these changes make the game easier to understand, for the player, for the umpires and, most importantly, for the spectators, Walsh said. He believes that rules have to change for the game to remain dynamic. Oltmans minces no words when saying: These are people who may have won gold way back in the fifties and dont want change. Hockey has changed forever and you just will have to adapt. Strong words, but true. The world is looking different. Of course I can say that in my country (The Netherlands) there are synthetic turfs for almost everybody who wants to play hockey, said Oltmans. But the pitch isnt the only thing. You must have constant competition, tough ones at that.  To an extent Rach agrees: You need to be able to see those kids in action more often to be able to pick them up. Scott Goodheart, former player and an FIH commentator and expert, says he believes the pitch factor is the key. I know for a fact that India are unbeatable, still, on grass. We have a club in Western Australia, called the Hotspurs, and we travel on invitation meets around the world and play good hockey, he says. I remember last year we had been to Singapore for a six-a-side meet and we had in our ranks four of the top players who have played in Athens  Robert Hammond, Nathan Eglington, Matthew Wells and Troy Elder. We played Indian Airlines in the semi-finals and just could not beat them, remembers Scott. Australia does have a good number of pitches in their cities. But overall, maybe there are somewhere in the region of 50 to 60 pitches, Scott says. Now thats something to work on. Hockey is big, but is becoming bigger Down Under. The main reason for this is the Australian Institute of Sports, dealing with many Olympic events. They have very specialised coaching facilities for juniors from any of the seven states. It reminds one of the Sports Authority of India, with possibly a better plan on paper. It is a different matter that in practice it is an administrative disaster. The popularity factor comes in big. With the sponsors now putting in a lot of money  Indias Sahara Group is a sponsor partner with the FIH  television needs to be appeased. Hence the India-Pakistan series end-September (four Tests in each country). Will that work? If you ask me, says Oltmans, we (Pakistan) should be playing a series with Holland and you (India) should be playing one with Germany instead, or vice-versa. But this series will help propagate the sport to many more areas in the two countries. That will help. Oltmans, who will guide the Pakistan team through the series before he launches into the Champions Trophy, has a contract with the Pakistan Hockey Federation till January 1, 2005. At this point he is thinking what to do with that. For Rach, the situation depends on the administration. And what about the rule changes? Are they taking hockey more towards television? I hope rule changes arent for TV only. Just to get more people to watch and like the game, says Scott.  Rach believes its the same for both sides, and Walsh says that too. Long way to go for Indian hockey, yet.  Copyright

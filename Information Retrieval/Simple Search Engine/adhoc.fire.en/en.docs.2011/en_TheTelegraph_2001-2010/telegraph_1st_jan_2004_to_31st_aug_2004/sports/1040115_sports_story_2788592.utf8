 Sehwag ensures bonus point
 - Disciplined India get past Zimbabwe with lots to spare  TRI SERIES
 ZIMBABWE
 208-6 (50 ovs)
 INDIA
 211-3 (37.4 ovs) Hobart: Virender Sehwag  slammed a cavalier 90 as India produced a disciplined performance  to crush Zimbabwe by seven wickets and record their first  victory in the tri-series on Wednesday. Sehwag struck five fours and five sixes and dominated the 130-run first wicket stand with Sachin Tendulkar as India comfortably overhauled Zimbabwes modest 208 for six in 37.4 overs to collect six points, including a bonus. Tendulkar, who scored 44 off 60 balls, was content to give the strike to his junior partner. Sehwags runs came from 102 balls. In his and Tendulkars approach there was a calm determination which has come to characterise Indias performance on this tour. Zimbabwe were never comfortable after winning the toss and owed their decent total to skipper Heath Streak and Sean Ervine. The two added 93 in an unfinished seventh wicket stand in 12 overs and the skipper top-scored with an unbeaten 59. The Indian openers shared their second successive century stand of the series as Indian batsmen continued to enjoy a golden summer in Australia. Sehwag was dropped on 24 by Tatenda Taibu when he slashed a hard chance off Ervine in the 12th over. He celebrated the reprieve with a soaring six over long-on off the same bowler and followed it up with another as he reached his half-century off 67 balls with three fours and two sixes. Sehwag then hoisted left-arm spinner Raymond Price out of the ground and very nearly into the Tasmanian Sea as the Indians raced towards the target. Sehwag moved into 80s with another six, again off Price. He hit his fifth six in the same over before an uppish drive into covers terminated his innings. Tendulkar had set the early pace by crashing Douglas Hondo through the covers and then flicking him sweetly towards backward square-leg. He was let off on 42 at extra cover off Price but departed in the very next over when he attempted a lordly drive off Ervine and was clean bowled. Sourav Ganguly finished off the match with a flurry of strokes, hoisting Price for a four and a six as the Indians won with 12-odd overs to spare. The Zimbabweans wasted another good opportunity to improve upon their image as the underdogs of the meet, and were outplayed in all departments of the game. In perfect batting conditions, the Zimbabwe batsmen failed to deliver once again and were reduced to 115 for six at one stage. The bowlers made an earnest effort but on a placid track, their gentle pace turned out to be easy meat for the Indian strokemakers. The win left India with seven points from two matches. Australia have 11. Zimbabwe are yet to open their account. Zimbabwes batting performance must have disappointed captain Streak. He had expected them to rise to the occasion but the top-order failed to perform once again. Just like in the previous match against Australia when they were all out for 126 while chasing 225 in Sydney, Zimbabwe batsmen cut a sorry figure with their poor technique. They made a disastrous start when Vusi Sibanda was run out and Stuart Matsikenyeri was caught by Hemang Badani off Irfan Pathan with the total reading only 36. Mark Vermeulen made a pathetic sight before being bowled by a top-spinner by Anil Kumble. Stuart Carlisle was adjudged leg-before to Sehwag and the experienced Grant Flower got out to a poor shot when he spooned a simple catch to the part-time bowler. So, as it was on Sunday, Zimbabwes fortunes again depended on the young Taibu and Streak. The two had added 66 for the sixth wicket in the defeat against Australia but their partnership on Wednesday today was cut short as Badani rattled Taibu with a faster one. Ervine and Streak were left with the difficult job of reviving the tattered innings but the two showed good improvisation to boost the teams total. Ervine was also impressive as he used the blustery wind conditions to get the better of the slow bowlers.  (PTI)  Copyright

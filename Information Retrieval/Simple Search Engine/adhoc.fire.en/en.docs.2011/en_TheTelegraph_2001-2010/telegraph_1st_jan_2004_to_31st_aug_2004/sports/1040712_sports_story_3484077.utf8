The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, July 12, 2004  Fantabulous comes good 
 BY TITAN BOY				 										Ridden by Pesi Shroff, Fantabulous King brought cheers to owner Vijay Mallyas camp after the horse easily claimed the 2,000m Kingfisher Derby Bangalore at the Bangalore races on Sunday. It was Shroffs fourth Derby win there.				 										The victory of the Sardar Singh-trainee had come after the Burden Of Proof-Imposing sons dismal failure in the Colts Trial Stakes, early last month. A switch to the cross nose band seems to have done the trick. He is a bit of roarer and needed the correction. Sardar rightly opted for the equipment, said the city trainer Richard Alford who was witness to the Kings pathetic failure in the Colts Stakes.				 										The race was run at a fast pace with Shroff settling the King right behind Moon Emperor, the stable- mate of the 5-4 favourite Spectacular Quest. Shroff made his move 325m from home and soon kicked clear of the opposition to score by two and half-a-lengths. Star Admiral, also from favourites yard, did come with a late dash but could only push Full Speed to the third slot. The favourite placed fifth.

 Challenge on mat ends 
 - Sushil Kumar wins second bout, but bows out  SUJIT BHAR Athens: On the mat is a term used in the negative by scribes. It describes a rather subjugated state. Indian wrestlers fit the description to the T. The problem is that they had to do this in the Olympic arena. Never a good thing to disgrace your country in front of a zillion viewers. Sujeet Singh Maan, a 74kg hulk, lost 0-3 to Japans Kunihiko Obata in the mens freestyle first bout. The Japanese also picked up 8 technical points against Maans none. The simple affair lasted six minutes. In his second bout Maan came up against Ivan Fundora of Cuba. Guess who had all the fun. The Cuban got three classification points, against none for Maan, and six technical points (none, again for Maan). Six minutes for fold-up. Sushil Kumar is a little lighter, at 60kg, and in his first bout he met Cuban Yandro Miguel Quintana. Cuban 3, Sushil zero in classification. Cuban 3, Sushil zero, in technical. Sushil then proved too good for his Bulgarian rival Ivan Djorev and recorded a thumping 9-0 victory, but still bowed out. The 21-year-old finished 14th.  Copyright

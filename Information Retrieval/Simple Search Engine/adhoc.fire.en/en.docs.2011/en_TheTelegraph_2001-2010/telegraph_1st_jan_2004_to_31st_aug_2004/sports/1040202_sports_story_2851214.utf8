The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ambitious academy launched
 FROM DWAIPAYAN DATTTA  State sport minister Subhas Chakraborty unveils the foundation stone of the IFA academy in Haldia on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Haldia: India have always produced the odd talent here and there. But hardly has there been an organised effort to produce quality footballers in a systematic way. The Tata Football Academy (TFA) is surely an exception  but the state associations had never taken a positive step to form an academy. However, the Indian Football Association (IFA) seems to have woken up and decided to show the way. The foundation stone of the IFA-CSF (County Sports Foundation) academy was laid at the Durgachak Stadium in Haldia on Sunday by state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, who also announced a grant of Rs 10 lakh. The academy will be inaugurated on April 14. Also present at the occasion was the IFA secretary Subrata Dutta and CSF chairman, MP Laxman Seth, who will also be the president of the board of governors of the academy. Dutta said the academy will have 24 boys in the age-group of 13-14 years. It will be a residential set-up with the boys training there under the guidance of the coaches till the age of 16-17. After three years, the academy team will play in the first division Group A of the Calcutta Football League for three years. During their stint there, the players will not be released from the academy to represent any other club, Dutta said. The players coming out of the academy will be professionals and the clubs will have to pay us to get the release order, the secretary added. He informed the boys will be selected from the nursery league teams and nursery coaching centres in different districts. The IFA will also conduct trial camps where players from all around the country will be asked to take part. The IFA has invited Mohammed Habeeb to become the chief coach of the academy following refusals from Amal Dutta and Syed Nayeemuddin. Habeeb has given his verbal consent, but he is still awaiting a clearance from TFA  his former workplace. The TFA contract mentioned Habeeb couldnt join another academy after quitting that job. Bengal under-16 coach Sujit Chakraborty will be the assistant coach, irrespective of who ever becomes the chief coach. Other than lodging facilities, the trainees will also be admitted in the best schools, and all the expenses will be taken care of by the IFA and CSF, Dutta stated. The total yearly expenditure will be about Rs 25 lakh and the boys will also be given a stipend of Rs 500 per month each. The IFA secretary said exposure trips will also be arranged for the boys. Meanwhile, the foundation stone of the IFA-CSF Football Bhavan was also laid, where the trainees will be shifted once it is completed. While the ground floor will have a gymnasium, the trainees will put up in the second floor and the third floor will have classrooms, where the coaches can have theory sessions with their wards, Seth said.

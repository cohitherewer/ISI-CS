 Newbery first Aussie to win gold in 80 years
Athens: Chantelle Newbery gave up diving after her son was born but she returned to the sport and on Sunday became the first Australian to win an Olympic diving title in 80 years. Newbery, who had already collected a bronze medal in the synchronised three-metre springboard event, consigned world championship silver medallist Lao Lishi to another silver, with another Australian, Loudy Tourky, claiming bronze. Im pretty excited to have come home with a gold medal. Im looking forward to getting home to my son. Hes two-and-a-half years old, Newbery said after becoming the first Australian to achieve an Olympic diving gold since Richmond Eve won the mens plain highboard event in 1924. Her husband Robert, who has won two synchronised diving bronzes in Athens, missed the win because he was back in the Olympic Village, resting before his next medal challenge in the mens three-metre springboard event. Newbery achieved Australias first world championship diving medal back in 1998 when, as Chantelle Michell, she took the bronze in the three-metre springboard event. But she quit diving before her son Jet was born. Id actually left the sport and I wasnt coming back. It wasnt till Jet was four months old that I decided I would give it another go, she said. This competition has been the biggest competition for wondering if its all worth it. I did wake up this morning thinking it had better be because it is really hard to leave him at home, she added, fighting back tears. She said she had thought about returning home early now but had decided to stay on to support her husband, who was still competing. The victory over the generally dominant Chinese owed much to Chinese coaching. Tourky said: I think its amazing to have two Australians on the medal dais. The event has been dominated by the Chinese. Weve been working really hard. We have Chinese coaches back in Australia. They helped our programme tremendously. Newbery said the Chinese coaches had brought over their whole programme and introduced it to the sport in Australia. Without it I definitely wouldnt be here today. Its a pretty tough training regime that they put forward to us but everyone steps up to the plate and gets everything done, she said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

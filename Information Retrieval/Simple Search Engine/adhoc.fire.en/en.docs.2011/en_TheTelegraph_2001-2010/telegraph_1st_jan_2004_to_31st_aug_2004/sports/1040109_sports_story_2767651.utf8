The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, January 09, 2004  Psychic Flame set to go places 
 BY STAR RACER		 Ryan Marshall on EvangelinePsychic Flames juggernaut rolled  on. With two Guineas already under her belt going into Sundays  races, the Darius Byramji-trainee lifted the Calcutta Derby  Stakes to complete a rare triple crown, which normally eludes  fillies in a male-dominated thoroughbred world. The fact  that the Razeen-Eminence daughter has won three classics  from five career starts speaks volumes of her prowess.				 										Her major part-owner Deepak Khaitan now has some hard decisions to make. They have a choice of keeping the Flame in the city to complete formalities of winning the St Leger on March 13, and pick up some plum events like the Indian Champion Cup and the Queen Elizabeth II Cup on the way. Alternatively, she leaves for western India to take a crack at the Indian Derby and compete in the Turf Invitation Cup at the Mahalaxmi racecourse.				 										Darius is more likely to insist on the western India sojourn as the combined winners purse for the two Mumbai events is more luring  close to Rs 1 crore. If she does leave for Mumbai, Aretino may spearhead the Khaitan-challenge in the local events.				 										Aretino, who placed third in the Derby, may not be the best choice over the gruelling 2,800m Leger course. Yet, the No Louder-Lady Cox son from Vijay Singhs yard may match the calibre of Red Chief who was half-a-length better in the Derby. Aretino was upfront and well in contention until a furlong from home but with Psychic Flame whizzing past all, the formers jockey C. Alford may have lost the mind game.				 										In the 2,000 Guineas, it was Alford on the Flame who had the measure of C. Rajendra-ridden Aretino. Their rides were switched in the Derby when Alford opted for Aretino.				 										Among those who impressed on the day were Thanks To All and Calorific. The former lifted the Arabian Rose Cup in a manner that suggests he may repeat the winning performance when saddled again. However, the victory of Vijays Calorific over stablemate Alashaan gladdened many hearts. Although it was a short-head that separated the two, the way in which the winner, a Steinbeck-Artistic son, covered ground from the rear of the eight-horse field in the last 300m was quite exceptional. The matured performance came from a youngster who had just attained the age of three on New Years Day, the official birthday of every thoroughbred.		 C.

The Excaliburs Lake-Glowing Tribute daughter simply left the field cold once she took over the running from Beneficent at the top of the final turn.				 										The victory of Assumer, in the 2,200m RCTC New Years Trophy, was equally smashing. The Twist And Turn-Fancy Design five-year-old led from the start and went on increasing his lead with every passing post.				 										Another one to impress was Gypsy King, the winner of the Burning Fire Cup over 1,400 metres. The small-made four-year-old colt demonstrated long strides as he beat the field hollow once he got going in the final stretch.

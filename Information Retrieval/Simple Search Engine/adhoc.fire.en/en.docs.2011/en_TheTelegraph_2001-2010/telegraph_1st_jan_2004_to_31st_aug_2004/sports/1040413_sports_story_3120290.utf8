The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aston Villa dash Chelsea hopes
London: Chelseas faltering hopes of catching leaders Arsenal suffered a severe setback after a 2-3 defeat at Aston Villa in the Premier League on Monday. Their lacklustre performance leaves Chelsea seven points adrift of Arsenal, who have 78 points from 32 matches and a game in hand on their London rivals, who have just five matches left. Any hopes that the west London side could narrow the gap to four points disappeared as goals from Darius Vassell, Thomas Hitzlsperger and Lee Hendrie gave Villa victory after Chelsea had taken a first-half lead through Hernan Crespo. Villa moved within a point of fourth-placed Liverpool, who slumped to a 0-1 defeat at home to Charlton Athletic, and Newcastle United, who drew 0-0 at home to Arsenal on Sunday. Charltons win came courtesy of a Shaun Bartlett goal just after the hour mark to secure their first victory at Anfield since 1954. At the bottom, Portsmouth moved three points clear of the relegation zone as they jumped one spot to 16th after a 3-1 win at home to ten-man Birmingham City who lost goalkeeper Maik Taylor for a handball outside the area just before the break. Bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers lost 1-2 at home to Bolton Wanderers after striker Kevin Davies struck a last-gasp winner to make the home sides chances of avoiding the drop all the more unlikely with just five games remaining. Manchester City moved on to 34 points after a 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur with Nicolas Anelkas 15th league goal of the season bringing a reply from Jermain Defoe. (Reuters)  Copyright

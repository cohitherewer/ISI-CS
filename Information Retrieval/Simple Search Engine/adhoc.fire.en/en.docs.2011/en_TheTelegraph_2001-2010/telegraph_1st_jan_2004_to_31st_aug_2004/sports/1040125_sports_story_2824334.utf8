The Telegraph - Calcutta
 My series best, says Laxman
 - Praise for Rohan, Bangar  Sourav Ganguly expresses his displeasure with the fielding at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday. (AFP) Adelaide, Jan. 24 (PTI): A victory normally brings relief but the India captain was relieved for a different reason after Saturdays tense tri-series match against Zimbabwe. Sourav Ganguly said playing four matches in seven days was beginning to take its toll on his players but praised them for doing well under pressure. It has been a tough week and all four matches have been keenly fought. It has been a hectic two months. The five-day break will be a welcome one, Sourav said. Sourav praised V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid for rebuilding the innings. They have been in superb form throughout this tour. Laxmans in particular was a tremendous performance. When you have a score like 280-290, you win eight out of ten times. MoM Laxman, who made a career-best 131 and took two superb catches, said the disappointment of his poor catching in the tri-series final at home late last year had inspired him to do well as a fielder. I was disappointed with myself after the final which we lost to Australia in Calcutta. It served as a motivation. I am happy that my catching came good today. I rate this hundred as my best of this series. It is because I came in when the team was in such a bad position. I have always enjoyed playing in Australia. Laxman praised Rohan Gavaskar too. He showed a lot of maturity and kept rotating the strike at a critical stage. I am very pleased with the way he batted. He didnt forget Sanjay Bangar either who bowled a tight final over under pressure. It was an amazing over. Sanjay has always been a cool customer and came good for us tonight. Laxman was mighty pleased with the catches he took. The one of Andy Blignaut was important because the game was at a critical stage and we needed him. But from a personal point of view, the one of Travis Friend was one of my best since the ball was dipping and I plucked it from inches above the ground.  Copyright

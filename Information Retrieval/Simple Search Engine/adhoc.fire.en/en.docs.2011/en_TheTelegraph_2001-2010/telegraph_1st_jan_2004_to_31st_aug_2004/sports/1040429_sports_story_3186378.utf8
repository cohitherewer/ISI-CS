		 Thursday, April 29, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Durban: The recently introduced 20-over cricket  pro20  is proving to be a big hit in South Africa where it has been wooing spectators back to domestic cricket.				 																																	Since the tournament got underway on April 7, a total of 1,22,542 cricket fans have flocked to cricket grounds around the country to watch the 14 games played so far. To put it simply this has been unheard of for a long time, Ros Goldin, a spokesperson for the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) said.				 																																	We have given the consumers what they want... A short-duration, quality product, he said. 				 																																	Sydney: Australias most successful one-day batsman Michael Bevan will continue playing first-class cricket after being dropped as a contracted player by Cricket Australia earlier this month. Bevan said he planned to play at first-class level, both in Australia and England, in the hope of a recall to the international arena.				 																																	I am still enjoying my cricket and having averaged 46 for Australia and nearly 100 for New South Wales last season, I believe I still have a lot to offer the game, Bevan said in a statement on Wednesday. I still think that I have room for improvement and my body is feeling great. My role has been to win matches when Australia is under pressure and the selectors have told me this role has been diminished in recent times. If this changes I will always be available.				 																																	Durban: Former South African opener Gary Kirsten, who retired recently from international cricket will don the role of a mentor to guide upcoming players.				 																																	Kirsten has been appointed by the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) as a mentor to new players joining the national and provincial teams.				 																																	The UCBSA has reached an agreement with the left-handed batsman to groom new players in the team. He may also be considered for a position in the selection committee, the board said in a statement on Wednesday.				 																																	Kirstens main role would be to bridge the gap between players in the six provincial teams and the national side.				 																																	Havana: Former world chess champion Anatoly Karpov plans to participate in a Cuban attempt to break the Guinness world record for most people playing chess simultaneously.				 																																	Organisers expect some 13,000 people to show up in the city of Santa Clara in central Cuba on Thursday to play chess in homage to the revolutionary leader Ernesto Che Guevara.				 																																	This will be an event not only for Cuban chess but for global chess, Karpov told reporters on Tuesday, the day after his arrival on the island.				 																																	The current Guinness record was also set by Cubans, when 11,320 people  including Cuban president Fidel Castro  played 5,660 simultaneous games of chess at Jose Marti Revolution square in Havana on December 7, 2002.				 																																	Karpov also expressed interest in creating a chess school in Cuba.				 																																	Auckland: Heavyweight boxer David Tua, currently fighting an acrimonious legal battle with his former handlers, said Wednesday that he is getting back into the ring to resume his pursuit of a world heavyweight title. 				 																																	Tua, who has not fought for a year and is embroiled in court action against his former manager and trainer, is expected to fight again in August. I cant wait. I believe my destiny is to be world champion and no court case is going to stop me, said Tua, 31, who had wanted to put off fighting until the legal action was resolved.

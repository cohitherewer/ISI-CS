The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Im to blame, admits Sehwag
 - Rahul Dravids run out cost us the Lahore Test match  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Dravid walks out after being run out at the Gaddafi Sehwag says he neither shouted yes nor noLahore: Whatever the grade, rarely does anybody accept responsibility for a run out. Virender Sehwag, who featured in one on the third afternoon of the Gaddafi Test, is different. Talking to The Telegraph on Friday afternoon (before setting out with idol Sachin Tendulkar to pick up DVDs), Sehwag said: I blame myself as the call was mine and I neither shouted yes nor no... Of course, Dravid didnt say anything either, but thats not the point... Still upset, he added: We just relied on eye-contact and, really, that had disastrous consequences... That run out (which made it 15 for two in the second innings) cost us the match... Given the impact it had, its difficult quickly forgetting it. Sehwag, it may be recalled, played Mohammed Sami in the cover region and the damage was done by Imran Farhat, who did a Yuvraj Singh. After all, in the first Test, it was Yuvrajs brilliance (on the fourth afternoon) which led to Inzamam-ul Haqs run out  more important, that set India on the road to a historic victory. Dravid himself didnt agree that his run out (without facing a ball) was the proverbial turning point, but Inzamam certainly picked that as the most decisive moment at the Gaddafi. The third and final Test is days away and, knowing Sehwag, he must be looking to make amends. Incidentally, Indias first triple centurion top-scored in the second innings here  90.  Copyright

 Portugal faces terror threat
Lisbon, May 29 (AFP):Corruption in Portugal would make it easy for terrorist groups to place a bomb in one of the ten stadia to host Euro 2004 matches, Martin Kallen, chief operating officer for Euro 2004, claimed Saturday. He said that after speaking with police they were of the opinion that corruption in Portugal has made the country vulnerable to potential terrorist attacks during the three-week championships starting June 12. In Portugal its easy to place a bomb in a stadium because you can always find a corrupt person, Kallen told Portuguese weekly Expresso. Kallen said that the main concern would be to secure the parking areas in all European championship stadia. All cars will be inspected, including that of the Prime Minister, said Kallen. Fans will have to arrive three hours before a match begins or else they wont get to park their cars.  Copyright

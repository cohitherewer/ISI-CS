Overmars predicts a Dutch treat
- The big occasion creates something more in me
 FROM JAMES MOSSOP IN LISBON  I am creating a small bomb inside myself, says Overmars Marc Overmars is small, famous, quick and ambitious at footballs over-the-hill age of 31. He sees Tuesdays match between two of Euro 2004s titans, Holland and Germany, as the opportunity to play his way back into the English Premier League where he once ranked among the best at Arsenal. As the Atlantic rollers crashed in, dyed aquamarine by the morning sun, he gazed into the distance and only saw what was close at hand; the big occasion stage that he relishes. He will be the dancing figure out wide for the Dutch in a game that is full of anticipation. The Dutch are habitually in a state of disarray before any major tournament but this time they insist they are all pulling together across their own sea of tranquillity. Well, almost. They lost two of their three warm-up matches, one of them against the Republic of Ireland, and coach Dick Advocaat is looking at as witch of formation after conferring with his senior players. Overmars, meanwhile, has his own view of what is needed to find a way past German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, arguably the best in the world though recently apparently affected by the distractions of a turbulent, highly-publicised episode in his private life. We may have had a difficult time in qualification but if we can show the right kind of spirit, as shown in the second play-off match against Scotland, then we can win this tournament. After losing the first leg of the play-off 0-1 in Glasgow they shredded the Scots 6-0 in Amsterdam with Ruud van Nistelrooy scoring a hattrick. Germany, always methodical and highly technical, will show much more resilience and competence than Scotland. There was a hungry look about the Dutch as they trained the other day. Overmars is markedly up for it. He said: The big occasion creates something more in me. When I was a little kid I always loved playing in tournaments. Now I am old but I still love the buzz that comes with tournaments such as this. Every day I am thinking about the match so that I can get the best out of myself. I am creating a small bomb inside myself and I know I have to explode against Germany. I know every team very well. Some people are saying we will get through and play Spain in the next round but that is something I dont want to think about. Over the past few weeks everyone knows that we have not been playing well. We have been the same as the Germans, losing two out of three matches, so that means we start even. There will be some changes and hopefully they will work out. Perhaps if we had been winning games 4-0, people would have said that we peaked too early. Now, in losing, people are saying we will not have a good tournament but where is the wisdom in that. If we start well the whole team can turn straight away. He snapped his fingers, adding: At the highest level you have to perform. You cannot stumble. Germany have their stars and none stands taller than Kahn who has been under serious pressure on and off the pitch of late. For almost 10 years he has been a reliable fixture as the last line of Germanys defence. His goalkeeping standards have been towering throughout that time so that when he made a rare blunder that led to Ronaldos opening goal in the 2002 World Cup final he was readily forgiven on account of many past glories. This year, though, his world has turned. He had an affair with a Munich barmaid and he was suddenly seen as a man with frailties, especially as his wife acrimoniously divorced him. What has that to do with goalkeeping? Not a lot but there was no mercy as mistakes began to show. On the bench, Jens Lehmann has been claiming that he should be handed the jersey. The pair of them have fallen out. Kahn will be in goal on Tuesday, well aware that the likes of Marc Overmars will be trying to find Van Nistelrooy, to put a couple past him. The stage is set for Overmars last hurrah.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

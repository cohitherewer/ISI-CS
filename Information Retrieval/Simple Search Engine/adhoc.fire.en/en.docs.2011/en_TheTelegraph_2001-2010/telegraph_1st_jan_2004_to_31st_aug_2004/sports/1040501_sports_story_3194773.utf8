The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its Azzurri or overseas for Marcello Lippi
Milan: He won two titles and reached a Champions League final in three seasons and yet still Juventus coach Marcello Lippi felt obliged to resign on Thursday with his team in third place in Serie A and in the Italian Cup final. Stung by criticism of his side this season, Lippi says he will take time out from the game and has ruled out coaching another Italian club side after the bitter experience of his brief spell with Inter Milan. I want to take a break for six or seven months, Lippi told Gazzetta dello Sports website. Ill go to the Delle Alpi to watch Juves games then I am certain that after that spell of rest my hands will start to sweat again and the desire to coach will return to me but not with any other Italian team. If Lippi sticks to his word and rejects any overtures from other leading Serie A clubs then his next job will see him either take over the reins of the Italian national team or try his hand in the English or Spanish league. I have always said that maybe I would go abroad or to the national team but only after that six or seven months, said Lippi on Thursday. Former Juventus coach Giovanni Trapattoni will lead Italy into the Euro 2004 finals but should the Azzurri fail to reach the latter stages Trap is almost certain to be replaced and Lippi would be the front-runner. Who wouldnt like to coach the national side?, said Lippi. From June 12 I will be the No. 1 fan of the Italy team and I hope that they win the European championships. If they call on me I will be honoured, he added. Should that not work out there would be no shortage of offers for one of the most highly respected coaches in the game. Lippi said he had already rejected a number of approaches during this season. The reason Lippi will be in demand for any vacancies that emerge at top European clubs is quite simply his outstanding record of success. In his two spells at the Turin club Lippi won five Italian titles and took Juventus to four Champions League finals, winning the continents top trophy in 1996. This season Juve struggled to keep pace with Milan and Roma in Serie A and were eliminated from the Champions League. I say to the players on an almost daily basis now that after all we have done in the last few years if one year we dont win something it does not mean we are useless. (Reuters)  Copyright

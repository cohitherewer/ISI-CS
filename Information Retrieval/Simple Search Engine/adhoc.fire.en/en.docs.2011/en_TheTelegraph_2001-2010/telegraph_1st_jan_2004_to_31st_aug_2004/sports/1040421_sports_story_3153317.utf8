 Door open for talks: ZCU
London: The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) has confirmed that it remains willing to talk to the 15 white players currently involved in a rebellion. The door remains open to the players and their representatives to talk to the Union in an attempt to find a solution to the very serious problems we are currently facing, said ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka on Tuesday. Chingoka and ZCU member Ozias Bvute met briefly with the ECB at Lords before going to a meeting with the ICC. In a statement released after the meeting, Chingoka said the ZCU remained willing to talk to the rebels. He said the board had agreed to restructure the selection panel, reducing it from six to four and including two new members in Richie Kaschula and Walter Chawaguta. Streak had been critical of the lack of cricketing experience of some members of the panel. The statement said the ZCU agreed to pay 100 per cent of the costs associated with running the Zimbabwe Professional Cricketers Association for the next 12 months and 50 per cent in subsequent years. Chingoka also expressed confidence that England would tour in October despite safety concerns and reservations about President Robert Mugabes government. (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Sania in doubles semis
Hyderabad: Sania Mirza and Liezel Huber upset second seeds Wynn Prakusya and Angelique Widjaja 6-0, 6-4 to storm into the doubles semi-finals of the $140,000 WTA Hyderabad Open tennis tournament Thursday. In the singles, second seed Marion Bartoli of France and fourth-seeded Australian Nicole Pratt entered the last four. Pairing with the world number 11, Sania enthralled the home crowd with a sterling performance as the duo outsmarted the Indonesian pair comprehensively to win the first set 6-0. Sania made a few mistakes in the second set and could not return properly, but the senior partner held fort and warded off a late challenge by the Indonesian pair who managed to take four games mostly owing to some negative points gifted away to them. In singles, Bartoli outplayed Bulgarian Mervana Jugic Salkic 7-5, 6-3 while Nicole Pratt defeated Croatian Jelena Kostanic 6-4, 7-5 in the quarter finals. Third seed and defending champion Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand defeated Chinas Jio Ziheng 6-3, 6-1.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Exit scare for Germany after 0-0 draw
	 - LATVIA PUSH Kahn amp; Co. TO MUST-WIN LAST GROUP MATCH VERSUS CZECHS  A frustrated German captain Oliver Kahn during the goalless draw against Latvia at the Bessa Stadium in Porto on Saturday Porto, June 19 (Reuters): Germanys chances of a Euro 2004 quarter-final spot were hit hard as they were held to a dismal 0-0 draw by debutants Latvia Saturday. Latvia, who had come close to victory in their opening 1-2 defeat by the Czech Republic, put up another competitive display to earn their first point in a major tournament. Germany, who will face elimination if they cannot beat the Czechs in their last Group D game, failed to repeat their convincing performance in their opening 1-1 draw with the Netherlands. The 2002 World Cup finalists, who had hinted against the Dutch that they could once against upset the odds after poor preparations for the tournament, are at risk of another early exit after failing to survive the group stage at Euro 2000. The Baltic debutants looked well organised and resisted Germany in a tight, tactical first half of few highlights. The second half was more one-sided, Germany stepping up a gear but looking clumsy in front of goal and failing to breach a determined Latvian defence. Latvian right back Aleksandrs Isakovs received the fastest yellow card of the tournament when he clattered midfielder Torsten Frings a few seconds into the game. The opening skirmishes were tense and dull with no clear chance until Frings fired over the bar from outside the box on eight minutes. Germany threatened again when striker Kevin Kuranyi controlled the ball on his chest and shot narrowly wide but there was little to get excited about for the German fans. Germany, playing with two strikers, failed to put their opponents under real pressure and were far less convincing than against the Netherlands. However, they showed more initiative with the break approaching, midfielder Michael Ballack and Kuranyi firing in shots. Latvia fought bravely and threatened shortly before halftime when striker Maris Verpakovskis surged powerfully into the box and produced a good save from goalkeeper Oliver Kahn. There was another pacey run from Verpakovskis ten minutes into the second half which ended when he was sandwiched by two defenders but his appeal for a penalty was harshly turned down by English referee Mike Riley. Germany appeared to need a set piece to break the deadlock and came close in the 64th minute when Latvia goalkeeper Aleksandrs Kolinko did well to punch away a fierce Ballack free kick. German substitute Miroslav Klose wasted a fine chance in injury time when he headed wide, and Latvia held on for a point, their only realistic goal in a tough group featuring three former European champions. After the match German coach Rudi Voeller said he could not blame his team for their unimpressive performance in the goalless draw with Latvia. He sounded a bit more philosophic, actually. We tried everything today and we had some chances, the best for (Miroslav) Klose at the end. I cant blame my team, Voeller said. They tried everything right up to the final whistle. But without goals, you cannot win matches. There were phases where we didnt play well, didnt play with any width. The Czechs also had a hard time against them. You need to have a lot of patience with a team like this.

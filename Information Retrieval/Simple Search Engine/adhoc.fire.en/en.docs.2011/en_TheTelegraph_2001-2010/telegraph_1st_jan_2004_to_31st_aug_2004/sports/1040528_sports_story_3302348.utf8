 Tim Lamb to quit 
London: Tim Lamb will step down as chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) at the end of September, the ECB said on Thursday. Lamb, 51, has held the post since 1997. I feel that after nearly eight years in the role I have probably taken the ECB as far as I can, Lamb said in a statement on the ECB website.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

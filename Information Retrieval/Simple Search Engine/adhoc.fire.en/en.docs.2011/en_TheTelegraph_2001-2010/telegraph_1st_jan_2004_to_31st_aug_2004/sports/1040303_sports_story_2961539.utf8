 Windies storm into final
 West Indies players celebrate a dismissal in Dhaka on Tuesday. (AFP) Dhaka: Denesh Ramdin struck a fluent 72 and pacer Ravi Rampaul claimed three wickets as the West Indies crushed England by 94 runs to storm into the under-19 World Cup final here on Tuesday. The West Indies will now clash with Pakistan in the day-night final on Friday. The West Indies scored 249 for six after electing to bat before restricting England to 155 under lights at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Skipper Ramdin boosted the West Indies total with a vital 85-ball knock and added 68 runs for the fourth wicket with Assad Fudadin (51) after his team was struggling at 69 for three at one stage. Lower-order batsman Zamal Khan smashed an unbeaten 60 off just 49 balls in the closing overs.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another easy win for India A
 Dhoni excelled as batsman and keeper Harare, July 31 (Agencies): India A notched up a convincing 10-wicket win against Zimbabwe Select XI on the third morning of their four-day match at Harare Sports Club today. The tourists had won the first tour game by nine wickets. Resuming their second innings on 125 for nine on Saturday, the home side added six more runs before folding up. Skipper Sairaj Bahutule took the last wicket to finish with dream figures of four of 11. Ramesh Powar and Shib Shankar Paul took three wickets each. India A knocked off the required 25 runs in 8.2 overs without losing a wicket. Dhiraj Jadhav and Gautam Gambhir remained unbeaten with 13 and 12, respectively. Bahutule led from the front on the second day also, hitting a fine 57 to guide India A to 259 for a first-innings lead of 107. The visitors had lost Rohan Gavaskar (60) and Dinesh Karthik (52) in quick succession early on Day II and were in a spot of bother at 141 for five. Bahutule found an able partner in wicketkeeper-batsman Mahender Singh Dhoni (47) and the two put on 77 crucial runs for the sixth wicket. After Dhonis dismissal, though, wickets fell quickly and India A were dismissed for 259 in 68.5 overs. The Zimbabweans were all at sea in the second innings. Needing a solid start to wipe off the 100-plus deficit, they lost wickets regularly against some good Indian bowling. Bengal seamer Paul and off-spinner Powar were as impressive as leg-spinner Bahutule. Dhoni did a good job behind the stumps, effecting three catches and two stumpings. Brief scores: Zimbabwe Select XI 152 amp; 131 (M. Vermeulen 40; S. Bahutule 4/11, S.S. Paul 3/38, R. Powar 3/33). India A 259 (R. Gavaskar 60, S. Bahutule 57, D. Karthik 52, M.S. Dhoni 47; T. Panyangara 5/60) amp; 26/0. India A won by 10 wkts.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Biggest dhamaka on wheels, east of the Suez
 - An India-Asean motoring event covering 5400-plus km across six countries takes shape  BY SUJIT BHAR Calcutta: Early October, in Bali, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee sealed an agreement with the Asean that promised to open up the entire connected land mass from the northeast of India way down to Thailand. Roads, he said, were the need of the area, and to put his point across forcefully he proposed an India-Asean car rally. That sapling of a proposal has quickly spread its branches and the rally is now a reality, with the ministry of external affairs (MEA), its section on economic relations, and a multitude of government, non-government and private associates working towards an affair on wheels, the magnitude of which has never before been seen in this part of the world. The touring category rally, with technical specs from the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (a government-recognised organisation) covering a mind-boggling 5,400-plus km and six countries (including India) is meant to showcase Indian technical expertise and export sporting and political goodwill. The countries  the rally of over 30 sport utility 4x4 vehicles will go through after leaving a possible starting point in Imphal (there will be a ceremonial flag-off in New Delhi, likely by the Prime Minister)  are Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. The idea is big and the logistics should be even bigger. But P.M. Bhandari, joint secretary in the MEA (external relations) told The Telegraph: The Prime Minister wants to make it a public display, which, in other words, means that no effort shall be spared to enhance its profile. It could turn out to be the most high profile cross-border motoring event in the world, with several crores going into its promotion. Championship category rallies like the Kenyan or the Paris-Dakar will feel the heat. The departments and organisations already involved and those moving in are corporates, the CII, the FICCI, the government agencies, the oil PSUs, the MEA, and all the Asean countries. All Indian companies will showcase their SUVs and we have asked other countries in the Asean to pitch in, said Bhandari. While basically it should result in a mega economic boost for the country, the sporting fallout will be as big, if not bigger. With the Pakistan front easing out, this is one more region that the government wishes to move into. Though vehemently denied from all quarters, there is a possibility that the tremendous goodwill from this will reflect on the incumbents at the next hustings. To that extent, of the two possible set of dates (within next April or after November, to avoid the rains), the former may look good. Trade and tourism, though, will have to be careful how they tread in Myanmar. In 1999, Karen ethnic guerrillas had warned organisers of a motor expedition through Myanmar against travelling through territory in which they operate. A spokesman for the Karen National Union, which has fought the Myanmar government for 50 years, had said the expedition would cross a war zone between the Thai border and the Myanmar capital, Yangon. The situation hasnt changed too much, though Bhandari said the security will not be a problem in Myanmar, with the military junta there having promised all help. The other problem, of course, will be of roads. The route isnt quite that. Some, so-called special stages along the route could extend to hundreds of kilometres, with barely a scratch of tarmac visible. That would mean breaking of routes. The recce teams expect to overcome this with ingenious methods. Whatever the method employed, however it happens. It will be surely the biggest dhamaka so far, east of the Suez.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Back at my best: Lee 
 - Aussie pacer worked hard on his action after being mauled by Sachin and Laxman  Lee feels Lillees tips were a big help Perth: The three-wicket haul against India on Sunday has helped Brett Lee regain confidence and he said on Monday he is back at his best. As far as pace and rhythm go, I am back to my best of World Cup days, said Lee who virtually fired bullets at the Indians on a nasty WACA pitch in the tri-series game to put them on notice for the finals. But pace is not Lees sole goal and he is concentrating on taking wickets primarily. Pace is not a goal for me. It is to take wickets for my country. It was good to see the ball carry to Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) at a good pace and a good height. The ball came out of my hand pretty well. But I would try to do the basics and keep my action very simple, he said. Lee, who took three wickets conceding only 22 runs in his ten overs, was almost unplayable with his pace and movement. I would admit I was helped by the breeze coming across (from the sea) and it helped my out-swingers. But basically I was not trying to bowl too fast, I only wanted to relax and bowl line and length, he said. Lee acknowledged that advice from Dennis Lillee on his action and rhythm helped him get over the problem of no-balls. I have done a lot of work with Dennis over the phone. He just wanted to reinforce the work I was doing during the World Cup. He told me to try out a few things to get my foot on the line. He suggested different techniques and said that I should let my arm go a little bit higher than it has in recent weeks. The tearaway bowler revealed that he had worked hard in the nets in the last few weeks after being mauled by Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman. Action is a weird thing. But I have trained very hard in the nets and over the last couple of weeks things are getting back into track. Lee felt playing on slow tracks also affected his performance. We have played on some very slow wickets but finally we got one in WACA which backed fast bowling. For me, more than pace, the length was the key. I had bowled either too short or two full in the Tests. We would try to take this momentum in the finals. It has been a great confidence builder. But it could be a different story. It was a great series to be part of and now things can happen in the finals. Lee admitted he might have tried to rush things in his eagerness to return to action. When I returned, I was anxious to do well. It does take a bit longer. I am a sort of guy who likes to rush in a bit too quickly. I was expecting things to happen far too quickly than it probably could have happened. Our fitness expert John Campbell said it takes about three months to reach top speed after injury. I think I am now much ahead of the track.  (PTI)  Copyright

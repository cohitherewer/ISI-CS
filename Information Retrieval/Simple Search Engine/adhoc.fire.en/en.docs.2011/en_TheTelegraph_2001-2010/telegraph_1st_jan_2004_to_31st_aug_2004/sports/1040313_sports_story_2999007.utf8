Anil Kumble (Ind) 382Galle: Shane Warne sealed a triumphant comeback to international cricket by becoming the first spin bowler to take 500 Test wickets as Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 197 runs on Friday. Warne, playing in his first Test since returning last month from a one-year ban for failing a drug test, was mobbed by teammates after claiming the scalp of Sri Lanka skipper Hashan Tillekeratne to reach the milestone. The 34-year-old legend finished the match with figures of 10 wickets for 159 as Sri Lanka collapsed to 154 all out in their second innings after the visitors had earlier declared on 512 for eight. Warne ended the game with 501 Test victims, with only retired Courtney Walsh standing ahead of him with 519. To come out and do what I did today and win a Test match was a very big achievement...I feel very proud, Warne said.  This is dedicated to those guys, my friends and my family, who have supported me. Man-of-the-match Haydens contribution, a 130 plus a record-equalling seven catches  the most in a Test by a non-wicketkeeper. But it was Warne who was centre of attention and his performance was doubly sweet as it saw him pip Muttiah Muralidharan to the magic number of 500.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Batsmen keep East on course
	 - DULEEP TROPHY  Shukla top-scored with 60 Amritsar: Some useful contributions from the middle-order batsmen helped East Zone take a big step towards the Duleep Trophy final on the penultimate day of their match against England A on Sunday. At stumps on Day 3, the English team was 78 for two chasing a target of 367. G. Smith was batting on 33 with K. Pieterson on 29. Earlier, resuming at their overnight score of 65 for three, East rode valuable contributions from all-rounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla, skipper Devang Gandhi and Shiv Sundar Das before being all out for 308. Das, who came into bat at No. 9, had made an unbeaten 124 in the first innings. Kiran Powar and Sourashish Lahiri made 40 each as East continued their fine comeback after being dismissed for 283 in the first innings. East, who have two points, need a win to edge out South who have four points from an outright win over the English side.The wicket is offering turn and our spinners Sourashish and Utpal Chatterjee will have key roles to play. If they bowl well, we should wrap it up by tea on the final day, said East Zone coach Karsan Ghavri. The wicket is slow and the bowlers should call the shots if they dont bowl short. Driving has become really difficult. The English team has managed to put together a partnership and breaking this stand early in the morning is our first aim. The visitors dont have too many good batsmen save two or three and this is their most experienced pair. If we break this stand quickly, the rest shouldnt be too much of a problem, said Ghavri.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 6 reported for flawed action
London: The ICC has identified six bowlers with potentially flawed actions during the under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh and names of these players have been given to their home boards for remedial work. The players, whose names were not disclosed, were identified at the February-March tournament by the ICC-appointed expert group comprising Waqar Younis, Bob Woolmer and bio-mechanical analysis specialist Bruce Eliott. This information has now been passed on to the respective boards which are required to work with the bowlers to review and remedy their actions before they graduate to full international cricket, the ICC said in a statement.

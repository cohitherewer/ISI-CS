(AP) St Georges (Grenada): The West Indies swept Bangladesh in a three-match series with a seven-wicket victory in a rain-shortened one-day International at Queens Park Stadium. Opener Devon Smith hit an unbeaten 39 to anchor the win on Wednesday. The 22-year-old Grenadian struck a six and a four off 70 balls as the home team reached their victory target of 119 for three wickets with five balls to spare. Bangladesh, with the help of captain Habibul Bashars 42 off 45 balls, totalled 118 for seven in a match limited to 25 overs per side after rain delayed the start by four hours. The West Indies swept the series 3-0 following back-to-back victories in St Vincent last weekend. While Devon Smith provided a solid performance, there were cameos from Ricardo Powell (17 off 13 balls), Dwayne Smith (23 off 24) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (24 off 28). Devon Smith and Chanderpaul shared a match-winning partnership of 55 off 64 balls. Captain Ramnaresh Sarwan hit an unbeaten seven but allowed the Grenadian crowd to cheer their hometown hero as Smith brought up the winning runs with a nudge to leg from the first ball of the final over.

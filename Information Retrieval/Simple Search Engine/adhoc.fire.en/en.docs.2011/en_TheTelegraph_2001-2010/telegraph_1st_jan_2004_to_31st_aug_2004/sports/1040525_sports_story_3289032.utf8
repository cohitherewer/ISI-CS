The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassi ousted; Ferrero will play
 - Henin-Hardenne, Mauresmo, Moya cruise; Henman, Roddick made to struggle Paris: Even as Juan Carlos Ferrero forgot his pull-out threat and decided to play his first round at the French Open Tuesday, sixth seed Andre Agassi was shown the door by French qualifier Jerome Haehnel on the opening day at Roland Garros Monday. Defending French Open champion Ferrero, doubtful in his title defence because of a rib injury, will play German Tommy Haas. The Spaniard, whose preparation has been hampered by the injury, trained on Monday and let the organisers know they could schedule his match as planned. Ferrero, seeded fourth, will be the last player in action on centre court. Yes he plays. It was obvious he would wait for the last minute to make a final decision about pulling out, given the importance of the tournament, said ATP spokesman Nicola Arzani. Agassi was humbled in the opening round of a Grand Slam for the first time in six years. He was unceremoniously dumped 4-6, 6-7 (4-7), 3-6 by Tour debutant Haehnel. The American, who had not suffered a first-round exit at any of the four majors since his visit here in 1998, was just a shadow of the player who lifted the Roland Garros trophy in 1999 as he lost to the 271st-ranked Haehnel. The French qualifier barely put a foot wrong as he ruthlessly dismantled Agassis gameplan in just over two hours. The 23-year-old had never before entered the main draw of a major tournament, let alone a Grand Slam. Its difficult to say what I feel, Ive surprised myself. Right now its unbelievable, he said. Andre just said well done and good luck. Agassis only previous first-round defeat at Roland Garros in 16 appearances had been against a young Marat Safin. While Haehnel scored his first victory at Tour level, Agassi was attempting to obtain his 800th. The signs looked ominous for Agassi when he dropped the first set. However, as the match progressed, it became obvious Agassi was paying the price for his lack of matchplay on clay. The eight-time Grand Slam champion had played only one match on the surface this season  in the first round in St Poelten last week  before arriving in Paris. Haehnel grabbed the second-set tiebreak 7-4 before snatching a 3-1 lead in the third set. Agassi fought back to level at 3-3 but eventually succumbed as Haehnel won the last three games, finishing in style with an emphatic ace. Theres really no explanation. I wish I could give you an excuse, Agassi said. In contrast, defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne made a successful if unspectacular return from illness, beating Sandrine Testud 6-4, 6-4. The Belgian world No. 1 shook off the after-effects of a viral infection to oust Testud in 87 minutes and gain a foothold in the draw. Former mens champion Carlos Moya was more convincing, the fifth seed beating the solid Dutchman John Van Lottum 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2. Briton Tim Henman, seeded ninth, had to fight back from two sets down to beat Frenchman Cyril Saulnier 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-3. Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan moved into the second round but was pushed hard by Czech teenager Tomas Berdych. The Asian No. 1 won 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 to set up a meeting with Spains Alex Corretja, who beat Jan-Michael Gambill of the US 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Second seed Andy Roddick averted a third consecutive first round defeat when he overcame fellow American Todd Martin 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 7-5. The US Open champion, upset in the first round in each of the last two years on the slow Roland Garros clay, produced a disciplined display of back-court shot making to dismiss his 33-year-old opponent with some ease on centre court. Roddick sneaked the first set by recovering from 4-2 down to win the tiebreak 7-5 with a crunching forehand and took control of the second with an early break. The 21-year-old then forced successive errors from Martin at 5-5 in the third to break decisively and wrapped up a comfortable victory on serves. Third seed Argentine Guillermo Coria also reached the second round thrashing Nikolay Davydenko 6-4 6-2 6-0. Among women, third seed Amelie Mauresmo chalked an efficient 6-3, 6-3 victory over Slovakias Ludmila Cervanova. Mauresmo eased through to set up a second round clash with Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain. (Agencies)  Copyright

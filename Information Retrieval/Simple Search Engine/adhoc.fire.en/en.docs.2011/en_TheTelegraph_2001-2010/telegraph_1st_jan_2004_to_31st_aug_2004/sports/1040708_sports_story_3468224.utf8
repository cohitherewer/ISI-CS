Drechsler out of Athens Meanwhile, two-time Olympic long jump champion Heike Drechsler said on Wednesday she will skip the Olympics because she could not raise her performance. Ive realised that my performance doesnt meet the necessary level at the moment, Drechsler said. I am not able to jump for titles now, neither nationally nor internationally.

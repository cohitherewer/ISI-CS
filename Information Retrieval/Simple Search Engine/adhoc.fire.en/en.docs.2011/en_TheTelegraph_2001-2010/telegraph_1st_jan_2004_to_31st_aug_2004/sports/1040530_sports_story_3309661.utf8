The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Okoro fined $4700
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, May 29: East Bengal on Saturday slapped a $4,700 fine on Mike Okoro. The six-member disciplinary committee, which felt that he had brought the club to disrepute, decided on his punishment. The club had earlier showcaused the Nigerian striker for refusing to take the field in their final group E league match of the AFC Cup against Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia. In his reply, the Nigerian striker apologised but didnt give any reason for his action. Okoros fine will either be adjusted against his new contract or he will have to deposit the amount before taking his International Transfer Certificate from the club. Okoro is likely to return home within a day or two and his availability for the ensuing season remains in doubt. He has informed the club that he will remain with East Bengal only from the AFC Cup, if he decides to play in India. He will thus be unavailable for the Calcutta Football League.  Copyright

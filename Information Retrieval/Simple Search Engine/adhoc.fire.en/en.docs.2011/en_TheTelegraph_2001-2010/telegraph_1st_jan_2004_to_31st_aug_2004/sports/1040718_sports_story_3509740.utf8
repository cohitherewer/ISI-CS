 Bahrain snatch point off China
Beijing, July 17 (Reuters): Hosts China were held to a surprise 2-2 draw by Bahrain in the opening game of the Asian Cup on Saturday after a late strike by substitute Husain Ali. Just as China thought they had escaped after battling back from a goal down, Ali equalised in the 89th minute with a thumping drive from the edge of the box. There were swathes of empty seats in Beijing for an opening match punctuated with fouls and six yellow cards. Midfielder Mohamed Hubail put Bahrain ahead with a superb goal four minutes before half-time, flicking the ball over China goalkeeper Liu Yunfei from 25m. Booed off the pitch at the interval, China hit back within six minutes of the restart. Zheng Zhi calmly converted a retaken penalty following a hand-ball from Bahrain defender Sayed Mohamed. China, who have never won the Asian Cup, took the lead in the 67th minute when striker Li Jinyu beat goalkeeper Ali Saeed with a low left-footed shot that went in off the post. But Husain Ali, who had been on the pitch for less than 10 minutes, made sure Bahrain got a points.  Copyright

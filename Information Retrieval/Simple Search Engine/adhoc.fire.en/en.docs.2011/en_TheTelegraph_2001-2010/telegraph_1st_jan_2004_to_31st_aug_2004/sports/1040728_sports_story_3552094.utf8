The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag shines all the way
 - Jayasuriyas 130 not enough to deny India final berth Colombo: India held their nerves to script a stunning last ball victory against Sri Lanka on Tuesday night to move into the final of the Asia Cup. In a nail-biting Super Four match, India managed to scamper home by four runs in the must-win floodlit encounter despite the heroics of Sanath Jayasuriya, who cracked his second successive century with a sizzling 132-ball 130 to almost spoil Indias party. The result means Pakistan are now out of the Asia Cup, which would again see the same opponents brace up for the title. India stopped Sri Lankas march at 267 for nine after they had scored 271 for six, built mainly around half centuries from Virender Sehwag (81) and Sourav Ganguly (79). Man of the Match Sehwag shone with the ball at the nick of time, claiming three important wickets including that of Jayasuriya to tilt the balance in his teams favour. Chasing 272 for victory, the hosts were struggling at 134 for five in the 27th over before the 35-year-old Jayasuriya decided to take over. With his usual flamboyance, the former Sri Lankan skipper steered his team to within sniffing distance. The veteran batsman displayed his class by not only notching up his 18th one-day century but also resurrecting the Lankan run chase with a flurry of strokes that left the Indians in a daze. But the visitors bounced back after his dismissal with a couple of quick wickets which put immense pressure on the hosts who needed 11 runs in Zaheer Khans last over. The Baroda speedster conceded five runs in his first three balls and then cleaned up Maharoof off his fourth ball to raise hopes of an Indian victory. And as the last ball went through to the keeper, Souravs men erupted in joy, celebrating their victory snatched from the jaws of defeat. Indias total appeared bigger than it was when Sri Lanka lost five wickets but Jayasuriya took charge with a 114-run sixth wicket association with Tillekeratne Dilshan (39). Jayasuriya ripped the field apart, reaching his 100 from 95 balls with 11 fours and one six in the 36th over. Earlier, Team India skipper led by example, sharing a 134-run second wicket stand with Sehwag (81) and then a run-a-ball 71 with Yuvraj Singh (50) for the fourth wicket. Sehwag was blessed with two lives. Ganguly too had his share of luck when he appeared to have been held at the long on fence off Upul Chandana but TV replays suggested it was picked on half volley. Sri Lanka, overall, had a forgettable day in the field. Yuvraj Singh also benefited from their largesse as Dilshan dropped him off his own bowling for 28. Sehwag was initially subdued and his first authentic stroke, a pull of Nuwan Zoysa, came in only the 11th over. But he made a gritty 81 from 92 balls with six fours and two sixes before a wild sweep off Jayasuriya caused a nick to the keeper. Ganguly began with a peach of an offdrive against Malinga but was more intent to provide the base for the innings, reaching his half-century from 84 balls with six fours. He was finally out in the 46th over when he dragged a lofted stroke off Malinga to mid-on, having batted for 120 balls for his 79 runs with nine fours. Meanwhile, Match referee Mike Proctor on Tuesday cautioned India for their poor over rate. Proctor noted that the over rate of the Indians was quite tardy and insisted on the need to work on this aspect. Team India coach John Wright assured the Match Referee that the team would be careful that the over-rate does not become an issue in the final on Sunday. (PTI)  Copyright

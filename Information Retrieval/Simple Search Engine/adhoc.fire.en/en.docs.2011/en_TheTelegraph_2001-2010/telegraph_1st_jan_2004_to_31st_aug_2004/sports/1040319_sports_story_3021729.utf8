 Bengal boys regain crown
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bengal regained the under-19 national football crown after seven years, beating Karnataka 2-0 in the final in Giridi on Thursday. Suraj Mondal and Lal Kamal Bhowmick scored for Bengal, who had last won the trophy in 1996, when the tournament was held in Midnapore. Incidentally, Suraj emerged the highest scorer of the tournament, netting ten goals, including a couple of hattricks, while Surajit Basu scored nine overall. Bengals dominance in the tournament could also be gauged from the fact that they scored 27 goals in all and conceded none. Bengals joint coach Tarun Dey (Raghu Nandy being the other) informed from Giridi that the players played exceptional football and were deserved winners. Attributing the success to teamwork, Dey said: Keeping Suraj and Surajits names in mind, everybody played to the teams requirements, and it paid off in the end. Dey also felt that the young squad had the potentials to make it big in the senior level soon. Most of them should play for the big clubs in a year or two, he pointed out.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Desailly under Uefa scanner
London: The Uefa has opened a disciplinary case against Chelsea defender Marcel Desailly after he apparently elbowed Monaco striker Fernando Morientes in the face during Tuesdays Champions League semi-final, first leg tie. The clash took place in the second half of the match in Monaco, which the home side won 3-1 with Morientes scoring the second goal for his club. An Uefa spokesman said their control and disciplinary committee would review video evidence of the incident on Friday. If the committee punishes Desailly, he is likely to miss the second leg of the semi-final on May 5. In another incident, Chelseas Claude Makelele reacted theatrically to a cuff from Monaco midfielder Andrea Zikos and the Greek was dismissed. As Makelele received a yellow card for his part in the affair, the incident will not be reviewed by Uefa. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Bangla bowlers action reported 
London: Bangladesh left-arm spinner Abdur Razzaq has been reported to the ICC for a suspect bowling action, the ICC said on Sunday. Razzaq, 22, was reported by match referee Roshan Mahanama after Bangladesh played Pakistan in an Asia Cup match in Sri Lanka on Saturday. Razzaq bowled his full quota of 10 overs, taking two for 36, in the match that was won by Pakistan by 76 runs. The umpires were of the opinion that the players action needed to be looked at and it is in the best interests of the player that this is done at this early stage of his career, said Mahanama in a statement. Under the ICCs two-stage process Razzaq will be allowed to continue to play but will have his action monitored by a bowling specialist and a human movement expert from the ICCs panel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004  Trainer, jockey suspended 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Trainer Daniel David and his stable rider Yacoob were suspended on Tuesday for the unsatisfactory riding of their less fancied runner Majestic Hills in the 1,200m Happy Scot Handicap. While Daniel was handed an eight calendar-day penalty  beginning from February 20, Yacoob has been asked to cool his heels till the end of April. The race was won by Daniels former deputy Errol Bhungards fancied runner Midas Touch.				 										Daniel and Errol, however, ruled the days card with a treble and double, respectively. They were helped by the visiting jockey K. Kariappa who won three events for them.				 										As expected, Apprise was simply brilliant in the 1,600m Baqlava Cup that the Dont Forget Me-Sterling Lass four-year-old won by a big margin. Going over the mile trip for the first time in his career, the winner, a 5-2 favourite from Vijay Singhs stable, was assisted in the saddle by C. Alford. 				 										RESULTS				 										1.

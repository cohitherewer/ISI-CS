The Telegraph - Calcutta
Valencia keep in touch with leaders Real
- EUROPEAN ROUND-UP - Inter beat Juventus, Milan draw with lowly Modena Inter Milans Christian Vieri challenges Juventus Gianluca Zambrotta on Sunday. (AFP) Madrid: Valencia kept the pressure on leaders Real Madrid after second-half goals from Mauricio Pellegrino and leading striker Mista gave them a 2-0 win at home to basement side Murcia on Sunday. Rafa Benitezs side looked as though they were going to be frustrated by their ultra-defensive opponents until Argentine defender Pellegrino broke the deadlock with a powerful header 17 minutes from time and Mista secured the all-important win with a late volley. With seven matches remaining Real, who claimed a somewhat fortunate 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday, lead the table with 67 points. Valencia (66) are hot on their heels, while Deportivo Coruna are a distant third on 57. Deportivo effectively waved goodbye to their title hopes after surrendering a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Real Betis. Atletico Madrid took an important step towards securing a place in next seasons Uefa Cup with a 2-1 win at home to Valladolid, a victory that leaves them in fifth place three points clear of Osasuna. Valencia, who went into the game at Mestalla on a four-match winning run, found it hard to open up a crowded Murcia defence. In-form winger Vicente made room for himself on the left on several occasions, but a forest of Murcia defenders were always on hand to clear the danger when he neared the area. Without playmaker Pablo Aimar, who picked up a groin injury while on international duty with Argentina in midweek, Valencia appeared to lack the ideas needed to unpick the defence. The home side had a strong penalty appeal turned down when Mista was brought down in the area at the end of the first half, but it was not until 28 minutes into the second half that they got the breakthrough. With his first touch of the ball, substitute Jorge Lopez swept a corner in from the right and Pellegrino burst through the defence to score with a bullet header. The goal immediately settled a nervy Valencia and Mista grabbed his 18th goal of the season when he volleyed in from eight metres out after Murcia failed to clear a Vicente cross. Earlier, neatly fashioned first-half strikes from forward Albert Luque and midfielder Victor had put Deportivo 2-0 up against Betis after just 17 minutes, but the visitors pulled one back when Marcos Assuncao scored with a spectacular free-kick just after the half hour. At the other end of the table Celta Vigo, drew 0-0 at Athletic Bilbao. In Italy, Inter Milan beat champions Juventus 3-2 on Sunday, providing a helping hand for city rivals Serie A leaders AC Milan after they were held to a 1-1 draw at lowly Modena. Juventus defeat means that with six games of the season remaining AS Roma, who won 3-0 at Lecce, are now the only side with a realistic chance of stopping European champions Milan claiming their 17th Italian title. Milans second successive draw leaves them on 69 points with Roma on 60 but with a game in hand. Third-placed Juventus are now 10 points behind the leaders.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

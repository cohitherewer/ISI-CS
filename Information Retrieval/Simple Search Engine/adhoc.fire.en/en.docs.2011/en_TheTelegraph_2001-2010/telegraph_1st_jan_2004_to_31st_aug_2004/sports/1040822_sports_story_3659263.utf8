The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Constantine rues Ashim absence
 Constantine Ho Chi Minh City: India begin their campaign in the six-nation LG Cup invitational football meet against Myanmar here on Sunday, hoping to repeat the 2002 magic when they went home with a rare title. The Indians, now 142nd in Fifa rankings, are five places above their group A rivals, but the absence of striker Ashim Biswas is worrying chief coach Stephen Constantine. Biswas had to pull out at the last moment following a torn cartilage with Bijen Singh replacing him. Yes, we will feel Ashims absence, Constantine said. He is planning to start with skipper Bhaichung Bhutia and Abhishek Yadav up front against Myanmar, who suffered were drubbed 0-5 by the hosts in the tournament opener at the Thong Nhat Stadium on Friday. Sangram Mukherjee is likely to be under the bar while the defence will be manned by Dipak Mondal, Debjit Ghosh and Mahesh Gawli. Heavy rains here hit preparations of the teams for this meet. The Indians couldnt practise as well as they would have liked after landing here three days ago. The Myanmar national team, it may be recalled, had beaten Mohun Bagan 4-0 at home a few days ago.

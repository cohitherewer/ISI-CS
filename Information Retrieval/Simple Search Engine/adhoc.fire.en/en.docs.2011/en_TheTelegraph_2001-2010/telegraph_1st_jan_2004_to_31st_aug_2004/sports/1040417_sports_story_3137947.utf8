 Rebels ignore ultimatum
 - ZIMBABWE CRISIS - Breach-of-contract move to be initiated Harare: Senior white players ignored a Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) ultimatum to show up for practice on Friday after refusing to play against visiting Sri Lanka next week. Their absence has fuelled expectations that they will be fired by the ZCU. The ZCU had instructed them to report for practice or face sanctions. It did not specify what those sanctions might be. The squad practice session was postponed until later in the day because of rain, but ZCU managing director Vince Hogg said the 13 players  including former captain Heath Streak  were still in breach of contract. Streak was back at his ranch near the western city of Bulawayo on Friday, while the others were meeting with their lawyer Chris Venturas in Harare. They didnt arrive, Hogg said. There is a process we need to follow on breach of contract, and the next stage is letters to the individuals asking them to remedy their breach. Hogg said the process would be taken forward in the next day or two, and that communication between the ZCU and the players, who are refusing to play in the home series against Sri Lanka, had broken down completely. Zimbabwean cricket was thrown into disarray on Thursday when the ZCU was forced to select a second-string squad to take on Sri Lanka next week after the players rebellion. The rebel players announced their boycott on Thursday while demanding that Streak be reinstated, one selector be sacked and that the board apologise for a series of transgressions. The 13 rebel players are Streak, Stuart Carlisle, Grant Flower, Craig Wishart, Andy Blignaut, Raymond Price, Gary Brent, Sean Ervine, Travis Friend, Barney Rogers, Trevor Gripper, Richard Sims and Neil Ferreria. The protesting players were omitted from the 13-man squad that will play Sri Lanka in the first of five one-day Internationals on Tuesday in Bulawayo. Only four of the selected squad, captained by 20-year-old wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu, played in Zimbabwes last Test and one-day side against Bangladesh in February and March. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

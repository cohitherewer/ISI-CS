 Anand slips to 6th
Monaco: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand drew both his games with Peter Leko of Hungary and slipped to joint sixth position in the eighth round of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament (as briefly reported in Mondays City edition). Vladimir Kramniks path to recovery continued as he shot in to sole lead defeating Loek van Wely of the Netherlands in both games. After the eighth round, Kramnik has 11 points followed by Hungarian Peter Leko and Morozevich, both having 10 points each. Russian Evgeny Bareev and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine are next in line with 9.5 points apiece, while Anand slipped to joint sixth on nine points along with Russian Peter Svidler. Playing black in the blindfold, Anand went for a well-analysed variation in the Sicilian Paulsen and comfortably equalised against Leko after a natural exchange sacrifice in the middle game. The trading of pieces started off early and continued till the players arrived at a completely level position where the peace was signed on the 23rd move. In the return game, Anand played white and opted for the Sicilian Rossolimo that failed to yield anything impressive. After some routine manoeuvring, Leko had a level position on board and Anand settled for truce on the 17th move.  (PTI)  Copyright

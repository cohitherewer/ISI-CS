 Bone scan to check Shoaib back injury
 - PCB medical inquiry to conduct several tests  A lot will depend on Shoaibs honesty Islamabad: The four-member medical inquiry committee, constituted to probe the nature of injuries which put five Pakistan players out of action during the recent series against India, would conduct various tests on Shoaib Akhtar when he appears before it on Tuesday. Local daily The News quoted PCB officials as saying that it has been decided to conduct a bone scan on Shoaib to determine his claims of back injury which kept him off the field on Day III of in the series-deciding third Test in Rawalpindi. The report said PCB officials had their doubts after an MRI test, on Shoaib and other fast bowlers, during the match failed to provide evidence of any injury. The News quoted medical specialists as saying that no medical test could reveal a muscle problem, if it is not serious. It all depended on the honesty of the players. The four-member medical team held its first meeting in Lahore on Sunday during which seamer Umar Gul, who helped his team win the second Test in Lahore, appeared before it. Gul had an injury even before he was selected to play the second Test and it was aggravated due to long bowling spells at the nets and in the match. Gul was dropped for the crucial third Test due to injury. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan told a media conference in Quetta that strict disciplinary action would be taken against the players who were found guilty by the inquiry commission. Khan said it was a matter of concern that Pakistan surrendered in the third Test without a fight. I was shocked by the manner of Pakistans defeat in the series decider, he remarked while adding that the team simply surrendered with only middle-order batsman Asim Kamal fighting it out despite carrying a serious injury. Khan, however, admitted that Pakistani players did not fight well in the series and termed the lack of discipline among the players as a major cause of the defeat. We are considering changes and we need to improve things. We need a bowling coach, batting coach and a fielding coach too. Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has made light of the PCB threat of disciplinary action for alleging match-fixing during the recent series, saying the PCB had no locus standi to do so since he was not a contracted player. Replying to a notice from the PCB chairman referring his case to a disciplinary committee, a defiant Latif said that his comments on television, regarding match-fixing after Pakistan lost the fourth one-dayer, were the views of an individual and player who was not under contract with the board.

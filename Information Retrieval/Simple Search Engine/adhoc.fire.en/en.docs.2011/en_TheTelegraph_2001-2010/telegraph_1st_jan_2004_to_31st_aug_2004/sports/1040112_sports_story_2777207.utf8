 Players support a boost for Rusedski
 Greg Rusedski practises in Homebush, near Sydney on Saturday. (Reuters) Sydney: British number two Greg Rusedski said on Sunday he had been heartened by the support he had received since news became public that he had tested positive to a banned steroid. Rusedski will face an independent tribunal in Montreal on February 9 after admitting last week that he had tested positive for the nandrolone at a tournament in Indianapolis last July. Rusedski has protested his innocence and in his defence has pointed to the case of Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach. Ulihrach also tested positive for nandrolone in October 2002 and was initially found guilty and banned for two years, but he was reinstated when it emerged that ATP trainers had been giving players mineral supplements, electrolytes and other supplements. We stopped the process of giving out supplements through our trainers in May 2003, ATPs David Higden told BBC Radio on Sunday. We feel our drugs testing programme is stellar and comprehensive and internationally recognised as one of the top testing programmes. Rusedski, however, failed his drugs test at a tournament in Indianapolis last July, two months after the ATP said it had stopped its trainers providing supplements. We would have to determine whether Rusedskis case occurred before that time (May 2003), Higden replied when asked if the Briton would be able to prove his innocence. Meanwhile, while refusing to answer direct questions, Rusedski read out a brief statement to reporters after practising ahead of the Sydney International tournament, saying he was heartened by the support he had received from other players. Ive had nothing but support from people  even in the locker room, he said. Ive been particularly pleased by the players reactions. Theyve been very positive and sympathetic towards me. I want to concentrate on my tennis right now. Ive got a match coming up and I want to get ready for Sydney this week and Ive got the Australian Open as well, Rusedski said. I would just like to say Im looking forward to playing my match against Juan Ignacio Chela  its obviously going to be a difficult first round match but one Im going to try and do my best in. Chela was suspended for three months in 2001 after testing positive to a steroid. Australian Lleyton Hewitt has backed Rusedskis decision to continue playing tennis in the lead-up to his drug hearing. Rusedski remains committed to playing in this weeks Sydney International and the Australian Open starting next week. Hewitt told a pre-tournament press conference here on Sunday he supported Rusedskis right to keep playing tour events until his case was heard and said he would have no problem dealing with him in person. You cant find a guy guilty till hes actually proven guilty, Hewitt said. At the moment its fine. Hes playing here and in Melbourne. Id say hello to him. Im not that close to Greg but I wouldnt ignore him or anything  thats for sure.  (AFP)  Copyright

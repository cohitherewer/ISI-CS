 Iran escape sanctions 
Athens: Iran have escaped sanction over the failure of their judo world champion to fight an Israeli in Athens, a source in world judos governing body said on Thursday. Despite earlier statements by Iranian officials that Arash Miresmaeili was told not to fight Ehud Vaks last Sunday because of Teherans political boycott of Israel, the source said the International Judo Federation (IJF) had now accepted that Miresmaeili had a genuine medical reason for showing up too heavy to fight.

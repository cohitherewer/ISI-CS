The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassi vs Roddick in semis 
 - Cincinnati Masters - Hewitt downs Safin to set up clash against Robredo  Andre Agassi after winning the first set in a tie-breaker over Carlos Moya in the Cincinnati Masters on Friday Cincinnati, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Andre Agassi continued his good run at the Master Series to set up a dream semi-final against US Open champion Andy Roddick on Friday. The 34-year-old 11th seed emerged from a battle of former world number ones with a 7-6, 6-3 victory over Spains Carlos Moya, saving six set points in the first set. The crowd favourite saved the set points in an epic tie-break in which Moya went toe-to-toe with the eight-time Grand Slam winner until Agassis varied ground strokes induced the fourth seed to over-hit when trailing 13-12. That tie-break was definitely one for the memories  I dont remember playing one that deep before, Agassi said. To come out two days in a row and start raising the standard is what creates belief. Its important to me beat some of the best in the world and get the belief in my game, added Agassi, who has been suffering from a lengthy hip injury and repeatedly the subject of retirement speculation. However, Agassi struck the ball with conviction against an opponent who possessed superior mobility and a fiercer forehand but was narrowly outsmarted by the tactical skill and technical variety of one of the games all-time greats. The victory created a confrontation of two generations of leading Americans. Roddick, the 22-year-old defending champion joined Agassi in the semis after a 6-3, 6-3 win over Tommy Haas, the former world number two from Germany. Roddick rarely needed to rely on his record-breaking serve and will be favoured to beat Agassi, despite having managed it only once in five attempts. Earlier, Lleyton Hewitt continued his build up for this months US Open by winning another battle of former world number ones with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Marat Safin. The Australian 10th seed beat the 24-year-old Russian in a contest containing plenty of brilliant counter-hitting and a little controversy to set up a last-four meeting with Spains Tommy Robredo. I played pretty well on his service games, said Hewitt, the 2001 US Open winner. I feel like I have been playing pretty well this year... I feel that I am near the mark. I just hope that in a few weeks time I will get the breakthrough. Safin had the greater weight of shot but was eventually frustrated by Hewitts consistency and superior mental toughness. When a Hewitt drive, which appeared to land a couple of inches out in the second game of the second set, was called in, Safin reacted with anger. He squatted on the court, placed his fingers on the surface to show the distance by which the ball had missed, and walked up to the umpire to remonstrate. The decision appeared to distract Safin as he lost four successive points to drop the game, which allowed Hewitt to take a firm grip on the match. Robredo followed up his conquests over former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero and Bri- ton Greg Rusedski by easing past Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-2, 6-3.  Copyright

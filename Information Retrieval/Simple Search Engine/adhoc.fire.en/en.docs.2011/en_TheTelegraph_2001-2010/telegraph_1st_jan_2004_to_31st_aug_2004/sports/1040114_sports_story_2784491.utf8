The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Capriati pulls out, Clijsters may follow suit
 - AUSTRALIAN OPEN - Injuries take a heavy toll on womens field  Sydney: Two-time champion Jennifer Capriati has withdrawn from next weeks Australian Open because of injury, tournament organisers said on Tuesday. Tennis Australia announced that the world No. 6 had pulled out because of a back problem. The possibility of another major pullout loomed large after world No. 2 Kim Clijsters withdrew from the Sydney International with a serious ankle injury. Capriati, who won the Australian Open in 2001 and 2002, would have been among the favourites in Melbourne this year. The American is the latest in a series of top players to withdraw from the first Grand Slam of the year. Serena Williams announced last week that she would not be defending her title. Four-time winner Monica Seles and 1995 champion Mary Pierce have also pulled out. Jelena Dokic is unlikely to play after pulling out of two warm-up events citing personal reasons. Clijsters injured the ankle playing for Belgium in last weeks Hopman Cup in Perth, but was hoping to make a quick comeback after a few days rest. But she aggravated the injury during a practice session on Tuesday and had to immediately withdraw from the Sydney tournament. Melbourne will definitely be in doubt now, she said. I have to think about my future as well. I have to make sure this doesnt become a chronic injury. I have to get on top of it now. Clijsters, one of the favourites to win the Australian Open, said she would wait a few days before making a final decision on Melbourne but did not want to risk any further damage. I might as well take a long break and try and be ready for my next tournament. Clijsters spent nearly a week on crutches after she first injured herself and said her foot would never completely heal and might eventually require surgery. But she was confident she could resume playing as soon as this week after completing her first practice session on Monday. She changed her mind after the pain returned during a morning workout on Tuesday. It got worse and thats what scares me, she said. I wasnt even trying 100 per cent so thats a sign its definitely not right. Clijsters absence would be an enormous blow to Australian Open organisers, already missing some of the worlds best women players.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

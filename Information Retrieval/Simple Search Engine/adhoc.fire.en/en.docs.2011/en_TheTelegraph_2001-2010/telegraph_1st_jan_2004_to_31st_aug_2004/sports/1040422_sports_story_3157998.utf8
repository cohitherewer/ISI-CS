 Fitness camp for Team India in June
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Indian cricket teams preparations for the next season will begin in June, with a physical conditioning programme. This was decided at a meeting between coach John Wright, physical trainer Gregory Allen King and BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya here on Tuesday evening. The players will get some precious rest in May before the start of the fitness programme, though a decision on the venue and dates will be taken later.  Copyright

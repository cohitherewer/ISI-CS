 Fleming puts NZ in final 
 - TRI-SERIES - Flintoffs maiden century in vain as visitors win by six wickets  Andrew Flintoff in action against New Zealand during the tri-series ODI in Bristol on Sunday. (Reuters) Bristol: Opener Stephen Fleming top-scored with 99 to put New Zealand into next Saturdays one-day triangular series final with a six-wicket win over England on Sunday. New Zealand reached their target with 16 balls to spare for the loss of four wickets after a maiden one-day International century from Andrew Flintoff had spurred England to 237 for seven in their 50 overs. Captain Fleming was dismissed for 99 from 125 balls with fellow opener Nathan Astle (53) and Hamish Marshall (55) also helping the Black Caps to their third win in a row. New Zealand qualify for the Lords final with 22 points, West Indies and England are on 10. Lancashire allrounder Flintoff, dropped on nought, made 106 in his 73rd one-dayer, after England had slumped to 57 for three. The hosts were indebted to a fourth wicket stand of 122 between the 25-year-old Flintoff and Middlesex captain Andrew Strauss, who was dropped on one, before making 61. Both batsmen were floored by the luckless Hamish Marshall. Marcus Trescothick was still on nought when he edged James Franklin. However, wicket-keeper Gareth Hopkins dropped a chance that was heading straight to Fleming at first slip. But after taking a single, Somerset left-hander Trescothick was run out coming back for a second when Ian Butlers throw from third man was safely gathered by Hopkins. On 12 the Yorkshire openers loose drive off Jacob Oram went straight to Chris Harris at cover. His exit meant Vaughan had scored just 39 runs in his four series innings. Strauss was dropped in the gully by Marshall off Oram. Marshall then missed another chance when he floored Flintoff at backward point, denying Scott Styris a second wicket in his first over after he had Robert Key caught off his first ball.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dempo rally to force 2-1 win
 - NFL - Bagan fail to defend early goal  Rennedy put his team ahead in the eighth minute Margao: Dempo Sports Club staged a superb rally to eke out a hard-fought 2-1 win over Mohun Bagan in their National Football League (NFL) match here on Tuesday to keep alive title hopes. Dempo, who were five points adrift of leaders East Bengal before the start of the match, moved to 35 points from 18 matches. Mohun Bagan, who needed a win to steer well clear of relegation zone, remained in eighth place with 19 points from 17 outings. After Sunday Seah neutralised Rennedy Singhs early strike, substitute R.C. Prakash scored the winner for the Goan outfit, shortly after half-time, with a powerful 30-metre right-footer. Mohun Bagans hopes of coming back into the match was thwarted by Dempos defence and goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal who stood firm. The green-and-maroon brigade began on a promising note. They went ahead in the eighth minute when Rennedys left-footer found the far post after custodian Mondal tried to punch away an Ashim Biswas cross intended for Rennedy. Dempo, who did not lose hope despite conceding the early goal, put enough pressure and got the equaliser through a penalty. Referee Dinesh Nair blew for the penalty when Rennedy brought down Prakash as he was moving dangerously towards the goal after collecting a pass from Wilton Gomes. Seah made no mistake with a deft placement to the left of the goalkeeper. Mohun Bagan would have fallen behind a second time had Eduardo Ribeiros header not hit the post two minutes before half-time. Dempo went ahead a minute after change of ends. A move between Seah and Prakash culminated in the latter, a substitute, finding the target. The Goans could have increased the lead a minute later, but Clifford Miranda drove the ball straight to the keeper. Seah, who was marked tightly by the rival defenders, also missed an open chance as he shot straight into the hands of the custodian after Clifford had done the spade work. Bagan made some desperate attempts to equalise but Mondal stood firm under the bar to save shots from Rennedy and Noel Kasak.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gilchrist leads counter-attack
 - Second Test - Aussies hit back after brave Lankan last-wicket stand Kandy: Adam Gilchrist smashed a superb unbeaten century as Australia hit back after being stung by Sri Lankas tail in the second Test here Wednesday. The left-hander slammed 140 not out for his tenth Test hundred as Australia reached 221 for two at stumps on the second day after conceding a lead of 91 runs. Damien Martyn was unbeaten on 64. Australia are now 130 runs ahead with eight wickets in hand. Gilchrist produced the big knock at the right time as his team needed to bat long in order to give enough time to skipper Ricky Ponting to recover from a back sprain. Ponting suffered the injury while fielding in the morning and received physiotherapy treatment. A team official said it was not certain yet when he would come in to bat. Gilchrist, batting at Pontings number three ,shared a record 195-run partnership for the unfinished third wicket with Martyn. Their stand is now Australias best for the third wicket against Sri Lanka, surpassing 158 between Allan Border and Tom Moody in Brisbane in 1989-90. Gilchrist was in punishing mood from the beginning as he swept off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan to reach his half-century and then firmly drove left-arm seamer Chaminda Vaas through the covers to reach his hundred. Gilchrists century came off just 128 balls, with two sixes and 14 fours. He has so far hit three sixes and 19 fours. He played a big role in keeping Muralidharan at bay with his attacking approach. The Sri Lankan, who Tuesday became the third bowler in Test history to take 500 wickets, had a rare off-day as he gave away 81 runs in his 22 wicketless overs. Australia were left to claw their way back after a record 79-run stand for the last wicket between Sri Lankan tail-enders Vaas and Murali (Lankas best, the previous being 73 between Hashan Tillekeratne and Sajeewa de Silva vs Pakistan in the Asian Test Championship in Dhaka in 1998-99). Vaas hit an unbeaten 68 for his seventh Test half-century and Murali an entertaining 43. The pair helped their team plunder 119 in the morning session.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Lanka frustrate Australia 
 - SECOND TEST 
- Atapattu century helps visitors reach 411/5 on rain-curtailed Day III  Thilan Samaraweera gets back into crease as Adam Gilchrist tries to stump him in Cairns on Sunday. Samaraweera finished the day unbeaten on 53. (AP) Cairns: Captain Maravan Atapattu hit a century to lead Sri Lanka to 411 for five on the weather-disrupted third day of the second Test against Australia on Sunday. Atapattu top-scored with 133, including 19 fours, as his side trailed by 106 runs on first innings with two days remaining. When play was called off for the day at 1720 local (0720 GMT) because of rain and bad light, Thilan Samaraweera was unbeaten on 53 with wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana not out 30. Atapattu reached his 15th Test century in the morning session but failed to add to his score after lunch. It is special. It was hard work and Im glad to get a hundred against Australia in Australia, he told a news conference. The 33-year-old right-hander was dismissed in the first over of the afternoon session for 133, caught at gully by Matthew Hayden off Glenn McGrath. Atapattu, who hit 19 fours and batted for five-and-a-half hours, had put on 124 for the third wicket with Mahela Jayawardene. Jayawardene fell in the next over for 43, miscuing an attempted hook shot off Michael Kasprowicz to be caught by the bowler with the score on 280. Australia had claimed two wickets for no runs but Samaraweera and Tillekeratne Dilshan guided Sri Lanka safely past the follow-on mark of 318 in a fifth-wicket stand of 65. Australia leg spinner Shane Warne picked up his second wicket of the innings, finishing with figures of two for 117, and needs another five to equal Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharans world record of 527. Australia coach John Buchanan said Warnes record bid had not been a big talking point among the players. Im sure Shane thinks about it every so often, particularly as he takes a wicket and edges closer, Buchanan told reporters. Great credit to the Sri Lankan batsmen. Their batting has been of great patience, trying to bat as long as they possibly can. Atapattu appeared set for his seventh double century in 75 Tests and described his departure immediately after lunch as a shock. We had one or two soft dismissals. I have faced better wicket-taking deliveries than the one I got out to, put it that way, the opening batsman said. My scores are either very high or very low. If you get a good start, you should go out and make the most of it, added Atapattu, who made one run in his first six Test innings. I had a bad, bad start to my career and when I was left out of the side there was little hope that I would score a century against any other Test-playing nation, let alone Australia, Atapattu said. It all happens for the good, I guess. I had to return to club cricket and get some experience before I came back to the Sri Lankan side. But the undemonstrative Atapattu has made up for lost time by scoring 4,685 Test runs at an average of over 40 even allowing for his wretched start. Getting a hundred outside your country is something I consider as a big thing for me, said Atapattu. Sri Lanka had resumed on their overnight score of 184 for two, with Atapattu on 75 and Jayawardene on nine. Dilshan fell to Warne for 35 shortly after tea, leaving Sri Lanka on 345 for five. Samaraweera, however, resisted the Australia attack for three hours before the premature close, hitting five fours. Kumar Sangakkara (74) and Atapattu shared a second-wicket stand of 138 on Saturday. Australia lead the two-match series 1-0. Both sides have got a lot of work to do on a very good batting wicket, Buchanan said of the remaining two days in the match.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

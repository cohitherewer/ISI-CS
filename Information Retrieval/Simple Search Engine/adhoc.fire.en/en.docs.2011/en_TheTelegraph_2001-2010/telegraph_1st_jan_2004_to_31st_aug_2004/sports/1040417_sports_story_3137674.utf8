The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Balaji, Pathan toast of nation
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The accolades have been flowing in thick and fast following Indias historic win in Pakistan. The Telegraph spoke to three former Test players who have toured Pakistan. The following is what they said:  ERAPALLI PRASANNA: The way Sourav led in this series is remarkable and the best after Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi. Sourav reminds me of Tigers aggression and positive approach. Its been incredible, the way he motivated the team and converted it into a winning unit. The Indians looked insurmountable. Their batting was good but its bowling that has come of age. This inspired show is encouraging and will set the tone for many more overseas wins. Pakistan felt their bowling was invincible but it proved to be their weakness. Balaji was the best has the ability to move the ball both ways even after the first 15 overs.  KARSAN GHAVRI: It was superb to witness history and I would rate it as the greatest effort in Indian cricket. The allround effort made it special. A few catches were dropped, some scintillating ones were taken too. This victory is sure to usher in a new chapter. It is difficult to compare this with any other achievement. Like everything new, it has its own charm. Balaji will get a bulk of the credit. He was rewarded for his disciplined line and length. The bowlers proved that if you stick to your target, everything else will fall in place. The win has proved that speed alone doesnt win matches.  ARUN LAL: This is one of the best moments in Indian cricket. But this wasnt unexpected since I always believed the Indians were better placed. In fact, we allowed the Pakistanis to claw back in Lahore. Pakistan are struggling to find replacements for Akram, Waqar and Saeed Anwar. On the other hand, weve discovered two fine bowlers in Pathan and Balaji who made the difference. If the series was to start afresh and I was asked to choose between two sets of bowlers in Shoaib and Sami and Balaji and Pathan, I would go for the latter.  Copyright

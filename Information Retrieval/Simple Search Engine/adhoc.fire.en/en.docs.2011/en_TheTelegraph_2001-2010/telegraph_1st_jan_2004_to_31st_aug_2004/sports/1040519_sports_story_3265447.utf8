The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Confident Valencia look to break jinx
 - UEFA CUP FINAL - Olympique Marseille bank on Drogbas brilliance  Olympique Marseilles coach Jose Anigo (left) and captain Brahim Hemdani with the Uefa Cup during a press conference at the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg on Tuesday. (AFP) Gothenburg, May 18 (Reuters): Three years on from the heartache of losing a second successive Champions League final, Valencia will be desperate to claim a European trophy against Olympique Marseille in the Uefa Cup final on Wednesday. The Primera Liga champions lost to Real Madrid in 2000 and Bayern Munich, in a penalty shootout, a year later and the pain of those defeats still haunt Valencia. Eight of the present Valencia squad played in the 2001 defeat in Milan. This time the Spaniards have the incentive of completing a league and European double and put the gloss on a superb season. Valencia last tasted European glory in 1980 when they defeated Arsenal in the Cup Winners Cup final. They previously won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the forerunner to the Uefa Cup, in 1962 and 1963. Valencia captain David Albelda believes experience and humility may provide the key to victory. Valencia have grown and developed as a team over recent years, Albelda said on Tuesday. The team has remained more or less the same, but it is now better prepared and more experienced. The key to our success is hard work and humility. We dont think we are superior to anyone else but we are determined to continue improving. This seasons title success was built on a rock-solid defence as well as a potent strikeforce. With one game remaining, they have conceded just 26 goals in 37 league matches while their tally of 71 goals scored, spearheaded by Mistas 19, has only been matched by Real Madrid. For the game against Olympique we are going to change as little as possible for the final because up to now it has worked very well, said Valencia coach Rafa Benitez. Valencias miserly defence is sure to be tested by Marseilles outstanding striker Didier Drogba. The striker from Ivory Coast, who was bothered by a hip injury, was passed fit to play Tuesday. It has taken some time for us to get Didier back on his feet, but he will be in the line-up and his presence can help us win, added Marseille coach Jose Anigo, who has guided Marseille to their first European final since 1999 just four months after taking charge at the Stade Velodrome. Drogbas first season at the Velodrome has yielded 32 goals overall, including 11 in Europe. His exploits have earned him the Ligue 1 player of the year award and his importance to the side was no more evident than in the semi-final second leg when two superb strikes against Newcastle secured Marseille a place in the final. Albelda said Valencia had no plans to change their usual defensive tactics to cope with Drogba. We are talking about a great player, the defensive midfielder said. But in the Spanish league we have to cope with great players week in and week out and we dont use any special man-marking or other plans to stop them, so we wont do it with Drogba either. Instead we will be relying on the whole team to do its work. Marseille, European champions in 1993 and beaten finalists in the Uefa Cup six years later, entered the competition at the third round stage after a disappointing Champions League campaign in which they finished a well-beaten third in their group. While they have played less games than Valencia in their run to the final, their passage has included the impressive scalps of Liverpool and Inter Milan. The return of France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez has also coincided with Marseilles strong showing in Europe. The French No. 1 re-joined his former side on loan from Manchester United in January and signed a two-year permanent deal in April. Barthez is no stranger to European success with Marseille, part of their European Cup winning side that defeated AC Milan 1-0 in Munich. The Drogba and Barthez factors notwithstanding, Marseille will start the final as underdogs. Anigo acknowledged the Spanish team would be firm favourites to maintain a record of just one defeat against French opposition in European competition. They are a strong team and not Spanish champions for nothing, he said. But even a great side has a weak spot somewhere and we need to exploit that. We just need to be confident in our own tactical approach. Anigo also spoke from the heart when he said: We are sick and tired of not winning anything. We cannot limit ourselves to playing for sixth or seventh place in the French league. My dream is to build a strong team here. It will take two or three years but we can get back to being one of the best in Europe. Winning this final would be the start of something great. Marseille has a glorious past and we want to ensure a glorious future.  Copyright

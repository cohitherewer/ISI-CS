 ICC appoints two more officials to curb fixing
Islamabad: Concerned over match-fixers targeting the proposed India-Pakistan series, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to deploy as many as three anti-corruption officials besides other security personnel to curb the menace. The ICC has informed that in addition to the retired Pakistani army colonel Qaza Noor, a security official each from India and Australia would keep a close watch during the series, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman Sami-Ul Hasan said over phone from Karachi on Thursday. Col. Noor represents ICCS Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) in Pakistan and Bangladesh while N. S. Virk is Indias representative. Deployment of additional officials for one series indicates ICCS renewed fears that match-fixing might still be affecting the game. The ACU had written to the PCB in recent months that some Pakistan players may have underperformed in a couple of one-day tournaments in 2002. Meanwhile, a Pakistani newspaper had quoted PCB sources as saying that although the ICC and boards of both countries had taken adequate steps to check illegal betting, a complete ban was not practical. The report said bookmakers had extended their network from Asia to Europe, Africa and the US. The much-awaited series will be the prime event for bookies to earn millions of dollars as they have formed a strong international network ahead of Indo-Pak series, the sources said. They were quoted as saying that a few former Dubai-based Indian, Pakistani and African cricketers were working as the international link for the network. These cricketers also help in communicating rates of teams and players and informing the bookmakers about the form, fitness and abilities of players. The Mumbai-based bookmakers communicate the rates of matches to South Africa, England, US, Australia, Hong Kong, and other major venues in the world. Karachi is working as the Pakistani headquarters of this network and some money-changers and prize bond dealers reportedly work for the match fixers. Lahore is also a major location for these people and various hotels in Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi and Islamabad are used for big deals during the matches, the sources disclosed.  (PTI)  Copyright

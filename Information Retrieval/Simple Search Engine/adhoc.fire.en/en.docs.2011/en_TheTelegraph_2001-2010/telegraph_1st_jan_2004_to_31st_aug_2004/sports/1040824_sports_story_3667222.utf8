The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Best 2 days of my life: Massu 
Athens: In a feat that would have made ancient alchemists green with envy, Chiles Fernando Gonzalez and Nicolas Massu turned sweat, tears and raw desire into solid gold at the Olympic Games. The small South American nation had waited more than 80 years for a gold medal at an Olympics and in an Athenian amphitheatre they won two in less than 24 hours. Gonzalez and Massu bagged the nations first in a memorable marathon that started on Saturday and ended at 2:37 am (2337 GMT) on Sunday. They beat Germanys Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schuettler 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6, 6-4. Its a wonderful thing for Chile, Gonzalez said, and the Chilean people responded, partying long into the night in Santiago. Massu, without a single victory on a hard court all year heading into the Olympics, defied conventional wisdom and the form book less than 24 hours later by beating American Mardy Fish for the mens singles gold medal in another five set tussle 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 (as briefly reported in Mondays Late City edition). The rest, as they say, was hysteria, as the stadium erupted in a din of Chilean roars and tears and Massu took to the medal podium with Gonzalez  winner of the singles bronze medal  at his side. I cant believe it ... these have been the best two days of my life, an emotional Massu said. It is just incredible for Chile. We are a small country and this is amazing. All my life I looked up to the Olympics. To be here is enough but to win gold... to win two golds, well... Fish could hardly believe it either. He just kept getting better and better, he said. And more untired. A medal ceremony, news conference and mandatory dope test had meant Massu had not left the tennis stadium until after 0400 GMT on Sunday morning following the doubles win. On Sunday night, he looked simply shattered and, after a strong start, seemed to fade in the warm Greek night as his legs started to cramp. But the player known to his fans as The Vampire clearly enjoys his late-night encounters and, thanks to vociferous support and single-minded determination, he closed out a famous victory in exactly four hours. Womens world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne had just as much to smile about as she confounded the pundits to win gold in her first tournament after three months away from the sport.

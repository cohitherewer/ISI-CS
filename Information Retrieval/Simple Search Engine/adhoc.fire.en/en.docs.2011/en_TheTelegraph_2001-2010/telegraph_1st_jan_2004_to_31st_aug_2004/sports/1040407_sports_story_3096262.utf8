 SLC to wait until Murali report
Colombo: Sri Lankas cricket board will not publicly release the results of an assessment into Muttiah Muralidharans bowling action until it has received an official report. On Monday, University of Western Australia biomechanist Bruce Elliott, who supervised last weeks tests, said he had spoken to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). But Sri Lanka board chief executive Duleep Mendis said on Tuesday no official report had been received. We will not be making any public statements until after we have that report, he said. Muralildharans bowling was assessed after the off spinner was reported to the International Cricket Council (ICC) by Match Referee Chris Broad during the recent Sri Lanka and Australia Test series. The legality of his doosra, which spins in the opposite direction to his stock delivery, has been questioned. Muralidharan has taken 513 wickets in 88 Tests and is now only six wickets short of West Indian Courtney Walshs world record. The 31-year-old took 28 wickets in the home series against Australia last month, while Australia leg spinner Shane Warne grabbed 26 to move to 517. Muralidharans action has been the source of controversy since he was no-balled for throwing by umpire Darrell Hair in a Test match at Melbourne in December 1995. He was later cleared by the ICC after a University of Western Australia biomechanical analysis, which concluded that the bent-arm action created an optical illusion of throwing.

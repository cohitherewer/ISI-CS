 Humpy goes down
Elsita (Kalmykia): A day after scoring a memorable win, top seed grandmaster Koneru Humpy on Thursday suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Tatiana Kosintseva of Russia in the second game of the third round in the womens world chess championship here. With their scores now tied, both Humpy and Kosintseva would fight it out in two tie-break games of 25 minutes each for a place in the next round. Kosintseva will have the advantage of playing white in the first game of the tie-break. Ketino Kachiani of Germany also failed to defend her full point lead against 14-year-old Kateryna Lahno of Ukraine even though former world womens champion Maiai Chiburdanidze of Georgia and compatriot world junior girls champion Nana Dzagnidze sailed through to the quarter finals. Dzagnidze scored her second successive victory over Maia Lomineishvili, also of Georgia, while Chburdanidze held Jana Jackova of Czech Republic. Also qualifying to the last 16 was world cup winner Xu Yuhua of China who beat Elisabeth Paehtz of Germany. (PTI)  Copyright

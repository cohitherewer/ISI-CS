The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne eyes 519, Ponting sweep 
 - THIRD TEST - Lankans may opt for three-pronged pace attack to salvage pride  Shane Warne at a training session in Colombo on Tuesday. (Reuters) Colombo: Skipper Ricky Ponting says hell give Shane Warne every opportunity to break Test crickets bowling record, as long as it doesnt compromise Australias chances of winning the final Test against Sri Lanka. Warne needs nine wickets to surpass retired West Indian Courtney Walsh (519 wickets in 132 matches) as the most prolific wicket-taker in Tests. His Australian teammates are aiming to become the first touring side to register a 3-0 Test series sweep in Sri Lanka when the final Test starts here on Wednesday. It all depends on how the situation of the game is, Ponting told reporters on Tuesday. We cant be playing with individual performances when there is a game in the balance. Ponting added that he would help Warne if he could. I cant bowl the ball for him but I can help him out with a few more overs if he wants to bowl and he is close to the record. If he keeps bowling as well as he has been then there is a huge chance that he will be able to reach it, he said. The way this team heads, is all based around team performances, Ponting said. But, Im sure therell be a lot of proud teammates around if he (Warne) happens to achieve (the record) this week. He will also be the first bowler to take five consecutive five-wicket hauls in an innings if he does it in the first innings. However, there is no chance of easing off in the third Test, said Ponting, in his first series as Test captain. Pakistan has twice won 2-0, Sri Lanka holding on for a draw in the third Test in the 1999-2000 series and the middle Test cancelled at Colombo in 1994. New Zealand defeated Sri Lanka in the first and third tests in 1984 for a 2-0 series result. Coach John Buchanan is unlikely to make many changes in his Australian line-up, although Brad Williams is a contender for a recall if the tourists decide to add a third pace bowler to the attack and Andrew Symonds spot in doubt. Sri Lanka captain Hashan Tillekeratne said Thilan Samaraweera had recovered from a groin strain and was an option to bat at No. 3 in place of Avishka Gunawardene. Sri Lankan selectors were also contemplating using three pace bowlers to complement Muralidharans spin, he said. Tillekeratne said Sri Lanka had been dominant in phases of the first two Tests. Muralidharan says the hosts are capable of winning in Colombo. Ok, the series is gone, but now we have to play for pride, said Muralidharan, who has 20 wickets so far in the series and is only the third man to reach 500 in his career. Hell need a career-best haul on home soil to have a shot at Walshs record of 519. Hes had more than 15 wickets in a Test once, returning 16 for 220 (7 for 155 and 9 for 65) against England at the Oval in 1998  the fifth-best figures of all time. His best at home was 13 for 115 against Zimbabwe at Kandy in 2002.

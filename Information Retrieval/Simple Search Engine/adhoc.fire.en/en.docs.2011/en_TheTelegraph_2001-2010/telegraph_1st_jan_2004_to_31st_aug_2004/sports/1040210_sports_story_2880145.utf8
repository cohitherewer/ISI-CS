The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wheelchair life stares at Lomu
 Lomu needs kidney transplant to be able to keep walking Auckland: Jonah Lomu faces life in a wheelchair if he does not get a kidney transplant, the former All Black said on Monday. Lomu said in a television interview a relative had offered him a kidney but doctors had advised he was not a good donor. We are travelling down the road (transplant) with a relative but he has complications, Lomu said, without spelling out the problem. Lomu was told early in 1995, before he leapt to prominence at the World Cup in South Africa, that he had a chance of having kidney failure in the future. I had nine good years of playing rugby after being given that warning but I have some unfinished business and I will be giving my all to play again, Lomu said. I want to finish on my own terms. The word impossible is nothing. A nerve specialist told Lomu, who has trouble walking because of dialysis treatment, he might not walk again in time. He didnt put a time limit on it, but thats what he said, Lomu said. Lomu took most of 1997 off for treatment for the rare kidney complaint and returned later that year. I have a lot of steps to climb to get to my house and I can still climb them, Lomu said. I try to monitor the difference every day and its not getting any easier.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mixed day for Indian shuttlers
New Delhi: Indian men thrashed rank-outsiders Macau 5-0 in the Thomas Cup (preliminaries) Asian Zone badminton tournament in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, according to information received here. The Indian women, however, went down 2-3 to second seeds Japan in a Uber Cup group A league encounter. Japans decision to leave out world No. 10 Kanako Yonekura backfired in the very first rubber with national champion Aparna Popat upsetting Miho Tanaka 11-8, 7-11, 11-2 to put India in the lead. Aparna, ranked 24th, began superbly against her opponent ranked 10 places higher to win the first game with relative ease. The Indian, however, lost her footing in the second, losing 7-11 but came back strongly in the third to take the match in 55 minutes. Despite a fighting performance by the top Indian doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Shruti Kurien, Japanese duo Shizuka Yamamoto and Seiko Yamada won 15-7, 15-3 to level the match 1-1. World No. 16 Kaori Mori then put japan ahead by defeating B. R. Meenakshi 11-9, 11-4 in the second singles. Thereafter, Keiko Yoshitomi and Kumiko Ogura beat Fatima Nazneen and Manjusha Kanwar 15-4, 15-3 to give Japan an unbeatable 3-1 lead.In the inconsequential fifth rubber, Trupti Murgunde came back from a game down to beat Yu Hirayama 4-11, 11-4, 13-10.

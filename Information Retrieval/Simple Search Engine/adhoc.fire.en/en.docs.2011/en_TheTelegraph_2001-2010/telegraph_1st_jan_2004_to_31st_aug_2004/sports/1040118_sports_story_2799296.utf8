The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Records by Gibbs, Kallis
 Herschelle Gibbs, who scored 192, in Centurion on Saturday Centurion, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis established individual records as South Africa enforced their batting superiority on the second day of the fourth and final Test against the West Indies on Saturday. Gibbs made 192, the highest score by a South African in Tests against the West Indies, while Kallis became the first South African to score centuries in four consecutive Tests with an unbeaten 130. When bad light halted play eight overs before the scheduled close, the West Indies were seven without loss in reply to South Africas imposing first innings of 604 for six declared. Chris Gayle was four not out with Daren Ganga on two. South Africa, who lead the series 2-0, have scored at least 500 runs in the first innings of each Test, matching the achievement of Australia at home to the West Indies in 1968-69. However the 12 centuries scored by South Africa in the series is the most by any team in Test history. Opener Gibbs, who shared a stand of 301 for the first wicket with captain Graeme Smith on Friday, batted for almost eight hours, faced 335 balls and hit 24 fours and three sixes. Kallis was at the crease for more than four hours, collecting 14 fours and a six in 199 balls. Gibbs and Jacques Rudolph resumed on 301 for two, and took their partnership to 72 before a ball from Edwards stayed low and bowled Rudolph for 37. Gibbs was out in the seventh over after lunch when he cut a wide long hop from part-time leg-spinner Ramnaresh Sarwan to Daren Ganga at backward point. Sarwan took his second wicket six overs later when Gary Kirsten slapped a full toss back to the bowler to be caught and bowled for 10. Neil McKenzie helped Kallis add 86 for the fifth wicket before edging a delivery from fast bowler Dillon to be caught by Brian Lara at first slip for 50. Kallis then batted cautiously to reach his century in almost four hours, from 183 balls and with nine fours and a six. The West Indies were set to face 13 overs before the close, but bad light curtailed play after just five overs. As the players left the field, South African Andre Nel had just under an hour to get to church on time for his wedding.  Copyright

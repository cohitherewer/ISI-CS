The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mills escapes penalty
Wellington: New Zealand players are prepared to prove a point and appeal at every opportunity in the dead rubber one-day International match against Pakistan after pace bowler Kyle Mills was cited for excessive appealing in the previous match. Mills has been officially reprimanded by Match Referee Chris Broad in Wednesdays ODI against Pakistan in Napier. Mills was cited with a level 1.5 offence. Mills received a censure but escaped the maximum penalty of being fined half his match fee for breaching ICCs Code of Conduct by celebrating his dismissal of Pakistan batsman Salim Elahi without checking to see if the umpire had given the caught behind decision.

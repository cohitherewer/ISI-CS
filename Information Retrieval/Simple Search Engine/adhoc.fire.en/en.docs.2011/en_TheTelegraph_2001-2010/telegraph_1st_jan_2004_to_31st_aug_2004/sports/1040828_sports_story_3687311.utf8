 Gul turns to Imran
Karachi: Pakistan quick Umar Gul, ruled out of cricket for several months because of a stress fracture injury, is to seek inspiration from former captain Imran Khan. He is hoping to get advice from Imran, who had to stop bowling for over two years due to a stress fracture in his left shin bone. Imran is the best example of a fast bowler who overcame a career-threatening injury to make a successful comeback. I think his guidance would be invaluable, Gul said on Friday after arriving home from South Africa where his injury was diagnosed this week. (Reuters)  Copyright

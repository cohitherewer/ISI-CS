The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Now, at best a bronze only 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: Here is another medal for India, within pure sniffing distance. Somewhat expected, it seems, with Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi racing into the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes lost in the semi-finals on Thursday. The fifth seeded Indians went down 2-6, 3-6 to unseeded Germans Nicholas Kiefer and Rainer Schuettler. Technically, that should be termed an upset, the Indians being the fifth seeds and the Zimbabweans fourth. However, considering the Indians past laurels and the way they won Wednesday, one hesitates to say that. It was as emphatic a victory as one can see. The bronze is yet to be confirmed, because the semi-final losers will play-off for the bronze. The one hour 29-minute match didnt see much heart from the Zimbabweans. That, possibly, was the fine dividing line between the two pairs. Dominating in serve, volley, and baseline play from the start, the Indians broke through in the seventh game. In the second set, the Zimbabweans looked a trifle more composed, putting that much more effort in their returns and net play, though their serving left much to be desired. Just that Bhupathi and Paes were made to fight every point. Not that the Indians were complaining, they were adept at it. The break came in the third game itself, and when, at 5-4, and Paes serving for the set and match, the Zimbabweans fought hard, one could only clap politely. It was all over, really, bar the shouting.  Copyright

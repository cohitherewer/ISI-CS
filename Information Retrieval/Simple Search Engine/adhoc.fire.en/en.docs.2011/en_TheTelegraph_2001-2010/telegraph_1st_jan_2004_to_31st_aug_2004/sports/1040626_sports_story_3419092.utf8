The Telegraph - Calcutta
 As good as it gets in Portugal 
 - Loss brings a grim sense of dj vu for England Lisbon: Hundreds of thousands of Portuguese flooded the streets in wild celebrations of the hosts while England fans stumbled into the streets in disbelief, misery and rage on Thursday after their team were knocked out of the European Championship in a heartbreaking quarter final. Following more than two hours of tension, Portuguese fans screamed and leapt for joy after goalkeeper Ricardo saved an England penalty and then scored the match-winner. I always knew we could win this, said 15-year-old Portuguese fan Diogo Godinho, sweat pouring down his face. Go home English  go home and cry. As midnight passed live television showed huge crowds of people of all generations waving flags and scarves as they swamped streets and squares in the major Portuguese cities. There were no reports of violence involving England fans, about 30,000 of whom watched the game in Luz stadium here, apart from brief scuffles in a Lisbon port district. Supporters watching on a large screen television on the outskirts of the capital could barely watch as first David Beckham for England and then Portugals Rui Costa sent their penalties over the bar. It was a bit of a lottery at the end, said student Alex Tome. But this will give us confidence to go all the way. Nearby England fans were bitterly disappointed. Im completely gutted. Im just beginning to wonder when well ever win a penalty shootout, said David Wheatley, an IT analyst from York. To be fair, I thought Portugal played better, but we battled on, we just didnt get the luck we needed. When Portugal beat Spain on Sunday, all-night celebrations followed with fans joy-riding up and down the main Liberty Avenue, honking horns and waving scarves and flags. The defeat of England guaranteed a repeat and thousands turned the central Lisbon landmark into a mass party as fans of all ages let off firecrackers, sang and cheered madly. In the popular docks district, England and Portugal fans scuffled. The loss to Portugal after a shoot-out  the fourth time England has lost on penalties in a major tournament in 14 years  brought on a grim sense of deja vu. The gods are always, always against England in the big tournaments, said mechanic Dave Johnson, 31, shaking his head in disbelief as he trooped home from The Gooners pub in London. The pub had been so packed that people were crowded on the street watching the game through windows. It cleared out minutes after Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo placed his spot kick past David James to win the game. Its absolutely unbelievable. History is repeating itself. When will the luck ever go with us? said Johnson. This is beginning to scar me emotionally. Judy Davies, standing on her front patio, her face still painted red and white with Englands cross of St George, said luck had nothing to do with it. Referee Urs Meier disallowed a Sol Campbell headed goal in the last seconds of ordinary time and Davies was incapable of discussing the incident without sounding unhinged. That referee is supposed to be the best in the world. Well, hed better never set foot in England. Ill lynch him with my own bare hands, she said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

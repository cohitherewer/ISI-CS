The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shib Sagars perfect 10
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Shib Sagar Calcutta: Shib Sagar Singh claimed 10 for 57 to singlehandedly demolish YMCA (Coll.) in the CAB senior division league on Wednesday. At the East Calcutta District Sports Council ground, YMCA were all out for 141. The CAB could not confirm, but its likely to be the first ten-wicket haul in the League. It was after getting the eighth wicket that I felt something of this sort could happen, said the left-arm spinner who had claimed seven wickets in the previous game. He has been in the Ranji squad for five games this season and has played in two of them. The performance, though, has not been encouraging and he has failed to find a berth in the squad for the national one-day meet. Ironically, the haul came a day before the one-day meet begins in the city. SUMMARISED SCORES  Rajasthan 167 (Sanjay Agarwal  54; Devender Panwar 8/66).

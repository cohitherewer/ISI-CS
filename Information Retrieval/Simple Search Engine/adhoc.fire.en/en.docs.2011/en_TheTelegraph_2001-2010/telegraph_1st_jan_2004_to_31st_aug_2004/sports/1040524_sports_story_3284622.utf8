 HASC drub BSF
Bangalore: Satish Kumar scored two goals as Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club (HASC) trounced BSF 5-0 in a second division National Football League encounter on Sunday to keep alive their hopes to qualify for the elite league. Sunil opened scoring for the HASC off a cross from skipper Dayanand as the home side led 1-0 at half-time. After the breather, Satish found the target twice in the space of five minutes to increase the lead to 3-0. Things went worse for the securitymen as Sarbjit Singh, attempting to clear a Xavier Vijyakumar corner-kick, deflected the ball into his own net. In injury time, Vijayakumar made it 5-0 off a pass from Manju. With one more match to go, HASC, Fransa of Goa and SBT all have nine points from four outings. The top two teams from the second division will secure a berth in the elite league.  (PTI)  Copyright

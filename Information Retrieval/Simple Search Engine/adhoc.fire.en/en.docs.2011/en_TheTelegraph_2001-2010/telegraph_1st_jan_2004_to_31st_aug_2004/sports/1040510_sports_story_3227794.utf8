 Johl finishes joint 3rd
 - MACAU OPEN 
- Knutzon wins title by a stroke over Wiratchant  Amandeep Johl in action in Macau on Sunday. (AFP) Macau: American Jason Knutzon birdied the last two holes to win the $275,000 Macau Open by one stroke over Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant after a thrilling final round on Sunday. Knutzon fired a closing four-under-par 67 at the Macau Golf and Country Club to seal his maiden Asian Tour triumph over Thaworn, who finished with a superb round of 65. Overnight leader Amandeep Johl of India and Taiwans Lu Wen-teh finished joint third, while Irelands Padraig Harrington and last years runner-up Scott Barr of Australia shared fifth place. Harmeet Kahlon, the other Indian in the fray, carded a 68 to finish seventh with an aggregate of 272. The laid-back American victor, the son of a fighter pilot, finished in a blaze of glory, chipping in for birdie at the par three 17th before setting up the winning putt with a glorious 117-yard approach that stopped three feet from the pin. His four-day total of 16-under-par 268 was a Macau Open tournament record and earned him a cheque for $44,412. The final round in Macau was a thriller, with Johl, who had led since the opening round, maintaining his grip through the front nine. When he made the turn, he led by two strokes but an errant tee shot on 10 which landed in thick bushes led to a double bogey six. Johl was disappointed with yet another near miss. I was cruising along through nine. Then I hit it into trouble and three-putted the 10th and that cost me, said Johl, still searching for his first Asian Tour title. (AFP)  Copyright

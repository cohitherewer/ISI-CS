The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Actual match fees may come down
Mumbai: The Indian players will retain their monthly contract amounts as decided, but will take a pay cut in their match fees once the contracts system is introduced, according to BCCI joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty. There is a likelihood that the match fees for Tests and ODIs could be cut down by around Rs 65,000 for Tests as well as ODIs once the contract system is put in place. But this is not final, Shetty said here Tuesday. The suggestion is that cricketers making the playing XI would get Rs 2 lakh for a Test, as compared to Rs 2.68 lakh they are getting now by way of fees plus money to sport logos of the team sponsors on their apparel. For ODIs the amount works out to Rs 1.60 lakh as compared to Rs 2.35 lakh they are getting now, Shetty explained. As per the players wishes the BCCI will give the same match fees for all cricketers chosen in the playing XI and 50 per cent of the same to the reserves, Shetty added. Shetty also reiterated that to make it to the contracted players list, a cricketer should have represented the country in at least 3 Tests or 10 ODIs. By this criteria 17 members of the probables list for the Asia Cup, announced in Bangalore a couple of days back, qualify. (PTI)  Copyright

 Lanka take early control
Harare: Dion Ebrahims ninth Test half-century notwithstanding, Sri Lanka gained the upper hand on the first day of the second Test against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Friday. The hosts, put in to bat after losing the first Test by an innings and 240 runs within three days, were dismissed for 228. At close, Sri Lanka were 18 for no loss. Left-arm pacer Chaminda Vaas took three for 41. He drew first blood inducing an edge from Brendan Taylor when the batsman was on five. Zimbabwe were dismissed an hour after tea, a slide that began when Ebrahim attempted to cut a delivery from Maharoof and was caught by Tillekeratne Dilshan at first slip. Muralidharan, who took two for 58 to extend his world record tally, did not bowl his controversial doosra.

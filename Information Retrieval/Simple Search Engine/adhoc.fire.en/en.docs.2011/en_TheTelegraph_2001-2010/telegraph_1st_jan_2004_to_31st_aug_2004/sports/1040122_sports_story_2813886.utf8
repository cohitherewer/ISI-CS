(Reuters) Melbourne: Andre Agassi underlined his intentions for a fifth Australian Open crown on Wednesday at the same time that Amelie Mauresmo raised hopes of a maiden Grand Slam. Agassi and Mauresmo, both seeded fourth, hammered their way into the third round of the opening Grand Slam of the year in sweltering conditions at Melbourne Park. They were joined by top seeds Andy Roddick and Justine Henin-Hardenne, who wasted little time advancing. Roddick flashed past Czech Bohdan Ulihrach 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 and Henin-Hardenne ousted French qualifier Camille Pin 6-1, 6-4. Daniela Hantuchova, however, bowed out after another dismal defeat. The Slovakian 15th seed lost 4-6, 3-6 to local favourite Alicia Molik. Frances Mauresmo smashed Ludmila Cervanova 6-0, 6-2 before saying that the absence of past champions Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati meant she feels she could go one better than her runner-up spot in 1999. Agassi will be hoping he can continue going like this after a commanding 6-0, 6-2, 6-4 defeat of Czech qualifier Tomas Berdych. It took the four-time champion 82 minutes to wrap up his 23rd consecutive win at Melbourne Park, having lifted the title in 2000-01 and 2003. Injury kept him out of the 2002 tournament.. American James Blake beat Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-1. Agassi also won the Open on his first trip to Melbourne Park in 1995 and now rues the nine years at the beginning of his career that he stayed away. I wish I had played here every opportunity I had, the 33-year-old said. Apart from the fact that this place has been so amazing for my career, I just enjoy being here so much. I think I didnt play at the time for reasons that were questionable. I was young and I wanted time off. Determined to make up for lost time, Agassi always comes to Melbourne in perfect physical shape, and his performances in his first two matches mark him out once again as a strong favourite. Roddick, coached by Agassis former mentor Brad Gilbert, looks to have adopted something of Agassis fitness regime. He also appears in fantastic shape and is playing with great confidence. Former world No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten reached the third round for the first time, ending a miserable run at Melbourne Park. Until Wednesdays 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Ivan Ljubicic, the Brazilian had endured five second-round losses and two defeats in the first round here. Paradorn Srichaphan was leading 6-3 against Jerome Golmard before the latter withdrew clutching his right hamstring. Marat Safin beat Finlands Jarkko Nieminen 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a pulsating encounter. Lindsay Davenport also advanced but not without difficulty. The only former womens champion in the draw, she beat Frances Emilie Loit 6-3, 3-6, 6-0.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Solicitor general of India on ICC panel
London: Indias solicitor general Goolam Vahanvati has been appointed by the International Cricket Council as one of the members of a two-man panel to look into the allegations of racism in Zimbabwe cricket. The ICC Tuesday confirmed the appointment of Vahanvati and South African high court judge Steven Majiedt as the panel to carry out an independent review into the allegations. They will investigate the racism allegations that were raised during a dispute between the Zimbabwe Cricket Union and some of its players in April this year. At the ICC executive board meeting in June, the board chose to appoint a panel of at least two eminent persons to conduct an independent review, and report back to the board in October 2004 with findings and appropriate recommendations. ICC president Ehsan Mani said the appointment of the eminent panel meant that the allegations could now be duly investigated. The ICC regards allegations of racism as a serious matter and the process which is now in place to investigate these claims will ensure that the issues and concerns are addressed thoroughly and independently, Mani said in an ICC release. Judge Majiedt and Mr Vahanvati both have considerable experience in overseeing legal hearings and dealing within a fair and considered framework for all parties. We have strong confidence and faith in the approach they are undertaking, and the ICC executive board will receive their findings and recommendations in October. In commencing the review, the panel will take written submissions from involved parties over the next 30 days, which will be researched and evaluated to try to determine trends and any prima facie allegations of racism.

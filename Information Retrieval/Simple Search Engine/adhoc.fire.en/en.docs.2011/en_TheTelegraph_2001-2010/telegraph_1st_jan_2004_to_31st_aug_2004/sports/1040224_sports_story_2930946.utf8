 Crucial win for Sasikiran
 Sasikiran is now in second pack Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran put it across GM Andrei Kharitonov of Russia and moved to joint fifth spot after the conclusion of the sixth round of A group in the Aeroflot International Open chess tournament now underway here. Four players  GMs Ferenc Berkes of Hungary and Russians Valerij Filippov, Pavel Tregubov and Alexander Rustemov  emerged joint leaders with a tally of five points eachs. Sasikiran is in the next pack of 16 players with 4.5 points so far and will now meet GM Tomasz Markowski of Poland in the next round with white pieces. The other Indian hope in this section, Lanka Ravis aspiration for his second GM norm suffered a setback as he went down fighting against GM Jaan Ehlvest of Estonia and could not add to his score of 3.5 points. Despite the loss, Ravi is still in contention for the norm but needs a couple of big victories. The other Indian contestants had a bad day with seasoned GM Praveen Thipsay and GM Sandipan Chanda suffering losses to Leonid Yurtaev of Kyrgyzstan and Athan Mastrovasilis of Greece, respectively, to remain on two points while Neelotpal Das drew with Vladimir Potkin of Russia to reach 3. In group B, IM P. Konguvel has surely turned into a dark horse. The Indian recorded his fifth straight victory and took his tally to 5.5 points out of a possible 7. On the receiving end this time was Nikolay Ogloblin of Russia who had played excellently in the first half of the tournament. For once, this section witnessed a change in the lead-pack with David Arutinian of Georgia coming out good against overnight leader Beniamin Galstian of Armenia. Arutinian shot into sole lead on 6.5 point following this victory and is followed by four players on 6 points. Konguvel shares the sixth spot with 7 others but GM-in-waiting Tejas Bakre slipped to joint 15th after settling for a draw with Wang Yu of China. Summing up a good day for the Indians in this section, IMs S. Kidambi and Dinesh Kumar Sharma scored easy victories over Vardan Danielian of Armenia and Rinat Zhumabaev of Kazakhstan, respectively.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chartered plane for players likely
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Lahore, Feb. 21: The Indian cricketers internal travel in Pakistan could be on a chartered aircraft. In fact, this is being seriously considered by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Were definitely looking at it... However, finalising may take some time, informed PCB chief executive Rameez Raja, during a brief chat with The Telegraph this evening. If that does materialise, the Pakistan team will also avail of the same aircraft. Clearly, such an arrangement is going to minimise the security risks. But, then, it will be an expensive proposition. To get over that, the PCB could even tie-up with TEN Sports, which has the TV production rights and requires an aircraft to criss-cross Pakistan. Meanwhile, Rameez confirmed that the teams security is going to be directly handled by Islamabad: The local police wont be involved with the inner (security) cordon... Moreover, from what I understand, the same set of personnel will accompany the teams throughout the tour. Thats going to be continuity with a difference.  Copyright

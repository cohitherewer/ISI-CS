The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick calls for discipline 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Coach Subhas Bhowmick rued lack of discipline among some of his players as East Bengal left for the Maldives on Sunday evening to take on an unknown Islands FC in an AFC Cup first-round match. The players must show discipline before a crucial match like this, he maintained before leaving the city. The fact that both goalkeepers Sangram Mukherjee and Sandip Nandy skipped the morning practice might have led to Bhowmicks call for discipline in his squad. Injuries to key players like Dipak Mondal and Subhas Bhowmick as well as non-availability of prolific scorer Cristiano Junior should also add up to his woes. Meanwhile, Al Wahda from Syria landed in Margao to face Mahindra United in another AFC Cup group match, reports PTI.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A battle to stay afloat
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge striker Akeem worries Md. Sp. Calcutta: Both teams know that a loss here can push them deeper into the relegation zone. Therefore, a victory is highly at stake when Tollygunge Agragami take on Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. While Mohammedan Sporting have 14 points from 14 games, Tollygunge have 13 from 13. If we have to ensure our stay in the NFL first tier, we have to win tomorrowthe boys know this fully well, Mohammedan Sporting coach Jamshed Nassiri said after practice on Friday. However, Hossain Mustafi skipped practice on Friday and Dipendu Biswas is nursing a back pain. However, the latter hopes to be fit by Saturday. Nassiri felt Tollygunge striker Akeem Abolanle will be the man to look out for. Hes quite nippy, well have to keep an eye on him, the coach said. Tollygunge coach Krishnendu Roy also felt its time his boys should start delivering. Weve our backs to the wallIts mandatory we win tomorrow, Roy said. He, however, sounded more worried about the referring than Mohammedan Sporting. Poor referring has let us down in a number of matchesI hope its not the same on Saturday, he added. But the fact that Kabijit Khotel and Jiten Rai are coming back (both missed the last game with double booking) lends relief to the coach. Also, I hope my No. 1 keeper Chinmoy (Banerjee) is fit, Roy said. Chinmoy was nursing a swelling on his back and missed the past few matches.  Copyright

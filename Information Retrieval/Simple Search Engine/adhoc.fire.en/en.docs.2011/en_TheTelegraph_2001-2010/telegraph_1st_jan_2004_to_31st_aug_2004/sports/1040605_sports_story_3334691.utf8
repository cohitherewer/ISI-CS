The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ dominate on Day II
 - Fleming, Papps share record partnership as England fielders falter  Stephen Fleming en route to his unbeaten 89 at Headingley on Friday. (Reuters) London: Stephen Fleming and Michael Papps shared a record second-wicket partnership of 169 on Friday as New Zealand dominated the second day of the second Test against England at Headingley. At tea New Zealand, who resumed on 41 for one after Thursdays rain-interrupted opening day, were 206 for two. Papps was the only batsman dismissed in the first two sessions of play, leg before to Andy Flintoff for his highest Test score of 86 from 232 balls with nine fours. Captain Fleming was on 89, his 35th Test half-century, while Nathan Astle was on one. Flemings partnership with Papps was the highest for any wicket by New Zealand at Headingley. The England pacemen failed to take advantage of a pitch still assisting the bowlers when play began on time on Friday. They were also again let down by their fielders when Papps, who was dropped on 15 and 20 on Thursday, was put down by Ashley Giles in the gully off Flintoff when he had scored 36. While Giles was receiving treatment to his left hand, substitute fielder Paul Collingwood squandered a runout opportunity when he missed the stumps from short range with Fleming well out of his ground after Papps had called for a risky single. The Black Caps skipper was then forced to dive to make his ground when England captain Michael Vaughan threw down the stumps with a direct throw but recovered quickly to pull Matthew Hoggard emphatically to the mid-wicket boundary. He brought up his 50 from 107 balls with six boundaries by pushing Giles to leg for a single in the penultimate over before lunch. Papps, playing only his fourth Test, reached his second Test half-century immediately after the interval with a cut for two to third man. Giles, bowling around the wicket, gave the ball plenty of air with close fielders on both sides of the pitch. Fleming used his feet well to on-drive a four and Papps pulled a short delivery to the boundary to bring up the 150. The pair also rotated the strike cleverly with some quick singles before Flintoff finally made the breakthrough, hitting Papps on the toe straight in front of the stumps with a yorker.

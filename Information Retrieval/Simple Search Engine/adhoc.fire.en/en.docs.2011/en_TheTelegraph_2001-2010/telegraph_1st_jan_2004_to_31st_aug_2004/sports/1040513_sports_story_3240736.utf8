 Lillee session for pace trio
Chennai: Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Zaheer Khan will sharpen their skills at the MRF Pace Foundation under Dennis Lillee before Indias series against Australia later this year. It has been the practice for Indian cricketers to visit the foundation for training since late 80s and these three bowlers were here before they went to Australia and Pakistan, foundation director T A. Sekar said. Lillee will arrive on June 14. The trio will train for a month starting May 28. Sekar said besides the Indian trio, bowlers from the National Cricket Academy, three Sri Lankan bowlers and two from Bangladesh will also be there during Lillees visit.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Unsteady start for Chandhok
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Indias young race sensation Karun Chandhok hasnt yet been able to settle down to the British Formula III circuit. At the famous Silverstone International Circuit Chandhok had a none-too-impressive stint, finishing 14th in torrential rain in Round 3 of the championship. According to information reaching here Chandhok described his experience as a tricky weekend. It may be recalled that even in the initial races of the Scholarship class Chandhok suffered hiccups before moving up to the podium. This weekend, Chandhok showed promise in qualifying 12th and 14th. Gusty winds and the rain did not offer ideal racing conditions. Just two-tenths of a second wouldve moved me into the top six  its that close. Unfortunately I was struggling to find time in the first sector of the lap and couldnt really string a lap together when the tyres were at their best, he said. Cold, wet and windy weather welcomed the drivers on Sunday morning, making it the second consecutive wet race of the season. Karun made a good start but got held up by the Scotsman Andrew Thompson on the run down to Copse corner which allowed Clivio Piccione and Alvaro Parente through.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Session with Boycott ends
 - Ex-English opener dubs interaction with Indians private; Woolmer off to England on short trip  Shib Shankar Paul is all ears as Team India coach John Wright offers him tips in the pre-Asia Cup camp in Chennai on Monday. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Chennai: Geoffrey Boycott completed his short stint with Indias Asia Cup probables on Monday. He refused to divulge what transpired between him and the cricketers during the interaction at the conditioning camp. The former England opener said the discussions were a private matter and it was important that it remained so to ensure there was no breach of trust. It is a private matter between the players and myself. I am not here to divulge any information on these. I am here for a specific job given to me, Boycott said. I am here to help the coach, captain and any individual player. But I am very concerned that I keep private the discussions I had with the players. It is very important that I retain their trust and confidence. Boycott also refused to say whether he had pointed out mistakes in the Indian batsmen as he often does while commentating. When I am commentating, my job is to commentate. You should all know that. But when players talk to me, it is private and confidential. Boycott, who played 108 Tests and scored 8,114 runs with 22 centuries at 47.72, said he admired Indian cricket. You have a settled and very good team.  (PTI)  Copyright

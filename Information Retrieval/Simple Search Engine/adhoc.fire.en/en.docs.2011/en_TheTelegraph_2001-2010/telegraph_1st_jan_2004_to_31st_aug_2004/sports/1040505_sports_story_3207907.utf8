 Teams agree to new format
Monaco: Formula One team chiefs agreed in principal to sweeping changes designed to make the sport more exciting, after a meeting with FIA president Max Mosley on Tuesday. A new engine format, a single tyre supplier and a ban on electronic driver aids were the three of many areas accepted by the teams for introduction by the 2008 season. Mosley and the ten team principals were joined by the sports commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, and several engine manufacturers for the meeting, which took place in the Automobile Club De Monaco. The changes will make Formula One more interesting, there will be closer racing and more overtaking. The basic idea is to make the racing closer and more interesting for the fans because that is what they want to see, Mosley said. He added: I think we are going to see a new engine formula in 2006 and the engine manufacturers are going to make proposals in addition to those that we have made to reduce the engine cost by 50 per cent. A new qualifying format could be brought in before the end of the year after team principals agreed that the back-to-back single lap system, introduced this season, has failed. Mosley said the changes will improve the spectacle and put a greater emphasis on driver skills while also reducing operating costs. He said the sport has suffered from a lack of entertainment in recent years.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

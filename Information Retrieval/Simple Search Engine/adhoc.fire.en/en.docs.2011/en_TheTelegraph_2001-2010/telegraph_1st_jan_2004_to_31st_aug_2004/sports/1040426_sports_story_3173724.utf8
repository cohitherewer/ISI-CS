 Tutu backs boycott
London: Veteran anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged Englands cricketers on Sunday not to tour Zimbabwe, saying the world has to send a clear signal to president Robert Mugabes regime. In a television interview, Tutu said: if not going (to Zimbabwe) was to exert some pressure, I would  as someone who used to support the sports boycott against apartheid -- say yes. We need to help the world show clearly that we disapprove of what is happening in Zimbabwe  and, not merely wanting to be punitive, we want to help them become a more just society, the South African cleric said. It isnt that we want to clobber them. Lets do what most of the people, especially the ones who are suffering, are saying we should do. The England and Wales Cricket Board believes current British government advice vis-a-vis Zimbabwe  where Mugabes regime stands accused of human rights abuses -- justifies cancelling the forthcoming winter tour. But the board faces a stiff fine and the threat of suspension if the International Cricket Council disagrees. In January, British foreign secretary Jack Straw asked the board to consider whether the tour would be consistent with Britains policy of isolating Zimbabwe.  (AFP)  Copyright

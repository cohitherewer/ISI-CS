The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne says he will enjoy the sledging
 Maybe Ranatunga swallowed a sheep, says Warne Melbourne: Shane Warne is looking to spice up his long-awaited return to Test cricket by sledging over his one-year drug ban. Warne was recalled to his countrys squad Friday for next months Test series in Sri Lanka. The 34-year-old played the last of his 107 Tests against England in Perth in December 2002 before failing a dope test that earned him the suspension. I hope so, Id be disappointed if there wasnt, Warne said of the prospect of an outbreak of sledging to greet his return to big-time cricket. Thats part of the game I really enjoy, Im sure there might be the odd word here or there which will make me enjoy it more, make me feel a part of it again and Im sure Ill give as good as I get. Warne wasted no time firing off a verbal barb at former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, who this week said his old side was not as fearful of Australias all-time leading wicket-taker (491). Arjuna, hes probably slotting himself around at 150kg at the moment, is he? Warne said. Swallowed a sheep or something like that. Arjuna, well look, hes a wonderful competitor... Its always been fun and games against him. (AFP)  Copyright

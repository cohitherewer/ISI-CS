The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal primed for historic feat
		 Gerrard injury a blow to Liverpool London: Arsenal begin their quest to become the first club since Blackburn Rovers in 1886 to win the FA Cup three years in succession with a tough tie against Leeds United at Elland Road on Sunday. Manchester United, record 10-time winners, visit Aston Villa in a Round III tie, while another glamour tie sends Liverpool to renowned giant-killers Yeovil. Arsenal, who defeated Southampton 1-0 in last seasons final to lift the trophy for the ninth time, will not want to slip up despite chasing glory on four fronts. Arsene Wengers side, one point behind champions United going into the second half of the season, are also through to the last 16 of the Champions League and the League Cup semi-finals. They have not lost to domestic opposition this season but will be wary of a Leeds side who have improved under caretaker boss Eddie Gray, despite a 1-3 reverse at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday that kept them in the relegation zone. Uniteds trip to Villa Park will evoke memories of the thrilling third-round encounter at the same ground in the 2001-02 season when Alex Fergusons side came back from the dead to win.  Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard  is a major doubt for the game after suffering a thigh injury  in the 2-2 draw at Manchester City on Sunday. (Reuters)  Copyright

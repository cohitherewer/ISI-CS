The Telegraph - Calcutta
 It could happen to any of us: Corretja
 Rusedski gets support from Corretja Rotterdam: Spains Alex Corretja has placed himself squarely in Greg Rusedskis corner as the British player awaits a tribunal ruling on results of a positive test last year for nandrolone. It could happen to any of us, the 29-year-old French Open finalist, who was once a member of the ATP Player Council, said. (If Rusedski is found guilty) Id support him, so would most of the players. Im not his best friend, but Id sign a petition for him. Id boycott also  but only if everyone else did, said Corretja. This could happen to any player and I would like to have my fellow player doing that for me. But Corretja, nursing a first-round loss as a wild card against Dutchman Raemon Sluiter at the Rotterdam meet, admitted that a players boycott would be unlikely. This is tennis, everyone does what he wants, you have a lot of different interest and cultures working against each other, its an individual sport. Corretja, down to world No. 90 after being years in the top-10, said agreement must be reached with the ATP to find a safe source of vitamins, mineral supplements and sports drinks which are guaranteed not to be contaminated by illegal, banned substances. Rusedski tested positive last summer in Indianapolis for nandrolone which even doctors admit could do nothing to boost his game. He could get a two-year ban, which would potentially end his career. Corretja said paranoia is ever-present in locker rooms, with players afraid to ingest even the most basic of vitamins which the body needs to replenish from a grinding, almost year-round playing schedule. Just think, 12 years on the tour, working like a dog, running like hell, said the Spaniard. Suddenly you get a positive test and your career can be over. Everything is risky, the ATP tells us that... Maybe they should go out and play for us. Corretja added that he takes an allergy medication, ointment for chapped lips, a multivitamin, two vitamin C tablets and one or two magnesium tablets each day. Playing tennis every day is tough. Its not impossible I could test positive for stuff like this. But if I dont take anything, thats bad for my own health. He added: Im sure that Greg didnt take anything, and most players also believe this. (AFP)  Copyright

				 																																	Kingston: The West Indies signalled an all-pace attack against England in the first cricket Test this week as it dropped spinner Dave Mohammed from the squad Monday.				 																																	Fast bowlers Dwight Washington and Carlton Baugh were also shown the door, as the squad was reduced to a 13-member one after a four-day camp.That left Fidel Edwards, Corey Collymore, Adam Sanford and Tino Best as the bowling options for the Test, which starts Thursday at Sabina Park. 				 																																	The Squad Brian Lara (captain), Chris Gayle, Devon Smith, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Dwayne Smith, Ridley Jacobs, Tino Best, Adam Sanford, Corey Collymore, Fidel Edwards, Ricardo Powell, Ryan Hinds.				 																																	Manchester: Nicolas Anelka wants to stay with relegation-threatened Premier League side Manchester City next season.				 																																	I am very happy here and want to stay. I have a contract with Manchester City and I am playing for them at the moment and next season I think I will still be with this club, the French striker told Mondays Manchester Evening News.				 																																	Anelka has been linked with moves to several club across Europe, including city rivals Manchester United, even though he is under contract until June 2007. I do think about playing for France and want to play for the national team again, Anelka said. First I have to speak with the manager, that is it, we will speak together. I dont know if I will be able to do it before Euro 2004, but why not.				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Former Brazil and Paris St Germain defender Ricardo Gomes suffered a humiliating debut as coach of Fluminense when they lost 0-4 to Vasco da Gama in a derby on Sunday. Gomes, who was raised at the club, took over last Friday, barely a month after being sacked as coach of Brazils under-23 team when they astonishingly failed to qualify for the Olympic Games. 				 																																	Fluminense missed several good openings early in the match, with 38-year-old former striker Romario among the culprits. They paid heavily for the misses as Vasco striker Valdir fired a hattrick and Robson Luis added a fourth in the Carioca championship match.				 																																	Buenos Aires: Chile striker Marcelo Salas scored for the third game in a row as River Plate routed Independiente 1-4 in a derby on Sunday.				 																																	The former Juventus and Lazio striker, who has suffered two years of injury problems, opened the scoring in the 15th minute as River coasted to victory and pulled level on points with Talleres at the top of the Clausura championship. Daniel Montenegro helped himself to two goals and Fernando Cavenaghi completed the scoring for River while Daniel Quinteros grabbed Independientes consolation from the penalty spot.				 																																	Paris: Lance Armstrong will ride in the Dauphine Libere stage race from June 5-12, organisers said on Monday, as the American prepares his bid for a record sixth Tour de France title. Armstrong, who had not been expected to take part, decided to sign up because this years edition of the race in the Rhone-Alpes region of southeast France includes a time trial up Mont Ventoux.				 																																	Nairobi: Patrick Ivuti was dropped from the Kenyan team for the 2004 world cross country championships in Belgium later this month, despite picking up a silver in the main 12km race last year. The six-man squad named on Monday to challenge Ethiopias double-champion Kenenisa Bekele for the world title includes reigning world 5000m champion Eliud Kipchoge, national champion John Korir and exciting prospect Simon Kiprop.Sport on ScreenCricket, Australia vs Sri Lanka  First Test, Day II, live from 10 am on TEN Sports

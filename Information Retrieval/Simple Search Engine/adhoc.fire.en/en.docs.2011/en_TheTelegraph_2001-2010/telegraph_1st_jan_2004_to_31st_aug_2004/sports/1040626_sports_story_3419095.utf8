The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mistaken umpire to sit out rest of Big W
London: The umpire who made a mistake in the decisive tie-break that ended with Venus Williams shock exit from Wimbledon on Thursday will officiate no further at this years tournament. I have now discussed the incident with the chair umpire concerned and we have agreed it will be in the best interests of both parties if he takes no further part in the event, Wimbledon referee Alan Mills said on Friday. British umpire Ted Watts made an error in the second set tie-break when he awarded Karolina Sprem a point when she faulted on a first serve. The Croatian went on to win 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6) and inflict on Venus her earliest Wimbledon defeat in seven years. Despite the furore surrounding the officials gaffe, twice Wimbledon champion, Venus refused to blame the confusion for her second-round defeat. Id like to think that one point doesnt make a difference, she said. But obviously it was a wrong call, yes. Sprem said: I was confused I was like 100 per cent in the match. Mills acknowledged the mistake soon after the end of the match. Regrettably the chair umpire made a mistake that ended up with the score being called wrongly, he said. Although both players seemed perplexed, neither queried the decision and play continued, resulting in Miss Sprem winning the tie-break and the match. As neither player queried the score with the chair umpire at the time, the result stands as the mistake should have been rectified immediately. The problem arose when Sprem faulted on her first serve at 2-1 down in the second set tie-break. Rather than announce a second serve, Watts mistakenly gave the Croatian a point and called the score at 2-2. (Reuters)  Copyright

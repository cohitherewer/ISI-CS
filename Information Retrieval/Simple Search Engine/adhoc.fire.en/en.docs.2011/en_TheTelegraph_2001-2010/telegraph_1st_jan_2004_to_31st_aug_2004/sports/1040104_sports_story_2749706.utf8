		 Sunday, January 04, 2004  Aretino may avenge Guineas defeat 
 BY STAR RACER Calcutta, Jan. 3: Aretino  may walk away with the Calcutta Derby Stakes, the prime  attraction of the winter season that takes the centerstage  in tomorrows race card. Circumstances favours the Vijay  Singh-trained horse to avenge his 2,000 Guineas defeat that  he suffered at the hands of Psychic Flame.				 										The scene has changed after the double classic winning filly Psychic Flame had failed to impress the morning railbirds. The Razeen-Eminence filly has not had adequate Derby preparations since winning the 2000 in a facile manner from Aretino. Derby being an arduous test of speed and stamina, only the fittest are known to survive. With the cloud of doubts engulfing the Darius Byramji-trained filly, it gives the opposition some hope.				 										However, Aretino is not the only one eyeing for the Rs 13 lakh plus purse marked for the winner, the likes of Own Visions, Devils Owns and Red Chiefs, in the eight-horse field are also champions in their own right, though some lack the class of Aretino and some are short on stamina.				 										For instance, Daniel Davids Own Vision had made the opposition look a bunch of novices in the Ladies Derby, the Calcutta Calcutta Oaks, last month. However, the Razeen-Treasure Land daughter was up against a poor opposition on that ocassion. Red Chief, another of Daniels ward, too, finished a decent third in the 2000. The fact that the distance has been stretched from 1,600m to the Derby trip of 2,400m, therefore the element of a drama.				 										The fact that Aretino has passed the speed test and has been satisfying his staying prowess in morning trials, jockey C. Alford is expected to guide the four-year-old home.				 										Jackpot: The brought forward amount of about Rs 4.3 lakh is the added attraction in the card. RCTC has also made arrangement for a non-stop musical show between each event. The show may continue even after the conclusion of the days programme, informed a senior RCTC official over the phone.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

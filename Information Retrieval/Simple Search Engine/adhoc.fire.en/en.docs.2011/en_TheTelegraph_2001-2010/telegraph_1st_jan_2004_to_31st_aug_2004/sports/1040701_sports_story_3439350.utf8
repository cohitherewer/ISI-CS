 Scouts line up at Greek camp
 Antonis Nikopolidis says the Greeks have shown the world what they can do Porto: Unheralded a month ago, Greek players are suddenly Europes hottest soccer commodities and many of the national squad at Euro 2004 are eyeing lucrative moves abroad. Scouts from major European clubs rushed to Thursdays semi-final against the Czech Republic after flooding Greek reporters covering the team in Portugal with calls over the past 10 days. Our aim was to show the world what Greek players can do, to make the players and the team known to the world, goalkeeper Antonis Nikopolidis said. We wanted to show them what kind of football we can play. Domestic Greek soccer is in disarray because of huge financial, organisational and crowd problems, and many of the squad are eager to get away. Eight of the 23-man unit, the first to beat both the hosts and the reigning champions at the same Euro tournament, already play for foreign clubs. Yourkas Seitaridis is expected to move to Champions League winners Porto after the tournament. The 23-year-old Panathinaikos defender is reported to have agreed a three-year deal worth an estimated $3.6 million. Another defender, Takis Fyssas, already plays in Portugal having moved from Panathinaikos to Benfica. Traianos Dellas, impressive in the centre of the back-four, was a fringe player at AS Roma last season and should attract transfer interest. Looking at any reasonable offers will be the squads five players from AEK Athens who are trying to avoid financial collapse. Captain Theodoros Zagorakis, Costas Katsouranis, Michalis Kapsis, Vassilis Lakis and Vassilis Tsartas have not been paid in months, and their performances at this tournament will have improved their chances of a move.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Dutch in shock and awe
 - Czechs to rest Nedved in Germany tie Aveiro: Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy said he was sick, broken and miserable after his side threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 2-3 to the Czech Republic at Euro 2004 on Saturday. We were 2-0 up and the Czechs made a change, a midfielder for a defender. After that we were not able to adjust and the match went out of our control, he said. Czech coach Karel Brueckner threw in attacking midfielder Vladimir Smicer, scorer of the 88th-minute winner, for Zdenek Grygera after just 25 minutes of the match, shortly after Van Nistelrooy had fired the Dutch into a 2-0 lead. Van Nistelrooy hailed Pavel Nedveds performance which left the Dutch spellbound. After they pulled a goal back to make it 2-1, Nedved took over and started to control the midfield. His passing was intelligent and there was more urgency about the Czechs. He was prompting all of their counter-attacks and we had trouble dealing with him. At 2-1 up we had some good chances, but when they equalised and we had a man sent off it was always going to be difficult. We played five times better (than in the 1-1 draw with Germany). We should never have let the game slip out of our hands. That was totally unnecessary, Van Nistelrooy said. Speaking a day after his team clinched a quarter-final spot Bruckener said playmaker Nedved definitely will not start. I will rest Nedved, and some other players, Brueckner said. We have plenty of good players in the squad. Germany need to win their final group game on Wednesday to be sure of reaching the last eight. Brueckners decision will not go down well with the Dutch, who need to beat Latvia and hope Germany do not win against the Czechs who have already won the group. Im sure the Czechs will do their duty and play the way they can (against Germany), Dutch coach Dick Advocaat said. While Brueckners positive change inspired his sides comeback, Dutch coach Advocaat was widely criticised for doing the opposite by taking off dangerous winger Arjen Robben for defensive midfielder Paul Bosvelt with half an hour to go. Advocaat defended his decision. I substituted Robben because I wanted more grip on the midfield, Advocaat said. (Tomas) Galasek had too much space. Now everyone is talking about my substitution that didnt work but no one is talking about all the chances that we missed. Even without Robben we created four or five good chances. The substitution is my responsibility and now we have to beat Latvia and hope the Czechs do their duty. After watching the match Dutch great Johan Cruyff said he could not understand the Robben substitution. Its a shame that Robben had to leave the pitch, he said. I didnt know if he had some injury, but when I saw his face I dont think so. He played like a train and the Czechs respected him. The Dutch play Latvia in their final game on Wednesday. Nedved, who won the Man-of-the-Match award, refused to take all the plaudits and saluted his teams never-say-die spirit. It was a fantastic evening and a fantastic match for us. The way we came back after going two goals behind was extraordinary, he said. You could say our coach is like a 12th player, said Nedved. Its quite simple, we just go out there and carry out his (Bruckners) instructions. The playmaker was also full of praise for the fans at the Municipal Stadium in Aveiro. If he is the 12th player then you can also say that the supporters were the 13th. The Czechs comeback win, making them the first side to reach the last eight, puts the team among the favourites to win but the pragmatic Brueckner said the 2-1 victory over Latvia in their opener made him just as happy. It was easier to score against The Netherlands than Latvia, said Brueckner, as he evaluated the performance. It could have been 7-7 against Holland because they play such an open game. The more I think about the Latvia game the more positives I see in it. Jaap Stam was at a loss to explain the setback. Asked how his team squandered such a commanding position having scored twice in the first 19 minutes, Stam replied: I havent got a clue, you saw it, perhaps you can explain it. We were in control and then they pulled it back to 2-1, but even after that we had plenty of chances to increase our lead. The Czechs are a tough team and they never gave up and you have to give them credit for that, but we made too many mistakes and were punished. Stam said he was confident their rivals would not ease off and boost the Dutch hopes of qualification. Im sure they will want to keep the momentum and try to win, said the central defender. But we cannot take Latvia for granted as they held Germany to a 0-0 draw and that shows that they have come a long way. Hopefully, we will get the three points and the Czechs can help us out. Czech striker Milan Baros said with qualification taken care of and no pressure weighing them down, they could go out and enjoy themselves against the Germans, who need a victory to progress. We can approach it in a relaxed manner, but it would be nice to win all our group matches, said the Liverpool forward, who scored the Czech equaliser. Asked if Bruckner might rest some players against Germany, Baros replied: Youll have to ask him. Marc Overmars said the Dutch now had only a 20 per cent chance of reaching the quarter finals. It will be an unbelievable drama if we get knocked out in the first round, he said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB maul Negeri after 2-goal scare
 - Okoro draws first blood -Junior hits a brace -Bhaichung nods in a beauty  BY ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY Calcutta: East Bengal produced two spells of stormy soccer, while Negeri Sembilan of Malaysia called the shots briefly in between. The home team scored two each in the sessions of supremacy and conceded two in the period they were lax. The result was a captivating 4-2 win for East Bengal in Wednesdays AFC Cup group E first leg match at Salt Lake Stadium. It was their second win in as many games, brightening East Bengals chances of making the knockout stage. An irrepressible Mike Okoro opened scoring in the ninth minute to announce East Bengals aggressive intent and the desire to win. The quality of build-up, Bhaichung Bhutias cheeky final pass, and the execution also gave a good indication of what was in store. It came 23 minutes later, after a few more looks at the goal. The Negeri goalkeeper had to resort to means forbidden by law to stop the menacing Bhaichung and Cristiano Junior converted the resultant penalty. East Bengal were on a roll and kept pounding the rival defence with some incisive moves. Okoros acceleration from a withdrawn position behind the strikers, Subhas Chakrabortys enterprise down the right and Bhutias determination to make things happen were too hot for Negeri to handle. Creditably, the visitors didnt crumble under the sustained pressure and snatched a lifeline by reducing the margin in first half added-on time. Rajan Koran took full advantage of a momentary lapse in marking and slipped in a low right-footer after being allowed room inside the box. Negeri took control of proceedings for a short spell in the second half, during which Efendi Malik rifled in the equaliser with a 25-yard right-footed free-kick in the 61st minute. The way the visitors increased men up front and put the defence under pressure suggested that East Bengal might face a tougher test in the away match. But Negeri got carried away at this point as the match turned on its head again. East Bengal needed a psychological boost to reclaim the commanding position they had let slip. Bhutia provided just that, in spectacular fashion, in the 69th minute. A looping cross from Subhas from the right saw the India captain pack surprising power into his diving header, which took shelter in the right corner of the net. Formation, strategy, theory all took a backseat for the rest of the match as East Bengal went all out for more. It was a dazzling display, characterised by the will to succeed. Negeri had no answer to this late avalanche as Junior struck the fourth in the 77th minute. East Bengal made their intentions clear by going on the offensive right after the starting whistle as Alvito DCunha and Junior came close even before the match was five minutes old. Okoro triumphed in almost every one-to-one duel and on most occasions, his passing was precise. Bhutia was desperate to get among the goals and his presence of mind in tight situations, with minimum space, left the 40,000 screaming for more. Not that Negeri didnt rise to the challenge. They were disciplined in defensive organisation and kept the gap between the back-three and the midfielders to the minimum. Though a second division outfit, Negeri looked better than many Indian NFL teams. But they were caught on the wrong foot every time East Bengal drew them into their own half and were clueless in the face of the late charge. Also, they suffered because the presence of their foreign strikers was hardly felt. The speed, accuracy in passing and the element of surprise in most of these East Bengal counters rattled Negeri. Its another story that East Bengal didnt make most of these chances count, with Junior alone muffing up a handful. The Brazilian has now scored 11 goals in ten matches, but should have taken his tally well ahead on Wednesday. East Bengals win was also a statement of sorts. Not many teams show the courage to overpower the opponents after surrendering a two-goal lead. If Bhaichung made sure the morale didnt dip, the manner in which the rest responded confirmed this team is daring to dream. This combination of determination and dream promises more.

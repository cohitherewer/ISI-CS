 Kasimdzhanov takes lead
Tripoli: Grandmaster Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan crashed through the defences of Englishman Michael Adams to win the second game of the world chess championship finals here on Wednesday. Kasimdzhanov now leads the six-game match 1.5-0.5. Unlike the first game that was drawn without a real contest, the second game provided ample fireworks. Kasimdzhanov had his eyes trained for drawing the first blood if the twinkle in his eyes around 35th move gave any indication. Even as Adams made up for some slight lapses on his part and defended precisely for some time, the end came quite abruptly with Kasimdzhanovs rooks doing the damage. It was another excellent result for the Uzbek, after drawing easily with black in the opening game. (PTI)  Copyright

 Advani reaches pre-quarters
New Delhi: World IBSF champion Pankaj Advani never looked his best but still managed to reach the pre-quarter finals of the World under-21 snooker championship without droping a frame against Jessada Posukarn of Thailand in Carlow, Ireland. The Indian never got into a rhythm and concentrated on playing a safety game, which paid off as he registered a 55-54, 59-9, 83-37, 84-13, 57-47 victory to set up a clash with top seed Gary Wilson of England in the round of 16, according to information received here. Advani never looked his confident self on the baize on Tuesday and had troubles in making a big break throughout the match. The only over 50 break by the 19-year-old came in the fourth frame. On the other hand Advanis next round opponent, Wilson was at his domineering best as he blanked Mark Owens of Scotland 5-0. The Englishman registered breaks of 85, 70, 43, 65 and 117 in the five frames, giving a warning signal to the world amateur champion. Another Indian in fray, Aditya Mehta, upset the eighth seeded Mark Allen of North Ireland to win his game 5-4. Mehta took the frame, 63-35, 3-71, 69-48, 74-42, 29-69, 72-24 and 22-110. He will now meet Brenden Byrne of Ireland.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ look to finish it off today
 - FOURTH ONE-DAYER - Seeing off Akhtar, Sami will be the key  Shoaib Akhtar will again pose a big threat Napier: Stephen Fleming sees Pakistan under pressure for the first time in the series as they go into the fourth one-dayer, looking to keep the series alive. The New Zealand captain is intent on following his unbeaten 115 in Christchurch last weekend with another matchwinning knock which will give the Black Caps an unbeatable 3-1 lead. New Zealands best strategy will be to see off the frontline pair of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami before launching into the rest of the attack. Akhtar clocked 159 kmph in Christchurch and will be a big threat again on what should be another hard and fast surface. Fleming said it was up to New Zealand to turn Akhtars extreme pace to their advantage. Theyve got three quality back-up bowlers (Abdul Razzaq, Azhar Mahmood and spinner Shoaib Malik) but once youve faced 150-160 kmph, youve got to be a pretty special bowler to then follow in because our guys, if they get through it, are going to look to pick up the pace, Fleming said. That was the formula New Zealand adopted in Christchurch where they won by seven wickets. They are also buoyed by their sound record at the McLean Park, where they have won 13 and lost six. Fleming too has happy memories of the ground, having scored 90 on debut against India in 1994 and his only other ODI century in New Zealand  111 not out against Australia. Pakistan may opt for the same team that lost in Christchurch, although there is an injury concern with Salim Elahi who has a bruised finger and may make way for Younis Khan. Teams New Zealand (from): Stephen Fleming (captain), Craig Cumming, Hamish Marshall, Scott Styris, Craig McMillan, Chris Cairns, Jacob Oram, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Daniel Vettori, Daryl Tuffey, Andre Adams. Pakistan (from): Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Salim Elahi, Yusuf Youhana, Shoaib Malik, Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Azhar Mahmood, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Younis Khan, Danish Kaneria, Umer Gul.

 - FINAL TEST

(AP) London: A defiant century from Graham Thorpe led England to a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the third Test at Trent Bridge and clinch a 3-0 series whitewash on a fluctuating fourth day on Sunday. Thorpe notched a cool-headed 104 not out and Ashley Giles was unbeaten with 36 as England reached their victory target of 284 to take their first series whitewash over the Black Caps in 26 years. I was proud to be there at the end. It was key to get a few partnerships and put New Zealand under pressure, Thorpe said. New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns, celebrating his 34th birthday and playing in his 62nd and final Test, had earlier threatened to turn the game New Zealands way with four wickets to go with his five for 79 in the first innings. But Man-of-the-Match Thorpe and Giles, who earlier impressed with the ball taking four for 46, steered the home side to victory as a depleted New Zealand attack tired in the evening sun. Mark Butcher scored a resolute 59 before Cairns trapped him leg before with the last ball before tea that nipped back. Cairns induced Andrew Flintoff (5) to mishit a drive to substitute fielder Hamish Marshall. The former Nottinghamshire player earlier dispatched England captain Michael Vaughan leg before for 10 but was fortunate with the dismissal of Andrew Strauss. The England opener was adjudged lbw for six in another controversial decision by Australian umpire Simon Taufel after several dubious calls in Saturdays play. Marcus Trescothick soon followed, lobbing a simple catch back to bowler James Franklin for nine. Franklin showed some of the verve the New Zealand pace attack has missed on tour without the injured Shane Bond. Geraint Jones fell for 27, playing a wayward shot to Jacob Oram at gully off Franklin. Cairns exploits and the closeness of the match were all the more impressive given Chris Martin and debutant Kyle Mills were both unable to bowl, nursing injuries picked up in Englands first innings. New Zealand were dismissed for 218 in the morning session after resuming their second innings 190 for five. England Man of the Series Steve Harmison became 2004s leading Test wicket-taker with 44 dismissals when he struck Craig McMillan (30) on the pads and Andrew Flintoff took a sharp catch at slip to dispatch Oram for nought. Englands victory represented the fourth highest total obtained by a team batting fourth in Tests in England. The last time they completed a whitewash over New Zealand was in 1978 in another 3-0 home series win under Mike Brearley.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

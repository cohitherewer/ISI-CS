		 Saturday, August 14, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
 Thai athletes competing in Athens have complained  that oily, unspiced food and the chilly weather are the  biggest hurdles in their quest for Olympic gold, a team  official said on Friday.				 																																	Many of the Asian kingdoms athletes have begun relying on Thai take-away restaurants in the Greek capital and have succumbed to the flu brought on by the unfamiliar evening chill, The Nation newspaper reported.				 																																	A team official told the daily that the athletes, who are used to training and competing in sweltering heat at home, were finding it difficult to acclimatise to the cold nights and the oily Greek cuisine served at the village. 				 																																	The official said many Thai athletes were living on a take-away diet of Thai fried chili chicken, eggs and spicy soup, as well as paracetamol. Polish gymnast Joanna Skowronska was recovering  in hospital on Friday after she injured her spine in a fall  from the asymmetric bars. 				 																																	She has an injury of the cervical spine without any neurological complications, Olympic Indoor Hall official Panagiotis Soukakos said. I think shell be okay. 				 																																	The 22-year-old lost her grip from the bars and landed awkwardly on her forehead during podium training on Thursday. On-site medics strapped on a neck brace before carrying Skowronska out of the arena on a stretcher just two days before the start of the gymnastics event.  A dejected Jeannie Longo dismissed her chances  of adding a fifth medal to her Olympic tally in Sundays  cycling road race, saying the course was not to her taste.				 																																	Its a course I really dont like at all. I was expecting something bad. But its worse. 				 																																	Everybody is going to want to ride to the front. Itll be warfare, a three-hour battle. Im really disappointed, the Frenchwoman added.				 																																	At 45, the greatest female cyclist in history again came out of semi-retirement to win her 48th French title  both on road and various track events  and qualify for the Games. 				 																																	I really wanted to be here because I have been part of all the Olympics since the womens road race was introduced in the Olympic programme, she said. A Chinese television cameraman collapsed and  died on Friday while filming the Olympic Torch relay in  central Athens, police said. The cameraman was named by  Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos as 47-year-old  Chang Lee. It is not officially known for which station  the man worked for or what the causes of his death were. 				 																																	According to the semi-official Athens News Agency, doctors said the cause of death was heart failure.

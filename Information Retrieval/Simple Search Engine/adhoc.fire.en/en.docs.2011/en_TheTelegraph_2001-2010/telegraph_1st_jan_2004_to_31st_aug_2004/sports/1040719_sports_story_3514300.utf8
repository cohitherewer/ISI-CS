				 																																	London: Craig Spearmans masterful unbeaten 143 took C and G Trophy holders Gloucestershire to a five-wicket semi-final win against Yorkshire in Bristol.				 																																	The former New Zealand opener, who quit international cricket three years ago after only modest success, was in commanding form with his hundred coming in just 84 balls as Gloucestershire booked their seventh Lords final appearance in six years on Saturday.				 																																	Gloucestershire will now face Worcestershire in the showpiece match on August 28 in a repeat of last years final.				 																																	Yorkshire, after winning the toss, made a by no means indefensible 243 for six from their full 50 overs.				 																																	But 32-year-old right-hander Spearman made nonsense of that target in a 122-ball innings featuring four sixes and 14 fours. 				 																																	Earlier, an unbeaten 80 from Darren Lehmann took Yorkshire to a decent total after three batsmen, including Michael Vaughan, gave their wickets away in the 30s. 				 																																	Yorkshires innings had been hampered by a 45-minute rain-break and overcast conditions while Gloucestershires reply took place in bright sunshine.				 																																	In the other semi-final, England one-day outcast Vikram Solankis 127 steered Worcestershire to a 41-run win against local rivals Warwickshire at Edgbaston.				 																																	London: English County Essex has announced that they have signed New Zealand allrounder Andre Adams as a replacement overseas player for Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria.				 																																	Adams, 29, a lively pace bowler and aggressive batsman, has been playing club cricket in England for Lancashire league side Colne.				 																																	Adams has played 31 one-day Internationals and one Test for New Zealand. In ODIs, he has taken 44 wickets at 28.11 and scored 338 runs at 19.88.				 																																	Hohenstein-Ernstthal (Germany): Italys Max Biaggi held off a strong challenge from MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi to win the German MotoGP on Sunday and advance to second in the championship standings.				 																																	Biaggi, starting on pole on his Honda, lost his lead to Rossi at the halfway point before fighting back to reclaim the lead and his first win of the season, leaving Rossis Yamaha in fourth behind Brazilian Alex Barros and American Nicky Hayden.				 																																	Spains Sete Gibernau on a Honda crashed out early for the second race in a row to open up one of the most closely fought world championships in years.				 																																	Rossi still heads the championship on 139 points, a point ahead of Biaggi on 138, with Gibernau in third on 126.				 																																	Indianapolis: Andre Agassi withdrew from the RCA Championships, saying his 34-year-old body needs some rest as he prepares for the US Open. He said his oft-injured hip felt great coming off three matches this week in the Mercedez-Benz Cup in Los Angeles, but he did not want to risk overexerting himself.				 																																	It was a concern of overload and playing too many weeks in a row through an important and big summer, Agassi said from California. Its a scheduling issue.				 																																	He also declined to play for the US at the Athens Olympics to avoid the wear and tear on his body.				 																																	Chennai: India thrashed Uzbekistan in straight sets in the fifth and final volleyball Test to complete a whitewash here on Sunday. 				 																																	The Indians proved far superior to the Uzbeks in all departments, carving out a 25-14, 25-20, 25-20 win in just under an hour before a packed crowd at the Santhom High School Indoor Stadium. 				 																																	The hosts had already won the series, clinching four matches in a row  one each by the senior and juniors and two by youth teams  in Bangalore last week.Sport on ScreenSoccer, Copa America: Highlights from 9 pm on TEN Sports

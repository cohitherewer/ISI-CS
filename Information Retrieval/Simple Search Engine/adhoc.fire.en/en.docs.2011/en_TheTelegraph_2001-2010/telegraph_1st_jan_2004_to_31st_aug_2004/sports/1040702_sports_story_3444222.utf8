The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EBs physio on 6-week mission
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: English physio Pete McKnight joined the East Bengal ranks on Thursday. The 26-year-old strength and conditioning specialist and UK level I athletics coach has worked at Loughborough University and the FA England Womens Academy. McKnight, here on a six-week assignment, will formally get down to business on Friday. He has already expressed satisfaction over the infrastructure and training facilities at the club. South Africa-born Kevin Jackson had worked with the club last season. Coach Subhas Bhowmick has reserved comment on the new recruit, saying he will voice his opinion only after observing a few sessions. I am here for a short term and would like to make the best of it. I hope to keep the players fit enough to help them get many trophies this season too, said McKnight. The physio informed he would stress on aerobic fitness, then move on to climatic training and finally work on strength-building and gym sessions. A footballer may not be hugely built, but he has to be fit and strong to last the entire season, McKnight explained. He needs to accelerate, decelerate and change direction with the ball. In the final lap of my assignment I will deal with intensive skill work.  Copyright

 Board yet to hear from players
Mumbai: The BCCI is waiting to hear from the players who want some changes in the graded payment system. We are still to hear from the players who wanted some changes. It is between the board and the players, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Monday. He was non-committal on the timeframe fixed for the implementation of the much delayed and discussed formula. Dalmiya is here to attend the two-day finance committee meeting of the board, the main agenda of which is to finalise the annual report. Sources said the players have already sent their recommendations, suggesting changes, besides asking for a hike in match fees for the reserves. (PTI)  Copyright

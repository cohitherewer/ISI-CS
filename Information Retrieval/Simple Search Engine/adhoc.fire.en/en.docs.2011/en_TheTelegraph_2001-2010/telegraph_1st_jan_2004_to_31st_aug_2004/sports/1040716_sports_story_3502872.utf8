The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, July 16, 2004  Smile A Mile for main event 
 BY HONKY DORY				 										Outsiders ruled the opening day of the Pune races. The story may, however, be different in Fridays seven events. 				 										The best bet in the card appears to be Altaf Hussains Smile A Mile, who will be ridden by P. Kamlesh, in the Majestic Eagle Trophy. The filly had placed a decent fourth behind some good horses in her only outing last winter. 				 										SELECTIONS				 										2 pm: Star Holme 1. Sugar Babe 2.

 Mickelson holds nerve to win

(Reuters) Augusta: American Phil Mickelson held his nerve to clinch a one-shot victory at the US Masters on Sunday, holing an 18-foot birdie putt at the last to end his long wait for a first major victory. The 33-year-old left-hander, who had previously produced 17 top ten finishes in 46 majors, fired a closing three-under-par 69 to overhaul a last-day charge by Ernie Els. Mickelson, long regarded as the best modern-day player not to win a major, completed the back nine in five-under 31, the lowest by a winner at Augusta National since Jack Nicklaus scorched round in 30 in 1986. He birdied two of the last three holes to finish at nine-under 279, becoming the second successive southpaw to wear the cherished green jacket at Augusta, after last years winner Mike Weir of Canada. I just kept believing something would happen... and it did, an emotionally-drained Mickelson said. Having come close so many times, to have had putts made on me in the last holes to lose by a shot... to have it be such a difficult journey to win my first major, makes it that much more special, sweeter. It just feels awesome. Mickelson, who had finished third in his previous three Masters starts, clinched his 23rd PGA Tour victory after an epic battle of shot-making with Els. South African Els, who led by two strokes with five holes to play, fired a five-under 67 to finish second at eight-under 280. South Koreas KJ Choi was a further two shots back in third after a 69.  World number one Tiger Woods, who tumbled out of contention for a fourth green jacket with a third-round 75, battled to a closing one-under 71. The eight-times major winner, who started out nine off the lead, vomited several times on the front nine before rallying to finish at two-over 290.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

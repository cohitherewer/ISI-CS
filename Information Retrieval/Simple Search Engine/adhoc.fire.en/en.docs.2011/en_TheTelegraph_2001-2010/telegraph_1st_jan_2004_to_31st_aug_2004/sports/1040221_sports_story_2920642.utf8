 Sania-Huber move into final
Hyderabad: Sania Mirza and Lieszel Huber defeated Chinas Zi Yan and Jie Zheng 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 to enter the doubles final of the WTA Indian Open on Friday. The duo will face Ting Li and Tian Sun, who defeated Yulia Beygelzimer and Tatiana Poutcheck 6-3 6-2 in the other semi. Meanwhile, unseeded Russian Maria Kirilenko upset defending champion Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand 6-3, 6-2 to set up a title clash with Nicole Pratt of Australia in the WTA Indian Open on Friday. Kirilenko took full advantage of the knee-injury to the defending champion taking the tie in less than an hour, while Pratt had to slug it out for over two-and-a-half hours to down second seed Marion Bartoli of France 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. Both Pratt and Bartoli matched each other shot for shot. Pratt was a bit tentative at the start and committed a couple of double faults to allow her opponent race to a 3-0 lead. Though she came back strongly to level the score 4-4, Bartoli kept her cool to take the set 6-4. Pratt then got into the act as both held their serve in the second set before the Australian went on to win it. (PTI)  Copyright

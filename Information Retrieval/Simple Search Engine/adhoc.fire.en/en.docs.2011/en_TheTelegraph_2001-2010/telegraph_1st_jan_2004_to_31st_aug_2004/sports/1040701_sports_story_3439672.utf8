The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Poulami aiming higher
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Poulami eyes improving international ranking Calcutta: After tasting the success at the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games, improving her world ranking tops paddler Poulami Ghataks agenda. To achieve that she plans to participate in the upcoming European circuit meets starting early next month. Both Mouma and myself, we are aiming those meets to improve our international ranking after playing so well in the Commonwealth Games, Poulami told The Telegraph on Wednesday. According to Poulami, planned preparation and guidance from the French coach Huftache culminated in the success story. Our performance has been very good. Im satisfied, Poulami, who led the five-member womens contingent to a third place finish in the Kuala Lumpur meet before pairing with Mouma Das for another bronze in the doubles, said. Australia, Singapore, Austria  all were very good sides but England were the best of the lot and we are all happy to overcome that challenge, Poulami said. But the top Indian paddler didnt forget to give the French coach his due for the success they achieved. He is like a father figure to us. He is impartial and pays personal attention to our needs and discomforts, Poulami revealed. In all, our preparation was well thought out and carefully planned, she said. Reverting back to the topic, Poulami informed that after the world championship, her ranking was 175, but now it has come down to 205 as she could not take part in international competitions to attend the camp ahead of the Commonwealth meet, she said. So, the European tour will be of immense advantage to us in this regard, she said. She also reminded that the Indian paddlers couldnt perform well in the Commonwealth Games held in Manchester and Glasgow and so it was a sort of challenge to all of them before leaving for the championship. As we did well in the 2000 Games in Delhi, I was always confident of a good show this time, she said.  Copyright

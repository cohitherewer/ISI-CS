The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PSB pip armymen in shootout
 - BEIGHTON CUP FINAL - Saini hopes to recover within 15 days  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Punjab and Sind Bank players with the Beighton Cup after beating Army XI 4-2 via tie-breaker in the final at CC amp;FC on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Punjab and Sind Bank (PSB) won the 109th Indian Oil-Servo Beighton Cup hockey tournament edging Army XI 4-2 via tie-breaker in the final at CC amp;FC on Sunday. The winners were a bit patchy to begin with but got hold of proceedings gradually. Under the scorching sun, the armymen kept the PSB defence busy during the initial part of the match but could not score. In fact, no goals were scored in regulation time and in 15 minutes of extra time. As the match progressed, the bankmen emerged the better side. In the tie-breaker also, they held their nerves and got through even after missing the first hit taken by skipper Baljit Singh Chandi, who was chosen the player of the tournament. It was in the 17th minute, when the bankmen could have drawn first blood but Rajwinder Singhs reverse hit missed the framework by a whisker. The match didnt rise to any great height, as players of both the teams found it hard to tackle the afternoon heat. PSB managed a couple of penalty corners on either side of the breather, but failed to capitalise any of them. The PSB forward line, led by Chandi, created plenty of chances. The absence of international Baljit Singh Saini was felt as his teammates Parminder Singh, Kulwinder Singh and others were not on target. Naginderjit Singh and Davinder Singh did well but could not get the precious goal. It is disappointing to miss the final, but I will be fit in 15 days, Saini said later. This accident will not hamper my preparation for the Olympics, he said about the injury suffered during Saturdays semi-final clash. Army XI managed five penalty corners. On most occasions, their players couldnt stop the ball properly. In defence, they were well served by C.S. Xalxo and K.S. Ganapathy. Among the forwards, Cyprian Aindh worked hard but failed to do the needful because of lack of support from teammates. After the barren 85 minutes, the bankmen didnt start well in the tie-breaker, as Chandis firm hit was saved by custodian P.T. Rao, who was brought in just before the shootout. But like true professionals, Mandeep Singh, Davinder, Harpreet Singh and Rajwinder scored one after the other for PSB. For Army XI, Suresh Kumar and Jagjit Singh found the net while Harpreet Singhs hit went wide of the post and Aindhs hit was saved by Maninder Singh. The champions were richer by Rs 1,25,000 while the runners-up received Rs 75,000. Losing semi-finalists BSF Jalandhar and Corps of Signals took home Rs 25,000 each.  Copyright

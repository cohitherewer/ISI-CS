The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gibbs, Boje may not visit India
 - MATCH-FIXING CASE - UCBSA against Delhi police interrogating players while on tour  Nicky Boje Durban: The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) has said it would not allow Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje to travel to India for a tour later this year if they are to be interrogated by New Delhi police in the match-fixing case. We cannot have our players being traumatised by police investigations while they are on a cricket tour, UCBSA president Ray Mali said. Gerald Majola, the UCBSA chief executive, is currently in the process of discussion with the Indian board on the Gibbs-Boje issue. South Africa are scheduled to tour India in October- November to play seven one-dayers, their first tour to the country after the infamous 2000 series when the match-fixing scandal broke out. Malis comments come in the wake of recent statements by Indian board president Jagmohan Dalmiya and New Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul. Dalmiya had said on Tuesday the BCCI could not interfere with police investigations and give an assurance to UCBSA that the South African players would not be interrogated. Paul had said match-fixing investigations involving Hansie Cronje, Gibbs and Boje had not yet been closed. Cronje, the former captain who was accused of match-fixing during the 2000 tour, died in a plane crash two years ago. The UCBSA also expressed dissatisfaction over Indias decision to play only one-dayers and not any Tests during the tour.  Herschelle GibbsA Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Dalmiya reiterated it is not possible for the BCCI to assure the South African board that Gibbs and Boje will not face any problem. I did get a call from Majola yesterday and he said that they have sent a letter to us. Neither me, nor (BCCI secretary) S.K. Nair have received it. I have told him to send it afresh and state clearly what they want. After receiving the letter, if needed, we may forward it to the police authorities since they will decide on what to do on this front, Dalmiya said. He made it clear that at no stage did the Indian board assure the UCBSA that the duo in question will not be interrogated. How can that be done, considering the fact that the issue is way beyond our jurisdiction.  (PTI)  Copyright

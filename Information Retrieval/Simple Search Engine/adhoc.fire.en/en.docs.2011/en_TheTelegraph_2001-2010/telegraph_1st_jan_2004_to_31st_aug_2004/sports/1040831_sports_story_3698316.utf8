 Suspended sentence for Irish priest
Athens: A Greek court on Monday gave a former Irish priest a suspended 12-month jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for pushing a leading Olympic marathon runner off the road, a court source said. Dressed in a kilt and beret, Cornelious Horan grabbed Brazils Vanderlei de Lima during Sundays marathon race and pushed him into the crowd, possibly costing him victory in the most serious security breach during the August 13-29 Games. He received a suspended sentence due to no prior criminal record and he was released, the source said. He said the court banned Horan, who also interrupted the British Formula One Grand Prix last year by running onto the track, from entering any sports facility for three months. Police had said the Irishman, who had the words The Grand Prix Priest. Israel Fulfilment of Prophecy Says The Bible. The Second Coming is Near pinned to his shirt, appeared drunk. After being pushed into the crowd, a grimacing De Lima got away and rejoined the race, holding his leg, with around 15 minutes to run. He soon lost the lead to Italian Stefano Baldini, who won the race and De Lima took bronze. The IOC awarded De Lima a special medal named after the founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre De Coubertin, in recognition of his exceptional demonstration of fair play and Olympic values. Despite this, the Brazilian Olympic Committee said it will take the case to the sports highest legal body, demanding a review of the result.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

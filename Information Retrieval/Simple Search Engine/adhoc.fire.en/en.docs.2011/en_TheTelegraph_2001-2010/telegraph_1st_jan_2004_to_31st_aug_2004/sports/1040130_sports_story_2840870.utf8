 Surya, Sandipan share lead
Gibraltar: Indian Grandmasters Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda emerged joint leaders with clinical victories in the second round of the Gibraltar chess congress here. Both Surya and Sandipan have two points each and are followed by a pack of 24 players including top seed Nigel Short of England, Abhijit Kunte and Dibyendu Barua on 1.5. The Indians had a good day with Barua, Kunte and Harikrishna scoring victories after a rather sedate first round. Getting another draw against a Grandmaster was Tejas Bakre who is gunning for his third and final GM norm here. Bakre drew with Colin McNab of Scotland. The Subbaraman sisters, Vijayalakshmi and Meenakshi went down fighting to Sandipan and GM Mark Hebden of England. The lone Indian girl to register a victory was Nisha Mohota who put it across Jesus Andrades of Spain while Krutikka Nadig lost her second straight game, going down to Iganacios Diaz, also of Spain. Surya accounted for English GM Peter Wells who just failed to deliver the goods with his white pieces. After beating GM Rowson in the first round, Vijayalakshmi could not keep the momentum going and lost to Sandipan. Harikrishna, who outplayed Helen Miligan of Scotland in all departments of the game with his white pieces. After Short was held to a draw by compatriot John Emms in the first round, it was the turn of second seed Russian Alexey Dreev to share honours with Bojan Vuckovic on the top board. It was a classical Sicilian where Vuckovic played very solidly to get an easy draw after 65 moves. Kunte defeated Aithmidou Mehdi of Morocco while Barua put it across Erik Eliassen of Norway.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Womens tennis takes a seat in the theatre of discomfort
- These days, touching human-interest stories often make for fallible major finals FROM SELENA ROBERTS IN PARIS Anastasia Myskina with the French Open trophy near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Sunday. (Reuters) The uneasy opponents materialised on Centre Court as childhood friends from Moscow who had emptied their families cookie jars of rubles to play tennis, who had competed for junk-food treats in practice, who were the earthy un-Kournikovas of their country.With wispy black bangs pushed from her forehead, Anastasia Myskina was the one in braces who cried to release pressure before the French Open final. With a ponytail as long as a Russian novel, Elena Dementieva was the player in a panic who couldnt breathe as she alighted on the red clay.But in an unsettling pattern for womens tennis, heart-warming tales and human-interest dramas produce agonising major finals. It happened again on Saturday.Is this a chick thing? Certainly, the men have had difficulty scribbling exclamation points at the end of majors, but their letdowns have been compartmentalised, with play usually related to the confines of the court, not the complexities of a relationship. Too often for the women, intrigue does not overwhelm awkwardness; awkwardness overwhelms the intrigue.After a 6-1, 6-2 victory in 58 minutes by Myskina, with 10 double faults and 33 unforced errors by Dementieva, the ungainly match became hauntingly similar to the stray quality found in major finals between the Williams sisters, or the Belgian twosome of Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin-Hardenne.Genetic links, friendship bonds and compatriot ties have made for disappointing rivalries in womens tennis. Remember the combined 101 unforced errors between Serena and Venus Williams in the 2002 French Open final, or the unravelling confidence of Clijsters in front of Henin-Hardenne at the 2003 French Open or last years US Open?On Saturday, in front of an uncomfortable crowd cringing with every nervous mistake, Myskina and Dementieva only submitted more evidence to support how the theatre of discomfort can intrude on match closure.How can Russia celebrate Myskina without feeling sorrow for Dementieva? Not even Myskina was capable of indulging in her glorious moment. On a subdued match point, and during a solemn trophy presentation, Myskina cloaked her excitement out of respect for her dispirited friend.Its hard to see your friend crying or how your friend is upset, Myskina said, later adding, For sure, it would be a different reaction if somebody else would be on that side of the court.For sure, it would have been easier for Dementieva if Myskina hadnt been her opposition. If there should be a next major final for Dementieva, she said she would prefer to play someone else in the final. Maybe it was better for me to play against Jennifer Capriati today.At least right now on the tour, there is something more natural about a rivalry that doesnt include the complications of a cozy relationship. Truly, Henin-Hardenne and Clijsters are more competitive since their warm relationship as the rising stars of Belgium has deteriorated beneath their intense bickering over the past year. Is bad blood competitive fuel? Its no secret that Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati dont share popcorn, a fact that adds an edge and, as a result, improved quality and drama to their matches. The men play this theory out . Although Gaston Gaudio and Guillermo Coria are from Argentina, there is tension between them related to the evils of jealousy and differences of privilege. Gaudio is the self-made miracle, while Coria is his countrys chosen pet project.For the women, the value of kindness has undercut quality. With a feel-good tale on the court on Saturday, with opponents making nice in a major final, the tour suffered another shortfall of competition. Myskina needed only one strategy: Keep the ball in play and allow her friend to self-destruct, one double fault at a time. I dont think it was only her serve today, Dementievas coach, the Russian tennis legend, Olga Morozova, said as she pointed to her head. But still, she will get through this. This was very difficult for her.It was complicated. Her opponent wasnt a target, but a childhood friend since the age of six. These days, touching human-interest stories often make for fallible major finals. Copyright

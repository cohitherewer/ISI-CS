The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leipus talks of larger interest
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Speedster Zaheer Khan has specifically been rested on the advice of Team India physio Andrew Leipus. According to The Telegraphs sources, his report to Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya reads as follows: Zaheer Khan does require specific ongoing exercises to help maintain the correct muscle balance around his trunk and pelvis. His participation in appropriate strength-training sessions has not been adequate till date. He is injury-fit at present and could manage to continue playing, but it is better in the larger interest for Zaheer to miss the next tour and concentrate on an intensive training/practice regimen. Obviously, Leipus wants Zaheer one hundred per cent fit for the home (Test) series against Australia.  Copyright

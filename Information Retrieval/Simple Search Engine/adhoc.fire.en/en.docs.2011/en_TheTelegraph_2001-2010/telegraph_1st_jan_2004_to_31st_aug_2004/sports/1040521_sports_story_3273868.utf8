The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dilip Tirkey is the fittest
 - Trainer Sampath Kumar judges players at the Barog camp  Indian hockey team members at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday after their arrival from Japan. (PTI) Barog: Deepak Thakur is fast, Gagan Ajit Singh agile and Prabhjot Singh has good stamina. But overall, the fittest player in the Indian hockey team is cool-headed defender Dilip Tirkey. This is the observation of team trainer Sampath Kumar, who is in charge of 13 players who are attending a fitness camp at this picturesque hill resort. These players, including struggling-to-be-fit Jugraj Singh, are going through the paces under the watchful eyes of the trainer, who would submit his report to the Indian Hockey Federation a couple of days after the start of second-round camp in Chandigarh on May 27. Besides working on their strengths, Sampath is also helping the players get rid of some of their minor weaknesses so that a fully-fit winning combination is put in place for Athens Olympics. Sampath observations were restricted to the top seven players, who would be key to Indias chances at the Olympics. Devesh is one of the best goalkeepers in the world as he possesses good stamina. He has got good speed and power. He is quite agile and has superb reflexes. He is nicely equipped to meet the international goalkeeping standards. Tirkey is a fitness freak and has got very good qualities. He likes to set standards by following the fitness regime sincerely. He has all the qualities needed to be a good full-back, Sampath said. He is cool-headed and his flexibility is outstanding. He can last the entire duration of the match without taking a break. He believes in extra stretching and sometimes has to be pulled out from training. The trainer felt Viren Rasquinha was also agile and had a good ball sense. The midfielder is gutsy and always ready to thwart any kind of attack that threatens the Indian goal. Vikram Pillay, another midfielder, is a powerful guy who has got good speed. Gagan Ajit is a fantastic forward, one of the best in business. Quite nippy and dangerous once he gets inside the circle. He has a fabulous sense of timing and got good reflexes. On Thakur, he felt, he is one of the fittest members in the side. Runs fast and for long when with the ball. Capable of making inroads into the circle whenever he gets a chance. Prabhjot Singh, the trainer said, has got amazing stamina. He can run a lot around the field, is quite an avid follower of the game, has got good speed and stretches a lot. The players, already established names in world hockey, could emerge even stronger if they work on certain minor aspects, said Sampath. Sampath feels Devesh needs to improve his concentration level which in a way was responsible for the dip in his performance in recent matches. Meditation is the best way to overcome this patchy performance. Viren needs to develop stamina which can make him one of the best midfielders in the world. Similarly Vikram needs to be more flexible. As far as Gagan Ajit is concerned, the trainer said, he needs to work on enhancing his stamina as the team wants him to play more up and down hockey. Long distance and uphill running has been prescribed for the forward to build on his endurance. Thakur needs to work on his reaction when inside the circle. He must not miss the chance to score the goals when he gets the ball from a sudden move. These weaknesses are not difficult to overcome and we are working on these. Hopefully, we would be sending a fully-fit team to Athens where it can win a medal for the country, Sampath said. (PTI)  Copyright

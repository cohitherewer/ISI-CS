The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004  Tasmac caught all napping 
 BY STAR RACER				 										The Navy authorities, patronising last Wednesdays card, could not have asked for a better competition, particularly in the chief event  the INS Netaji Subhas Cup which had ten horses lined up for the race.				 										With there being no clear favourite, the honour of balancing of books for the layers of odds fell squarely on the ring and tote backers. This was because there were six horses in contention but going by the odds, of 5-1 and over, none of them commanded respect.				 										The bookies were delighted with the kind of money coming in and their community started screaming at the first sign of Tasmacs triumph. Trained by Bharath Singh (who incidentally had six runners in the field) Tasmac, a 10-1 shot, built up a winning lead of five lengths in the straight after showing gentle paces up front to catch the opposition napping.				 										The race also witnessed a mad scramble for the minor slots. But Bharaths Gypsy King put in a good spurt in the final stages to put the issue beyond the reach of Daniel Davids duo of Indian Gold and Dashing Chief.				 										However, early in the afternoon, Daniel had ruled without much trouble winning three races, including two trophy events. His Blushing Queen, in the Eastern Naval Command Cup, picked up from where she had left on the first day of the season to post back-to-back wins with Robert Gowli.				 										Royal Command could have run the Queen close. But jockey Yacoob lost his whip in the final stretch and thereafter the rider was helpless to stop his ride from shifting out badly when the heat was on. It was only a length that separated him from the winner while Azinger, who was seen putting in some good work in the last 200m, came third a shade under two lengths behind.				 										Sit and suffer were the riding instructions for Gowli on his next ride Royal Bounty in the Nausena Cup. The crafty jockey followed his connections riding briefs in toto, though the backers of the 5-4 favourite may have given up in the final 200m when the Bounty was trailing in the fourth berth and by nearly six lengths.				 										The Bountys acceleration was amazing when the Bees Prospector-Auspicious Girl accounted for a strongly fancied Eglevsky with commendable ease. In fact, Eglevsky was hard pressed to retain his slot as the rest in the field piled on to him.				 										Daniels Measure Up was the other one who settled the debate over whether the steward had done justice and not a favour while upholding her protest against Flinders on the opening day. In the Defenders Of Sea Handicap, on this day, the 7-2 fancy galloped close to the leader, Advancer, till 300m from home before kicking clear. Actualite, the 6-4 favourite, raced in close proximity too but found herself second best in the field of six.				 										Bharaths Deeqa did a Royal Bounty, in the 1,200m Admirals Plate, when the Flitch-Kabuki daughter got comfortable measure of One for Me. However, Lucifer was a trifle lucky in the NWWA Handicap as Bharaths Shining Jewel failed to get proper assistance from Islam and thus settled for a neck defeat.

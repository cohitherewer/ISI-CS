				 																																	Rome: Brazils World Cup-winning captain Cafu and AS Roma president Franco Sensi were ordered to stand trial on Monday on charges of falsely obtaining an Italian passport for the former Roma defender, judicial sources said.				 																																	Former Roma player Gustavo Bartelt and seven other people, including Cafus wife, were also sent to trial as part of the investigation into alleged passport scams at the Serie A club. Eleven players in Italy were handed bans of up to a year, imposed in 2001, after they were found to have obtained Italian passports with false documentation.				 																																	Doha: Frenchman Bruno Metsu, who steered Senegal to the quarter finals of the 2002 World Cup, is to join Qatars Al Ithihad Club, Qatar FA technical director Manfred Hoener said on Monday. Metsu is set to sign a two-year contract with Al Ithihad Sports Club for a salary of $1.7 million per season, Hoener said. Metsu, now at Al Ain club in the United Arab Emirates, had a low-key career as a player with Nice, Andserlecht, Lille and Valenciennes before his first coaching job with the Guinea national team. In 2000, he took over Senegal and shocked France in the first round of the World Cup before a quarter final exit against Turkey.				 																																	London: In a case of better late than never, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has fined and banned for five years retired Test player Ed Giddins for cricket betting two years ago.				 																																	The 32-year old Giddins, who scalped five wickets at Lords against Zimbabwe in 2000, was handed the punishment for placing bets worth 70,000 on Surrey to lose to Northamptonshire in a National League one-day match in 2002, a website reported on Monday.				 																																	The ECB slapped a five-year ban from all forms of cricket besides a fine of 5,000 plus another thousand covering the costs on Giddins, who was playing for surrey at that time.				 																																	The ban would mean nothing for Giddins, who reportedly pleaded not guilty but did not contest the facts placed before him by an inquiry panel, since he had announced his retirement from all levels of the game at the end of last season.				 																																	Tehran: Iranian wrestling and fencing teams will boycott pre-Olympic competitions in the United States because of US actions in Iraq, notably in the two Shiite holy cities of Karbala and Najaf, Iranian media reported Monday. 				 																																	 The Iranian Wrestling Federation website said its technical committee had agreed with the objections of its board of directors not to send freestyle and Greco-Roman teams to the Titan Games in Atlanta, Georgia, next month.				 																																	Moscow: Alexander Popov suffered a rare home defeat when he was beaten into second place in the 100m freestyle at the Russian championships on Sunday. The 32-year-old, who has collected a stack of world, European and Olympic titles, had not lost in domestic competition for more than a decade.				 																																	But on the last day of the national championships, which served as Olympic qualifiers, Popov clocked 49.25 seconds to finish second behind Andrei Kapralovs 49.10. Both had already qualified for Athens.				 																																	San Vendemiano (Italy): Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi won his eighth stage of the Tour of Italy as he took the 15th stage a 243km ride from the Croatian town of Pula. 				 																																	The 30-year-olds victory saw him break the record for most stage wins in one edition of the race as he also racked up his 14th triumph. 				 																																	The Fassa Bortolo rider has now broken the records of Belgian riders Roger de Vlaemenick and Freddy Maertens in 1975 and 1977 respectively, and Italian Giuseppe Saronni in 1980.Ukraines Yaroslav Popovych retained the overall leaders pink jersey.Sport on ScreenTennis, French Open: Live from 2.30pm on TEN Sports

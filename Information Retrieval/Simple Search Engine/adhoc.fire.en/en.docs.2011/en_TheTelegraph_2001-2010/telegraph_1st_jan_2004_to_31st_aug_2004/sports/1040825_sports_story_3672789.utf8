The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its an honour being picked by Benaud
	 - Its unlikely that anybody of his generation has seen so much cricket: Sachin  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: If being laid low with a tennis elbow isnt bad enough, Sachin Tendulkar is battling a viral attack too. Ive been on medication for five days, but am yet to recover, he told The Telegraph, when contacted at the team hotel in Amsterdam on Tuesday afternoon. Having been reduced to a bystander in the ongoing tri-series, Sachin sounded despondent, but became somewhat enthusiastic when informed of his selection in Richie Benauds World XI of the 20th century. When did Benaud make the announcement? he asked, following that up with another question: Well, who are the others in his XI? Sachin probably jotted down his teammates and, after a pause, remarked: Dont know how much better Ill feel, but its an honour Benaud, after all, is the sports elder statesman and its unlikely that anybody of his generation has seen so much cricket [Benauds XI, by the way, is: Jack Hobbs, Sunil Gavaskar, Don Bradman, Sachin, Viv Richards, Imran Khan, Garfield Sobers, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Sydney Barnes and Dennis Lillee.] According to the master bat, this selection means more than some of the others largely because of the former Australian captains stature. Its not insignificant, of course, that Benaud has picked him ahead of the Brian Laras. Expectedly, Sachin didnt wish to comment on those who didnt make it. He did, however, speak about being rendered hors de combat: The (left) elbow pain isnt going to disappear overnight It will take time No matter how frustrating, Ive got to be patient The viral, though, should be a thing of the past in a day or two. Incidentally, its because of his illness that Sachin opted out of the evenings proposed canal-cruise, usually the high point of any visit to Amsterdam. Like the little champion, Team India look set to be reduced to bystander-status unless Pakistan hammer world champions Australia in Wednesdays last league match. Now, whether we remain in the tournament or not isnt in our hands We have to depend on somebody else Pakistan must win with the bonus point and Sachin trailed off. Its hoping for too much, which is why he left quite a bit unsaid. Footnote: Meanwhile, vice-captain Rahul Dravid has also been bitten by the viral bug. Im staying indoors Away from the wind, he said, when reached for a reaction at the team hotel.  Copyright

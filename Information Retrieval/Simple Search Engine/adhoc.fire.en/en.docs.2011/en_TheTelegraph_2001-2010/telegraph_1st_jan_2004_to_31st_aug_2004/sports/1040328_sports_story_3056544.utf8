 Langers 18th ton forces Lankans on the backfoot
 Justin Langer (166) crouches after suffering leg cramps in Colombo on Saturday. (Reuters) Colombo: Australia opener Justin Langer scored 166 to leave Sri Lanka fighting to avoid a series whitewash at the close of the fourth day of the third Test on Saturday. Australia, 80 for three overnight, slumped to 98 for five in the morning but reclaimed the initiative when Langer and Simon Katich compiled a 218-run stand for the sixth wicket. Sri Lanka, who had taken a six-run first innings lead on Friday after scoring 407 to Australias 401, were left needing 370 to win in the final innings after Australia were bowled out for 375. The home side survived five overs against the new ball to close on 18 without loss, with Maravan Atapattu unbeaten on five and Sanath Jayasuriya 13 not out. Muttiah Muralidharan, locked in a race with Australias leg-spinner Shane Warne to beat Courtney Walshs 519-wicket world record, extended his career tally to 513, taking three for 93. Warne is also on 513 and will have an outside chance of breaking the record on the final day on Sunday. Langer threw off the distraction of a disciplinary inquiry the previous evening, in which he was cleared of bringing the game into disrepute, to rediscover his batting form after a lean series. The 33-year-old was dogged by painful leg cramps during a six-and-three-quarter-hour innings that spanned 295 balls and included 14 fours and two sixes. Katich provided a patient and solid ally, battling hard for his 86 from 214 balls. Rangana Herath was Sri Lankas most successful bowler, claiming a career best four for 92 from 24.2 overs. Sri Lanka started the morning with their two spinners and needed just three overs to break through when Damien Martyn was pinned lbw by Herath.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

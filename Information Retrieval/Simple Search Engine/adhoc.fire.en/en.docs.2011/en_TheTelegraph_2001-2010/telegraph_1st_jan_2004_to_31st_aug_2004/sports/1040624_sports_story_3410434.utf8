 Uefa clean chit for Sweden, Denmark
Lisbon: Uefa, the governing body of European soccer, said on Wednesday there was nothing suspicious about the 2-2 result between Sweden and Denmark, a high-scoring draw which helped both teams make it to the Euro 2004 quarter finals and automatically eliminated Italy. There isnt anything there at all, said Uefa spokesman Rob Faulkner. Asked if Uefa would investigate the result, he replied: Absolutely not. Ahead of the match, conspiracy theories swirled in the Italian media that the Scandinavian neighbours would play for the 2-2 result. Any draw 2-2 or above automatically knocked out Italy. Meanwhile, Italy have not lodged an official complaint about the draw. For the moment there is no complaint from Italy, Uefa disciplinary counsel Julien Sieveking told reporters. Frankly, if they (Sweden and Denmark) had tried to put that together and succeeded in putting it together they should get a Hollywood contract, said Uefa spokesman William Gaillard. Franco Carraro, a member of the Uefa executive committee and president of the Italian soccer federation, hinted that Sweden and Denmark colluded to arrange Italys exit from Euro 2004 on Tuesday night. There is no doubt that the way the Denmark-Sweden game developed shows that the two teams were aiming for a draw. Of course, proof of that is hard to find, Carraro told Italian television. Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni was asked afterward if he had suspicions about the result. I have none, he said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

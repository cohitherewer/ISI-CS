 Bayern ride Deisler brace to title

(AFP) Mainz: Two goals from Sebastian Deisler helped Bayern Munich to a 3-2 victory over Bundesliga champions Werder Bremen in an entertaining German League Cup final on Monday. Deisler, who missed most of last season while being treated for depression, opened the scoring with a free-kick after 27 minutes in the final of the pre-season tournament. The Germany midfielder doubled the advantage from 20 metres just before half-time and playmaker Michael Ballack seemingly killed the tie with their third in the 65th minute. But Werder, who won their first league and Cup double last season, still had some fight left in them. They reduced the arrears through Croatian striker Ivan Klasnic in the 68th minute before scoring again six minutes later with a penalty from French defender Valerien Ismael. Deisler, whose career has persistently been hit by injury, had to be substituted in the 71st minute with a sore knee. It was not immediately known how serious the problem was. The Bundesliga resumes on Friday with Werder hosting Schalke 04. Bayern, who ended last season without a trophy, start their campaign on Saturday at Hamburg SV. Bayern, who won their first title under new coach Felix Magath, pocketed 1.3 million euros for their fifth victory in the lucrative warm-up while Werder had to be content with 900,000 euros. The Munich club, which reinforced their squad by signing Germany midfielder Torsten Frings and Brazil defender Lucio, were convincing before dropping their guard. It was a beginning and we should not be satisfied with that, said Magath. We nearly gave away the victory and thats something that must not happen in the Bundesliga. Werder coach Thomas Schaaf blamed his team for a sluggish start. We slept in the first half, he said. Only after the break did we wake up. (Reuters)  Copyright

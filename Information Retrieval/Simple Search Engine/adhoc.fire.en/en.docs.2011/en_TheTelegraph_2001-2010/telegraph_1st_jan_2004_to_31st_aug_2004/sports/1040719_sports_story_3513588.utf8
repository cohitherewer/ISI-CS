 Argentina oust Peru
 Argentine players congratulate Carlos Tevez (third from right) after he scored the first goal against Peru in Chiclayo on Saturday. (AFP) Chiclayo: Argentina eliminated hosts Peru 1-0 in the quarter finals on Sunday and will try to end defending champions Colombias 10-match unbeaten streak since 2001 at the Copa America. Colombia easily dispatched Costa Rica 2-0 on first-half goals by Abel Aguilar and Tressor Moreno at Trujillo, and will tackle Argentina in the first semi-final on Tuesday at Lima. Brazil will meet Mexico, followed by Paraguay versus Uruguay in the other quarter finals on Monday to complete the semi-final line-up on Wednesday. It took the inspired substitution of Carlos Tevez for Argentina to go past hosts Peru 1-0, in a tale of free-kicks. Only three minutes after entering the match at packed Elias Aguirre Stadium, Tevez bent an unstoppable free-kick inside the left corner of the goal in the 61st minute. Tevez, only 20, has dominated the Argentine league for the last 18 months, leading Boca Juniors to the Copa Libertadores championship and the Intercontinental Cup, and urging many to wonder why national coach Marcelo Bielsa waited until last month to start the 2003 Latin American Player of the Year. But Bielsas decision to insert Tevez for Andres DAlessandro was perfectly timed. After Tevezs shot beat goalkeeper Oscar Ibanez, he pumped his arms in the air to celebrate as teammates raced over to hug him. Bielsa said he initially second-guessed the substitution. The Argentines played the final minutes a man down after Roberto Ayala was expelled for excessive yellow cards in the 82nd minute. Ayala had a chance to give Argentina the lead in the 25th off a corner kick, but his header from just inside the penalty area sailed wide. The Peruvian attack came to life with around 15 minutes left in the half. But Roberto Palacios failed to finish off a pass from Andres Mendoza in front of the goal in the 35th. Mendoza then had a chance of his own three minutes later, but sent a soft, rolling shot that goalkeeper Roberto Abbondazieri easily handled. After the break, Argentina kept up the pressure and threatened first. In the 57th, Luciano Figueroa  with three Peruvian defenders nearby  nailed the post with a header on a pass from Javier Zanetti. A little south down the coast at Trujillo, a well-rested Colombia easily overcame Costa Rica at Mansiche Stadium. Aguilar one-timed a low right cross from Jairo Patino near the penalty spot in the 41st minute, and two minutes into first-half injury time Tressor Moreno converted a penalty he drew when he was tripped up on a breakaway by Costa Rica goalkeeper Ricardo Gonzalez.

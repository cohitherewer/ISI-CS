				 																																	Berlin: The German Football Association (DFB) on Wednesday denied reports that players with the West Germany team which won the 1954 World Cup had used performance-enhancing stimulants but said they had received vitamin treatments.				 																																	DFB spokesman Harald Stenger said doping allegations against the 1954 side reported by Germanys ARD public television network and repeated on the front page of the countrys top-selling Bild newspaper were completely unfounded.				 																																	The players were treated with glucose and Vitamin C  as a means to help them regenerate, Stenger said when asked about reports some of the 1954 players had received injections after the former groundsman at the stadium in Berne, Switzerland said he found used vials in the drains of the dressing room. To call it doping is way off the mark, said Stenger.				 																																	West Germany shocked Hungary 3-2 in the final of the 1954 tournament. 				 																																	London: Everton striker Duncan Ferguson will not face a racism charge from the Football Association over a complaint by Fulhams Luis Boa-Morte as there is insufficient evidence, the FA said Wednesday.				 																																	Fulham made a formal complaint on behalf of Portuguese striker Boa-Morte, who said Ferguson aimed racist comments at him during a a FA Cup tie in January. But Ferguson has pleaded guilty to charges of violent behaviour and improper conduct during Evertons match against Leicester City earlier this month, the FA said.				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn has no plans to retire and wants to continue as Germany goalkeeper until after the 2010 World Cup when he will be 40.				 																																	Asked in an interview in Stern magazine if he would retire from the national side after the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Kahn said: I feel physically far too fit.				 																																	Dino Zoff was a World Cup winner at 40. Im 34 now, so that would be the 2010 World Cup.				 																																	Berlin: Ralf Schumacher does not talk to his brother Michael, six-times world champion, about Formula One any more because he is eager to win the title himself. We still talk to each other like in the past, but Formula One is a taboo topic because weve become such rivals professionally, Ralf told Germanys Bunte magazine on Wednesday.				 																																	Williams Ralf finished last season in fifth after briefly challenging Michael with two mid-season wins.				 																																	Michael said he sees Ralf every fortnight. How many other brothers can say they see each other every two weeks? he asked.				 																																	Sydney: Lisbeth Lenton set a world record in the semi-finals of the womens 100 metres freestyle at the Australian Olympic selection trials and national championships at the Sydney Olympic pool on Wednesday.				 																																	Lenton clocked 53.66 seconds to better the mark of 53.77 set by Dutchwoman Inge de Bruijn at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. 				 																																	Savannah: A heavyweight boxer from Florida has died two days after being knocked out in a prize fight in neighboring Georgia, authorities said on Tuesday.				 																																	David Rickman, 29, was pronounced dead on Monday at Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, Georgia, said Sarah Smith, deputy coroner of Chatham County. His body was released to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which planned to conduct an autopsy.				 																																	Rickman fell to the canvas on Saturday night after receiving several blows.Sport on Screen Soccer: World Cup qualifiers, Paraguay vs Brazil live from 6 am on TEN Sports

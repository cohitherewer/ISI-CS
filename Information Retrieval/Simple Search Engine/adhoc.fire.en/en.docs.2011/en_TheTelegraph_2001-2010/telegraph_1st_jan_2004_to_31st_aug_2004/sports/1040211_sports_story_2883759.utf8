The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne doesnt get to bowl
Sydney: Shane Warnes much-anticipated comeback to cricket after completing a 12-month doping ban ended in anti-climax on Tuesday when rain stopped play before he had the chance to bowl. The Australian leg-spinner did get to bat, however, making 11 runs in a brief stay at the crease and also took a sharp catch in the field, but foul weather prevented him from bowling. About 1,000 people, including members of his family and a large media contingent turned up in the modest surroundings of Junction Oval in suburban Melbourne in the hope of seeing Australias greatest wicket-taker roll his arm over. But they left the ground disappointed when the heavens opened up shortly after lunch and eventually forced play to be abandoned early. Warne batted for 20 minutes before he was caught behind by Chris Hartley off Steve Magoffin and Victoria declared shortly after at 379-5. Victoria selector Mick OSullivan said that although many of the states second-string players had never met Warne, his addition to the team was positive. Shanes very excited, he loves playing cricket, hes a real cricket nut, said OSullivan. He cant wait to get out and have a bat, have a bowl  more than anything, be part of the team.

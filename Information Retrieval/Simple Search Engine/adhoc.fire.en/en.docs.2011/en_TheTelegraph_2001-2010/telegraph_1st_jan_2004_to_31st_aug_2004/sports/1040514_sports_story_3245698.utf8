The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Morgans bid not attractive
Liverpool, May 13 (Reuters): Liverpool said on Thursday that an investment offer from British businessman Steve Morgan was not attractive. The Liverpool board met to discuss offers from Morgan, referred to as the Bridgemere Proposal, and Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecoms tycoon before he turned to politics. The club later issued a statement saying: The board notes that the Bridgemere Proposal, at 1,750 pounds per share, implies a current value of 61 million pounds ($107.6 million) for the entire club, which is a substantial discount to the value placed on the club by the board. The board has therefore concluded that the Bridgemere Proposal as currently constituted is not attractive. It intends to discuss its response to both these proposals with the respective parties. Thaksin offered $100 million for a 30 percent stake in the Premier League club. Property developer Morgan wanted to increase his five percent stake with a deal funded by a rights issue and the sale of shares to supporters. Liverpool is 51 percent owned by David Moores, whose family has had control for half a century, and 9.9 percent owned by television company Granada.  Copyright

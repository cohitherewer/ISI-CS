The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A homecoming for Federer
 - Wimbledon - Defending champion Serena Williams out to bend it like Beckham  Serena Williams listens to a question during a press conference in London on Sunday London: Roger Federer is ready to savour every moment when he opens play on Centre Court at the Wimbledon getting underway on Monday. Serena Williams, meanwhile, has big plans. Im going to bend it like Beckham, she laughs. When you come here you know it is so special, the 22-year-old Federer said on Sunday. Once you have been on Centre Court and seen a match or played a match there, somehow you fall in love with this place. This is what happened to me. The first time I played here against (Pete) Sampras...the first time I stepped on court as a junior in 98...I remember those things like it was yesterday. Federer, who plays Britains Alex Bogdanovic in the first round, won many admirers for his free-flowing tennis last year and has gone from strength to strength in the 12 months since lifting the Wimbledon title. He went on to win the season-ending Masters Cup and the Australian Open at the beginning of 2004. Now, he says, he has cracked the knack of preparing for major events. I know what I have to do leading up to Grand Slams, he said at the All England Club. This was a thing I was not sure of in the past. I would just come to Grand Slams and prepare the way I do for a regular tournament. I dont think thats the right approach. Thats really a thing I have learned over this past year. Federers Grand Slam titles have instilled greater confidence into the player but have also added a little pressure to the mix. This year it is trying to defend the title, this is a new situation for me. All the focus, I feel, is on me. Also from my own side I put a lot of pressure on myself. But it is a different pressure. It is all about Wimbledon and trying to do well here because this is really my favourite place to play tennis. Serena says she is fully fit and raring to go as she prepares to defend the only Grand Slam title left in her possession. She also claims to be drawing inspiration from Englands soccer captain. I love David Beckham, she said on Sunday. I am really excited about the England team at Euro 2004. Im going to be watching the matches...and Ive been following Beckham since the World Cup in 98. The Williams family has not been without a Grand Slam title since 1998, putting added pressure on Serena. I have to work really hard here, she said. People are here trying to thieve my title from me. I think anyone is a big threat to my title. If I get over-confident I could end up going home early and that is not something I want to do. Both Serena and elder sister Venus lost in the quarter finals of the French Open last month and Serena is determined not to repeat that disappointment. I have just got to get over it, you know? I didnt want to bring the bad karma to Wimbledon. You cant live in the past. You have to live in the present and in the future. Dismissing suggestions she has become distracted from tennis and is diverting time and energy away from the court and into her nascent acting career, the top seed said: I am more serious about tennis than ever. Before when I was winning, it was like whatever, now it is different. I really want to win. Physically I am close to 100 per cent. But you know, everybody expects me to win 100 per cent of the time...I expect myself to win 200 per cent of the time but no matter how good you are, you are not going to win every match you play. Serena has not even looked at who she will meet in the first round. I dont know, she smiled. All I can do is get myself ready, get my game going and then whoever I play thats okay.

 Pitch drama on Day III 
 Makhaya Ntini in action against New Zealand in Hamilton on Friday. (AFP) Hamilton: Jacques Kallis took three wickets from an unsupportive pitch on Friday to tighten South Africas hold on the first Test against New Zealand on Day III. However, far outweighing anything that happened on the pitch on Friday was the pitch itself, which both aroused the series first great controversy and helped drain life from the day. South Africa arrived at the ground early to find the grounds sightscreens had been rebuilt overnight, apparently at New Zealands request, and the pitch had been illegally repaired. The tourists immediately drew the repair to the attention of Match Referee Clive Lloyd and Lloyd ordered the work carried out by groundstaff to be undone. Lloyd then issued a statement in which he said the work conducted on the pitch had occurred because of miscommunication between umpires and groundstaff. The condition of the pitch should not be artificially altered during the match, Lloyd said. Before the start of play today I instructed that the pitch be returned to the condition it was in at the close of play last night. South African coach Eric Simons said their suspicions about the repair work had been aroused on Thursday when the Proteas overheard a conversation about the pitch. Andre Nel was officially warned on Thursday for running on the pitch after bowling two balls. Kallis victims included Michael Papps and Brendon McCullum, whose half centuries on debut guided New Zealands stumbling progress to 361 for the loss of seven wickets in reply to South Africas first innings of 459. Papps made 59, only slightly enlarging the debut 50 he achieved before stumps on Thursday, and McCullum made 57 in the days brightest and most assertive innings. Scott Styris made 74 and Jacob Oram reached 49 not out before stumps to find New Zealands hopes of defraying South Africas first innings lead weighing on his shoulders.  (AP)  Copyright

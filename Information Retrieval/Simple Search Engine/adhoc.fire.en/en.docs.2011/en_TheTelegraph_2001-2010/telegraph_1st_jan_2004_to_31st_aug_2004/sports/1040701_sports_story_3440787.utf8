		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 EURO DIGEST
				 																																	Geneva: Swiss referee Urs Meier said on Wednesday that he feared for the security of his family after receiving death threats from English football supporters infuriated at his disallowing a last minute goal by Sol Campbell in the Euro 2004 quarter final defeat by Portugal. The 45-year-old revealed that he had been offered police protection for himself and his family and the 15 people he employs at his electrical goods shop after receiving the threats. I am not afraid for my life, but for those of my family and close friends, he told Swiss newspaper Le Matin. When they begin to involve my family and invade my private life, that is intolerable. They are trying to destroy me. Meier has received the threats by phone and e-mail while his company has been flooded with calls from England. Lisbon: Two coaches with 130 years of life experience between them will strike a blow for the golden oldies when the Czech Republic play Greece in Thursdays Euro 2004 semi-final. Karel Brueckner, who has been promised free Czech beer for the rest of his days if his team wins the tournament, meets Otto Rehhagel for a place in Sundays final. Brueckner, white-haired, crumpled and radiating the warmth of an avuncular grandfather, has built the Czechs into a formidable side who have won 11 of their 12 competitive matches since his first game in charge in February 2002. Rehhagel, at 65, looks younger than his 64-year-old rival thanks to his unflecked brown hair and he has a reputation as an occasionally volatile showman. Win or lose at Euro 2004, Rehhagel wants to stay and direct the side in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. Zagreb: Croatias coach, Otto Baric, stepped down as expected from his lofty position on Tuesday following Croatias first round elimination at Euro 2004. The 71-year-old had been in charge since 2002 and had not been expected to stay on with two members of their great team from the 90s Zvonimir Boban and Slaven Bilic mentioned as possible successors. Baric said that he was satisfied with the way the team had performed at Euro, drawing with the Swiss and the deposed champions France while losing to England. The Croatian FA is scheduled to name their coach next Thursday. Barics contract expires on July 31.

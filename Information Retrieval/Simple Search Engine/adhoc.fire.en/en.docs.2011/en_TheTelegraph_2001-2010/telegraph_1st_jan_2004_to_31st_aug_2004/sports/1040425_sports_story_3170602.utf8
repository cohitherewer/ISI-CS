 Maradona back on respirator
Buenos Aires, April 24 (AFP): Doctors put Argentine football legend Diego Maradona back on a respirator on Friday afternoon, saying that his condition had not worsened but that his diminished breathing capacity was due to sedatives. Maradona needed... the reinserted tracheal tube to help breathing and to handle bronchial secretions caused by indispensable sedatives, which reduce the mechanical movement of the thorax, the hospital statement said. Twenty-four hours after having taken him off the respirator, doctors reinserted the small tube pumping air into his lungs, weakened by pneumonia. Reinsertion of the tube was not due to a worsening heart condition or infections, which remain stable, the statement said. Meanwhile, Maradonas daughters have asked for silence after reports that the former Argentina captains supporters planned a rally in front of the hospital to wish the 43-year-old. Today, dad needs to be quiet so that he can recover and be with us again, said a statement issued by Dalma and Gianina Maradona. Thats why we ask the real supporters and fanatics to co-operate, not just by not shouting his name but helping to quieten anybody who does. We ask that if they hold any kind of demonstration, they do it away from the clinic. It will be worth as much and it will be better for everyone. The Boca Juniors president also discouraged the idea, saying Maradona and other patients needed their rest.  Copyright

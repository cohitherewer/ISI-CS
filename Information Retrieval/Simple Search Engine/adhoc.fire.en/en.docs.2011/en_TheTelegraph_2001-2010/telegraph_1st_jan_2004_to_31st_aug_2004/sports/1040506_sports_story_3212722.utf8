 England shouldnt tour, says Blair
London: British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Wednesday that England cricketers shouldnt tour Zimbabwe, but added the decision rests with international cricket chiefs. We would prefer them not to go, Blair said during his weekly question period in the House of Commons, adding: There is a difference between doing that and ordering them not to go which I think would step over the proper line. Meanwhile, ICC president Ehsan Mani launched a bitter attack on Blair accusing him of inaction on the thorny subject. It is disappointing that a politician should attempt to shift the blame in this way, said Mani. At no stage has he or any of his people sought to get the facts on this matter from the ICC. quot; (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saini still in dark about exclusion
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Baljit Singh Saini, seen practising at the CCFC ground on Tuesday, is hopeful of returning to the national squad Calcutta: He was unceremoniously dropped from the Indian squad for Australian tour (for two four-nation meets), along with Baljit Singh Dhillon, Dhanraj Pillay and Sandeep Michael, but Baljit Singh Saini still believes that he can prove himself once again and return to the side for the Athens Olympics. I cannot say why I have been dropped, it is completely the Indian Hockey Federations decision, Saini said at the CC amp;FC ground. He is here to play in the ongoing Beighton Cup. He didnt want to discuss any further the matter of his exclusion from the side. Maybe, the federation has been looking for junior players... An international, who hails from this city, he is now relieved a bit as his daughter is keeping well after a heart operation. It took me by surprise when a hole was detected in her heart, Saini said. However, though Saini says he will showcase his talent to be back in the squad for the Olympics he will not have any match opportunity to do that. What he will have to rely upon is the extended pre-Olympic camp that will follow the Australia tour. Another former Indian international, Daljit Dhillon, who is also here, to play for Punjab Police, said he remained hopeful on his comeback to the national side. Dhillon, though, said that he wasnt happy playing the Beighton Cup on grass. Since it is such a renowned meet, it should be played on astroturf, he opined. Playing on astroturf makes a lot of difference to your gameespecially the speed of the game, Dhillon remarked. Punjab Police also have two more internationals in Baljit Singh Dhillon (yet to arrive and will be playing from the next match), and Pravdeep Singh (who played against the Tamil Nadu outfit on Tuesday) at the East Bengal ground. Meanwhile, it was learnt from the team sources that coach Pargat Singh is unlikely to turn up this time.  Copyright

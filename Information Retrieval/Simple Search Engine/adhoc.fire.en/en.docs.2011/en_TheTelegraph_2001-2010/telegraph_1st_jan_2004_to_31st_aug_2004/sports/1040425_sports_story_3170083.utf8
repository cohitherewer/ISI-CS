The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe to field second string again
 - Third One-dayer vs Sri Lanka  Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu and coach Geoff Marsh watch their team practise at the Harare Sports Club on Saturday. (Reuters) Harare, April 24 (AFP): A continued boycott by 15 white Zimbabwe professional cricketers has forced the national selectors here to choose a team once more from the countrys second string to meet Sri Lanka in the third of five ODIs on Sunday. They are sticking to the side that has already suffered two big defeats at the hands of the bemused tourists. In refusing to show up for practice on Saturday as part of a new deal proposed by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, the dissident players underlined their rejection of a plan which would mean mediation by an independent body and of new procedures to resolve union and player differences. A players meeting is being planned for Tuesday or Wednesday next week, after the return of their lawyer Chris Venturas from South Africa. Flower said: Nothing is going to happen until at least then. In these circumstances the 15 could not turn up for practice, which would be an indication that they are available for selection, until the crisis is resolved, because that would concede a negotiating position. It seems inevitable that Sri Lanka will proceed on Sunday on their way to a series whitewash by the final match on Thursday. Sri Lanka will choose their final XI just before the match. TEAMS Zimbabwe: Tatenda Taibu (capt), Vusi Sibanda, Brendan Taylor, Dion Ebrahim, Elton Chigumbura, Stuart Matsikenyere, Alester Magwedere, Mluleki Nkala, Prosper Utseya, Douglas Hondo, Tinashe Panyangara. 12th man: Tawanda Mpariwa. Sri Lanka (from): Maravan Atapattu (capt), Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Russel Arnold, Saman Jayantha, Thilina Kandamby, Chaminda Vaas, Nuwan Zoysa, Dilhara Fernando, Nuwan Kalasekera, Farveez Maharoof, Muttiah Muralidharan, Upul Chandana, Rangana Herath.

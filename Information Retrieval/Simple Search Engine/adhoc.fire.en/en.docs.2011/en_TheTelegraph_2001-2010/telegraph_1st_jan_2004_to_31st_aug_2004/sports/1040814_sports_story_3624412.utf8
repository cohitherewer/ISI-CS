The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lombard banned for two years
Dublin: Irish distance runner Cathal Lombard has been banned for two years after he admitted taking the banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) while training for the Athens Olympics opening on Friday. The period of ineligibility shall commence from August 10, the Irish Sports Council said in a statement released after a disciplinary panel hearing on Thursday. Lombard, 28, a lawyer who qualified for the 5,000 and 10,000 metres in Athens, was provisionally suspended earlier this week when his failed test was announced. The Irish Sports Council, which oversees the national anti-doping system, said it had pursued Lombard after suspiciously dramatic improvements in his performance. Lombard has apologised for taking the drug and said he now wanted to join the fight against drugs in sport.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gangjee to start afresh
	 - MACAU OPEN  Rahil Gangjee in action during the Pro-Am event of the Macau Open on Wednesday. (AFP) Macau: Indias Rahil Gangjee will be hoping to bag another piece of silverware on the Asian Tour as he prepares to tee off in the $275,000 dollar Macau Open on Thursday. Still over the moon after being elevated to prominence after scoring a maiden victory at last weeks Volkswagen Masters China in Beijing, the 25-year-old said on Wednesday that he was relishing the prospect of getting out on the course again. Ive had so many phone calls from well-wishers from back home and my parents and coach Ajay Gupta were simply ecstatic. Im still going to go out there this week and have fun. Last week was great but its back to work here in Macau. It starts afresh for me, said Gangjee. Irish star Padraig Harrington, who has finished in the top-three of the European money ranking in the past three seasons, is also looking to pick up another piece of Far Eastern silverware. The world No. 8 has a successful record in Asia, with victories in Hong Kong and Taiwan and numerous top-10 finishes. With his form this season showing no signs of abating, Harrington is ready to shine in the 10th leg of the 2004 Asian Tour and deprive local favourite Zhang Liangwei of China a third Macau Open title in four years. Harrington, who will play the first two rounds alongside Zhang, is using the event as a warm-up ahead of his defence of next weeks BMW Asian Open title in Shanghai. Zhang has made the Macau Open very much his own tournament, winning back to back titles in 2001 and 2002. He triumphed over Nick Price of Zimbabwe after a memorable five-hole play-off for his second win and is looking forward to completing his hattrick this week.  (AFP)  Copyright

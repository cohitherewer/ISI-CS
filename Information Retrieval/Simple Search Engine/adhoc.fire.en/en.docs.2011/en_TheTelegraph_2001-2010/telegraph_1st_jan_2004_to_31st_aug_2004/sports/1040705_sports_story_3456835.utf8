		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Federer is more gifted than Pistol Pete
Champion Speak John McEnroeWhen I was a kid I used to watch a basketball player called Julius Irving  Dr J  who could do some quite amazing things with a ball and I remember thinking at the time theres never going to be anyone like him again.																								And then along came Michael Jordan. I was reminded of how even the very special can be succeeded when Roger Federer finally arrived last summer to take over the mantle of Pete Sampras. Now, Im not suggesting for one moment that I believe Federer can surpass Sampras extraordinary record haul of 14 Grand Slam titles, but I do think he is a more gifted player than the American and he certainly has it within his capability to go past my seven Slam successes.																								Federer is more fluid and plays with greater style than his predecessor, but he doesnt possess quite the same power and, perhaps even more importantly, that same assassins mentality Pistol Pete had. Not yet anyway. If he eventually learns it... my God he could dominate Wimbledon almost to the same extent that Sampras did.																								Federers tennis this year, like last, has been quite sublime, only even more relaxed. No sign of a repetition of the back spasm he suffered in his fourth-round match last year against Feliciano Lopez that was clearly due to nerves, and which may also have partly explained Amelie Mauresmos back problems in her thrilling semi-final against the eventual runner-up, Serena Williams.																								There is no doubt the Swiss already feels almost as much at ease at Wimbledon as Sampras did. The Championship suits his personality in the same way that it suited Sampras. I think he appreciates the orderliness of it and for the same reason I think he usually does well at a tournament like the Hamburg Masters.																								The US Open is a little too crazy for someone of his persona, just as Paris and Rome are probably a little too emotive. Eventually, Im sure, hell figure out a way of winning at Flushing Meadow, just as Stefan Edberg did, and then there will be no holding him. Hes not so comfortable on clay, though, so the French could be the last that he wins.																								As for Andy Roddick, he has exceptional firepower and, as I have said before, nothing negates skill quite like power; its the ultimate equaliser, as I discovered to my own cost towards the end of my career.																								Roddick has the utmost respect for Federer; indeed all the players do. It isnt just the fans and the media who enthuse about him. Players talk about him with great reverence in the locker room, too. 																								In fact, Mirca, his girlfriend, told me the other day that I should stop saying so many nice things about him because he was starting to get a bit too cocky. Apparently, he enjoys watching himself on television, but you can hardly blame the guy!																								Federer versus Roddick was the match-up we had all hoped for. Well, all of us, except the Brits. It was almost unbearable for them to take the crushing disappointment of Tim Henmans elimination.																								Im starting to think its not going to happen for the British No. 1. The window of opportunity is getting smaller with each passing year. He has to figure out a way of winning the easy matches more easily. It must be mentally as well as physically draining for him to play the way he has done here. 																								I feel exhausted just commentating his matches. If only he could tap into the crowds positive energy he would find it easier but, sadly, they take their lead from his own internalisation and remain as quiet as a library.																								I have to say I was surprised the way he played against Mario Antic. Up until the quarter final, he had mixed it up when serving, coming to the net on some occasions, staying back on others. I have never advocated him staying back too much but, against the Croatian, for some reason, he decided to come in behind every serve and Antic seemed to enjoy the target.																								Since there were very few rallies, there was no way to get the crowd into the match, which was what he needed to do because his performance was so flat. 																								Why, when he was two sets to love down, he didnt throw the guy a wrench, do something different, may be even serve under-arm, I dont know. It was a strange choice of tactics for someone of his experience.																								Once Henman lost that first set, he just seemed to deflate. For a guy who has never won a major, and doesnt have the ability of some of the others, an awful lot is expected of him. 																								In the circumstances, four semi-finals and four quarter finals in the last nine years as well as legitimising his position as a top-10 player after a serious shoulder injury are pretty incredible achievements. But its going to take a mighty big prayer for him to improve upon that now.The Sunday Telegraph

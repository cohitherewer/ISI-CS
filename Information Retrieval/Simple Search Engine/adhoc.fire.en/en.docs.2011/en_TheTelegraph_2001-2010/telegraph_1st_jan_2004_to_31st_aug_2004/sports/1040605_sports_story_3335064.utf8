The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangladesh on backfoot
 Lara vows to step down if WI dont win Kingston: Three wickets, two to Pedro Collins, set back Bangladesh before lunch on the opening day of the second and final cricket Test against West Indies on Friday. Choosing to bat, Bangladesh reached 73 for three in their first innings at the interval with Rajin Saleh not out on 16 and Mohammad Ashraful not out on 10. Collins removed opening batsman Hannan Sarkar and captain Habibul Bashar in the first hour to carry figures of two wickets for 24 runs from eight overs into the interval. Fidel Edwards, his brother, added the wicket of Javed Omar to end a satisfying morning for the home team. Collins, like he did in the previous Test, struck with the very first ball of the match when Sarkar was again adjudged lbw for nought again offering no stroke to a delivery that jagged back and hit him adjacent to the off-stump. It was the third time Sarkar had fell to Collins this way, and with the first ball of a Test to make the West Indies left-arm medium-fast bowler the first player to take a wicket with the first ball of a Test three times. Meanwhile, Brian Lara vowed to step down as the West Indies captain if his team did not beat Bangladesh in the second and final Test at Sabina Park on Friday. If we dont win, I dont think Im going to lead the team to England, Lara said at a news conference on Thursday. If we dont beat Bangladesh in five good days of cricket in Jamaica, I think we need another leader. The first Test in Gros Islet, St Lucia, ended in a draw earlier this week after Bangladesh dominated most of the match. Lara is in his second stint as skipper of the Caribbean side. He has two wins, six draws and nine losses in 17 Tests since taking over again a year ago against the Australians.  (Agencies)  Copyright

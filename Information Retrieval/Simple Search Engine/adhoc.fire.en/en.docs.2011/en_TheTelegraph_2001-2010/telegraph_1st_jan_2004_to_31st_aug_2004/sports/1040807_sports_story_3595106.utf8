The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Only Anju stands a chance
 - OLYMPIC ATHLETICS 
- Precious little to show for in over 100 years of participation  Anju Bobby George has the best credentials New Delhi: Over a hundred years have passed since an athletics medal has been credited to India in the Olympic Games. India-based British soldier Norman Pritchard was credited with two silver medals at the Paris Games in 1900 when the Indian Olympic Association was not even in existence. Since those forgotten days when the countrymen in undivided India were more interested in breaking out of the shackles of British rule than in an Olympic medal, the country has drawn a blank every time it has sent athletes to the multi-event extravaganza. There have been great athletes like Milkha Singh, Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, Sriram Singh and P. T. Usha, to speak of a few, who have come close to standing on the medal podium in Olympics. However, they too could not attain the feat. Over the last few editions, the country has sent quite a few athletes with hopes that at least one or two of those would raise a cheer with a medal haul, but those dreams have, unfortunately not been realised. For the August 13-29 Athens Games as many as 19 athletes, including 14 women, have found berths in the Indian contingent. But the reality is, barring long jumper Anju Bobby George, no other athlete seems to have a remote chance of bringing home the elusive medal in track and field, a reflection of the quality of opposition as well as the lack of stature of Indian athletes on the global stage. Often in the past it has been witnessed that a plethora of Olympic-standard feats at home or in remote meets have fetched berths for athletes, only for them to flop badly at the games, questioning the veracity of these pre-Olympic performances. For example shot putters and discus throwers seem to be in peak form in the run-up to major events like the Olympics or Asian Games, only for them to perform far below par in the actual event. This phenomenon has never been explained satisfactorily by the Athletics Federation of India officials after the mega events. As far as the Athens Games are concerned the lone world class competitor India has at present is Anju George, who was ranked joint fourth by end-July, a feat by itself, which she has achieved through sheer hard work, perseverence and courage. While Anju has rubbed shoulders with her peers at world level in various meets mainly in the US and in Europe, most others have been content to parade their wares at home or at best take part in meets in Ukraine or Hungary to attain the qualifying marks. But even world championship bronze medallist Anju has her task cut out for climbing the medal rostrum in Athens in her pet event. The Indian champion has quite a few rivals to beat, including Marion Jones, the American sprint ace who is under a cloud related to drug abuse. The other notable rivals are French world champion Eunice Barber, ranked joint fourth end-July with Anju and a set of strong challengers from Russia, including world indoor champion and world number two Tatyana Lebedeva and world number one Tatyana Kotova. In the tune-up to the Athens Games, Anju has cleared over 6.80m twice  6.82 and 6.83m in Doha, Qatar and in Eugene, Oregon. But both these fine efforts, which should have been Indian records otherwise, were wind-assisted with the tail wind just half a metre per second over the permissible limit for record purposes when she jumped in the US. These leaps by the 27-year-old Kerala-born Chennai Customs officer were made in may and June, respectively, while her latest more modest effort of 6.60 m helped her finish only fifth in Stockholm in July-end. With a best effort of 6.66 m this year without the help of wind, the national record holder (6.74 m) has taken a short break to recharge her batteries and for training in her present base, Paris, before heading for Athens. Anju certainly has the ability to strike a medal in Athens where steely nerves and a consistently good take-off would be of paramount importance. The Indian ace has competed with the best in the world over the last couple of years and thus must be pretty confident of her own ability to withstand the pressure which would be huge in an Olympic arena. Compared to Anjus world standards, the ranking of all others are poor with some of them not even finding a place in the top 50. The best-ranked individual, from among the rest, is seasoned woman discus thrower Neelam Singh who is 15th while the other two women discus throwers, Seema Antil and Harwant Kaur, occupied the 25th and 32nd spots, respectively at the end of July. All the three women discus throwers had attained the Olympic A norm to qualify for the Games, while some others like mens one-lap racer K. M. Binu, womens 200 m and 400 m runners Saraswati Saha and Rajwinder Kaur have attained the B norm to make it to the Athens-bound squad. Strangely, shot putter Ranvijay Singh of UP, who attained the B norm with an effort of 20.26 m in the 44th inter-state meet in Chennai on July 18, has not found a berth in the team. The only relay team which has qualified for the Games is the womens 4 x 400 m quartet which set the new national record of 3:27.35 seconds at the Asian Grand Prix meet in Colombo in the third week of June. THE SQUAD MEN: K. M. Binu (400m), Bahadur Singh (shot put), Vikas Gowda and Anil Kumar (discus). WOMEN: Saraswati Saha (200m), Manjit Kaur (400m, 4x400m relay), Chitra Soman (400m, 4x400m relay), Rajwinder Kaur, K M Beenamol, S Geeta, Sagardeep Kaur (all 4x400m relay), Soma Biswas and J J Shobha (heptathlon), Anju Bobby George (long jump), Bobby Aloysius (high jump), Neelam J Singh, Seema Antil nd Harwant Kaur (discus).

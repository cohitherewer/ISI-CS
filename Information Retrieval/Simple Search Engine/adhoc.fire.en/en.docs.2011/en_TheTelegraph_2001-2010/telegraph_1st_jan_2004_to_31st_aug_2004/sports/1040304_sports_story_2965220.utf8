The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India eves wrap up series vs Windies
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Off-spinner Nooshin al Khadeer with the WoM trophy at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The West Indies women succumbed to spin once again as India completed a series win in the third match of the ODI series at Eden Gardens on Wednesday with two games still remaining. This time, India defended a modest total of 207 with plenty to spare in the end, bowling out the visitors for a mere 135. Off-spinner Nooshin al Khadeer was adjudged Player of the Match for returning figures of 10-1-22-4. The Caribbean challenge evaporated early, with the departure of Nadine George in the third over. George (who hit 16 off 11 balls) was the threat for us. We were not feeling safe with 207 on board as she is capable of taking the total to 95-100 in the first 15 overs. That could have made things difficult for us, said India captain Mamta Maben. The spinners took over from the tenth over and the visiting women were found woefully short on the technique of handling the slower variety. Not that the wicket was offering huge turn, but the West Indians just didnt have the footwork to counter the spinners. Opener Nelly Williams, leading the side in place of an indisposed Stephanie Power, top-scored with a 103-ball 41 and No. 9 Philipa Thomas contributed a bold 38 to save the team from total embarrassment. The Indian attack looked handicapped in the fast bowling department. Maben and Sunetra Paranjpe shared the new ball and none generated any kind of pace or movement to trouble the batswomen. Maben, though, picked two wickets before the ball was handed over to the spinners. Khadeer, the find of the season for Indian womens cricket, was late in getting into the wicket-taking act. Diana David, the other off-spinner, had started the job by claiming the third and fourth wickets. Left-armer Neetu David picked up two in the end to take her series tally to 11 wickets from three matches. India surprised the visitors by shuffling the batting order after winning the toss. The regular and successful opening pair of Anju Jain and Jaya Sharma made way for Paranjpe and Anjum Chopra. Sharma and Jain came into bat at No. 4 and 8, respectively. The openers had hardly allowed others any time to bat in the previous games. So the change in order was to ensure that everyone gets some time in the middle, we didnt want to experiment. We will do some experiments now that the series has been won, explained Maben. The start wasnt bad, but things got slowed down in the middle overs as Chopra struggled to force the pace. The former captain top-scored with 36, but took 85 balls to score them. Nevertheless, the time spent at the wicket should help her regain the touch that has been missing for some time. At one stage it seemed as if India would struggle to reach 200, Jains acceleration (26 not out off 23 balls) took the team past that mark. Before her, Maben and Hemlata Kala also tried to get things moving. But, as was seen in the end, even the mediocre Indian effort was too much for this West Indian lot.  Copyright

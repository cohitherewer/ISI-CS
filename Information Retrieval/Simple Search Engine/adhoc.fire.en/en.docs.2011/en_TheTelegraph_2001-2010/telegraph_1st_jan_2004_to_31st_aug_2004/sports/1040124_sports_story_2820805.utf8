The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Leander, Martina back on song

Melbourne: The Martina Navratilova-Leander Paes chemistry sizzled after a long gap on Friday night as the defending champions carved out a 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) victory over Chris Haggard (South Africa) and Emile Loit (France). 
One of the feature matches of the night session at the Rod Laver Arena, the fourth-seeded Indo-American combine looked in control for most of the match to wrap it up in an hour and a quarter. As the last point got over, the 47-year-old Navratilova bowed to Paes who is coming back from a five-month lay-off forced by a brain lesion. 
Paes had bowed similarly after the duo had emerged winners at Wimbledon last year. 
The Indian could not play the 2003 US Open because of the illness and his partner promptly pulled out, too, saying that she wouldnt play mixed doubles till the Indian got back to competitive tennis. Their camaraderie and mutual respect was once again on show Friday night. 
Paes and Czech partner Tomas Cibulec made a first-round exit from mens doubles, but the Indian is very much in business in mixed doubles with a partner he relishes playing with. 
 Mahesh-Max up 
There was more joy for India as Mahesh Bhupathi and his Belarussian partner Max Mirnyi advanced to the last 16. 
It was anything but an easy passage for the second seeds, though. They dropped the first set and were pushed in the next two as well before coming through 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4 against unfancied French duo Julien Benneteau and Arnaud Clement. 
Bhupathi and Mirnyi will next face Hicham Arazi (Morocco) and Nicolas Mahut (France).

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Australians talk tough
 - Zimbabwes Test status comes under cloud yet again Melbourne, May 22 (Agencies): Australia will consider pushing for Zimbabwe to be stripped of Test status at next months ICC meeting. Its over a month away right now and that gives the ZCU a chance to resolve some of their differences with their players, Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland told a news conference on Saturday. I think that (the Test status of Zimbabwe) is a question that has probably come on to the table and is higher on the agenda now than it has ever been before. Asked whether CA would lead a push to strip Zimbabwe of Test status, Sutherland said: Well obviously make a judgement a lot closer to the time. But there is no doubt that CA and a number of other full member countries are concerned about how things have developed in recent weeks. Zimbabwes two-Test home series against Australia, the worlds top-ranked team, was called off on Friday, 24 hours before it was due to start. In an unprecedented move, the ZCU and CA agreed at a meeting in Harare to postpone the matches. Because of Australias tight schedule, the games are highly unlikely to be played for at least four years. Zimbabwe would have had to field a severely weakened team due to a festering dispute which has left the selectors without 15 experienced white players, including ex-captain Heath Streak. However, three ODIs, originally set for June, are being brought forward to May 25, 27 and 29. All will be played in Harare. The joint decision to call off the Tests came two hours before an ICC teleconference which looked likely to strip the series of its Test status. The teleconference was swiftly abandoned. One cant predict but one would assume that a Zimbabwe second XI or third XI playing against the best team in the world would not have been a pretty contest, Sutherland said. Its well known that the ICC have commenced a review of the structure of international cricket. Sutherland said CA supported the ICCs review. The circumstances around this (deferred tour) are no good for the game of cricket. The game is not worthy of this kind of speculation and uncertainty, Sutherland said. There are certainly concerns about the standard of their team at the moment and thats something the ICC will address at their June meeting. Though the players have paid heed to the ICCs advice to approach the disputes committee, the ZCU is still reluctant to do so, saying such a body does not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The ICC has previously advised both the ZCU and the players representatives of the ICCs view and the external legal advice that we have obtained say that this procedure may be applied in this case, ICC president Ehsan Mani. At this time, the ZCU is not of the same view. It believes that a disputes resolution committee does not have any jurisdiction over this dispute. However, the players have advised the ICC that they wish to take this dispute to this forum, he said. Meanwhile, Imran Khan on Saturday called the crisis an internal clash between the countrys white minority and the government. The current cricket crisis in Zimbabwe is their internal matter and its a clash of white minority farmers with the majority. But no one has the right to interfere in it, Imran said in Karachi.

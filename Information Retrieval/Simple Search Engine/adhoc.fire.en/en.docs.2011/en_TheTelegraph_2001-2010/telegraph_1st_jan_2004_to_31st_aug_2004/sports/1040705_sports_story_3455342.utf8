The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, July 05, 2004  RCTC: No more cancellations 
 BY STAR RACER 				 										Calcutta: The focus at the RCTC media conference on Sunday was more on Clause 21  of the monsoon season prospectus  which, barring a sweepstake, forbids an owner to accept more than three runners in any race. The meet was chaired by Deepak Khaitan, an RCTC steward, who justified the new clause in view of last winters bitter experience. It brought the club a lot of embarrassment, said Khaitan. 				 										It was understood that most in the club were against those packing fields with runners to confused turfites. Khaitan also said that the RCTC was working on coupling of horses (bracketing) owned by same owners  a practice abandoned by almost all clubs nearly four decades ago. Khaitan, however, justified it, saying that the system was re-emerging in the west and the RCTC was open to the idea.				 										New cameras are being installed for better viewing and live broadcast of our races. The uplinking will encourage outstation owners to bring horses to Calcutta, added Khaitan. 				 										Seeing is believing may be the message RCTC is trying to convey to the other turf clubs. But the present horse-strength in Hastings is far from encouraging. The opening day programme was cancelled because the track was hard and dry. There will be no more cancellations, assured Khaitan.

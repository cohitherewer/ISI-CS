 Olympic champion Nicolas Massu has finally found a safe place for his gold medals which went temporarily missing in a mad departing dash from Athens. The world No. 11 Chilean said that in the euphoria after winning both singles and doubles gold last weekend, he stashed his precious trinkets behind a pillow on his bed at the athletes village.				 																																	After finishing interviews, doping tests and celebrations early Monday, he didnt bother to sleep, quickly packing a bag and also realising that he had to withdraw from this weeks ATP tournament on Long Island.				 																																	Only when he got to Athens airport, did he notice that his priceless rewards were not in his possession. I was in a panic, he said on Wednesday. I rang and asked if my medals were there. They were, and (doubles partner) Fernando Gonzalez brought them to me in Miami on Tuesday. A white Zimbabwean swimmer has been hailed a golden girl by President Robert Mugabe after winning all three of the countrys medals so far at the Olympic Games in Athens.

Coventry became her countrys first Olympic gold medallist in 24 years. New Zealand is glad three of its athletes have been crowned Olympic champions  but if their Athens olive wreaths come home they risk going up in smoke. Agriculture officials, who can incinerate plant material found at customs, have warned cycle rider Sarah Ulmer and rowing twins Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell that the wreaths won with their gold medals will be barred as a security threat.				 																																	Our understanding is that they are made out of olive branches, roses and chrysanthemums  this is plant material and it is considered to be a biosecurity risk, Agriculture Ministry official Veronica Herrera said on Thursday. Paula Radcliffe has entered her name for the Olympic 10,000 metres, a British team spokeswoman said on Thursday.				 																																	However, the marathon world record holder has yet to make a final decision on whether to take part in Fridays race. We have confirmed her entry before the 9:00 am deadline, the spokeswoman said. But basically its up to her to decide whether to compete between now and the race.  An Athens taxi driver has enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame for honestly returning a mislaid Olympic medal.				 																																	I put it on and, for a few moments, became a medallist myself, Yannis Zavos told Apoyevmatini newspaper on Thursday. But my wife started teasing me.				 																																	The rotund Zavos, a cabbie for 42 years, said he never thought of keeping the silver medal, left by Dutch rower Diederik Simon in the back of his taxi: I didnt win it. Somebody worked very hard for that.  Ukraine have lost the bronze medals they won in womens quadruple sculls on Sunday after crew member Olena Olefirenko tested positive for a prohibited stimulant.

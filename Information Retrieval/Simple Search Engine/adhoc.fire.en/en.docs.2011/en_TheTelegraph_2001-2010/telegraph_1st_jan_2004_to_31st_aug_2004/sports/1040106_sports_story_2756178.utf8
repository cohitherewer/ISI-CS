				 																																	London: David Beckham believes Rio Ferdinand can put his drugs ban behind him to become the England captain one day.				 																																	It will make him stronger once he has come through all of this. It wont stop him becoming a future England captain, current England skipper Beckham told the Sun newspaper.				 																																	I have known him for a long time, even before he was at United. I knew him when he was at West Ham and even then I recognised how strong he was. I have no doubt he will come back from this  but I am not going to give up being national skipper easily!				 																																	Ferdinand is facing an eight month ban for missing a drugs test in September which is due to start on January 12.				 																																	London: Plans to build a retractable roof over Wimbledons Centre Court are expected to be unveiled at the All England Club on Tuesday.				 																																	After years of rejecting the idea of having a roof, organisers of the grasscourt Grand Slam seem to have relented to meet television demands.				 																																	Rain has completely washed out play on five days since 1991 and during the 2003 championships, competitors were left playing a waiting game in the locker rooms after incessant showers frequently halted play during the second week. With fans frustrated at the constant delays and broadcasters left to delve into their archives to fill in precious television airtime, Wimbledon organisers look set to follow in the footsteps of the Australian Open.				 																																	New York: Former US Olympic swimming coach James Doc Counsilman died aged 83 on Sunday in Bloomington, the Indiana University website reported. Considered as one of the best coaches in the sport, 60 of Counsilmans swimmers went on to be Olympians, including Mark Spitz, who claimed a record seven gold medals in the 1972 Munich Games.				 																																	He coached the 1964 and 1976 Olympic teams. During those Games, US swimmers captured 48 medals  17 gold, 18 silver and 13 bronze. He was inducted into the International Swimming and Diving Hall of Fame in 1976. 				 																																	Amsterdam: Former Dutch international Ruud Gullit will take over as head coach of Feyenoord from July 1, the Rotterdam club announced on Monday.				 																																	The Dutch first division club, currently fourth in the league, also appointed Willem II Tilburg coach Mark Wotte as technical manager. Wotte will start his new assignment immediately. I always wanted to work as coach for Feyenoord, said the 41-year-old Gullit, who was a former player with the side. The club still means something special for me.				 																																	Rome: Italian cycling coach Franco Ballerini will appear before magistrates next week to answer doping charges dating back to 1998, the year he won the Paris-Roubaix classic, La Gazzetta dello Sport said on Monday. Ballerini, two-times winner of the worlds most demanding one-day race, said he had nothing to fear from his court appearance on January 14 in Pistoia near Florence. I cant wait... to end this once and for all. I know I have nothing to worry about, Ballerini said.				 																																	Milan: Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi says the Italian champions are no longer interested in signing Lazios Serbian midfielder Dejan Stankovic. Stankovic, whose contract at Lazio ends in June, has been strongly linked with a mid-season move to Juventus or their rivals Inter. Moggi, responsible for Juves transfer policy  said he had informed Inter his club were no longer bidding  for the player.

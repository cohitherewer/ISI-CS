 Skippers play down incident 
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Lahore: The mind games were sure to be played in a series of such intensity and Mohammed Samis gesticulation to Yuvraj Singh during the Peshawar game was the talking point Saturday. Both skippers tried to play it down and Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle has issued no statement either.  Sami made an obscene gesture and few words were also exchanged when Yuvraj was going great guns during the slog overs. It was just a stray incident. Too much should not be read into it. Its good that the game is being fought hard with no yard surrendered, Sourav Ganguly said. Inzamam also dismissed it saying, it happened in the heat of the moment. Yuvraj also did not wish to read much into it. Its just part of the game. The passion is always great when India and Pakistan play. Its great fun and I enjoy the experience. The World Cup game was very special and you are always worked up to give your best, he said.  I played my natural game yesterday and was aiming to stay till the end, he said of his 65. Having played both Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar, Yuvraj felt that both were of the same mould. Both are equally fast, effective and of the same class. Having a bowler of such calibre in your team is always a big plus, he said.  Copyright

 Shoaib amp; Co. have forgotten how to use new ball: Sarfraz
 - Pak attack is 100 per cent better But Indian opening bowlers have a definite strategy  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  The likes of Mohammed Sami (left) and Shoaib Akhtar continue to follow in the paths of the Wasim Akrams in relying more on the old ball Rawalpindi: Sarfraz Nawaz may still be the most controversial character in Pakistan cricket, but when it comes to commitment and dedication, he is not loathe to extending a helping hand to the younger generation. He laments the Pakistan opening bowlers have forgotten how to use the new ball and says he is game to help them out if the need be. Waqar (Younis) and Wasim (Akram) had started this trend (of being more effective with the old ball) and it has been continuing. Pakistan win and lose a one-day game in the last 10 overs. They either score 100-odd runs and put the opposition under pressure or their bowlers call the shots, Sarfraz told The Telegraph. Shoaib Akhtar and Co. have forgotten how to use the new ball. They only rely on the old ball for reverse swing. Thats why they get clobbered so easily in the opening overs. If you see the statistics of Indo-Pak matches recently, the Indian batsmen have always prevailed in the first 15 overs. Whatever breakthroughs Pakistan have been able to make have come only in the middle or end overs, the former pacer explained. They have no idea on how to swing the new ball. The tendency is only to use pace to put the batsmen under pressure. The ploy cannot work at all times. Thats why Shoaib has never bowled more than four-five overs in his opening spell. The attack has thus become very predictable during this period and they need to work on variations, Sarfraz said. His suggestion is simple. Pakistan should learn to stick to line and length and shouldnt go flat out. Pace should be generated gradually. Why does Shoaib generate so much controversy with his action every time? Pat came Sarfrazs reply: Thats the handiwork of the foreigners who cannot withstand a coloured person being regarded as the fastest in the world. Comparing the two attacks in the current series, Sarfraz said: Pakistan bowling is hundred per cent better than India and this is a very big advantage. But the Indians have a definite strategy with the new ball, though it never worked today. Sarfraz felt the Indian attack was crippled after the Australian tour with three of their best performers  Anil Kumble, Ajit Agarkar and Harbhajan Singh  unable to make the trip because of injuries. The raw and inexperienced attack will be thus up against a more experienced batting line-up. But does he support the current state of bowlers getting clobbered and batsmen laughing away to glory in ODIs? If they continue to produce such pitches what can bowlers do? They have to rely on reverse swing but that can happen only with the old ball.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Strokeful 69 by Chris Gayle
 - FINAL TEST - West Indies off to a bright start  Gayle hit his 14th Test half-century St Johns: Chris Gayle hit a swashbuckling half-century on the first morning of the fourth and final Test as the West Indies reached 98 for two at lunch. Heavy rains prevented resumption of play after lunch. The West Indies, seeking to avoid a series whitewash against England, opted to bat first after Brian Lara had called correctly. Daren Ganga made a cautious start while Gayle looked for boundaries as and when the English new ball bowlers Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard presented an opportunity. The score moved to 33 when Ganga departed in the 13th over. The right-hander was adjudged leg-before off Andrew Flintoff after he had made 10 off 46 balls. Lara joined Gayle who continued playing his shots. The left-handed struck a dozen boundaries in 69  his 14th Test half-century  before falling to spinner Gareth Batty in the last over before lunch. Batty, lucky to be playing the Test, had Gayle caught-and-bowled with his second ball. Lara was unbeaten on 17 at lunch. England suffered a blow on the morning of the match as left-arm spinner Ashley Giles was ruled out of the final Test because of a stomach upset. Giles was replaced by Gareth Batty, who earned his fifth Test cap. Geraint Jones made his debut behind the stumps after Chris Read was dropped from the side which won the first three Tests. The West Indies included allrounder Ricardo Powell in their line-up. Powell, who has just one Test appearance to his name, replaces Shivnarine Chanderpaul who was dropped after suffering from fatigue. Powell won the battle with Dwayne Smith and Sylvester Joseph for the last remaining place. It is the only change from the side which lost the third Test in Barbados last weekend. England have already clinched the series 3-0. TEAMS West Indies: Brian Lara (captain), Chris Gayle, Daren Ganga, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Ricardo Powell, Ryan Hinds, Ridley Jacobs, Tino Best, Corey Collymore, Pedro Collins, Fidel Edwards. England: Michael Vaughan (captain), Marcus Trescothick, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Gareth Batty, Simon Jones, Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard.

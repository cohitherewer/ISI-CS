The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The opening-slot debate crops up again
 - Souravs decision on Yuvraj as good as sees Chopra out, but...  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Lahore: With regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly announcing in Calcutta that centurion Yuvraj Singh will play the third Test, in Rawalpindi, its more or less certain that Akash Chopra is going to be dropped. Specifically, Yuvraj will have to open with Virender Sehwag as Souravs return is going to close the middle-order. The three former India captains in the city, though, are divided on whether that really should be done. All were spoken to by The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon. While Chandu Borde didnt have an opinion  I need to give it some thought, Gundappa Viswanath expressed his reservations. Dilip Vengsarkar, however, isnt averse to Yuvraj opening. Borde and Viswanath have, by the way, chaired the national selection committee. Frankly, its a tricky question... Having said that, I would persist with Chopra... Dont forget he has been seeing off the new ball quite admirably... He did well in Australia and wasnt found wanting in Multan. One failure here shouldnt... is what Viswanath had to say. Vengsarkar, for his part, felt Yuvraj must regularly play Test cricket  as an opener, if so required. In fact, earlier this season, I saw him do that for Punjab against Delhi and he looked comfortable... Omitting Chopra is going to be sad, but I cant see Yuvraj not playing the next Test, he maintained. Significantly, chief selector Syed Kirmani pointed out he wouldnt recommend that Chopra be dropped. Talking exclusively, he said: Ive come as a guest and have no role as selection committee chairman. But, if the thinktank seeks my opinion, I wont recommend that Chopra be excluded. Hes a specialist who has done pretty well... Of course, the selectors didnt quite let it be known publicly, but Yuvraj is in the squad as back-up opener too. More important, Sourav is convinced he can deliver at the very top of the order.  Copyright

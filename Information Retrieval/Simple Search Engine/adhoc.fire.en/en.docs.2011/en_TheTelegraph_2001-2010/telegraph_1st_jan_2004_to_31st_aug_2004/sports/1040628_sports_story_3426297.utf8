 Isinbayeva mark
Gateshead: Russian Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own world pole vault record with a leap of 4.87m at a Grand Prix meeting on Sunday. Isinbayeva surpassed her previous best, a clearance of 4.86 at the world indoor championships in Budapest in March. The 22-year-old said the strong breeze had helped her.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

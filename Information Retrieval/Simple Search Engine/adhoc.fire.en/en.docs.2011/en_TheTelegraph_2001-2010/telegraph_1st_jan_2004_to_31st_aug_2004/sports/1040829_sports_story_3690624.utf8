The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Simi has to wait till December
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Simi Mehra was very near getting back her card at the Ladies PGA Tour. After the inspiring victory at the difficult Hunters Oak Futures Golf Classic course in Queenstown, Maryland last weekend, Simi was just another win away from making the cut. Only her left wrist gave way. Its probably a stress fracture. I got it while hitting on the last day of the Hunters Oak Futures Classic. Right now I am on my way to Orlando to get it checked by the doctor, the Calcutta pro told The Telegraph when contacted on her mobile. Her husband Chris was also travelling with her, as he has all through the year. Formerly a school teacher, Chris eventually quit to caddie for Simi. He also accompanied her during her remarkable win at Hunters Oak. Its really wonderful to have my husband with me all the time. Its of real help, Simi said. Simi has, therefore, missed the all-important tournament in Pennsylvania this week. She now needs to go back to Qualifying School to be held in Daytona in the first week of December. A top 20 finish there and she will make it back to the LPGA Tour. But its a lot of heartbreak right now. I was just getting back to the fold again. I was struggling quite a bit till the US Open where I sprained my ankle pulled the Achilles tendon on my left ankle. Right now I wish I could cut off the left part of my body! Maybe that would help. Today I feel really dejected, a sombre Simi said. The 32-year-old has won two events on the Futures Tour this season. The Frye Classic in Kansas was the first. But my win in Queenstown is really special because the course was very difficult there. It was a week-long event and there was a lot of rain too. But I led all the way and won by one stroke after hitting one under on the final day. For a moment, she sounded cheerful and enthusiastic. After pulling out of the Tour, Simi is now engrossed with Indias performance at the Olympics. I watched the womens 4x400m relay yesterday I hope they get a medal, she said, adding the effort itself is inspiring. She will make a trip back home in December, she promises. Just after Qualifying School. I hope I will give you the good news then, she trailed off.  Copyright

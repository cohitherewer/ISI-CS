The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thorpe wish-list
Sydney: Australian Ian Thorpe has virtually given up hope of winning seven gold medals at this years Athens Olympics and is planning to limit himself to six events. Thorpe has not finalised his programme for Athens but says he is no longer thinking about trying to match American Mark Spitzs record of seven Olympic golds. I doubt Ill be swimming seven, I really do, Thorpe said on Monday. He has been touted as the man most likely to equal Spitzs record haul from Munich in 1972 ever since he won three golds as a 17-year-old at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

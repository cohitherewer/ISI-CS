 PCB warns Shoaib not to play till fully fit
 Shoaib will consult a specialist in London Islamabad, May 18 (PTI): The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reminded Shoaib Akhtar of his priorities and asked him not to play for Durham unless he was absolutely fit. Chairman Shaharyar Khan also warned Shoaib that the PCB would be forced to review its position on allowing him to play in the English County championship if he did not pay heed to its advice. In separate letters to Shoaib and Durham, Shaharyar emphasised that the PCB did not want to see the bowler further aggravate his rib injury, a newspaper reported quoting PCB sources. Shoaibs first priority is to Pakistan cricket and he should be played in selective matches by the County or the PCB would review its position on allowing him to play in the County championship, Shaharyar was quoted as saying. Despite carrying a rib cage injury Shoaib has started playing for Durham soon after reaching England, he has written in the letter while asking the County to ensure proper medical attention is given to the pacer. In his letter to Shoaib, the PCB chief said he was surprised to learn that the bowler had started playing for Durham so soon. It meant that either Shoaib had made a miraculous recovery from his injury or else he had been forced to play with an injury because of his commitment to Durham, Shaharyar said in the letter. According to another report, Akhtar has decided to consult a specialist in London to cure his rib problem. I am feeling stiff and some pain in my side muscles due to the rib cage stress. After playing against Somerset and then Worcestershire on Sunday, the pain has increased, Shoaib was quoted as saying. I have also asked my County management to rest me for the four-day match against Glamorgan starting Monday and play me selectively for the rest of the season because of the rib problem, Shoaib said, obviously aware that the PCB had not liked the idea of his playing so soon. Pakistan have a lot of important commitments coming up this year and I dont want to risk missing any of them due to a serious injury. I will pace myself out for Durham from now onwards, he said. I have advised them (Durham) to look for a back-up player for the next match and also for the season because I want to take proper rest in between matches, Shoaib said. Haroon Rashid report Meanwhile, Pakistan team manager Haroon Rashid has submitted his report on the recent home series against India. He has advised the PCB not to take any hasty decisions against senior players in the team.  Copyright

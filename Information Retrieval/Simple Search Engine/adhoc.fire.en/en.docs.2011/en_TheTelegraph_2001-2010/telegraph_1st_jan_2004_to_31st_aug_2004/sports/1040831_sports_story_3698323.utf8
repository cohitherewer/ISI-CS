The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United held by Everton
 - European Round-Up
- Werder Bremen suffer first defeat of season  Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo in a battle for the ball with Evertons Tony Hibbert in their Premier League match on Monday. (Reuters) London: Manchester United were held on Monday to a 0-0 home draw by Everton, the club whose England striker Wayne Rooney they hope to sign before Tuesdays transfer deadline. United, whose latest offer for Rooney of an estimated 25 million ($44.92 million) is being considered by Everton, climbed to ninth in the Premier League standings with five points from four games. On Sunday, a first-half strike by Kevin Davies and some sterling defence earned Bolton Wanderers a 1-0 home win over a disjointed Liverpool, lifting them into third place on Sunday. Bolton have won three matches and lost one for nine points, three less than leaders Arsenal, who won 4-1 at Norwich City on Saturday, and Chelsea, 2-1 winners at home to Southampton. Liverpool, going down to their second successive defeat after losing 0-1 at home to Graz AK of Austria in the second leg of their Champions League qualifier in midweek, remain equal 10th on four points after three matches. Davies struck in a quick counter-attack in the 38th minute. Henrik Pedersen crossed low from the left, goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek failed to cut the ball out and it reached Davies beyond the far post, who shot right-footed into the net. Spanish debutant Luis Garcia steered what would have been a Liverpool equaliser past Dudek from a chip over the defence, but a goal was ruled out in an offside decision that looked dubious in television replays. In Germany, Bundesliga champions Werder Bremen suffered their first defeat of the season, a 1-2 loss to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday dropping them to third place in the table. After a patchy first half, Wolfsburgs Germany striker Thomas Brdaric scored immediately after the restart. Seven minutes later, Pablo Thiam won the ball close to halfway and set off on a solo run, holding off the Bremen defence to double Wolfsburgs lead with a powerful shot into the left corner. Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf brought on Greeces Euro 2004 player Angelos Haristeas but it was new signing Miroslav Klose, with his first goal for the club, who pulled one back for the hosts after the Wolfsburg defence left him clear in the penalty area. Elsewhere, a 29th-minute strike from Tomas Rosicky seemed to have ensured Borussia Dortmund victory until Per Mertesacker headed in a corner a minute into injury time for his first Bundesliga goal.

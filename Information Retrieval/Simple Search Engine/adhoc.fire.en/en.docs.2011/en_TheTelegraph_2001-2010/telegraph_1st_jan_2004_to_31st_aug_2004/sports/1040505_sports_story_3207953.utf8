 Zafar Iqbal slams IHF approach
 Dhanraj Pillay got a raw deal, feels Zafar New Delhi: Coming down heavily on the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) for excluding seniors like Dhanraj Pillay from the list of 30 Olympic hopefuls, former captain Zafar Iqbal said on Tuesday the federation should have shown a professional approach instead of giving them a raw deal. It (IHF) should be more professional in its approach. Everything should be transparent and one person should not dictate terms, said Zafar, a feared left-winger of his time. He was peeved at the way the IHF dealt with Pillay, Baljit Singh Dhillon and Baljit Saini, saying their shoddy treatment would send the wrong signal. If Pillay is saying he is fit, he should have been given a chance. He should have been named for the four-nation meet or the fitness camp where he could have proved whether he is fit enough to play or not. He should have been tested, Zafar said. The seniors certainly got a raw deal and their absence would be a jolt to the team. The IHFs job is to improve the standard of the game in the country. By doing such things, they are only sending the wrong signals, he said. If they do not want Pillay to play any more, they should tell him openly. They should be clear about what they want and not indulge in such negative tactics. I think there is more to his omission than what meets the eye, Zafar said. The former captain also ridiculed IHFs decision to continue experimenting with the national team despite the Olympics being just three months away. I dont think it has worked. We are yet to find a replacement for Jugraj Singh. Their attempt to find a schemer in place of Pillay also did not materialise. We must field a balanced side for the Olympics and such experiments are doing no good to our Olympic hopes. Zafar said he didnt see any justification behind the IHF decision to pick only those for the Olympics who can play for the entire duration of a match. No one plays for the entire 70 minutes. And for a forward, its just not possible. The amount of running a forward does in a match, if he can run for even 50 minutes its more than enough. With the game becoming so fast, if one can play for 25 minutes at a stretch, it should serve the purpose, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

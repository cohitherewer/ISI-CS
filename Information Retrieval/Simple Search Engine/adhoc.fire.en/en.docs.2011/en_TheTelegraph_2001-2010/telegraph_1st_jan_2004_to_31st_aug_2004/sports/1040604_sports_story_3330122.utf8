The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zico may have to revamp squad
 Zico will miss three key players Tokyo: Japan coach Zico returned tight-lipped after a memorable 1-1 away draw with England, as injury to Junichi Inamoto might force him to revamp the squad ahead of a World Cup qualifier against India. Inamoto, who broke his left shin in the friendly on Tuesday, was in a wheelchair as he landed with Zico and other Japanese internationals. I wish to concentrate on treatment, above all things, the 24-year-old midfielder said at Narita airport. He was scheduled to undergo a medical check-up at a hospital, possibly followed by surgery. An initial examination at a hospital in Manchester showed he might need three months to recover fully from the injury, the Japanese Football Association said. Not only will Inamoto miss Wednesdays home match against India, he is also ruled out of Japans Asian Cup defence in China next month. Zico left the airport without talking to newsmen while his aide said the Brazilian legend was wondering whether he should call up an additional player to fill in for Inamoto. Two other Europe-based stars, Bologna midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata and SV Hamburg striker Naohiro Takahara, have already been ruled out of the match against India in Saitama due to injuries.

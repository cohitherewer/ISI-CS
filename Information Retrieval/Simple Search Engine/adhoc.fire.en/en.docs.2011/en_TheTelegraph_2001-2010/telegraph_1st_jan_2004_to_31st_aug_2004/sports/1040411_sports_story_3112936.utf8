 Title for Chuang 
New Delhi: Top seed Chia-Jung Chuang of Chinese Taipei had no problems in packing off Jie Hao of China to win the $10,000 Bank of Baroda ITF womens championship on Saturday. The unseeded Chinese, who had a fever in the morning and was a doubtful starter, went down 3-6, 1-6 in just over an hour. The win made Chuang richer by $1600 and she collected six ranking points, while the runner-up took home a $1000 purse.  (PTI)  Copyright

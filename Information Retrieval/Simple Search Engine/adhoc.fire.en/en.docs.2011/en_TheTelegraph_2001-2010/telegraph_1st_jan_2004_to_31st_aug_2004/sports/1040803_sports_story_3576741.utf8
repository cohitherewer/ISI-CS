The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India must blame themselves
	 - Team management should have done its homework better  BY JAWAGAL SRINATH Indian captain Sourav Ganguly with wife Dona and daughter Sana at Chennai airport on Monday. (PTI)The defeat against hosts Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final on Sunday will give rise to many questions about the Indian team management. The think-thank will have to face the harsh realities. The Indian team that came back from the death on Tuesday was viewed as a resilient side only to be proved wrong on Sunday. While making an honest assessment about themselves, it is important to take into account the growing worthiness of Sri Lanka as well. Today, the Indian team must stand up to take the responsibility and accept the defeat. But the amendments the side would be doing in terms of chopping and changing have to be closely monitored. Any defeat would call for some drastic measures. There are experts who may come out with strong opinions. But one should not give too much importance to alarmists and rather look for positive solutions that would help the team do better. After the fall of Sangakkaras wicket, the hosts could manage only 70-odd runs for the last seven wickets. It indicates that the dropped catch of Sangakkara proved too costly for India. In any match, the policy of horses for the courses form the basis of selection. On a square turner at Premadasa, there was not much to differentiate between a regular off spinner like Harbhajan Singh and non-regulars such as Virender Sehwag or Sachin Tendulkar. The way Sachin bowled his leggies would have made Shane Warne watch him in awe. But it also leads to the debate whether excluding Anil Kumble was the right decision. Skipper Sourav Ganguly had somehow reposed more confidence in the combination of three seamers and one spinner. It works well in most parts of the world. But the last Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka provided ample evidence why India could have relied more on spinners. After all, the team calling the coin right always holds the advantage in these grounds. I think the team management should have done their homework better. Sundays match reminded me of the 1996 World Cup semi-final in Calcutta. We hoped to win as long as Sachin was there at the crease. Indian batsmen have only to blame themselves for the defeat. It only required a game of singles and twos to win the match. They should have realised that scoring shots would be dangerous on these tracks. The focus from ones and twos shifted to scoring shots owing to some acrobatic and agile fielding by the Lankans. Yuvraj and Kaif always come in at the crucial stages. They can do their job properly only if top order batsmen lay the right platform. Blaming Kaif for his dismissal is not the right way to assess his efforts. It is natural to see the positive aspects and ignore the blunders when the team wins. Similarly, a defeated team mostly fails to see the positives and gets too immersed in its own cup of woes. India must be serious about Balaji and proper care should be taken to improve his fragile confidence. The youngster should also learn from Pathans progress. And Sehwag, by now, must be doing some introspection about his own batting. (PTI)  Copyright

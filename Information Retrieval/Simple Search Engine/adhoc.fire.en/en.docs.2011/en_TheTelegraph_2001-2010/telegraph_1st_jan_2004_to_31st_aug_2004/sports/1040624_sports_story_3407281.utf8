 Pires wants change in strategy 
Santo Tirso: Midfielder Robert Pires proposed a radical change in Frances strategy on Tuesday ahead of the Euro 2004 quarter-final against surprise package Greece. Pires wants France to consider dropping deeper and hitting opposing teams on the counter-attack. The champions qualified top of group B thanks to two wins and a draw but they looked shaky in defence and struggled throughout against teams who suffocated French creativity. All our opponents are now playing the same way. They opt for a very defensive set-up with seven or eight players packed on their side of the pitch, said Pires. This leaves very little room for our strikers to show their skill. Of the seven goals France have scored in the tournament four have been from dead-ball situations. (Reuters)  Copyright

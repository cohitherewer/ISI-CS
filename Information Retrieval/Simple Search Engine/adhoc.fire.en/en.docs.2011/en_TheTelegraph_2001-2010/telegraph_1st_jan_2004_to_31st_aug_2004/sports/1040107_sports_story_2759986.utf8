 Safin to give up high life for tennis
 Marat Safin sets sights on world No. 1 ranking Perth: For larger-than-life Marat Safin, its crunch time. The Russians love of the high life is matched only by his love for tennis  but now he knows something must give. The tortured Tartar has realised it is time to calm down and move on if he is to fight his way back from an unflattering world number 77 to the number one spot his talent deserves. A frustrating year spent on the sidelines nursing injuries gave the 23-year-old plenty of time to reflect on a short career during which he has scaled the heights and scraped the barrel. Ive had a lot of time to think about my life, he said in Perth, revealing a new years resolution centred on shunning the spotlight and hitting the courts. I have a lot of people around me and I talked about everything, he said of those dark months where a series of injuries kept him out of the game in 2003. I had a lot of questions about my life, about my professional life and how I should do everything possible to get wherever I want to be. I had people direct me and give me some great advice. That sound advice has been a long time coming. One of the most exciting players in the world, the Russian has often suffered from less-than-sound advice as he has lurched round the circuit. His sublime demolition of Pete Sampras to win the US Open in 2001 was in stark contrast to the 2002 Australian Open final when Safin spent more time smiling at the group of blondies cheering him from his private box. That he lost to Thomas Johansson was no great shock, such were the distractions surrounding his camp for the fortnight. It was a disappointing way to mark his birthday. Not for the first time were questions asked about his commitment and level of effort in the match. In 2000, the youngster was fined by Australian Open officials for tanking  deliberately throwing a match or not trying his best against South African Grant Stafford in the first round. It was a shameful episode and one for which he apologised 12 months later. Concentration and keeping his head up has always been a problem  something he is coming to terms with. Im growing ... getting older, he said. Basically something has to change because it has been for many years a problem. I couldnt concentrate, I was getting frustrated during matches and was giving up many times in many matches. I have finally understood, at the age of 23, becoming 24, that is not the way I should treat myself on court. Because the match is still going I should at least try. Try and try and if its not working its no big deal. Thats one of my goals for the year. Certainly the Russian has set heady goals for himself. I decided to come back strong  I really want to be number one in the world at the end of the year. I really hope that I will be lucky in Australia. Im really looking forward to doing well. Im not talking about quarter finals, semi-finals ... I am talking about finals.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Anand faces Leko in semi-finals 
Dortmund: World No. 2 Viswanathan Anand will take on Peter Leko of Hungary in the semi-finals of the Dortmund Sparkassen chess tournament after a quick draw with Russian champion Peter Svidler helped the Indian to top his group at the end of the preliminary rounds. The semi-finals, which starts on Thursday after a rest day, will also see Svidler challenging world No. 3 Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the other semi-final. The rest of the players will battle it out for 5-8 places. Anand, who had already assured his semi berth, ended with a tally of four points from six games to top group A. Svidler, too, moved into the last four finishing just half a point behind the Indian Grandmaster. In third place was local hope Arkadij Naiditsch who defeated Aeroflot Open champion Sergei Rublevsky of Russia in the lone decisive game of the day under classical time control. As expected the fight for the semi-final spots in group B was stretched to the tie-break after another spate of draws. kramnik settled for the truce in just 20 moves with Leko while worlds youngest GM Sergey Karjakin got the same result against defending champion Viktor Bologan in 25 moves. Though there was not a single decisive game in the preliminaries in Kramniks group, the status quo was maintained as the Russian eventually finished on top with four points at the end of the tie-breaker.  Leko finished second with 3.5 points, Bologan third on 2.5 and Karjakin fourth on 2.0 points. Anand had little to do with black against Svidler as a draw suited both perfectly to move to the last four stage. For the record, both played out 19 moves of a closed Ruy Lopez before signing the peace treaty. Naiditschs first victory in the tournament came a little too late. Rublevsky again went for the Scotch opening and some reckless play enabled Naiditsch to gain the upper hand after some quick exchanges in the middle game. Rublevsky lost a couple of pawns and never recovered.  (PTI)  Copyright

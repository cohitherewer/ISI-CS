The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Age-bar has been raised
Athens: The older the violin, the sweeter the music. And the Athens Olympics is proving the lyrics right as Martina Navratilova, Merlene Ottey and company are demonstrating the endurance of women with middle-aged ladies defying perceptions about age and competition in nearly every sport. Athletics sprinting great Ottey, a 44-year-old Jamaican now running for her adopted country Slovenia, denies she keeps coming back for more punishment because she has no life outside the sport. I have got my fashion line and the other company, said Ottey, who labels another veteran Gail Devers, 37, as her toughest rival as she always beat me in dead heats, she just stuck her chest out better!. Devers beat Ottey to gold medals in two Olympics. However, I have a passion for the sport and can never stop running. The two-time world 200m champion has won 14 world championship and eight Olympic medals in six Games. Otteys first Olympic medal came with a bronze at 200m in the 1980 Moscow Games when she was running against the now discredited East Germans and Soviets. Navratilova, making her first appearance at the Olympics at 47, sticks up for her sex in typical fashion. We give birth, so right there we have to be pretty tough, says the outspoken Navratilova. Navratilova, who won 18 Grand Slam titles, is the oldest tennis Olympian ever. Two American competitors in Athens are 50 or older  shooter Libby Callahan (52) and archer Janet Dykman (50). Australia have their oldest Olympian ever in 57-year-old pistol shooter Annette Woodward, who has six children. Up to 44 per cent of the 10,500 Olympic athletes in Athens are women, and many are 30 and older. Some sports are used to grey-haired competitors. The average age in equestrian is 38. American Robert Dover, who has won three team bronze medals in successive games, is riding in his sixth Olympic dressage event at the age of 48. The bar has been raised for athletes, Navratilova said. Thirty is not the death knell anymore. The age is not 30 anymore. I think its 40. Andre Agassi is doing it. There are plenty of baseball players, even football players. So I think the bar has been raised for both men and women. Many athletes are doing things at an advanced age. Im just one of them.

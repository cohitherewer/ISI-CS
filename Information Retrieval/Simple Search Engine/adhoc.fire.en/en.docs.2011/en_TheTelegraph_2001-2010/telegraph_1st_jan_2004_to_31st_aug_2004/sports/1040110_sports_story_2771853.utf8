The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India go down to Pakistan
 - Azlan shah meet - Sohail Abbas hattrick gives arch-rivals revenge victory  Pakistans Shabbir Hussain tries to evade a challenge from Indias William Xalco during their match in Kuala Lumpur on Friday. Pakistan won 3-2. (Reuters) Kuala Lumpur: India failed to fulfil early promise and went down 2-3 to Pakistan in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here on Friday in a match that did not witness the customary passion and excitement. A hattrick by full-back Sohail Abbas (13th, 18th and 50th minutes) was the highlight of Pakistans success that came after a series of losses, including the finals of the Asia Cup and Afro-Asian Games, to their arch-rivals. The Indians, after taking a 2-1 lead, thanks to goals from Baljeet Singh Dhillon (13th) and rookie substitute Rajpal Singh (15th) failed to maintain the momentum and a series of midfield errors, compounded by a disjointed forward-line, denied them further success. It was Indias second straight defeat in the seven-nation tournament following the 1-3 loss to Germany Thursday, while Pakistan picked up their second set of full points, having defeated South Korea 4-2 in their opener. The Indians put in an eye-catching performance in the first-half as they matched the more experienced Pakistanis move for move. In fact, the Indians appeared far more decisive and dangerous when on the counter-attack, and with a little more combination among the forwards, they could well have come out on top. Pakistan got six penalty corners while India managed only one. Abbas came up with two good conversions, off the first (1-0) and sixth (2-2) to keep Pakistan afloat. When on the move, though, the Indians were quicker on the ball and Dhanraj Pillay led the attacks with rare inspiration and dash. It was his stunning acceleration after intercepting a pass by Waseem Ahmed that tore the Pakistani defence apart. The veteran made his way in from the right and essayed a flick. Goalkeeper Salman Ahmed parried the attempt and the next on the rebound by Sandeep Michael. However, Dhillon was at hand to hit home the third rebound to put India on level terms in the 15th minute. Three minutes later, young Rajpal Singh came in for Michael, and the substitution fetched quick dividends. Left-half Ignace Tirkey found Rajpal on the right with a brilliant diagonal ball. The forward, showing no signs of nevers, let fly an angular hit to give India a 2-1 lead. The Indians held sway thereafter until the final moments of the first half when they conceded a penalty corner. Full-back William Xalco deliberatey stopped the ball with his foot on top of the circle. Abbas found the net with a powerful drag-flick, leaving the game evenly poised 2-2 at the break. On change of ends, the Indians began strongly but then for some reason, their midfield play began to crumble. Past the 47th minute, linkman Prabhdeep Singh took a yellow card suspension after a foul on Adnan Masood. Reduced to 10 men, the Indians conceded their seventh penalty corner that Abbas brought to account with a neat conversion (3-2) in the 50th. Thereafter, the Pakistanis kept persisting, but goalkeeper Kamaldeep Singh brought off some good saves. The positives that India could look at was the good work of full-back William Xalco who yet again impressed in tackling and covering. Indian coach Harendra Singh said after the match penalty corners continued to be the bane of Indian hockey. Modern hockey is all about penalty corners, both taking and defending. All the six goals against India have come from conversions and I do agree that we need to work on defending penalty corners, he said. Skipper Pillay, endorsing this view, said of Abbas: Pakistan have the worlds best penalty corner specialist and today, he made all the difference. But I feel that this young Indian team has plenty of potential. There are about six youngsters in this team whom I feel can become top class players with some maturity that will come only from exposure and experience. Harendra, however, said Fridays defeat was no reflection on the Indian team. I thought we played extremely well in the first half and early in the second, he said. But we committed some errors in the midfield and again, conceded some soft penalty corner goals. Tirkey, who, apart from checking Butt, did the spadework for the second Indian goal, said: I have been playing against Rehan for sometime now. I have now understood his style of play. He tends to do the inside dodge and I was able to anticipate.  (PTI)  Copyright

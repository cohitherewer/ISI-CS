The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian duo begins in style
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi kicked off their Olympic preparations on an encouraging note at the Toronto Masters Series meet on Thursday. According to information received here, the eighth-seeded Indian pair overcame Argentines Gaston Etlis and Martin Rodriguez 6-3, 6-2 in the second round. Playing together on Tour for the first time since they paired at the Mallorca Open (in April 2002)  and won the title  Paes and Bhupathi had a rough time to begin with. Both were down 0-40 on their respective service games but fought their way out of trouble. They broke the Argentine pair in the eighth game for a 5-3 advantage and served out the set, but only after seeing off two more break-points. The second set was a breeze for the once-world No. 1 duo, as they raced to 4-0 before finishing off the match in 61 minutes and setting up a possible clash with top seeds Mike and Bob Bryan. It was by no means an easy draw for Paes and Bhupathi. Neither of them (with regular partners David Rikl and Max Mirnyi) had managed to defeat Etlis and Rodriguez, currently ranked No. 9 in the world, in their last four clashes. Paes and Bhupathi have now won their last 14 matches  five on Tour, five in Davis Cup and four at the Busan Asian Games.  Copyright

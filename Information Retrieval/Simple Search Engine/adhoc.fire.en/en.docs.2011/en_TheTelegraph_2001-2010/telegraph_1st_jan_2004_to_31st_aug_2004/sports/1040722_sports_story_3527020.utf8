 China close in on quarter final berth

(Reuters) Beijing: China closed in on a quarter final berth at the Asian Cup on Wednesday, the hosts destroying Indonesia 5-0 in a Beijing storm shower. Earlier, Qatar earned a controversial 1-1 draw with Gulf rivals Bahrain, a day after dismissing coach Philippe Troussier. Shao Jiayi capped a wonderful performance with two goals as China completely dominated the 200th match in Asian Cup finals history. A crowd of 48,000 braved the driving rain to roar on China, who were anxious to atone for a lacklustre 2-2 draw with Bahrain. China, who have never won the Asian Cup, have four points from two Group A games and need a draw with Qatar on Sunday to reach the quarter finals. Indonesia have three points after their upset 2-1 victory over Qatar, while Bahrain have two points. Qatar looked poised to spring an upset following Wesam Riziks 59th-minute penalty, awarded for a questionable foul on striker Seyd Bechir. Japanese referee Toru Kamikawa waved off furious penalty appeals from Bahrain players six minutes later when substitute Duaij Naser was clattered just inside the box. However, striker Mohamed Hubail salvaged a 1-1 draw for Gulf Cup runners-up Bahrain with a looping header a minute into injury time. In my opinion the penalty against us was not a penalty, shrugged Bahrain coach Srecko Juricic. The penalty claim we had should have been a penalty. We deserved this point.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

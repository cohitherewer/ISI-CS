The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians ready to extend domination
	 - SAF GAMES  The Indian soccer team trains in Islamabad on Monday, the formal opening day of the SAF Games. India face Pakistan on Tuesday. (AFP) Islamabad: Following the solid stamp of authority that Indian cricketers put in Multan on Monday, Indian athletes, too, are now ready to take on all Saarc nations from Tuesday. India are set to reassert their dominance in the SAF Games pool, the volleyball competition, badminton, and the shooting competition. India, having an unquestioned hegemony in the swimming competitions, will field with relatively junior talents, particularly the mens section. But they have outstanding achievements to their credit at this level. Fina has said this competition here could be considered as an Olympic qualifier and has stipulated qualifying time for each event. This provides another stepping stone for Indian swimmers. Sikha Tandon (50m and 100m freestyle) remains the lone Indian to have achieved the Olympic qualification norm. She is not taking pat in these Games. Sujith Thangappan, Amar Muralidharan and Arjun Muralidharan are the three experienced swimmers in the mens section, while in the womens section Richa Mishra and Sumi Cyriac will be watched. At the last Games Indian swimmers claimed 26 of the 30 golds medals and 11 silvers and two bronze medals. In football, India take on Pakistan on Tuesday. Indian spikers are the defending champions. They take on Afghanistan in the opening match at the Liaquat Gymnasium Tuesday, and that should be a cakewalk. Former All-England champion Pullela Gopichand and national womens champion Aparna Popat arent there, but the rest, too are good enough in the badminton event. Abhinn Shyam Gupta is top-ranked and national champion Chetan Anand adds punch. Young Trupti Murgunde and the experienced B. R. Meenakshi are also strong among women. Even the shooters are favourites. The events will be held from Tuesday at the Pakistan Army shooting range. Meanwhile, the thrice-postponed meet finally became a reality on Monday with President Pervez Musharraf turning out to be the surprise chief guest at a colourful opening ceremony at the Jinnah Stadium. The organisers had said earlier that the Games would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali. But they later clarified that Jamalis name was used as a camouflage to provide security for the President who has escaped three attacks on his life. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick in a fix, again
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IFA has sent a letter to East Bengal asking the club to explain the reason behind the misbehaviour of their coach Subhas Bhowmick with a ball boy during their NFL match against JCT last week. It was learnt that Friends of the Stadium, who supply the ball boys for the NFL matches, have taken strong exception to Bhowmicks behaviour and wrote to the IFA pleading for proper action. This can go against the coach in the governing body meeting of the IFA on March 30, where he has been asked to appear following a letter from East Bengal to reduce his two-year ban. Meanwhile, Bengal referee Subrata Sarkar will officiate in the Iran versus Qatar pre-World Cup match in Iran next month.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Newcastle, Liverpool held
London: Newcastle United missed the chance to strengthen their grip on fourth place in the Premier League on Sunday when they were held 1-1 at relegation-threatened Portsmouth. With Liverpool, one of Newcastles main rivals for the final Champions League spot, drawing 2-2 at Leeds earlier, Newcastle seemed on course to widen the gap after Craig Bellamys 34th-minute effort. But Lomana LuaLua pounced in the 89th minute to volley an equaliser and secure a precious point for the south coast club to lift them out of the relegation zone. Newcastle remain in fourth place on 42 points, 16 behind Manchester United but two ahead of Charlton Athletic and three more than Liverpool. Harry Kewell put Liverpool in front against his old club in a thrilling draw at Elland Road after 21 minutes. Goals from Eirik Bakke and Mark Viduka turned the game on its head before Czech striker Milan Baros equalised shortly before the end of a pulsating first half. Alan Smith hit the crossbar late on for Leeds but they remain bottom of the table with 22 points, one behind Leicester City. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India are favourites: Srikkanth
Chennai: Former captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth Tuesday said India have the wherewithal to beat Pakistan in the upcoming one-day and Test series. Were definitely the favourites to win both the series. We have the wherewithal to do so as both batsmen and bowlers are at a higher confidence level having proved themselves very well on the Australian tour, Srikkanth, who was the captain when India last played a full-fledged series in Pakistan in 1989, said. Srikkanth believes that despite the hectic tour of Australia, India can continue in the same vein against Pakistan, who would be keen to emerge victorious at home. If I was playing now, I would have definitely required rest to get mentally prepared for a tour like this to Pakistan. The Indians have just completed the tri-series finals. But they have the commitment and are responsible enough to keep themselves fit. Definitely Pakistan is not a great team, especially after the retirements of Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. But they have the capability to build up playing on home soil, he said. If Pakistan are known for their pace-strength, Srikkanth feels India also have quality fast bowlers to test their batting. I hope Zaheer and others would be fit for the Test series. Now we have enough fast bowling strength. Irfan Pathan is our newest talent and Balaji has also proved his worth.  (PTI)  Copyright

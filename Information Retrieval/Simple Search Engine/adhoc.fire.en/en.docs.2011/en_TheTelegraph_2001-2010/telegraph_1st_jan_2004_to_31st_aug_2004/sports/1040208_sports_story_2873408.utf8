The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India lose 1-2 to Holland
 Vikram Pillay tackles a challenge from Karel Klaver in Hyderabad on Saturday. (AFP) Hyderabad, Feb. 7 (PTI): India failed to carry on the good work from the first Test versus Holland, losing 1-2 in the second Test of the Naval Tata Memorial Trophy here Saturday. Holland went ahead through two penalty corner conversions. In the fourth minute Bram Lomans drew first blood, before Taeke Taekema slotted home the second in the 50th minute. India had got and wasted one penalty corner, but the second penalty corner, created by Baljit Singh Dhillon in the 54th minute, was also converted by him with a fine drag-flick. While the Holland team seemed to have found their groove, the Indians semed to missing Prabhjot Singh and Deepak Thakur. Gagan Ajit Singh was pretty off-colour Saturday and was also well-marked. Dhillon was the pick of the Indian side. Apart from the goal he had two other good tries. One excellent hit was brilliant saved by the Dutch goalkeeper.  Copyright

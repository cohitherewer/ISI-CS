 Crowd trouble at Millwall 
London: Crowd trouble marred an English first division match between Millwall and West Ham United on Sunday. Mounted police were needed to restore order at Millwalls New Den stadium as trouble flared in the second half of the crucial promotion battle between the London rivals. According to BBC radio, West Ham fans tried to invade the pitch when Millwall, leading 3-1, were awarded a penalty and West Ham goalkeeper Stephen Bywater was sent off. The match had attracted a massive security operation, with a reported 1,000 police officers on duty in and around the stadium close by the River Thames. FA Cup semi-finalists Millwall won the game 4-1 to boost their chances of reaching the promotion playoffs. The south London club is now seventh in the table with 59 points, level with Sunderland and Ipswich and just one behind fifth-placed West Ham with two games in hand. Norwich and West Brom-wich Albion occupy the automatic promotion places with 70 points. On Saturday, Crystal Palace beat Norwich 1-0, while Derby defeated Nottingham Forrest 4-2. Sunderland got the better of Reading 2-0, while Sheffield United beat Bradford by the same margin. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Honour for IG Azad
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Yashovardhan Azad Lahore: Assignment almost over, IG Yashovardhan Azad has been busy packing the many mementoes gifted by some of the highest-ranked police officers in Pakistan. However, when Team Indias chief security liaison officer leaves on Thursday, the memory he will treasure most is being invited by the IG, Punjab (Syed Masud Shah), to address the gazetted officers here on Tuesday  incidentally, Pakistan Day. I felt honoured... It was quite a gesture and an extraordinary experience, Azad told The Telegraph. The invitation included lunch at the Police Lines. Azad, a joint director with the Intelligence Bureau (IB) back home, is leaving, as he is required in the lead-up to the general elections from next month. Manoj Lal, who too has been with Sourav Ganguly and Co. from the beginning, also leaves the same day. Their replacements, by the way, have already arrived. While (IB) DIG Dharmendra Kumar is going to step into Azads shoes, Lals colleague in the Delhi Police, Prabhakar, will function as the No.2. Security officers accompanying Team India is, of course, a first.  Copyright

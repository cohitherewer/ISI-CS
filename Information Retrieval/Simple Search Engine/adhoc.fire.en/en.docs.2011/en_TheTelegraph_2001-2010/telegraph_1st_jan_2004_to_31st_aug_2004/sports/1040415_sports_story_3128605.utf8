The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I dont know how Lara did it: Smith
Durban: Graeme Smith says West Indies captain Brian Lara had set a benchmark for other batsmen with his world record Test score of 400 not out. Thats something for all of us to aim at now. It must have helped him that hed already been to 375 before when he set the record for the first time, said Smith who was recently named among Wisdens five cricketers of the year. In the process, Smith reclaimed the world record from Australian Matthew Hayden who had bettered the West Indians 375 with a 380 against Zimbabwe in Perth early this season. Smith described Laras knock as absolutely brilliant. Its a helluva long way from nought to 400, said the 23-year old who scored back-to-back double tons in England last summer. I dont know how he did it. I know how buggered I was after the double centuries. Its just amazing how he managed to keep himself going mentally and physically.  (PTI)  Copyright

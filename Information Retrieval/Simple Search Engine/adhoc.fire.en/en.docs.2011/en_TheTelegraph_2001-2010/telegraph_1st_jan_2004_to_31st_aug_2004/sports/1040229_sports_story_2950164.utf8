The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, February 29, 2004  Errols five floors jackpot hunters 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta, Feb. 28: Trainer Errol Bhungard ruled the roost at the RCTC ground today when he led in five less-fancied winners in a card of eight events. His tally also included a friendless Dashing Chief who easily won 1,600m Governors Cup, the star attraction in the card. Had his course-favourite Autumn Fantasy not lost narrowly to an outsider Capistrano, in the third leg jackpot, Errol would have had a winner in the each leg of the pool. With favourites falling like nine pins, the 70 per cent of the pool remained unsolved.RESULTS				 										1.

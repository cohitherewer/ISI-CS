The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal 30th with 5-under round
	 - Daily clinches play-off for first PGA Tour title in nine years John Daly shows off his trophy to son Austin after winning the Buick Invitational in San Diego on Sunday San Diego: Arjun Atwal has done it again. A slow start, an acceleration in Round II, a hurdle in Round III, and a smacking five-under final round that saw him finish a joint 30th  his second best on the US PGA Tour  on Sunday in the $4.5 million Buick Invitational meet here. John Daly won the championship when he birdied the first play-off hole to edge out Chris Riley and Britains Luke Donald and seize his first PGA Tour victory for nearly nine years. The Calcutta pro aggregated 285 on a fine day where he birdied five holes and shot an eagle on the par-5 18th. Atwal brought in the final days best card, along with Phil Mickelson. The Indian picked up a cheque for $28,525.71. That took his total earning on the Tour so far to $ 95,414 and Atwal is now a high 77th on the money list. Atwal finished with Sergio Garcia, Danny Ellis, Joey Sindelar, Tommy Tolles and Jonathan Kaye. Starting on the tenth, Atwal hit two consecutive birdies to warm up. He showed that he had finally taken stock of the course with a further birdie, on the 13th before hitting his trademark bogey on the 15th. On this day, though, these hurdles seemed too insignificant for Atwal and he went into top gear with his eagle hole. The second hole was birdied and the fourth-hole bogey apart, the end was the fifth hole birdie. All three top competitors finished 72 holes on 10-under-par 278. Riley (69) and Donald (69) birdied the 18th in regulation play while Daly could only muster a par as he carded a closing three-over 75. The trio then played the 18th again in the play-off and Daly came out on top when he splashed out to six inches from a greenside bunker and tapped in for a birdie four. Donald missed his birdie putt while Rileys attempt at a four lipped out. Daly, 37, earned $ 864,000 for his first PGA Tour win since the 1995 British Open. Mickelson, Bo Van Pelt, Duffy Waldorf, Swede Jesper Parnevik, Japanese Shigeki Maruyama and Dane Thomas Bjorn finished in a tie for fourth place on 279. World No. 1 and defending champion Tiger Woods was in a group of six players back on 280. Woods was in contention when he reached nine-under through 10 holes but he gave a shot back and eventually tied for 10th, his worst finish in seven appearances in this event. Its a wonderful feeling to win again, Daly said. It was just the sweetest victory because its been a long, long time coming. Ive won two majors, nothing can take that away, but Ive never won a tournament with Tiger in the field.  Daly had history on his side going into the final round. When leading after 54 holes, he had won three of four tournaments. But after his tee shot on the par-three third found a hazard, Daly trailed Stewart Cink by one stroke. He regained the lead as Cink bogeyed three of the next four holes and Daly produced his only birdie of the round at the sixth. The most dramatic stroke of the day came when faced with a 96-foot bunker shot on the play-off hole, Daly nestled the ball to within six inches of the cup. Donald and Riley missed six-footers for birdie that would have continued the play-off.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

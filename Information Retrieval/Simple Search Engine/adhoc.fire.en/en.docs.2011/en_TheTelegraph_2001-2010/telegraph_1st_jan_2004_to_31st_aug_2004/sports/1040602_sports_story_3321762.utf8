 Vaughan declares himself fit
 Vaughan says hell be going in 100 per cent fit London: England captain Michael Vaughan declared himself fit for Thursdays second Test against New Zealand after his suspect knee came through unscathed in a county match Monday. Yorkshire batsman Vaughan missed Englands seven-wicket first Test win at Lords after injuring his left knee in the nets. But Monday he played for Yorkshire in their one-day league match away to Scotland, scoring 32 off 62 balls before being run out. Yorkshire won the match at the Grange by 59 runs and afterwards Vaughan said of his knee: Its fine. I trained pretty hard last week and the rehab went pretty well. Plus I have come through a good game of cricket which was a good test. I never say there is no trouble with my knee because I have had dodgy knees for a few years now, added Vaughan ahead of the second Test at Headingley. But what happened at Lords was just bad luck and Im hoping it never happens again. Im going into the game on Thursday one hundred per cent fit. Vaughans place at Lords was taken by Middlesex captain Andrew Strauss who marked his Test debut by scoring 112 and 83. Strauss also filled Vaughans opening spot and there had been speculation about where the captain would bat on his return. However, Vaughan told Sky Sports earlier Monday he was ready to return to number four, where he began his Test career, and leave Strauss at the top of the order.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dream come true for Dinesh Karthik
Chennai: Getting a senior national team call-up is a dream come true for Dinesh Karthik. The wicketkeeper-batsman is in the squads for the Amstelveen tri-series, three-match ODI series versus England and the ICC Champions Trophy. Im not worried whether I will get to keep wickets. I am eager to play to my potential right from the first chance and the rest will not bother me, the 19-year-old said on his return from Zimbabwe. Both Karthik and Rohan Gavaskar were in Zimbabwe with the India A squad when they got picked for the senior team. Gavaskar, though, missed out on the Champions Trophy as only 14 got picked. Asked whether he was disheartened by captain Sourav Gangulys comment that Rahul Dravid would continue keeping wickets in ODIs, Karthik said: I am not bothered about such things. I will continue to obey my captain and respect decisions of the team manmagement. Karthik, who has made giant strides during the last couple of seasons with hundreds in the Ranji semi-final and final, is the fifth wicketkeeper to make the India ranks from Tamil Nadu. The previous four were S.V.T. Chari, M. Srinivasan, T.V. Parthasarathy and Bharat Reddy.  Rayudu for Badani Meanwhile, Ambati Rayudu of Hyderabad will replace Hemang Badani in the India A squad for the tri-series in Kenya, BCCI secretary said in Mumbai. Badani suffered an ankle injury in Zimbabwe. The tri-series in Kenya also involves Pakistan A and the Kenya national team. The meet kicks off on Wednesday.  (PTI)  Copyright

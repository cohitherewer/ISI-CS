The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Das Gupta manager
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Goutam Das Gupta, a member of the Cricket Association of Bengal trustee board, has been appointed Team India manager for the forthcoming tri-series in Holland and the NatWest Challenge in England. The manager for the September 10-25 Champions Trophy (again in England), though, is going to be named at a later date. According to The Telegraphs sources, Das Gupta would probably have stayed on had the build-up to the Boards AGM not coincided with the high-profile meet. Das Gupta, of course, has been manager before  among his bigger appointments being to the West Indies in 2001-02.  Copyright

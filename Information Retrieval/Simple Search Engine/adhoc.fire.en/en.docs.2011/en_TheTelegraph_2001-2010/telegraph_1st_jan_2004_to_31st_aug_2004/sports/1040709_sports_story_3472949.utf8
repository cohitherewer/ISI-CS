The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another match rained off 
London, July 8 (Reuters): Play in the rain-delayed one-day triangular series match between New Zealand and the West Indies at Southampton on Thursday was abandoned due to poor weather. It is the third match of the series to be declared a no result after rain completely washed out the first match between England and New Zealand in Manchester on June 24 and severely affected the second between New Zealand and the West Indies in Birmingham two days later. New Zealand and the West Indies had already qualified for Saturdays final at Lords.  Copyright

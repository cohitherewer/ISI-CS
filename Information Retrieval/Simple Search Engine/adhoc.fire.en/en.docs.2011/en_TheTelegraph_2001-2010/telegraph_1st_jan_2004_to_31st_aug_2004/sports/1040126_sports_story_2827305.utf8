 Jayasuriya expects tough ones from Aussies
 Jayasuriya is taking one series at a time Colombo: Sri Lankas hard-hitting opening batsman Sanath Jayasuriya has a lot of homework to do ahead of next months home series against Australia. The Aussies will have a plan for each of us and I feel we need to practice more, Jayasuriya said in the Sunday Island newspaper. Personally I need to do a lot of homework. They will not give any room at all for me and bowl as straight as possible. Australia will play three Tests and five ODIs in Sri Lanka. The left-handed opening batsman admitted he is nearing the end of his career and has decided to take it one series at a time. I wanted to finish off the English series well and that happened, and Im now looking forward to the Aussie series, he said. You cant think of a long future. You set goals for a series and try to achieve them. But he said he saw no point in prolonging his career if he could not produce his best. If I am unable to give 100 per cent I dont see the point in continuing, said Jayasuriya, who turns 35 this year. Ill always be prepared to go before someone reminds me to. Jayasuriya has scored 5258 runs in 83 Test matches at 41. He has amassed 9,172 runs in 308 ODIs and taken 251 wickets with his left-arm spin bowling. Jayasuriya led Sri Lanka in 38 Test matches and won 18. He has also won 66 of the 118 ODIs in which he lead Sri Lanka. (AP)  Copyright

 Tennis the cleanest sport: Agassi
 Andre Agassi at a press conference in Melbourne on Tuesday Melbourne: Tennis is one of the worlds cleanest sports in terms of drug abuse  if not the cleanest, Andre Agassi said on Tuesday. The spotlight in Sydney has been on Greg Rusedski after the Britons admission last week that he had tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. But Agassi told reporters ahead of an invitational tournament in Kooyong that he is convinced tennis does not have a problem with doping. Well, one of the things we can say for sure is our sport is the leading, if not the top, sport in drug testing in both its intensity as far as what they test for. Its a very extensive list, probably more extensive than any other sport, and how often they test. Last year I played 13 tournaments. I was tested (via a) urine sample 11 times, I was tested (via a) blood sample eight times, which includes three out of competition testings. Its not possible to get more aggressive with the goal of maintaining the integrity of our sport, he added. Rusedski last week admitted he tested positive during the RCA Championships in Indianapolis last July but said he would be cleared of any wrongdoing at a hearing in February. World number four Agassi applauded Rusedski and the ATPs efforts to get to the bottom of the issue. We need to get to the bottom of something thats crucial to our integrity and thats going to require everybody accepting responsibility and its going to require keeping useless... and irresponsible quotes out of the headlines. I cant speak for his (Rusedskis) situation because I dont know it. Again, I think that the right thing to do for Greg, as well as the governing bodies, is to be responsible and diligent in their efforts to get to the bottom of it. World No. 1 Andy Roddick, who is also playing in the Kooyong Classic that starts on Wednesday, agreed. As Andre said earlier, we are tested very regularly and for an extremely extensive list of things so I feel like if Im playing someone and they havent been caught, that its a very fair match.

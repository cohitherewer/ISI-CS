The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Defence a worry for EB 
 - AFC CUP tie vs negeri sembilan - Sureshs absence bothers coach before leaving for Malaysia  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Chandan Das, Cristiano Junior and Bhaichung Bhutia practise at the club ground on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick feels M. Sureshs absence in the AFC Cup match against Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia will be tough to overcome. The central defender was injured during their National Football League tie against Churchill Brothers in Goa last Sunday. Sureshs absence is a big blow. He has been the most consistent over the last two years. Its sad that he had to be injured at this time. Looking back, I also feel guilty for fielding him. He had told me that he was not feeling well Bhowmick recounted. Douglas da Silva has a visa problem and officials are trying to sort it out in time. East Bengal, who have already qualified for the quarter finals from group E, will top the group even if they draw with Negeri on Tuesday. The team leaves on Saturday night. Suresh apart, midfielder Subhas Chakraborty is also injured. I hope Mahesh Gawli is back in time, Bhowmick hoped. It will, however, be the last time Gawli be donning the red-and-golden colours. The defender has decided to go back to native Goa next season because of family commitments. This does not imply that Bhowmick is on the back foot. Weve to keep the good work going. We have to approach the game in a positive frame of mind. Other things will then fall into place. It matters very little if we are playing at home or away, the coach said. If we have the opportunity to top the group, why finish second? East Bengal had won the home tie 4-2. His evaluation of Negeri was also straightforward. They are a good attacking side but nothing extraordinary. We have played against such attacking oppositions in India. There cannot be any dramatic change in their approach or performance because they cannot recruit any new foreigner at this point. The Negeri tie will be Bhowmicks last engagement this season before he takes a break to the United States. It was also time for him to reflect on the 0-1 loss to Churchill in the NFL. I lost three players to injuries in the first ten minutes of the match. Still we could have drawn the tie. The strength of this side lies in the fact that despite the loss we managed to stage a comeback within a couple of days and defeat Haywards Sporting in the final game. Bhowmick informed that at an informal meeting with AIFF secretary Albert Colaco in Goa, he had proposed a eight-team three-tier NFL from next season.  Copyright

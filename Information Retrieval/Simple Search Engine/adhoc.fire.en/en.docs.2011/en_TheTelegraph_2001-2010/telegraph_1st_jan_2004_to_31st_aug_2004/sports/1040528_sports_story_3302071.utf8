The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Limited options restrict Latvia
Riga: Surprise Euro 2004 qualifiers Latvia are trying to make the most of a tight budget and avoid injuries among their small squad ahead of next months finals, soccer federation president Janis Mezeckis said on Thursday. He added that coach Aleksandrs Starkovs  hailed as a guru for guiding the small nation of 2.3 million to its first major finals  had complete control of the build-up to Euro 2004 but said costs and the fear of injuries restricted the team. We must be very careful both mentally and physically, he said. We dont have as many players to choose from as France or Germany, so every injury is a problem for us. Southampton striker Marian Pahars, Viborg midfielder Imants Bleidelis and Skonto Riga defender Olegs Blagonadezdins are all struggling with injuries but are expected to be ready when the finals kick off on June 12. Pahars, who has a groin problem, will train with the squad next week after undergoing a personal rehabilitation programme to try and shrug off the injury but may start on the bench in Portugal after missing most of last season through injuries. Bleidelis pulled a muscle during Latvias goalless draw in a home friendly against Iceland in April, while Blagonadezdins has a minor injury and should be fit in a couple of days. Latvia will only play a home friendly against Azerbaijan on June 6 before travelling to Portugal and Mezeckis said the reason was partly a question of money in a country where ice hockey is king and football has been a distant second until now. Its very difficult to arrange friendlies against bigger teams because they have very long schedules planned and they are always asking for money, he said. A planned pre-tournament friendly against the United States was cancelled earlier this year due to the costs involved. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Lee to miss Zimbabwe 
Melbourne: Australias fastest bowler Brett Lee will have ankle surgery on Tuesday and will miss the two-Test tour of Zimbabwe in May. Lee was sent home from Sri Lanka after breaking down with a sore ankle before the first Test earlier this month. The 27-year-old will have surgery on his left ankle at a Sydney hospital, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement on Sunday. Lee will then undergo a lengthy rehabilitation process and it is not yet known how long he will be sidelined, CA said. Lee said in the CA statement: Obviously, I have been bowling with some discomfort for a little while now and, despite receiving plenty of treatment on the ankle, it was still causing me some trouble. Whilst its disappointing not to be playing right now, I need to make sure the ankle is right so that I can look to be playing in the longer term rather than trying to apply a short-term fix. After the operation, I will be doing everything I can with rehabilitation to get back to 100 per cent fitness.  (Reuters)  Copyright

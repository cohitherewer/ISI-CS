 Reverse swing may not be a mystery to India
 BY RASHID LATIF  Sachin, of course, is a genius There is a worry in the Pakistan camp that Indians might not be susceptible to reverse swing. The way they played in Australia it was apparent they knew what the ball would do. It might still be a mystery for teams like England and South Africa, but that doesnt seem the case with Indians. We in Pakistan are very good in caring for the ball. We make sure that at least one side of the ball retains its shine. After 30-40 overs, the dry conditions of our sub-continent help the ball to reverse swing. When Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis operated, we tried our best to ensure the ball didnt get wet or too much of sweat was not applied on it. I remember the Old Trafford Test of 2001 when sweat on the hands of Saqlain Mushtaq didnt allow the ball to dry up enough. Saqlain usually sweats a lot. In order to counter it, and to make sure our fast bowlers got their way, he used to apply a cream to keep his hands dry. These days I am speaking a lot to Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami, who incidentally is from my academy, about the plans they should hatch against the Indian batsmen. Most of the Indian batsmen are greats, but everyone has faults. As a coach, you must look at the current fault of batsmen. Sachin Tendulkar, for instance, does not have a long stride forward and to any delivery which comes in quickly from a good length spot he tends to inside-edge on to his stumps. Tendulkar, of course, is a genius and I would never forget his double century in Sydney. He had been dismissed a few times driving on the off-side. He cleverly took the centre rather than the off-stump guard. It allowed him to walk on to his off-stump and any deliveries pitched on the middle and leg were worked on the onside beautifully. He did the same against us during the World Cup. I had got injured and was not there when the Indians batted, but if I were there, I would have never let Shoaib Akhtar take the new ball It should have been Waqar with the new ball. Shoaib should have bowled with the old ball. Tendulkar settled that match in the first 10 overs itself. Now, of course, it would be Shoaib to start our operations. He is the fastest bowler in the world and he now also has good focus. I have been telling him to avoid verbal intimidation and rather let his deeds do the talking. Lets admit, Shoaib is the glamour boy of international cricket. He knows when he is on the field, everyone expects him to strike all the time. Sami is not as quick as Shoaib but in terms of consistent speed, he perhaps is the best in Pakistan. He regularly bowls in excess of 145 kmph. He is very quick off the pitch. He can also indulge in verbal intimidation, actually lot of young bowlers do it as we saw Irfan Pathan and Brad Williams indulge in it in Australia. Shoaib does not do much talking but he has his own mannerisms and style. Shabbir Ahmed restricts his menace to his pace alone. He is back from his correctives in Australia and he has pace and bounce which he extracts from his unusual height. The good thing with these three Ss is that all are different and bring their own sets of problems for batsmen. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan is a youngster who made his debut under my captaincy in Sharjah but was dropped for Sri Lanka, because of which I had a showdown with Aamer Sohail, the then chairman of selectors. He is a very decent prospect, his pace is better than that of Abdul Razzaq and Azhar Mahmood and he is a very good exponent of reverse swing. He is also a very good batsman. All these fast bowlers would be aggressive but then they must not sacrifice control. Thats how you build pressure on batsmen. Indian batsmen are good enough to plunder loose bowling. Also, let us not presume that all the pressure is on the Indian team. If anything, the members of Pakistan team would face stiffer pressure. You walk on to the field, go out with friends, talk to friends or relatives, theres this constant pleading for you to do well in the series. When you are touring, you have less pressure.

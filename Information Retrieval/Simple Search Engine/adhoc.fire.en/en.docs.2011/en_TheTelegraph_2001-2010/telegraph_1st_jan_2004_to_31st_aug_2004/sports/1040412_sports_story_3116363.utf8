The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe tour is on, says ECB
London: England will go ahead with their controversial tour of Zimbabwe later this year, according to their senior administrator, amid growing fears that cancellation would prove financially ruinous. ECB officials had previously hinted they would boycott the trip in protest at the policies of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. But ECB chairman David Morgan, announcing their latest U-turn on Zimbabwe, told British broadsheet The Independent Saturday.  The only way that I can see us not fulfilling the tour is either because of government directive or because of safety and security. And let me emphasise we dont see them as being issues at the moment, he added. Zimbabwe Cricket Union chairman Peter Chingoka said in Harare he was obviously delighted that England had decided to go ahead with the tour. The ECBs board is due to discuss the tour at an April 20 meeting at their Lords headquarters to which three ZCU officials, including Chingoka, have also been invited. Under new sanctions agreed at an International Cricket Council (ICC) board meeting in Auckland earlier last month, England risk a $ 2 million fine if they fail to tour Zimbabwe as scheduled in October. They could also lose their lucrative status as hosts of Septembers ICC Champions Trophy one-day tournament.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Dont relax, Kiri urges players
Bangalore: Like the rest of the nation, S.M.H. Kirmani was overjoyed at the Indian success in the Multan Test. But the chairman of the selection committee cautioned the team against complacency and urged the players to continue exerting pressure on Pakistan in the next two Tests. Its a historic win for India. Simply glorious, the former India stumper said, adding that the Indians had the upperhand from the beginning. Kirmani singled out Anil Kumble and Irfan Pathan for special praise. Pathan has been improving with every game. We have got a wonderful bowler in the form of Pathan. Thats good news for the Indian team, he remarked. In the next breath, though, he had a word of caution. Keep up the intensity till the end, dont get complacent, was his advice for Rahul Dravid amp; Co. Not very far away, at their Indiranagar residence, stand-in captain Dravids parents were celebrating in their own way. Sharad Dravid kept pointing out it was a team effort. I am very, very happy. I expected the team to do well, and they did just that. A win against Pakistan is great. Mother Pushpa said: It was great... I am happy they made all Indians feel proud. Kiran More, another former wicketkeeper and now a national selector, said the dominant Indian batting, especially by Virender Sehwag, had killed the morale of the Pakistan team. It was an outstanding performance. Our batting was very impressive and it killed the rivals morale and they just could not come back into the game, More said from Vadodara. In Indore, veteran Test cricketer Mushtaq Ali said the credit for the historic win should go to the entire team and also the efforts of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in restoring cricketing ties between the two nations.

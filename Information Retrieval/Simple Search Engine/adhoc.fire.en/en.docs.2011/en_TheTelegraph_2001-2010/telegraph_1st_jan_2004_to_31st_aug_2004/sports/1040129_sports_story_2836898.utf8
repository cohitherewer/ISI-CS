The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ministry nominee on BCCI team
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: In an effort to quickly resolve the itinerary for the Indian cricket teams tour of Pakistan in March-April the BCCI has decided to send a three-member team on a recce mission to Pakistan in the first week of February. The team comprises board joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty (who will lead the delegation), board director of communications Amrit Mathur, and Yashovardhan Azad, Inspector General of Police, VIP security division of the government of Indias home ministry. The composition, said Jagmohan Dalmiya at a press briefing here Wednesday, was made with the purpose of giving the team all the power to decide on the venues with the cricketing angle in mind and weigh the security aspects. We at the board are not experts on security, so we asked the government to send their chosen man for the trip, said Dalmiya. They decided on Azad. Azad isnt a new face for the BCCI, though. It may be recalled that the Indian ministry had deputed Azad with Wasim Akrams Pakistan when the team toured in early 1999. Yashovardhan is Kirti Azads elder brother. The teams trip will last about a week, with the prime objective being the safety and security of the players and officials and of the media personnel who would be visiting the country with the Indian team. Asked if security concerns alone will decide the venues (Peshawar and Karachi, though being great cricketing venues, are seemingly on the controversial list security-wise), Dalmiya said: That is why we have selected the three specifically, so they can discuss issues threadbare and make decisions, taking all aspects into consideratoin said Dalmiya. The problem is that we have too little time to go through the specifics and logistics, and things will have to be pushed. Regarding the issue of the impending declaration of Lok Sabha elections, Dalmiya said the Pak tour dates will have to be adjusted so it does not get disturbed by the election process. However, till the poll dates are known we cannot conjecture on this. Dalmiya also said that the Aussie under-19 team which is to pay a preparatory visit to India prior to the under-19 World Cup to be held in Bangladesh from February 10, will play the India under-19 team in Cuttack on February 4 and in Calcutta on February 6 and 8.

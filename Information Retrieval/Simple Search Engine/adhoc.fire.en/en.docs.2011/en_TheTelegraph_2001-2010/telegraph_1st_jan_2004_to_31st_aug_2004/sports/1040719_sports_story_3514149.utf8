 WICB outlines reform plans
Port-of-Spain: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) president outlined reforms to improve the West Indies lagging play, including giving coaches a say in picking players and designing strategy. The proposed structure calls for distinct and discrete roles for the manager, coach, captain and selectors, and provides for clear reporting lines and accountability, Teddy Griffith said. Griffith has said one of his main goals is for the West Indies to be among the top three teams within two years. He said head coach Gus Logie would become a voting member of the West Indies team selection panel. He will also become involved in planning game strategy, a responsibility currently shouldered by captain Brian Lara. (AP)  Copyright

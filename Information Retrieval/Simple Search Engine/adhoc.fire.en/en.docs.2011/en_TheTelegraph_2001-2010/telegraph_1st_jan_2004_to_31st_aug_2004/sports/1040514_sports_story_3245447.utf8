The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gurbux on selection panel 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER IN CALCUTTA AND PTI FROM NEW DELHI  Gurbux Singh May 13: Sports minister Vikram Verma, who rapped the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) bosses on the federations opaque selection policy Wednesday, is gone, with his entire ministry. The IHF, though, has taken the outgoing ministers advice seriously and Thursday announced the appointment of a seven-member selection committee which includes four former national captains including Olympic gold medallist Gurbux Singh of Calcutta. Others in the committee, to be headed by IHF president K. P. S. Gill, are B. P. Govinda, Aslam Sher Khan, Surinder Singh Sodhi, IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran and IPS Prithviraj (vice-chairman of the committee). The federation has been functioning without a selection committee for two years now. Selections were made by Jyothikumaran and Gill. And the issue of the non-inclusion of Dhanraj Pillay, Baljit Singh Dhillon and Baljit Singh Saini was on the front burner for some time too. Then, quite suddenly, Pillay and Dillon were back in the reckoning, though Saini stays out. A top official of the IHF, however, denied that the making of this selection committee was at the prompting of the minister. The names had been decided much earlier, he said. One of the selectors (Govinda) had even been sent with the team to Japan to observe the players perform in the four-nation meet, the official said. The background of the selectors has been taken into account. Gurbux is a double-Olympian (and the only gold medallist). He also coached the national team in the Montreal Olympics. Govinda and Aslam Sher Khan played in the Munich and Montreal Olympics while Moscow Olympian Sodhi led India to bronze medal in the 1982 Champions Trophy in Amstelveen. Gurbux told The Telegraph in Calcutta that it was a very fruitful morning meeting: Apart from those selected, others at the meeting were IOA secretary Randhir Singh, Ashok Kumar, Zafar Iqbal, R.S. Bhola and M.P. Ganesh (from the SAI). Verma made it clear that the government was not interested in forcing the hand of the IHF. The general consensus was to have a discussion on how best to have a team which can do well in the Olympics. Gurbux had been a member of the IHFs selection committee in 1973 and then from 1981 to 85. One thing, however, is sure. The new dispensation at the Centre will not affect the working of the IHF on its way to a strong charge in Athens. If anything, said a source who preferred anonymity, a Congress-led government will only be helpful, Gill having always been close to the brass in the party.  Copyright

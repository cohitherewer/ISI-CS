The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia boost for EB before derby
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia signs for East Bengal at the IFA office on Friday. The India captains contract runs till December 31. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The East Bengal camp got a major boost 48 hours before the CFL Super Division clash with Mohun Bagan when Bhaichung Bhutia formally renewed his association with the red-and-gold jersey. The contract, however, is only till December 31, 2004, after which he will decide whether to complete the National League with East Bengal. East Bengal have several important tournaments this year and I think I should be with them  the club has been in touch with me for quite some time, so I decided to sign for them, explained Bhutia, ending weeks of speculation and uncertainty about his actual intention. The most sought-after desi striker for almost a decade now, Bhutia will not only spearhead the East Bengal attack in the Sunday derby, he will also be in the England-bound squad at the end of this month for the Leicester City-organised four-nation meet. Although Im not 100 per cent on the physical fitness front, Ill play on Sunday and do my best to help the teams cause, said Bhutia, who returned from Sikkim on Thursday evening after visiting his ailing father. We had a fairly good last season and another crucial season is ahead of us. We have a good team this time, too, and there is plenty of scope for improvement, remarked Bhutia, who had a rigorous session with his teammates on Friday morning. Bhutia will travel to Cyprus as and when he is called for trials by a club there. Thats part of the understanding with East Bengal. His decision is sure to prop up interest for Sundays match. Ticket sales were already extremely encouraging and the organisers are expecting a six-digit attendance. The IFA, in conjunction with the state athletics association (AA-WB), has planned a novel way to entertain the big Sunday crowd; a relay race will be held at half-time. Five teams  East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting, Bardhaman and South 24 Parganas  will take part in a 4x400m relay race while the footballers freshen up for the second session. All athletes will run in their respective team/district colours, with the fastest quartet standing to earn some prize-money. The idea of the relay is to give the mother-sport some exposure and visibility, said IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, adding that it would not in any way distract or shift focus from the afternoons main event. It remains to be seen whether the footballers, coaches or even the fans appreciate Duttas latest innovation.  Copyright

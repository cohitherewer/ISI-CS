The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Toms in lead, Atwal out again
Germantown (Tennessee), May 29 (Reuters): Defending champion David Toms fired an eight-under-par 63 in calm conditions to move into a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the St Jude Classic Friday. Indias Arjun Atwal came back into the fairways after his baby was born, and took part in this championship, but had a disastrous start. In Round I Atwal hit two birdies alright, but that was wiped out and more by two bogies and two double bogies. That ended his outing on a poor 78, too far off from a cut. He recovered quickly in the second round, hitting no less than five birdies, but two bogies and a double bogey would not let his round go past 70. With a total of total of 148, he was tied at 115th position, way off the cut. Toms, who finished the day on 12-under 130, shot his 10th consecutive round in the 60s. The strong wind that buffeted the course Thursday vanished overnight.  Copyright

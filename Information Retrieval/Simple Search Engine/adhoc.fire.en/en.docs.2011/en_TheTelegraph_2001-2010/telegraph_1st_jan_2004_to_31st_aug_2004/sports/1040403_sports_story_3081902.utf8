The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Teams security reviewed
 - Intruder at hotel causes commotion among security staff  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  A file picture of Team Indias security cover at the Lahore hotel Lahore: The security arrangements for Team India were reviewed on Friday morning and the personnel advised not to lower guard. According to The Telegraphs sources, the review was undertaken by the teams chief security liaison officer, DIG Dharmendra Kumar, and included in the exercise was the Islamabad-assigned SSP, Sohail Khan. Khan, it may be recalled, has been with the Rahul Dravids from Day I (March 10). Of course, nobody is saying the review became necessary after Indias unprecedented win in Multan, but there are whispers about that being a factor. Basically, the already limited access to the players is probably going to be curtailed even more. Incidentally, a gentleman looking for an Indian friend at the hotel, Pearl Continental, caused some commotion amongst the security staff late on Thursday. That came about as he actually made his way to the highly-protected floor where the Indian players have been put up. One understands the local agencies have been requested to deploy the same personnel who did duty during the Indians two previous trips to Lahore  on arrival and for the last two ODIs.  Copyright

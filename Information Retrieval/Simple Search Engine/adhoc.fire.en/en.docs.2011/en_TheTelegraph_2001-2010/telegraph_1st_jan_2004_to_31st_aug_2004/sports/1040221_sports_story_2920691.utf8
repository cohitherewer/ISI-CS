 Jyoti stuck in rain
	 - MALAYSIAN OPEN  Thaworn Wirachanth follows through with his tee shot on the second day of the Malaysian Open on Friday. (AFP) Kuala Lumpur: Deaf South Korean Lee Sung-man was left sharing the lead when a tropical downpour brought a sudden halt to the second round of the Malaysian Open on Friday. Lee, who has been deaf from birth and communicates by lip-reading through his father who travels with him, carded a four-under-par 68 to move to seven under and join Thailands Thaworn Wiratchanth at the top of the leader board. Indian star Jyoti Randhawa could not complete his round, being stuck at a fine two-under after 13 holes. He will complete his round Saturday before going into the third round. Also stuck due to the rain are three other Indians  Arjun Singh at one over after six holes, Jeev Milkha Singh at two over after nine holes and Harmeet Kahlon at two over after six holes. Irelands Paul McGinley, with a round of 70, were tied for third with American Gregory Hanrahan who added a similar round of 70 to his opening 68 in the co-sanctioned European and Asian Tour event at the Saujana course in Kuala Lumpur. The 24-year-old Lee, who has tried unsuccessfully the last four years to earn his US PGA Tour card, last month earned his 2004 Asian Tour card after finishing first at the qualifying school. McGinley is striving for a first tour victory since the 2001 Welsh Open when he won in a sudden death playoff from Britons Paul Lawrie and Daren Lee after rain reduced the tournament to 36 holes. The Irishman, who holed the winning putt in the 2002 Ryder Cup, managed four birdies in his round and said he is finally benefiting from new technology.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe, Nepal floor giants
Dhaka: It was a day of upsets in the under-19 World Cup on Wednesday. Zimbabwe sprang the first surprise by beating Australia in Rajshahi, but Nepal produced the stunner by upstaging South Africa in Chittagong. In group B, Nepal bowled out their much fancied opponents for 156 and scampered home with a wicket and two balls to spare. Manjeet Sreshtha (four for 15) and MoM Shakti Gauchan (51 not out) were the chief architects of their memorable win. In a group A match, Zimbabwe bundled out Australia for a mere 73 and then reached the target in 17.1 overs for the loss of three wickets. Tinashe Panyangara was the hero of the match, taking six for 31. Australia must beat Sri Lanka on Friday to reach the Super League, while South Africa must put it across England to harbour hopes of making progress. There was no such surprise in Khulna, where the West Indies beat Papua New Guinea by 152 runs for their second straight victory in group D. Tishan Maraj and Lendl Simmons both scored centuries to take the West Indies to 371 for three. Papua New Guinea refused to fold and were all out for a creditable 219.

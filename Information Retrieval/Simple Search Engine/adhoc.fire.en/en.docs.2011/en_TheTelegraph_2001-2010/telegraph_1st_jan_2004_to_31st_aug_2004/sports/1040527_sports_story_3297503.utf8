The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengal win 1-0
Jamalpur: A sterling performance by skipper Rahim Nabi enabled defending champions Bengal to defeat Goa by a lone goal even as Manipur trounced Orissa 7-0 in the league match for 13th Junior nation- al under-21 football championship for Dr M. Dutta Roy Trophy at the Jamalpur Sports Association ground on Wednesday. In a keenly contested match, Bengal boys repeatedly raided the Goan territory but could not score initially as Goa defenders stood like rock to frustrate their attempts. However, Bengal skipper Rahim Nabis in-swinging direct free-kick in the 40th minute fetched his team the lone goal. Though Goa midfielders and forward line co-ordinated well making small passes in the second half to mount pressure on Bengal, they failed to equalise due to poor finish. In the 60th minute of play, right striker Zico DSuza came close to scoring a goal but missed an easy sitter. In another match of the day, Manipur drubbed Orissa 7-0 scoring two goals in the first half and five in the second.  (PTI)  Copyright

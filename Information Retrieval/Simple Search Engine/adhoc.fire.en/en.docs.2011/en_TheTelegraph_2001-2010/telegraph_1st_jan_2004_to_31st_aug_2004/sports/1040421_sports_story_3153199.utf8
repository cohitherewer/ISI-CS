The Telegraph - Calcutta
Lanka overcome Taibus grit
- 'Keeper becomes youngest skipper ever and first black to lead Zimbabwe
 Nuwan Zoysa, who took three for 21, celebrates the wicket of Dion Ebrahim in Bulawayo on Tuesday. (Reuters) Harare: Kumar Sangakkara scored a well-paced 73 not out to help Sri Lanka beat a severely weakened Zimbabwe by 12 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis system after rain disrupted the first one-day International in Bulawayo on Tuesday. Sangakkaras knock guided his side to 144 for four when bad light ended the match after 27 overs of their innings while chasing a revised target of 173 from 33 overs. The visitors were ahead of the target under the system. Earlier, Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu scored a career-best 96 not out to help his side post 211 for six in 50 overs. Rain disrupted the match in the seventh over of Sri Lankas innings. The 20-year-old wicketkeeper, the first black player to captain his country, came to the crease after the home side had lost both openers with only a run on the board. He steered Zimbabwe past 200 after they had slumped to 79 for five. Zimbabwe were fielding a weakened side after 15 white players, including former captain Heath Streak, made themselves unavailable as part of an ongoing battle with their board. The inexperienced line-up started poorly after being sent in by Maravan Atapattu, with openers Vusi Sibanda and debutant Brendon Taylor dismissed without scoring. Zimbabwe then slumped to 79 for five in the 25th over after debutant Elton Chigumbura (13) and Stuart Matsikenyeri (6) were dismissed. Maragwede, who scored 37 from 44 balls, then shared a stand of 75 with Taibu for the sixth wicket, before Taibu and Nkala pushed Zimbabwe past 200 with an unbroken partnership of 57 off 48 balls. Sanath Jayasuriya became Panyangaras first victim. Atapattu followed for a six-ball duck, before it began raining with the visitors at 31 for two. When play resumed, Jayawardene was caught in the deep by Panyangara before Zoysa mistimed a pull shot to Taylor at mid-on. Sangakkara and Tillekeratne Dilshan (35 not out) then snuffed out Zimbabwes hopes of an upset with a 67-run fifth-wicket stand. The second ODI will be played at the same venue on Thursday. Procter replaces Broad Match Referee Chris Broad, who reported Muttiah Muralidharan for suspect bowling action last month, has been replaced by South African Mike Procter for the Sri Lanka-Zimbabwe Series, adds a report from London. The ICC said that the change was made to avoid the same official take charge of a series involving the same player during the six-week stage one period of the ICCs bowling review process. Sri Lanka applauded the decision and urged a review of the officials list for Sri Lankas series against Australia.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 My biggest win: Devang
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Devang hopes Deodhar experience will inspire Bengal Calcutta: It had hardly been an impressive Ranji Trophy campaign for any of them. But the players from Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Assam and Tripura are really a force to reckon with in the national circuit when it comes to playing together. While the captain of the East Zone team, Devang Gandhi feels winning the Deodhar Trophy is one of the biggest triumphs of his cricketing life, he believes that this performance will go a long way in helping Bengal put up a real fight in the forthcoming national one-day meet starting in the city on February 5. Most of the Bengal boys were there Im sure this tempo will be maintained in the next tournament as well, Devang said on Thursday. While he rated this show as a collective effort, the captain had a special word for left-arm spinner Anirban Chatterjee. He has really come of age and should be an integral part of the Bengal team in the next tournament. Anirban, it may be noted, had come into the side after Utpal Chatterjee dropped out from the East Zone squad citing personal reasons. The captain, however, feels Utpal will make himself available when Bengal play in the national one-dayers. Im sure his presence will increase our strength. He felt Bengal have a very good nucleus which will be a big help. Also, with the likes of Arindam Das coming back, we should do well. Commenting on the performance of the East Zone team in the Deodhar Trophy, he said: All 11 chipped in I havent seen an East Zone team of late with so much spirit. The skipper was all praise for Deep Dasgupta, who joined the squad after returning from Australia. This is the best Ive seen Deep keepIf he can keep this going, well  Copyright

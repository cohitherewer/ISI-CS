The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Proposals accepted
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The BCCI working committee has accepted the proposal of its disciplinary committee to constitute a Code of Conduct for national selectors. The disciplinary committee had suggested this while handling the Abhijit Kale case. BCCI president Jagmohgan Dalmiya said Wednesday that the working committee had decided to adopt the idea at its recent meeting in New Delhi. The guidelines will be worked out soon. The proposals, though, will not come into effect before the selection of the team for the Champions Trophy in England from September 10 to 25. These proposals and the guidelines will be placed before the BCCIs special general body meeting in September. That is where this could become law, affecting selectors after that. Meanwhile, India may pick 15 players, one extra, for the Champions Trophy. Though tournament rules allow 14-member squads, sources indicated that India would most probably select 15, with the BCCI bearing the expenses of the extra player. The Champions Trophy squad will have to be selected before August 10, since that is the last date for submission of names. The national selectors will meet on either August 6 or 7 to pick the squad. The same squad will travel to Amstelveen before facing England in the three ODIs on September 1, 3 and 5.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Donations keep Island going
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: There is little history attached to Island FC, the team in the city now to play their away match versus East Bengal in the AFC Cup Group E league. It is a four-year-old club that finished fourth last year in the Maldives six-team league in Male (the top three being Valencia, Victory SC and New Radiant). They topped the FA Cup, so they now represent the country in the AFC Cup, and were runners-up in the Cup Winners Cup. Clubs in the Maldives arent particularly shining with funds. Island, for example, run mainly on personal donations, organised by their CEO Hilay Md Rashid, who is also a Member of Parliament. The teams manager here, Ibrahim Lutfi, said this private club also gets funds from government programmes, just like all other clubs of Male. There is no organised commercial sponsorship and mostly the system is geared for a low-budget, low intensity soccer.  Copyright

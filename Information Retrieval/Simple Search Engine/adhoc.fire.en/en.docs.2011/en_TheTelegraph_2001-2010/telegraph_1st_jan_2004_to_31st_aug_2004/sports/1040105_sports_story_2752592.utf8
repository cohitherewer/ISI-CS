The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McGrath return still uncertain
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  McGrath is likely to miss tri-series too  Sydney: Australias No. 1 quick Glenn McGrath,  who has been out of action for over five months, is not  putting a date on his comeback. His last series, it may  be recalled, was against Bangladesh in end July last year.  Of course, I bowled a bit this  (Sunday) morning, but Im still in the midst of my rehab  (after two surgeries on the left ankle)... I suppose it  will be another two-three weeks before I resume full-fledged  nets and, then, go on from there, McGrath told The Telegraph  at the SCG. Acknowledging that it was tough not being able to feature in the action, he added: Its very difficult when the team isnt doing well... One feels helpless... In any case, its tough being sidelined because of injuries. McGrath, who turns 34 next month, conceded that Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman had batted beautifully in the deciding Test, but insisted he would have backed himself in a face-off with the in-form Indians. Who knows, I could have got both first ball, he said, heading for a session with the New South Wales physio.  The Indians, by the way, are relieved they havent  had to face McGrath in the Tests. Its more than likely  he will miss the forthcoming tri-series as well.  Copyright

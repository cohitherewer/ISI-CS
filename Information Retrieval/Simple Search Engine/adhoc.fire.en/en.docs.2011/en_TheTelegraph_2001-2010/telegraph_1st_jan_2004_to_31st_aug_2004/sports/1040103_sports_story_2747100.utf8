 Ruud set to extend deal
 - Manchester United striker offered around 80,000 a week  BY SAM WALLACE  Ruud van Nistelrooy is confident of a smooth negotiation Ruud van Nistelrooy revealed Thursday that he was ready to commit himself to Manchester United in a deal that would mean his salary roughly doubling to around 80,000 a week and killing off growing interest from Real Madrid and Chelsea. The United board have been in negotiations with Van Nistelrooy, 26, for months about a deal that will reflect the enormous contribution that the Dutchman  who has 97 goals in 118 games for United  has made since his arrival in the summer of 2001. The deal should be completed this month with the United chief executive David Gill, well before his predecessor, Peter Kenyon, is allowed to take up his new role in charge of Chelsea. The signing up of Van Nistelrooy on a five-year deal will mean that United have secured all their senior internationals on contracts that do not have to be re-examined for at least 18 months and will allay some fears that Kenyons knowledge of the clubs workings might make certain players a target. It was the former United chief executive who led the negotiations for Van Nistelrooys first deal, which was effectively decided in the summer of 2000, before the player broke down with a knee injury, before being completed a year later in the 19.5 million move from PSV Eindhoven. It meant that Van Nistelrooy, still regarded as something of an injury risk when he signed, was put on relatively modest wages, understood to be 35,000-45,000 a week with the assurance that the original five-year deal would be reassessed halfway through. The talks are going very well and I am positive about the outcome, Van Nistelrooy said. I do not expect any problems and quite probably the negotiations are going to be finished soon. The manager knows what I feel for this club. I want to stay here for a long time that is why I am so happy that everything is going so well. It is fantastic to be part of a club with such big names and huge tradition. If I score a lot of goals it means I am doing my job. Getting to 50 or 100 is not a target on its own. I just want to carry on doing my best, I can look at the statistics when I get to the end of my career. The deal will be a warning to Real Madrid, whose cautious speculation that Van Nistelrooy would be the kind of player they would target had shown all the signs of being the beginning of a campaign to unsettle the striker. Even Chelseas acting chief executive, Paul Smith, had suggested that the club would pay 60 million for Van Nistelrooy if they considered it a good investment. While Uniteds preferred targets for Van Nistelrooys new strike partner are Louis Saha, Mark Viduka and Jermain Defoe, Chelsea might have to turn their attention now to the Real Mallorca striker Samuel Etoo. However, a valuation of around 20 million and his commitments for Cameroon at the African Nations Cup this year could prove disincentives. Meanwhile, Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, has praised his goalkeeper Tim Howard, bought from the New York/New Jersey MetroStars this summer, as the player of the season so far after the American took over in goal during the summer tour of the US and then succeeded in holding his place ahead of Fabien Barthez. Tim Howard has been the star of the show this season, Ferguson said. He is quick, alert, agile, courageous and has speed. Its all there for us to see. I thought I would have to leave him out for a bit in October, but it hasnt happened.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

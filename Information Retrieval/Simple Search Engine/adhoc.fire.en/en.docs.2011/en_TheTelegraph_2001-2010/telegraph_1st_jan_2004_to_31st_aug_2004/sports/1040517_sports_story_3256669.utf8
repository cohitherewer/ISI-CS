Lyon are only the third club after St Etienne and Olympique Marseille to clinch three French championships in a row. With one game left, Lyon have 76 points from 37 games with a goal difference of plus 35. PSG, who won thanks to a Pedro Pauleta early goal, are three points off the pace with a goal difference of plus 21. Monaco are third with 72 points after they were beaten by mid-table Stade Rennes. Fernando Morientes left the pitch on the stroke of halftime after sustaining an ankle sprain. Monaco, who will try to clinch a direct Champions League qualifying spot at Girondins Bordeaux next Friday, play the competitions final against Porto on May 26 in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Striker Djibril Cisse, who is to join Liverpool during the close season, bid a tearful farewell to the fans after scoring twice to secure AJ Auxerre a Uefa Cup spot for next season with a 2-0 win over Nantes. Ten-man Olympique Marseille lost 1-2 at Toulouse. In Spain, Celta Vigo and Valladolid were left teetering on the brink of relegation after both were defeated in the Primera Liga on Saturday. Ten-man Celta slumped to a 0-3 defeat against Deportivo La Coruna, while Valladolid went down 0-1 at Real Betis. Valladolid have 38 points and Celta 39, a point adrift of Espanyol who travel to Real Mallorca in the knowledge that a win will ensure they retain their top-flight status. At the other end of the table newly crowned champions Valencia slipped to their first defeat in 11 games on Friday when they lost 1-2 to regional rivals Villarreal. Valencia have an unassailable 77 points from 37 games, Real Madrid are seven back on 70, one ahead of Barcelona and two clear of Deportivo. Celta, desperately needing a win to climb out of the bottom three, made an ambitious start against Depor but a stroke of bad luck put them a goal behind after 14 minutes. Depor midfielder Fran swung a dangerous cross in from the left, striker Walter Pandiani failed to connect but the ball ricocheted off Celta defender Silvinhos foot and went in. Ten minutes later Depor struck again, this time Pandiani cracked in from the edge of the box a perfect first-time finish after another fine cross from Fran. Depor added a third when Pedro Munitis clipping in over keeper Pablo Cavallero after fellow midfielder Sergio had split open the Celta defence with a delightful through ball. (Reuters)  Copyright

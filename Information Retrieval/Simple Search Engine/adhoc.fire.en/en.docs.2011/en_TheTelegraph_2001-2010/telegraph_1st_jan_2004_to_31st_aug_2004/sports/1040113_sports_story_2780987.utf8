 IOA desire shot down by minister
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: While the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) Monday announced it would enter into the fray for hosting the 2016 Olympic Games, Union sports minister VikramVerma hinted that the Centre is not in favour backing any such bid. The IOA executives, seemingly buoyed by its successful Commonwealth Games 2010 bid, met during the annual general meeting of the association Sunday and this consensus was hammered out, said IOA secretary general Randhir Singh in a press release. But Verma said: The proposal will ultimately come to me. We will examine it. We are hosting the Commonwealth Games in 2010 and so ideally we would like to pitch in for the Olympics 10 years later. This gap is needed for building our infrastructure. It was decided that the 2007 National Games will be held in Jharkhand.  Copyright

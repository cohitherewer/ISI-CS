The BCCI president, however, informed he had no knowledge about the match. I dont know anything about itdont know who is going and who is not, Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Sunday. The AFP report quoted Abu Dhabi cricket board chairman Sheikh Nahyan Bin Mubarak Al Nahyan as saying: Thanks to the Indian and Pakistan cricket boards and the players who have all agreed to support cricket here. We are happy that India and Pakistan, the two countries with whom the UAE share exemplary relations, should kick-start international competitions here. The report added that India will be without the newly wed Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar. Pakistan, it said, will miss Shoaib Akhtar. It is understood that representatives of the Abu Dhabi board got in touch with the players of both teams during the final Test between India and Pakistan in Rawalpindi.  Copyright

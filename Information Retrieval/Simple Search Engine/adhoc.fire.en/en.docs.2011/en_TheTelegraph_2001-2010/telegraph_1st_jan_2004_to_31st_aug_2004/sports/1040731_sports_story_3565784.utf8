The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Indians look good: Le Roux
	 - REUNION CELEBRATED WITH DINNER IN COLOMBO  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Colombo: It has been a brief reunion and the dramatis personae  John Wright, Andrew Leipus and Adrian le Roux  the gentlemen who collectively played a huge role in Team Indias handsome run from April 2002 till March 2003 chose to celebrate over dinner on Thursday. In a nice gesture, le Rouxs successor as the trainer, Greg King, was invited to join the party. It has been wonderful catching up with Adrian and, really, the best way was for all of us to have a meal together... I quite enjoyed it, coach Wright told The Telegraph. Physio Leipus nodded in agreement. Le Roux, it may be recalled, took up his national (South African) sides assignment after the last World Cup as the Board of Control for Cricket in India acted foolishly and delayed extending his contract. He is currently in Colombo with the Graeme Smith-led team. And, le Roux is happy with the way the Sourav Gangulys have kept themselves fit. Ive bumped into the boys at the hotel and, believe me, theyve looked good, he remarked, during an exclusive chat on Friday evening. Le Roux added: Greg, I must say, has done a fine job... He has devised programmes and, obviously, the follow-up is there... Moreover, Im happy the side has been doing well... Indeed, last season, I watched much of the series in Australia and Pakistan... Asked just how long it took him to settle down with the Proteas, le Roux answered: Not much... Basically, its the same job, with the only difference being working with different faces... Understandably, though, le Roux didnt discuss individuals. According to the South Africans, le Roux is very strict  the Indians, by the way, had the same complaint. Yet, no one minds because he is such a professional. Incidentally, the Indians also had enormous respect for this low profile and uncompromising back room stalwart.  Copyright

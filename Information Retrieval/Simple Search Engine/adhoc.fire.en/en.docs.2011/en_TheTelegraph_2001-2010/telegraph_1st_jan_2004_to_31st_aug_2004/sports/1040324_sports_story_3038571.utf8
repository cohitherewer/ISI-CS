The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand up to third spot
Monaco: In a fine attacking game, defending champion Viswanathan Anand dealt a double blow to Francisco Vallejo Pons of Spain to move to the joint third position in the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament. With a victory each in blindfold (as reported in the Late City edition of these columns Tuesday) and rapid games of round three Monday, Anand took his tally to four points from six games played so far. BrainGames champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia played out two hard fought draws against Peter Leko of Hungary and was joined by compatriot Evgeny Bareev in the lead after the latter scored a hard-hitting 2-0 victory over Loek van Wely of the Netherlands. Both the leaders have 4.5 points each in their kitty and are followed by Anand, Leko and Russian champion Peter Svidler. The sixth spot is jointly held by Russian Alexander Morozevich and Latvian born Spaniard Alexei Shirov, who have 3.5 points apiece. Eight more rounds remain. (PTI)  Copyright

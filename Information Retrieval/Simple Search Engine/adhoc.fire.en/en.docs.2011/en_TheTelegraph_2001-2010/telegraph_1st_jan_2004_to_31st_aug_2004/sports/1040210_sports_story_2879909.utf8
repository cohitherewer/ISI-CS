The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne back today 
 - Teams bend rules to let leggie join low-key game on Day II  Shane Warne will play for Victoria second XI after serving out a 12-month suspension Sydney: Shane Warne returns after a drugs ban on Tuesday hoping to play his way back into international cricket. The disgraced Australian leg-spinner, who has served a 12-month suspension, will make his first appearance in the modest surrounds of Melbournes Junction Oval where he will play for the Victorian states second XI against the Queensland Academy of Sport. Such matches rarely make the news but Warnes return has suddenly made this the biggest fixture of the season. Local newspapers have been counting down the days to his comeback and an army of reporters and photographers will descend on the suburban park to watch him roll his arm over. Despite the drug scandal, Warne is being welcomed back to the fold with open arms. The match actually began on Monday but such is the collective support for Warne in Australian cricket circles, the teams bent the rules to let him join the game on the second day when his ban officially ends. Warne was diplomatic when asked about a critical article by cricket commentator Tim Lane in a Melbourne daily. (They) have bent the laws of cricket and abused the integrity of one of their own competitions to facilitate the speediest-possible return of a player found guilty of a serious breach of sports drug code, Lane wrote. Warne, who remained a Cricket Australia-contracted player throughout his suspension, said: I think hes missed the point. He was left out of the Australian one-day squad announced on Monday to tour Sri Lanka later this month but is almost certain to be included in the Test squad when it is announced on February 20. My goal is to try to make the Test tour of Sri Lanka, warne told radio station 3AW on Monday. But I am just going to enjoy being back playing  if its 0-100, its 0-100, if its 5-50, thats a bonus. Warne needed to be pressed before he jokingly predicted Tuesdays bowling figures as three for 75. It depends on the skipper (Peter Roach)  I have got no idea, anything will be good, he said. When youve been out of competitive cricket, you can train as much as you like. When you get in a match situation, someone else is there. Australias greatest wicket-taker in Tests and with 491 scalps, second only on the all-time list to West Indian Courtney Walsh, Warne has little to prove beyond his fitness and said he was not feeling any pressure to perform straight away. Warne, who has had shoulder, wrist and finger surgery over the years, has even said his suspension could prove a blessing in disguise by prolonging his international career. One of Wisdens five cricketers of the 20th Century, Warne was banned last year after testing positive for a diuretic, which can be used to mask other drugs.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Dont judge Seaman by mistakes
 - I still think Ronaldinhos attempt on goal in the World Cup quarter final was intentional  BY GARY LINEKER  David Seaman is among the authors all-time great English goalkeepers Now that David Seaman has finally hung up his gloves, I can reveal that for much of the Nineties, he was known to most of the England squad not as Safe Hands or even David but by the obscure nickname of Frankie. What will not surprise you is that this had everything to do with one Paul Gascoigne. We were on a plane flying to an England game in the late Eighties when David happened to be sitting next to a bloke who was the spitting image of English comedian and star of the farcical Carry On films, Frankie Howerd. Titter ye not, (his catchphrase), this is the truth. I was sitting a few seats further ahead of David alongside Chris Waddle and Gazza, who was greatly amused when he spotted the Frankie Howerd lookalike. So every time Gazza turned round to speak to David, he would get his attention by yelling Frankie, Frankie and bursting into laughter. Silly, I know, but it was a long flight and we are talking Paul Gascoigne. But somehow the name stuck and I am probably the only person who still refers to David as Frankie, to the bemusement of anyone else who might be in our company. Some critics, of course, would claim that it is a fitting sobriquet because of the number of Carry On moments David has supposedly had on the pitch, such as the Nayim shot from the halfway line that beat him and Arsenal in the 1995 European Cup Winners Cup final and the Ronaldinho lob in the 2002 World Cup quarter final against Brazil. But over a fantastic career, you can count such moments on the fingers of one goalkeeping glove. David had a truly wonderful career and I rate him as one of the greatest England goalkeepers of all time. My own No. 1 is Peter Shilton but then I am biased because he was my schoolboy hero and Gordon Banks, many peoples favourite, was before my time. Since Shilts, I cannot think of anyone who has been as consistent as David for England and for a period of time, he was undoubtedly the best goalkeeper in the world. Funnily enough, I was talking to Peter Schmeichel about him this week and he told me that he counted him in his all-time world greats and as keepers understand their somewhat quirky profession better than most, that is one hell of an accolade. That was the other thing about David. He was remarkably unlike a goalkeeper as a person. Most of them tend to be a bit off the wall and strong, outgoing personalities. He has always been a man of few words and known for that big smile more than anything else. I was pleased that most journalists who covered Davids retirement last week focused on the great times, rather than a couple of freak moments because that is how he ought to be remembered. He received enormous stick over the Ronaldinho goal, more than he deserved because of the disappointment people felt over missing out on a World Cup semi-final place. But even then, it was not as if he threw the ball into the back of the net. It was a fantastic bit of skill by Ronaldinho and I happen to be one of those who believe that he intended to do it. I was a striker, after all. What separates great goalkeepers from the good ones is how they react to so-called gaffes like that. We have seen many promising keepers who have made a howler and never been the same player again. But you could never say that about David Seaman. He just put it behind him and carried on doing what he did best. We all make mistakes but how long they are remembered is determined by when and in what circumstances you make them. The Nayim goal cost Arsenal a trophy in the final seconds of extra time and Ronaldinhos knocked England out of the World Cup. So naturally, they linger in the mind. Yet I missed a penalty in the biggest game of the English season, the 1991 FA Cup final against Nottingham Forest. But though it gave me a few sleepless nights afterwards, no one ever reminds me of it because my Spurs side won 2-1. Gazzas self-inflicted injury which led to him being carried off also stands out more in peoples minds. In hindsight, David might have been better off retiring after last seasons FA Cup final success against Southampton. But very few players get to choose their moment to walk off into the sunset. Their body decides for them and that has proven the case with David after a recurring shoulder problem. At the end of last season, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger offered David the job of goalkeeping coach but since then, he seems to have drifted into TV and seems to be steering his ambitions in that direction. But I think it is a terrible decision to have committed himself to a comedy quiz show. I would never have done something like that myself.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

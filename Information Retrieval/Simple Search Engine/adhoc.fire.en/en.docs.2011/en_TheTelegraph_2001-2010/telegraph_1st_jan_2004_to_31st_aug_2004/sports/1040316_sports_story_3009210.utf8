The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian boxers on stiff route to Athens 
 BY SUJIT BHAR  Ali Qamar feels he has a chance Calcutta: Propping up an Indian boxing squad for the Athens Olympics is proving tough. Or so it seems, going by the way the Indians performed in the last qualifying meet in Manila. The Manila meet (January 11 and 18) was basically the 22nd Asian championship, also masquerading as the first of three qualifying rounds for the Olympics from Asia. Ten boxers had gone to Manila. Among them were Md Ali Qamar of Calcutta (48kg), Akhil Kumar (51kg, Haryana), Diwakar Prasad (54kg, Steel Plant) and Jitender Kumar (81kg, Haryana). Nobody qualified (the cut-off was gold-silver, and the best Indians managed quarters berths), and four boxers are out of the race. Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) vice-president Asit Banerjee told The Telegraph over phone from Delhi Monday that competition in Manila was tough. The second of the three qualification rounds will be held in China (March 23-28). The Indian contingent leaves Tuesday. The contingent comprises six of those who went to Manila. They are Ali Qamar, Akhil, Diwakar, Vijender Singh (67kg, Haryana), Ramanand (64kg, services) and Jitender. The criterion remains gold-silver in the different categories. There is another qualifying round to go, in Karachi (March 29 to April 7), but that being the home country of International Amateur Boxing Association president Anwar Chowdhry, things, one learns, could be difficult from an Indian standpoint. India can send only one boxer per category to Athens. All these qualifiers come after a 42-day training camp held in Tashkent in November-December last year and then a one-month sting inPatiala. Qamar, also speaking from Delhi, said: It would have been nice had we got more actual sparring in Uzbekistan. We practised technicalities with a lot of top class boxers, but got only one days practice. We had been to Uzbekistan before the Commonwealth meet, but we had a big sparring opportunity there then.  I really cant say if my qualification will come through, said Qamar. However, Filipinos have made it, Chinese have made it, so have the Pakistanis. So that way maybe India have a chance, and so do I. SAF squad Meanwhile, the IABF has named the squad for the SAF Games to be held in Islamabad from March 29 to April 7. THE SQUAD M. Suranjay Singh (48kg, SSCB), S.

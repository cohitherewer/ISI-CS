The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Italians have more of the pressure
 - MATCH vs SWEDEN 
- Totti ban may severely cripple Trapattoni  Alessandro del Piero at practice on Wednesday. (Reuters) Lisbon: The absence of Francesco Totti is overshadowing Italy coach Giovanni Trapattonis preparations for the Euro 2004 Group C match against Sweden on Friday. Trapattoni had said he would resist making sweeping changes the lacklustre goalless draw against Denmark, but he must now swiftly restructure his side in time for the game against the in-form Swedes in Porto, who are still buzzing from their 5-0 crushing of Bulgaria. The three-match ban means Totti will miss the remaining two Group C games against Sweden and Bulgaria, and the quarter finals if Italy get that far. Totti was found guilty of spitting at Denmarks Christian Poulsen, contributing to the mounting pressure on the Italians who know that defeat by the Swedes would leave them facing the prospect of an early exit. In contrast, a confident Sweden will book their place in the last eight with victory. In training on Wednesday, Trapattonis first team featured Tottis Roma teammate Antonio Cassano alongside Alessandro Del Piero and Christian Vieri in attack. But it was in midfield where the Italy coach hinted at more drastic changes with AC Milan pair Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso operating alongside Cristiano Zanetti at the expense of Simone Perrotta and Mauro Camoranesi. The loss of Totti is a major setback for Trapattoni and it places added responsibility on Del Piero who, in keeping with his past record in major tournaments, looked far from his best in the opener. The Swedes, t2hough, have a different memory of the Juventus striker as he grabbed the winner two minutes from the end when Italy beat them 2-1 in a Euro 2000 group match. One sure starter for Italy is left back Gianluca Zambrotta who says the Azzurri need to show more graft and dynamism than they managed in the Denmark game. To win against Sweden we have to run more than them, he said. They are an excellent team with dangerous forwards. The main difference between them and Denmark is the quality the Swedes have in attack. That quality was certainly evident against Bulgaria with two-goal striker Henrik Larsson in top form alongside Zlatan Ibrahamovic. Sweden will be forced into at least one change with right back Teddy Lucic set to miss the game through injury. Joint coaches Tommy Soderberg and Lars Lagerback will probably ask midfielder Mikael Nilsson to slot in at right back with Christian Wilhelmsson, who came on for Lucic against Bulgaria, moving into the midfield. Probable Teams Italy: Gianluigi Buffon; Christian Panucci, Alessandro Nesta, Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluca Zambrotta; Gennaro Gattuso, Andrea Pirlo, Cristiano Zanetti (or Simone Perrotta); Antonio Cassano, Alessandro Del Piero, Christian Vieri. Sweden: Andreas Isaksson; Mikael Nilsson, Olof Mellberg, Andreas Jakobsson, Erik Edman; Christian Wilhelmsson, Tobias Linderoth, Anders Svensson, Fredrik Ljungberg; Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrik Larsson.

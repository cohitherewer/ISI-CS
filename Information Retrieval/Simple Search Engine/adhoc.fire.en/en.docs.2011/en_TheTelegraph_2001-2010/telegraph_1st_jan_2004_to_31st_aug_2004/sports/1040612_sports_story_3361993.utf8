The Telegraph - Calcutta
Teamwork will improve refereeing 
Long Whistle Milan DattaRehearsing teamwork was on the agenda of match officials too  not just of M/s Santini and Scolari  in the lead-up to the Euro 2004. This is the first major where the referee and his assistants will be from the same country in every match, at least in the group league stage.This was the practice in one-off international matches like World and Asian Cup qualifiers for almost 20 years. There was an effort to field a team of referees and his assistants who speak the same language (English, Spanish or Arabic) in the last two World Cups.Due to practical reasons, putting this into practice is not easy in a tournament as vast as the World Cup, and thus, is making its tournament debut at Euro 2004.Its an excellent idea, considering the role referees play. This will certainly be better than conducting a match with colleagues who were strangers not very long ago.Communicating with the men running along the sidelines is not always easy. The new system will foster errorless communication, as language will come into the act  something that was only coincidental in major tournaments till date. Needless to say, the prior understanding between the officials helps better co-operation.Maybe the AIFF can also think of a similar system in the future, as resource-wise, this is not feasible in India at the moment.Pierluigi Collina trains with other referees in PortoMarking another departure, there will be no golden goal to decide the Euro crown this time, unlike in the last two finals, in 2000 and 1996. The Fifa is scrapping golden and silver goals from July 1, but the latter will stay till the end of Euro 2004.Though never adopted by Fifa, the silver goal was widely used in Uefa tournaments in the last couple of years. It has been deciding winners in matches conducted by the European football body since, though there has been no news of a major title being decided by a silver goal.SILVER GOAL: The rule says there will be 15 minutes of extra time if a match ends in a draw. The team leading at the end of these 15 minutes will be declared the winner.If the teams are tied after the first 15 minutes, another quarter of an hour will be played. The team leading at the end of this period will be the winner. Obviously, the goal securing victory is the silver goal.The old penalty shootout (kicks from the penalty mark in legal terms), where the teams take five shots each, stays. It will be required if the 30 minutes of extra time doesnt pop a winner.JERSEY EMBARGO: After being discussed for a while, the sanction against players taking off their shirts will make its maiden entry to a major tournament. For the rest of the world, this comes into effect from July 1.A player taking off the shirt for any reason, on the pitch during playing time, will get a yellow card for unsporting behaviour.Clearly, Fifa doesnt like the sight of a player revealing the upper part of his body, especially in joy, after scoring goals.NO SMOKING: Last but not least, there is bad news for coaches and other members of the crew who smoke. They cant douse the flame inside with smoke any longer while walking up and down. Smoking has been banned in the technical areas and dugouts. Copyright

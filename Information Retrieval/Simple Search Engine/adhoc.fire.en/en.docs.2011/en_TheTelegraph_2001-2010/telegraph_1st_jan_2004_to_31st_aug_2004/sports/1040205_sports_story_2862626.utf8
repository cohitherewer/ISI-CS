The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Windies soar to 305/2
 Chris Gayle hit an unbeaten 152 Johannesburg: Chris Gayles unbeaten 152 and Shivnarine Chanderpauls 85 took West Indies to an imposing 305 for two in 50 overs in their fifth one-day International versus South Africa here Wednesday. South African bowlers had little luck in penetrating the West Indian guard and managed only when Chanderpaul fell to host captain Graeme Smith with the total at 193, a record partnership. Left-handers Gayle and Chanderpaul, whose opening partnership came off 235 balls, eclipsed the previous best for the first wicket against South Africa, the unbroken 154 put on by Desmond Haynes and Brian Lara at Port-of-Spain in 1991-92. It was the highest total by West Indies against South Africa in one-dayers, surpassing their 300 for three at Centurion on Sunday in the fourth match of series. Brian Lara and Gayle put on 19 more runs before Lance Kluesener grabbed the visitors skipper for a mere 11. Powell, though, remained unbeaten on 49 till the end, having put on another 92 runs with Gayle. Nel went for 60 runs in his ten overs sans success. Both teams have a lot riding on the outcome of Wednesdays match, with South Africa leading the series 2-1. A West Indies victory in the last game of their tour would provide a significant boost for the visitors, who lost the Test series 3-0 and were dismissed for a record low of 54 in the opening ODI in Cape Town. Chanderpaul faced 114 balls and hit six fours and a six. Both openers scored heavily with straight drives, with Gayles straight six off Makhaya Ntini the most memorable blow of the innings.

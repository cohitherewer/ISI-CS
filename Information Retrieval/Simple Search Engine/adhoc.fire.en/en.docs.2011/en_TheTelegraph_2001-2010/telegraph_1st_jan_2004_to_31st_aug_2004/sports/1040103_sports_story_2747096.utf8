		 Sania MirzaHyderabad: Defending champion Sania Mirza has opted out of the second ITF Womens Tennis championship which begins at the Fateh Maidan tennis complex here later this month. Players from seven countries will be seen in action in the tournament which commences from January 12. Since there was some delay in fixing our tournament, Sania has opted for other engagements. She was committed for two tournaments in Italy, tournament director M Chandrasekhar said here Friday.  Asian junior champion Isha Lakhani  is top seed in the tournament in which Rushmi Chakravarthi  and Ankita Bhambri also figure along with Maya Rosa (Indonesia),  Giorgia Mortello (Italy) and Maria Penkova (Bulgaria) in  the direct entries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Injured Shoaib goes jet-skiing
 - Controversial pacer leaves team management red-faced  Shoaib Akhtar was ruled out of the second ODI, yet  Islamabad: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib  Akhtar, who bowled Pakistan to a memorable win in the just-concluded  Test series against New Zealand, is in the news again, for  the wrong reasons.  Shoaib left his teammates and management embarrassed  when, after being ruled out of the second one-day International  due to a groin injury, he appeared on the front page of  a New Zealand daily jet-skiing at Lake Wakatipu. It led to some embarrassing questions being put to Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid and coach Javed Miandad about how he went jet-skiing before the match when he was supposed to be doubtful for the Queenstown match because of a groin injury. Shoaib was hit in the nets last Friday while batting without a protector on and missed the first two games of the five-match series. Miandad tried to play down the incident saying obviously everyone wants to enjoy the place and he cannot stay in the hotel room all day. [Shoaib declared himself fit for Saturdays third one-day International, but Miandad said the pacer would undergo a fitness test before the match, an AFP report from Christchurch says. He still has a problem but Im sure he will be fit enough to play. Its up to him, Miandad said. The series is tied 1-1 and Shoaibs presence in this needle game will be crucial as he has had a stranglehold on Stephen Flemings men.] Whether he plays or not, the incident again raised questions as to what cost Pakistan cricket has to pay in return for match-winning performances from the Rawalpindi Express. This is not the first time Shoaib has rubbed the team management the wrong way by ruling himself out of a match on fitness grounds and then indulging in other activities. In Durban in January 2002, for instance, Shoaib had ruled himself out of the Test with an injury and was released by the team management to return home for treatment. But the fast bowler stayed back in Durban to attend a reception in honour of some Bollywood stars. Shoaib underwent a scan on Thursday and according to Rashid, he has some problems. He has got some problems but the type of medical terminology they used I could not understand, the manager said. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board has said if Shoaib did not recover from his injury in time, he would be called back home for treatment and asked to rest before the home series against India in March-April. A series against India is always very big and it is an ideal opportunity for him to become a hero for his country. He is a matchwinner and we want him fit for the series, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said.  Meanwhile, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said  Shoaibs presence would provide an additional challenge  for his team. We like to play against the best, even if  he does bowl at 155 kmh. Weve got to be on our game  and as weve seen from Shoaib in the past, in the one-day  game he can be expensive. But he is a world class fast bowler  Fleming said.  (PTI)  Copyright

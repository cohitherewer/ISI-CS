 Negi, Saheli clinch crowns
Kozhikode: Indias youngest IM-norm holder Parimarjan Negi of Delhi clinched an all-important win against overnight sole leader K. Vijay Keerthi in the crucial ninth and final round to claim the boys title in the national sub-junior chess championship here on Tuesday. The 11-year-old Negi effectively employed Sicilian defence against Keerthi of Karnataka to improve from an equal position in the ninth move. He secured the advantage from the 33rd after moving forward his two pawns thereby forcing his rival, who only needed a draw to settle the issue, to resign in the 51st move. Saheli Nath, who made sure of the title in the penultimate round itself by virtue of her better progressive score, went on to prove her class by engaging modern defence against P. Lakshmi Sahiti of Andhra Pradesh to record a win in 56 moves. Among boys, Keerthi, Rahul Sangma and Mary Ann Gomes (both GNCA) took the second, third and fourth positions, respectively. Top seed Soumya Swaminthan (VCA), Ramyakrishna (AP) and M. Rajadarshini (ECA) took similar spots among girls. (PTI)  Copyright

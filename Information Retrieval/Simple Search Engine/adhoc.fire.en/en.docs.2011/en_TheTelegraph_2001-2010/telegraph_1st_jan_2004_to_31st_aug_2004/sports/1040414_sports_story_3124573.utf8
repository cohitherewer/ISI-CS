 Balaji ensures jolly good Day I
 - FINAL TEST - Sami, Akbar help Pakistan recover from 137/8 to 224  Mohammed Sami pulls one en route to his fighting 49 in Rawalpindi on Tuesday. (Reuters) Irfan Pathan and Parthiv Patel celebrate the dismissal of Yusuf Youhana on TuesdayRawalpindi: India had Pakistan on the mat before allowing them to reach a fighting 224 and then lost Virender Sehwag to the first ball of the innings on the opening day of the series-deciding final Test here on Tuesday. Put into bat on a seaming wicket, the hosts were reeling at 137 for eight before the Indians faltered to allow tailenders Mohammed Sami (49) and Fazl-e-Akbar (25) add 70 for the ninth wicket. Eventually the innings folded at 224, Lakshmipathy Balaji taking a career-best four for 63. The start to the Indian innings could not have been more dramatic as Shoaib Akhtars first delivery took the edge of Sehwags bat and Yasir Hameed grabbed a brilliant, tumbling catch at gully. Wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, the other opener, and Rahul Dravid stayed unseparated in the end as India reached 23 for one in 15 overs. Balaji did the bulk of the damage in helpful conditions while Ashish Nehra, playing his first match of the three-Test series, and Irfan Pathan chipped in with two wickets each before Samis heroics pulled the hosts out of the pits. The Pakistan innings came to an end about 35 minutes before the scheduled close of play when Sami was run out by a direct Pathan throw . The home team lost Imran Farhat (16), Taufiq Umar (9), Hameed (26) and Inzamam-ul Haq (15) before lunch and another four after the break to lose the plot in the do-or-die encounter. Indias new ball operators  Pathan and Balaji  eager to exploit the conditions, tried a little too hard and as a result were guilty of straying in line and length. But just when it looked like Farhat and Umar would see through the crucial first hour, Balaji got the breakthrough in the first over of his second spell, getting rid of Umar for nine. The left-handed opener was trapped leg before with one that came in sharply, while Nehra, included in place of Ajit Agarkar, evicted Farhat in the very next over to reduce the home team to 34 for two, justifying Souravs decision to bowl first. Hameed and the in-form Inzamam took the score to 77 before Pathan joined the party by removing Hameed. The righthander had himself to blame as he slashed wide outside the off stump, only succeeded in edging to VVS Laxman at slip. The home team suffered a huge jolt in the very next over when Nehra captured the prized scalp of Inzamam inducing him to edge an outswinger to Parthiv. The Indians continued their good work in the post-lunch session by taking four more wickets to leave the hosts tottering at 137 for eight but allowed the game to drift out of control by failing to clean up the last two batsmen. Balaji snapped up three wickets in the post-lunch session accounting for Asim Kamal (21), Kamran Akmal (17) and Shoaib (0) in a span of seven overs. Anil Kumble was introduced late in the post-lunch session and he managed to dismiss the last wicket, evicting Akbar.

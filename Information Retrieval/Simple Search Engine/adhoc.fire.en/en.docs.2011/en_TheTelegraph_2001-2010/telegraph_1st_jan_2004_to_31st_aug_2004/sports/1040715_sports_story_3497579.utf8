 Murali aims to tie India in knots
 - Despite doosra ban, Lanka off-spinner still has enough tricks up his sleeve  Murali thinks extra spin is his most potent weapon Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan may have been banned from bowling his most lethal delivery but believes he has enough tricks up his sleeves to take on the Indians who have one of the best batting line-ups in the world. The spin wizard said the ban on his doosra  the delivery that moves away from right handers  was bound to affect him, although he had enough experience to develop new tricks and rattle the opposition. If you dont allow a bowler to use his weapon, it is like asking someone to run on just one leg. My main weapon has been denied to me. It surely is going to affect me, said the off-spinner. Muralidharan was practising in the NCC Cricket Club on Wednesday in the same ground where the Indians played a game against some local cricketers ahead of the Asia Cup starting Thursday. One of the most destructive bowlers in the history of the game, the off-spinner  who with Shane Warne jointly holds the highest wicket-takers mantle  feels fettered by the ICC. But he still vows to play successfully for at least another six years, a period during which he might end up with 1,000 Test scalps. I think I can play for six more years. I can still bowl a straighter one and can still impart great spin on my deliveries. Hopefully, I can also use my doosra in near future. It took me four or five years to develop this art. Muralidharan is keen to take on the Indians and feels his mental strength might see him conquer them. They are all good batsmen but it is a matter of how well they are batting on a day and how well I am bowling on that day. It is this, which decides the issue. I think the Indians will challenge me. But when I look at my strength, I have about 20 per cent natural talent and 20 per cent technique. The rest is mental strength. Cricket is a mental game and I am very focused. I practise very, very hard. Extra spin still remains my most potent weapon in this battle. The bowler was looking forward to the study proposed to be carried out by the ICC on all bowlers during the Champions Trophy in England in September.  Sourav has tremendous man-management skills, feels MuraliI will wait for the ICC decision. They are going to check everyone (during the Champions Trophy). They are going to test other players and then they will know the facts. Muralidharan has long held the belief that all off-spinners bend their arms to a certain degree while delivering the doosra and it is unavoidable. Things being what they are, Muralidharan still is looking forward to taking on the Indians and cant help gushing about Sachin Tendulkar. The pressure he (Tendulkar) gets from the outside is tremendous. I also get the same kind of pressure and I know how tough it is to live with it. Muralidharan does not think it would be fair to compare Sachin with Brian Lara. The thing is I havent played against Sachin for a long time. I have not played him for six years and that is almost half of my career. Lara has played more matches against me in these years. I bowled to Sachin in 1994-95 and he was tremendous. The off-spinner is also appreciative of Rahul Dravid who has been in exceptional form in the last two years. The thing is all five fingers are not the same. It is the same with batsmen. Dravid has been a truly great performer for India in recent years. Muralidharan does not forget to express his admiration for Team India captain Sourav Ganguly for the way he has shaped the team. Great captaincy is all about man management. Sourav has been tremendous in this field. To do so when the side is packed with great players is exceptional. He has been tremendous in this regard.

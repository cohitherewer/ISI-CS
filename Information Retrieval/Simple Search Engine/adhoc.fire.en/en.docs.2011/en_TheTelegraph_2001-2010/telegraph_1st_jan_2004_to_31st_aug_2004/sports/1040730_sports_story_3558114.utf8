 United summon stars after flop show
 FROM SAM WALLACE IN PHILADELPHIA  Ferguson has to swallow a bitter pill Sir Alex Ferguson has bowed to the criticism Manchester United have faced in the United States for failing to bring their star players on tour and will now call up Ruud van Nistelrooy and Paul Scholes even though they have not yet finished their pre-season fitness work. After an uncharacteristic change of mind, Ferguson will also bring over Mikael Silvestre and Louis Saha for the game against AC Milan at Giants Stadium in New Jersey on Saturday night after admitting that the club had to save its reputation in America. The decision, which was taken reluctantly, has revealed just how important United regard their commercial impact in the United States. The clubs board has been surprised by the response of fans and sponsors after United fielded a team of mainly youth and reserve players against Bayern Munich in Chicago last Sunday and has asked Ferguson to call up the four internationals. Some sections of the 58,121 crowd at Soldier Field booed and there was stinging criticism in the Chicago newspapers. All four players had been told they could miss the tour after playing in Euro 2004 and were preparing for the new season in Manchester. Ferguson admitted he was not happy with the prospect of them playing before they had completed the clubs requisite ten days of summer conditioning, but will fly out new fitness coach Valter di Salvo to monitor their physical state. Theres been a lot of criticism of the team we put out and I wish I could have put out a better one, but there was just no way I could do it, Ferguson said. The people here want to see the stars. I dont think they understand why I would leave a player like Van Nistelrooy behind. But we dont want them to think were being blas about having 67,000 people come to see us here and 72,000 in New York. If we bring them over, it will probably be for just half an hour. You may say thats a waste of time for them to come over one day and then go back the next. But theyd fly first class, its only a six-and-half-hour journey, and it may be worth it for our reputation over here. Ferguson said he had scrapped plans to pick reserve goalkeeper Ricardo in favour of the American Tim Howard. Last summer, Howard, a native of New Jersey, proved the star attraction as United played four matches with virtually full-strength teams in venues from Los Angeles to New York. It was so successful last year and it was an easy decision to come back, Ferguson said. But when we made that decision, we didnt know about the Copa America tournament. Then we picked up some injuries, which meant some players werent able to join us. I feel for the fans who come to watch the games. They are entitled to see the best United players but its hard for them to understand the difficulties I have in presenting that to them.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 State guest status for Rahul, Priyanka
 - Siblings to be seen in Karachi; Amitabh, Shah Rukh decline PCB invitation for Lahore ODIs  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Lahore: Indias most-in-the-news siblings, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka, will be in Karachi on Saturday to cheer Sourav Gangulys team in person. They are going to be accompanied by Priyankas husband, Robert Vadra. According to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Rameez Raja, all three will be state guests and the PCBs responsibility is going to be limited to hospitality at the National Stadium, venue of the first ODI. On the issue of guests, Rameez clarified the PCB wasnt inviting Indian politicians  something talked about in sections of the Media. Yes, we did invite Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan (for the two ODIs here, on March 21 and 24), but nobody else who isnt connected with cricket. Of course, the PCB will be inviting some former Indian cricketers in partnership with your Board, he said, during a brief interaction with The Telegraph. Incidentally, both Amitabh and Shah Rukh have declined the PCBs invitation. The list of select former Indian cricketers, though, hasnt been finalised. Im awaiting a response from the other side, Rameez remarked, indicating the PCB would pick up 70 per cent of the expenses. Meanwhile, the PCBs patron, President Pervez Musharraf, hasnt yet confirmed making an appearance either during the Rawalpindi ODI (March 16) or the Rawalpindi Test (April 13-17).  Copyright

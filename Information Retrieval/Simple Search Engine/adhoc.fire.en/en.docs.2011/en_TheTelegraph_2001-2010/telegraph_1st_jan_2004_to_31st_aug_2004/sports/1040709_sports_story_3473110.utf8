The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mancini takes over at Inter
 Roberto Mancini Rome, July 8 (Reuters): Roberto Mancini has taken over as coach of Inter Milan, joining the Serie A side on a three-year deal after resolving a dispute with Lazio, the club announced on Wednesday. The 39-year-old succeeds Alberto Zaccheroni, who resigned last month after only eight months in charge. FC Internazionale communicates that it has sealed the signing of Roberto Mancini. The coach has put pen to paper on a contract which ties him to the club until 30 June 2007, Inter said on its website. His appointment ends months of speculation in the Italian media, which even before the end of last season reported Inter owner Massimo Moratti had decided to replace Zaccheroni with Mancini. When Zaccheroni resigned, Inter president Giacinto Facchetti told a shareholders meeting Mancini would sign for Inter within days, but his move was slowed by a dispute with Lazio, with whom he had a contract until 2008. Lazios decision on Tuesday to release Mancini, however, opened the way for him to take up the Inter post. Mancini, who as a player won Serie A titles with Sampdoria and Lazio as well as making 36 international appearances for Italy, is considered one of the brightest young coaches in Serie A. Having started out as assistant to current England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson at Lazio, Mancini took over at Fiorentina during the 2000-2001 season, leading them to the Italian Cup in his first season in charge. He quit the following year as Fiorentina spiralled towards bankruptcy before rejoining Rome-based Lazio in August 2002. Mancini again had to cope with serious financial problems that forced the departures of players Alessandro Nesta and Hernan Crespo, but guided the club to fourth place in Serie A and the semi-finals of the Uefa Cup in the 2002-03 season. Last season Lazio won the Italian Cup and finished sixth in Serie A. At Inter, money is less of an issue than the inability of a series of high-profile coaches to turn huge investment by Moratti into success on the pitch. Since acquiring the club in February 1995, Moratti has bought and sold a string of world-class players, but the Serie A title has eluded him.  Copyright

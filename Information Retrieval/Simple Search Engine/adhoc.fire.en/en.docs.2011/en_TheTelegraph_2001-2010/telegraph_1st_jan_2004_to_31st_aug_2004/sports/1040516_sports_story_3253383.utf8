The Telegraph - Calcutta
 And now, Team Pakistan
 Rameez Islamabad, May 15 (PTI): Taking a cue from the Indians, the PCB will soon adopt a new slogan  Team Pakistan  to give a thrust to team effort. PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said the board would replace the old slogan  Proud to be a Pakistani  with the new one and market it aggressively. The thrust is going to be on team effort and team performance. Our mission statement is going to be reflected in our future strategy and we are going to market it aggressively, Rameez said on Friday. In future, once the policy decision is taken by chairman Shaharyar Khan and the advisory council, the board will be referring to the national team as Team Pakistan in all its future press releases, statements and tour schedules, he was quoted by a local daily. Rameez said for the team to do well, a cohesion and unity of thought and performance was required from every player as the goal was common for all of them. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, meanwhile, has sought an audience with President Pervez Musharraf next week to seek his opinion on whether to advertise for the CEOs post. Board sources said that Shaharyar would also try and get the chief patron to instruct Rameez not to do commentary while he is working as chief executive in the board.  Copyright

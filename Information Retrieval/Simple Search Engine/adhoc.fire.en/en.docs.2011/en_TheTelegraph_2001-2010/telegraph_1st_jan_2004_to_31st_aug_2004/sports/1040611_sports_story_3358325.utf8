The Telegraph - Calcutta
Competition good for me
- Balaji-Pathan presence does not worry Ashish Nehra Lakshmipathy Balaji and Zaheer Khan at the NCA in Bangalore on Thursday. (AFP) Bangalore: Asserting that he was not worried by competition for the medium pacers slot following the emergence of Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan, left-arm speedster Ashish Nehra Thursday said his prime concern was to remain fit and injury-free. Its good for me and the team (because) if one bowler is injured, you have a good back-up, Nehra told reporters here when asked about the growing competition for medium pacers slots. It (competition) is not worrying for me because whenever I am fit, I have always played. Its not like that I am fit and I am not playing, said Nehra, who is attending the fitness camp for fast bowlers here. Asked whether he would have to work that much harder to retain his place in the squad because of the competition, he said: In international cricket, one always has to work hard irrespective of whether there is competition or not. Such competition is good for Indian cricket. Balaji and Irfan did well in the last two series. Good for all of us and Indian cricket, he added. Asked if he was happy with the way his career had shaped so far, he said: Its not only me. If you ask Sachin Tendulkar, he wont be happy with his career, he wants to score more and more runs. I am happy that I have played for India, specifically in the last three-four years. But I would be happier if I am injury-free, thats the main worry for me... Its not the performance that worries me always. Nehra said injury to fast bowlers was quite common. It seems (injury) happens to me more and more but injury hits any fast bowler. Its not in my hands. My job is to work hard and thats what I am doing. On the coming series against Australia and South Africa at home, he said the fast bowlers would have a tough task on their hands. It would be difficult for any fast bowler on Indian wickets. But we will try our best. The seamer said yoga was good for fast bowlers but they were only having yoga sessions during camps in Bangalore. If its available to all of us throughout the year, it will be good for us. On his bowling speed, Nehra said: I think, I have enough of speed. It would be better for me, if I concentrate on my line and length.  (PTI)  Copyright

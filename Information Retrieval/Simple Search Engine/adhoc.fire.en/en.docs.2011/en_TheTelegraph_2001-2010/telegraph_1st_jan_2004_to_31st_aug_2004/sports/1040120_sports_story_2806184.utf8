The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mixed luck for Asians
Melbourne: Paradorn Srichaphans high profile in Asia has never helped him at the Australian Open, where he has not advanced past the second round in four previous tournaments. But Paradorn, seeded 13th at the season-opening Grand Slam, hopes to change that this year. On Monday, he advanced to the second round with a 7-5, 6-4, 6-0 win over Jose Acasuso of Argentina. Fellow Thai player Tamarine Tanasugarn lost her first-round match. Seeded 31st and in her eighth Australian Open, she struggled for rhythm and timing and was beaten by American Laura Granville 1-6, 3-6. Its always tough to play in Australia, its quite windy, Paradorn said after his 94-minute win over Acasuso. What I did well was maintain my level, I played a lot of balls in court. I think I played well. Paradorn, who next faces French qualifier Jerome Golmard, said his immediate aim was to advance to the second week of the tournament. He made the fourth round at both Wimbledon and the US Open in his two previous Grand Slam starts. Its good to get through the first round in three sets, said Paradorn, who completed the match with his usual bow to the four sides of the court. It is the second time Tamarine has been beaten in the first round at the Australian Open, and the first time since 1999. She had advanced to the third round for the previous four years. Tamarine said she has felt sluggish at the start of the year. Its hard for me this year. I have problems starting well, said Tamarine, beaten in the second round at the Canberra Classic last week. Tamarine handed her rival a number of easy points, making 36 unforced errors to Granvilles 21. Tamarine won just 43 points for the match, to Granvilles 66. Its tough to go out there and start playing well, my rhythm was not there, she said. Tamarine was playing in her 29th Grand Slam event since 1997.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Lazio rally to lift fourth Italian Cup 
 - EURO SOCCAR - Liverpool poised for Champions League berth  Lazios Jaap Stam (right) and Massimo Oddo with the Italian Cup in Turin on Wednesday. (Reuters) London, May 13 (Reuters): Newcastle Uniteds dream of a place in the Champions League was snuffed out in a 3-3 draw at Southampton on Wednesday, all but handing qualification to Liverpool. Substitute Leandre Griffit, who had been on the pitch seven minutes, put Southampton 3-2 ahead after a breakaway two minutes from time after the home side had trailed twice. Midfielder Darren Ambrose squeezed in an injury-time equaliser for Newcastle but it was not enough to keep them in contention for fourth spot. The Magpies needed to beat both Southampton and Liverpool in their last Premier League match on Saturday to bag Englands fourth and remaining berth in Europes premier club competition. Liverpool can now only be caught by Aston Villa on points but fifth-placed Villa have a far inferior goal difference. Champions Arsenal and second-placed Chelsea have qualified for the Champions League group stage, while Manchester United, who are third, go into the third qualifying round. Sixth-placed Newcastle are now battling with Villa and Bolton Wanderers for a Uefa Cup berth. Meanwhile, Lazio lifted the Italian Cup for the fourth time when they played out a 2-2 draw against Juventus on Wednesday. Newcastle manager Bobby Robson pointed to his teams disappointing away form and said: If wed played like this (on Wednesday night) much of the season away from home wed be laughing, wed have been home and dry, but then Liverpool might be saying the same sort of things. Theyve had some depressing results, we can all say well, if only, if is the biggest word Ive ever known in football. But overall weve come a long way from four years ago and I hope our supporters will remember that. Weve had injuries to big players at the wrong time, added Robson, who was without the likes of England centre-back Jonathan Woodgate and Wales striker Craig Bellamy and took a risk with half-fit England midfielder Keiron Dyer. Striker Shola Ameobi put Newcastle ahead in the seventh minute from a cross by left back Olivier Bernard. Englands James Beattie equalised in the 19th when he netted the rebound from close range after goalkeeper Shay Given had parried Swedish midfielder Anders Svenssons shot. Newcastle went in front again in the 35th when Lee Bowyer met Ameobis low cross first time with a crisp left-foot strike that flew past debutant goalkeeper Alan Blayney. Again Saints drew level, this time after only four minutes when central defender Titus Bramble turned a cross into his own net with his knee. Newcastle hit the woodwork twice early in the second half and Blayney made a brilliant diving save from Alan Shearer. It was a world class save, he had no right to make that save, exclaimed Robson. In Italian Cup action, Lazio came back from two goals down to lift the Italian Cup with a 2-2 draw at Juventus in the second leg to secure a 4-2 aggregate win. Juventus, trailing 2-0 from the first leg, pulled a goal back through French striker David Trezeguet in the 20th minute and then Alessandro Del Piero brought the tie level with a goal right after the interval. But Lazio fought back with a header from Bernardo Corradi and a late Stefano Fiore strike to make it 2-2. This crowns a super season for us, said Lazio coach Roberto Mancini. Lyon eye title Meanwhile in Paris, a superb Juninho Pernambucano free-kick gave Olympique Lyon a 1-0 victory over Bastia on Wednesday to put them in sight of a third successive Ligue 1 title. The Brazilian international midfielder beat Bastia goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau in the 26th minute for his 10th goal of the season to take Lyon to 76 points. Second-placed Monaco were held 0-0 at Racing Strasbourg and are now four points behind with two games left. Paris St Germain are six points behind. Paris St Germain squandered their last title chance with a 3-0 humiliation at Girondins Bordeaux on Tuesday. Guineas Pascal Feindouno scored twice for Bordeaux for whom goalkeeper Ulrich Rame saved two penalties. At the bottom Montpellier look doomed to be relegated after drawing 1-1 with Olympique Marseille.  Copyright

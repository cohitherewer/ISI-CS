 South Korea drub India 6-1 in final
New Delhi, May 18 (PTI): In yet another disappointing show, India were handed a humiliating 1-6 defeat by South Korea in the final of the four-nation Prince Takamado hockey tournament in Gifu, Japan on Tuesday. The Koreans proved to be the nemesis for India in the womens section as well, as they went down to their rivals 4-0 in the playoff for the third place. Riding on a hattrick by Yi Chong-Son, the South Koreans completely dominated India before clinching the title with a comprehensive victory. The Indian team, comprising mainly of youngsters, were caught napping with Chong-Son, the tournaments highest scorer, pumping in two quick ones in successive minutes (16th and 17th). The Koreans made it 3-0 in the 25th minute when Hwang Chong-Hyon hit a reverse flick off a rebound. India launched a counter-attack and their efforts paid off when young Sandeep Michael sounded the board in the 28th minute. The Koreans returned with a vengeance after the break to slam three more goals through Yi, who completed his hattrick with a goal in the 40th minute, So Chong-Ho (57) and Yu Ko-Sik (59). Although the Koreans were superior, the Indians were a trifle unlucky as two golden opportunities went amiss when Jatinderpal Singhs shot hit the post and Vivek Guptas strike was stopped by an alert Korean keeper Ko Tong-Sik. Hosts Japan finished third after they beat China 3-1 in the play-off for the third place. Nishimura (39), Yasui (54) and Noda (60) scored for the winners. The womens title was clinched by the hosts who beat China 2-1 through goals by Miura (16) and Komori (62). Indian women finished a dismal last, losing the playoff for the third place 0-4 to South Korea. Sait, Satinder chosen Indias Muneer Sait and Satinder Kumar have been selected by the international hockey federation (FIH) to officiate as judge and umpire, respectively, in the August 13-29 Olympic Games hockey tournament in Athens.

 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mike Okoro has been having a golden run of late. And the AFC Cup has already started bringing offers to East Bengals versatile Nigerian. Though he was the Man of the Match in Negeri Sembilan coach K. Devans book after Wednesdays match, it is an offer from the Singapore club Geylang United which is making the player think. Geylang wants me for the next season and I dont mind going out of India, Okoro told The Telegraph on Thursday. But right now, East Bengal commitments are the biggest priority. Ive told Geylang officials that I want to finish this season They can come with the offer after that and Ill think. Okoro made no bones about the fact that this is the best phase of his career. Yes, this is the best Ive playedBut Im confident that this can improve. He played as a roving midfielder on Wednesday and excelled. But Okoro felt he was as good against Geylang. Both these performances will give me confidence to perform better in the later stages. After a lean trot towards the end of last year, Okoro has come back roaring and has attributed the success to the hard work that Ive put in. How far can East Bengal go in the AFC Cup? The way were playing, I believe, the distance, Okoro signed off.  Copyright

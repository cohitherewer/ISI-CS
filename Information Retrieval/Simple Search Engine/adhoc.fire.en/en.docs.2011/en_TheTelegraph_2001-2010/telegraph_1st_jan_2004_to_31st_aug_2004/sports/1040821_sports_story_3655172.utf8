The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Technology juxtaposes with chaos 
Amsterdam: Technology will take a giant step forward in the world of cricket when the tri-series opener here on Saturday will have no-balls called by the third and not the on-field umpires. In an experimental rule introduced by the ICC, the third umpire will make a ruling on the no-balls and convey his decision to umpires standing in the middle through two-way radio system. It is yet another attempt by the games authorities to minimise mistakes, even though a batsman standing at the crease almost surely would not be able to take advantage of it. Steve Bucknor and David Shepherd, the two longest-serving umpires in the game, are also unlikely to be amused at yet another bastion of their profession being taken away from them. Meanwhile, the organisers have made a request to the airport authorities to rework the route of aircrafts flying overhead as Schipol, the international airport, is situated nearby. Aircrafts cross the ground so low that one can actually read the names of the airlines. Batsmen have another reason to feel distracted  there is no sightscreen on the one side of the ground for them. The organisers are busy arranging for a makeshift sightscreen for the match which could be pulled down from the top of the commentators box. But the only worry is that when it is pulled down the television crew and commentators vision would be completely blacked out! The players dressing room is so situated that they would be straining their necks to catch the action in the middle. And last but not the least, so small is the ground and so high are the trees and the canal nearby that a lot of balls will almost surely be lost because of big hitting. (PTI)  Copyright

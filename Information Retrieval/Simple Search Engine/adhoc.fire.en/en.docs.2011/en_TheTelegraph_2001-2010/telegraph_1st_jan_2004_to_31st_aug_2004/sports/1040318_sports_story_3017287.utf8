 Collins to replace injured Edwards
Kingston: Left-arm seamer Pedro Collins has been drafted into West Indies squad in place of the injured Fidel Edwards for the second Test against England, which starts on Friday in Port of Spain. West Indies officials said Edwards strained the left side of his lower back after taking three wickets in the opening Test, which the hosts lost by 10 wickets. Batsman Dwayne Smith, who missed the first Test with a dislocated finger, was also included in the 13-man squad. The 27-year-old Collins has taken 55 wickets in 19 Tests. His last international appearance was against Australia in April 2003. England lead the four-match series 1-0 and are looking to win a series in the Caribbean for the first time since 1968.

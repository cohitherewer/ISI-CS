The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and George Telegraph each earned 1-0 victories as the Calcutta Super Divisions current season kicked off here on Monday.				 																																																	Port Trust, coached by Krishnendu Roy, are known to choke as soon as they concede a goal. On Monday, though they went into the attack from the start and in the tenth minute Shyam Babu Routh took a ball from near the top of the box and dodged a couple of Eastern Railway defenders before netting the winner. The rest of the match, however, was dull, with Port bolstering the defence.				 																																																	George, too, got an early winner, over CFC, Amit Biswas scoring in the 19th minute.				 																																																	Interestingly, the fourth referee at the Port-Railway match was a lady  Chaitali Pal. It was a good feeling, being able to be a part of a mens game, she said later. 				 																																																	She said she had been fourth referee in an East Bengal match last season as well. In the fifth division match between South Folk and Maitree Sangha, Shukla Nag was scheduled to be main referee, but Maitree were absent.

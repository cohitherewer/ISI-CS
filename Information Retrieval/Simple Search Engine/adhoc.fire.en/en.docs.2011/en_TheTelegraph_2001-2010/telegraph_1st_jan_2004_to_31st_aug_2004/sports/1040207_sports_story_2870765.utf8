The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lewis hangs up gloves
London: Lennox Lewis announced his retirement from professional boxing on Friday. The 38-year-old Briton is only the third heavyweight after Americans Gene Tunney and Rocky Marciano to retire while still the world champion. I would like to announce that June 21, 2003, was my last professional fight, Lewis told a news conference. Its not easy becoming heavyweight champion of the world and its even harder to stay at the top. Im a person who believes that if you cant give 110 per cent then you shouldnt do it. I respect boxing a great deal and one of the reasons that Im retiring is because I respect it so much. Its time for the younger generation of boxers to have their chance. I realised there was no straight road to becoming heavyweight champion of the world, Lewis added. I realised there would be bumps on the road. To go out and achieve what Ive achieved, Im proud of being heavyweight champion of the world for the last decade. I learned on this trip that if you lose that doesnt mean that it is the end of your boxing career. I brushed myself off and got back to it. (Reuters)  Copyright

				 																																	Wellington: Former All Black winger Jonah Lomu has undergone a kidney transplant in a New Zealand hospital after a suitable donor became available, New Zealand media reported on Thursday.				 																																	Lomu, 29, who has been suffering from nephrotic syndrome for almost 10 years, received a new kidney during an operation on Tuesday. Dr John Mayhew, the former All Black team doctor who has been treating Lomu, said it was too early to comment on the success of the transplant.				 																																	Surgeons confirm that the operation went according to plan and Jonah is in a stable condition, Mayhew was quoted as saying by local news agency NZPA. 				 																																	Rochester (New York): Former undisputed heavyweight champion Hasim The Rock Rahman knocked out Terrence Lewis with a left jab that broke his nose 43 seconds into the second round.

The fighter from Baltimore got his 32nd career knockout on Wednesday and raised his record to 39-5-1. Lewis, from Philadelphia, fell to 31-14-1 with his third straight loss.				 																																	Rahman used a plodding, workmanlike approach to put Lewis against the ropes from the start and bloodied his face, setting the stage for his thunderous finish.

 Sachin bats for injured junior
Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar visited a local hospital on Saturday night to see an under 14 Mumbai cricketer, who is in a semi-conscious state after falling from a train. I requested Tendulkar to visit Mohsin Shaikh at the hospital whenever he was free. He went there to see him on Saturday night, MCA joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty said on Monday. Tendulkar said a few words to the boy who can open his eyes if someone speaks to him. The star batsman also left behind his gloves for the youngster. Shaikh fell off a local train while returning from a camp in May. His treatment costs are being borne by the MCA.  (PTI)  Copyright

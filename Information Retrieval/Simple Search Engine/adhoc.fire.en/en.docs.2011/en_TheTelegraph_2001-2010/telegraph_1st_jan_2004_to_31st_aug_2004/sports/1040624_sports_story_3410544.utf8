The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Flintoff out with foot injury
 - Tri-series - England take on New Zealand in opening match today  England captain Michael Vaughan at the Old Trafford nets on Wednesday. (AFP) Manchester: England allrounder Andrew Flintoff will miss the triangular series against New Zealand and the West Indies with a left foot injury, the team announced on Wednesday. Flintoff was injured in the third Test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge 10 days ago while bowling a fast spell. He underwent intensive medical treatment but has been told to rest for at least two weeks. England play New Zealand in the series opener on Thursday in Manchester. Flintoff is hoping to be fit for a Test against the West Indies on July 22. Our priority is to get him fit for the start of the Test series against the West Indies, England and Wales Cricket board medical officer Peter Gregory said. Marcus Trescothick, arguably Englands top opening batsman, is also questionable. He twisted his left ankle during training on Monday. Allrounder Rikki Clarke and uncapped batsman Michael Powell were called up as injury cover on Tuesday. Meanwhile, England captain Michael Vaughan is hoping England will use the tri-series as a building block in their quest to win the Champions Trophy. Obviously we are trying to pick our squad to win every tournament that we are in, starting with this one, but the big one at the end of the summer is that Champions Trophy. I keep talking about building, but while you are building you can win games as well and its a great opportunity for everyone in the squad to really make their mark on the game, Vaughan said. Vaughan said of Flintoff, Englands current player of the year: Weve got to look at the long term and the summer weve got ahead. We definitely dont want to risk him in a game and put him back a few weeks. Earlier this month England completed a 3-0 Test whitewash of New Zealand having defeated the West Indies by the same scoreline during their preceding Test series in the Caribbean. Fast bowler Stephen Harmison was instrumental in both those victories and England will be wary of overbowling their prized asset. That should see the likes of James Anderson getting a chance to revive their international careers. Although overwhelmed in the Tests, the West Indies fought back to square the subsequent one-day series at 2-2. The West Indies, despite the embarrassment of a defeat by Ireland earlier in their tour, look to be finding form with their key batting trio of captain Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul all in the runs in recent matches. Before the Ireland defeat, Lara admitted: Its been tough, England beating the West Indies (in a Test series) for the first time in 36 years. Thats the past. We have to look forward to the next Test series and one-day tournaments. Weve learned from our experiences. Meanwhile New Zealand, under coach John Bracewell, the mastermind behind Gloucestershires run of six one-day trophies in five years until he quit the English county at the end of last season, have won nine of their 11 limited overs Internationals since the former Test off-spinner took charge. And the Black Caps captain Stephen Fleming said: We have to win this tournament, get to the final at Lords, to make sure we go home with our heads held higher than they would have been if we were knocked out early.

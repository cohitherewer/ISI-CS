The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tour ties are the fillip we need
 - AIFE and EB deserve kudos for arranging warm-up matches  in England
 FREE-KICK - P.K. BANERJEE 
		 Rajat Ghosh Dastidar played  the match of his life against MaritimoIt was heartening to see the Indian under-17 team and East Bengal play warm-up matches in England. Not often do you see footballers from this country displaying their skills in the land of the games origin. The Leicester City 120th anniversary tournament and the four matches the juniors played against academy sides were just the kind of fillip we need. The AIFF and East Bengal officials must be complimented for succeeding in lining up these games. This tour was immensely helpful for the junior national team ahead of the Asian under-17 finals to be played in Japan in September. For East Bengal, it was an important international outing ahead of the AFC Cup quarter final against Al Jaish of Syria. It was a fantastic opportunity for the coaching staff of these teams to evaluate their strength. East Bengal did well to come off with a 0-1 defeat against Leicester Citys experimental side and were outplayed in every possible manner in the second match against Maritimo. The standout performers for Subhas Bhowmicks team were the goalkeepers  Sangram Mukherjee in the first match and Rajat Ghosh Dastidar in the second. The latter had to effect more saves in the second game because against Leicester City, East Bengal had packed their defence with nine, with just Bhaichung Bhutia up front. Against Maritimo, Rajat had less protection. We dont see too many Bengalis in the senior Indian team these days, but the state still produces the finest of goalkeepers you will find in India. Those who tuned in for highlights of the Leicester City tournament saw a few of the numerous saves Rajat made against Maritimo. There were many more and this former India goalkeeper certainly played the match of his life. It is probably clear now that a goalkeepers services are sought more desperately when other parts of the team dont do well. Against Leicester City, Subhas Bhowmick tried his best by crowding out the midfield and defence. They should still have won a penalty, but well before that tackle on him, Bhutia should have taken a shot at the goal. Against Maritimo, East Bengal were simply taken apart. Poor Bhowmick could only watch and think  of the team that won the ASEAN Club Championship. This East Bengal is not a patch on what they were last year. The defence is severely depleted by the absence of Mahesh Gawli and M. Suresh, while also missing are the towering Suley Musah and Surkumar Singh, that bundle of power and speed down the right. Add to it the absence of Mike Okoro or Cristiano Junior and Bhutia cuts a lonely figure as forward. It will be very difficult for East Bengal to repeat the success they achieved in the last two seasons, unless they get some good reinforcements. Its too early to say how good their new recruits are because they have not had the time to prepare. Bhowmick will still rely a lot on Douglas and much will depend on how he uses Nigerian Louis Aniweta. If these two are used in midfield, a foreign striker and the return of Debjit Ghosh will add a lot of balance to his team. I know he treated the England trip as a chance to show the world that in some corner of India people are trying to develop the game along methodical and scientific lines. I wish him well for the AFC Cup. The Indian under-17 team is good in terms of basic skills, technique and health but short on height. With this height, we will face problems against Iran and Qatar. We must beat Malaysia in our last match and cant afford lose to the other two if we are to make the quarters from our group. All four semi-finalists from this event will make it to the under-19 World Cup. In England, the players beat an assortment of Indian and African boys 5-3, lost to the academy teams of Leicester City and Stokes City 2-5 and 1-2 before beating Birmingham City academy 1-0. We made some tactical adjustments, which may draw frowns, but we need these to derive the best possible result from the resources we have. Its not impossible for this team to do well.  Copyright

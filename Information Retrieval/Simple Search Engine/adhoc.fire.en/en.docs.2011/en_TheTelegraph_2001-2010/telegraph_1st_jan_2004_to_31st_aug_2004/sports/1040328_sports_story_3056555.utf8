The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA in strong position
Wellington: Herschelle Gibbs made an eventful 77 and Jacques Rudolph 60 not out as South Africa played themselves into a strong position on the second day of the third Test against New Zealand Saturday. Contributions of 48 from Martin van Jaarsveld, who was unbeaten at stumps, and 47 from captain Graeme Smith carried South Africa to 237 for three in reply to New Zealands first innings of 297 at the Basin Reserve. Gibbs rode his luck on his way to his 16th half century in Tests but his 2 -hour innings, which was decorated with 12 boundaries, pushed South Africa steadily towards first-innings superiority. Martin struck twice within four overs of tea to remove Gibbs and Gary Kirsten and slant the match briefly in New Zealands favour. Kirsten, playing his 101st and last Test, was caught by McCullum off Martin, dismissed for 1 for the third time in three innings. South Africa were then 136 for three, trailing New Zealand by 161 runs and the match might have tipped substantially towards New Zealand. But Rudolph and Van Jaarsveld stayed together in a partnership producing 101 runs by stumps. Earlier, Shaun Pollock took two wickets, Nicky Boje and Andre Nel one each, as South Africa took only 14 overs to wrap up the New Zealand first innings. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PSB set up showdown with Army XI 
 - BEIGHTON CUP SEMI-FINALS - Baljit Saini hit on the jaw, to miss final  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Naginderjit Singh (left) collects the ball after hitting the PSB matchwinner against Punjab Police in their Beighton Cup semi-final at the CC amp;FC on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Punjab amp; Sind Bank (PSB) rode a last-minute goal from Naginderjit Singh to the final of the Indian Oil Servo 109th Beighton Cup. The bankmen, who came from behind to knock out Punjab Police 2-1, will clash with Army XI in Sundays title-clash. The armymen needed an Avtar Singh golden goal to edge past Corps of Signals in Saturdays first semi-final. PSB captain Baljit Saini couldnt be present at the CC amp;FC ground to see his teams progress to the title-round as the Indian left-half was taken to a nursing home after being struck a painful blow on the jaw by a police players stick. The collision happened in the 33rd minute when PSB were pressing for the lead. Saini bled profusely as he suffered deep cuts near the gum area. He needed eight stitches before being released from the nursing home. Its not a major injury, but he will miss the final, informed BHA secretary Gurbux Singh. Undaunted by the captains departure, PSB continued to probe the rival area and forced five penalty corners in the second session. The eventual matchwinner came following a penalty corner just when everyone had taken extra-time for granted. Sharanjit Singhs 69th-minute penalty corner push saw his teammates failing to capitalise, but the illegal clearance from a Punjab Police defender led to another penalty corner. This time, instead of taking a direct hit, the PSB players exchanged a few passes before the ball was released for Naginderjit on the right. The PSB defender didnt miss the target from close range.

after the injuryPunjab Police had taken the lead against the run of play, converting their only penalty corner of the match in the 16th minute. PSB keeper Maninder Singh had no answer to Jaskaran Singhs direct shot. Despite falling behind early, PSB had only themselves to blame for taking so long in closing out the match. And Mandeep Singh should take the bulk of the blame, failing to find the target on either side of half-time with the goalkeeper completely at his mercy. Mandeeps first shocking miss came four minutes after the Punjab Police goal, as he hit straight at Punjab Police custodian Manpreet Singh from hand-shaking distance. Sharanjit Singh made amends for his teammate by converting a 28th-minute penalty corner. PSBs maintained their attacking thrust in the second half and Rajwinder Singhs goal, off another penalty corner, was ruled illegal. In the 62nd minute, Mandeep repeated his first-half mistake. Getting the ball in the clear following Manpreets blocking of a Ravi Pal shot, Mandeep directed his hit straight at the custodian. After a reverse-flick by Punjab Police midfielder Amit Singh had missed the target, Naginderjit won PSBs day. Opportunistic goal In the first semi-final, J.P. Singh gave Corps of Signals the lead in the 16th minute. He followed a Ghanashyam Dass hit, which was partially blocked by the goalkeeper, and coolly placed the ball in. Army XI reacted in brilliant fashion, putting the rivals to the sword in the second half. They deservedly equalised in the 43rd minute when Avtar Singh converted a penalty corner. It was almost one-way traffic but poor finishing by the army forwards took the match into extra-time. Army XI missed another penalty corner in the very first minute of extra-time. A little later, captain Cyrian Aind missed the target from inside the striking zone. Seven minutes into extra-time, Army XI clinched the issue. C.S. Xalcos penalty corner hit caught Signals Pius Kujur on the wrong foot and the umpire rightly awarded a penalty stroke. Avtar made no mistake.  Copyright

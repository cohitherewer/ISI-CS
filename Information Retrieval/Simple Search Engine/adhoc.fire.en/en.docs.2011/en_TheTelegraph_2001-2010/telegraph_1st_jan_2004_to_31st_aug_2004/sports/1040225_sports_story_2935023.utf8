The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two-year ban on Chambers
London: Britains European 100 metres champion Dwain Chambers was banned for two years on Tuesday after failing a test for the new designer steroid THG. Chambers, 25, tested positive for tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) in an out-of-competition test last August. Four American track and field athletes have also tested positive for the steroid, which was discovered in a Los Angeles laboratory last year. The sprinters lawyer said he was considering an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In a statement released on Tuesday, UK Athletics said the ban, which runs from November, 2003, followed a disciplinary hearing last week. Chambers denied knowingly taking a banned substance. UK Athletics is proud of the fact that we conduct a full programme of in and out-of-competition testing alongside targeted testing to ensure we do all we can to protect those athletes who compete fairly, said chief executive David Moorcroft. We are mindful of the fact that this may lead to adverse findings and that publicity resulting from a positive finding can hurt the sport, but we feel this is a price worth paying to keep the sport clean. At a later news conference, Moorcroft said the Chambers verdict was a test case for THG. We are at the front of a worldwide issue, he said. Im relieved that a verdict has been reached. Im deeply disappointed for Dwain but its the right verdict. We all must now move on. Graham Shear, Chambers lawyer, issued a statement saying that the athlete continued to assert his innocence. The decision of the tribunal is being studied in detail for the purposes of considering a possible appeal to the Court of Arbritration for Sport, he said. The independent Lausanne-based court is recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) as the final court of appeal in drugs cases. IAAF spokesman Nick Davies welcomed the decision. A two-year ban is pretty emphatic. Its basically the end for most careers. In this case its appropriate, he said.  (Reuters)  Copyright

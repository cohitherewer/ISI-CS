The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Officials squabble as players send plea
 EVEN COACH ALOKE MUKHERJEES PERSONAL VISIT TO BARRETOS HOUSE FAILED TO MOVE THE BRAZILIAN FROM HIS STANDBY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: As Jose Ramirez Barreto announced he will be going back to Brazil without taking any further part in the National Football League, rival Mohun Bagan factions, led by secretary Anjan Mitra and assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury, respectively, promptly put the blame on each other. However, the players were trying their best to ensure the talismanic striker does not desert the Bagan ship, especially when it is going through tough times. Captain Rennedy Singh, senior player Basudeb Mondal and coach Aloke Mukherjee visited Barretos house to convince him to stay back, but the Brazilian was not there. Later, talking to The Telegraph, Rennedy said: Well again visit him tomorrow and will do our best to see to it that he stays. Barreto had alleged Thursday that some of the officials have blamed him for not giving his 100 per cent on the field. But the skipper made it clear there is no way Barreto can give anything less on the field. He is such a wholehearted footballer and always gives 100 per cent. If he leaves, it will be a huge loss for us, Rennedy added. Mukherjee, meanwhile, had gone to Barretos place on Thursday night itself trying to see to it that the Brazilian comes for practice on Friday. However, Barreto didnt turn up. Though the striker could not be contacted, sources close to him informed he has not moved from his earlier stance and will leave as soon as possible. He said he will be missing the fans more than anyone else. But the attitude of the officials has really been a blow and he will he be going back, the source said. On the other hand, both the assistant secretary and the secretary met the player. Dutta said later that Barreto has told him that it is impossible for him to continue in Mohun Bagan because of the officials who are in charge. He promised to convince the player to stay back. Chowdhury blamed that it was entirely the handiwork of the Mitra-group to insult Barreto, but hoped he will not leave the country. Ill have another meeting with him, Chowdhury said.  Copyright

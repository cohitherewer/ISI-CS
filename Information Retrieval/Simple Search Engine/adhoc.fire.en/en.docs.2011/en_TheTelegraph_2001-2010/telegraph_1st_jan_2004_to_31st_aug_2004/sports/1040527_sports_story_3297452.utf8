The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Beckham has no ifs about Butt
 FROM HENRY WINTER IN CAGLIARI Englands preparations for Euro 2004 intensified here at their breezy Sardinian hideaway Tuesday with the captain, David Beckham, stressing that a specialist ball-winner was crucial in tackling France in 18 days time. Thoughts of Lisbon, of Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry are beginning to seize England players minds. The temperature is rising. The debate over whether Frank Lampard or Nicky Butt should start alongside Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes in midfield seems to be shifting heavily in Butts favour, despite Lampards outstanding form for Chelsea and Butts rustiness as a Manchester United fringe player. Lampard offers greater creativity and goals but Butt, a more natural anchorman, can kill off opposing attacks. You need someone who can win the ball in midfield and Nicky Butt is definitely that player, said Beckham, relaxing at the squads base in the Forte Village here. Its down to Sven-Goran Eriksson but you always need a Nicky Butt in your team. France have a couple: Patrick Vieira and Claude Makelele are great players. Hearing the French squad read out the other day was quite frightening. But we have a great squad. When the England squad was read out, our fans had great smiles on their faces. Expectation from players and fans is always very, very high and rightly so because we have a lot of talent. Steven has had an amazing season. He can be one of the best players at Euro 2004. The strength and power he has shown has been great. We need players like that. Frank has had the best season of his career; he has scored a lot of goals, many of them in big games. Beckham relishes the prospect of Euro 2004, having entered the last tournament, the 2002 World Cup, with fitness problems following his metatarsal injury. I have not broken any bones so far, Beckham smiled. Leading into the World Cup, I was less than 95 per cent fit. Despite recent travails, Beckham believes his move to Real Madrid has made him a better player. I have proved to people in Spain from the first day that I can play football instead of just selling shirts. I have enjoyed my time in central midfield... I was always happy at Real Madrid and wanted to stay there. I just had to clear that up for other people. I am very happy at the moment. I am totally in control. People are saying the red mist is back [after the dismissal against Real Murcia for swearing at a linesman]. But these things happen in football. Sometimes you are so frustrated, so tense in games, that things happen. I didnt realise what I said (son of a whore) was that bad. I heard a few of the players say that to the referee and linesman just before that. Maybe it came across more aggressively from me. Beckham was also determined to make a point to those he feels have vilified him during recent awkward times off the field. The way I have been treated and the way my family has been treated was an absolute disgrace, he said. I am a nice person, a loving father and a loving husband.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

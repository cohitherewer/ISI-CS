 Ferguson flays Olympic call-up
 - Manchester United coach says Cristiano Ronaldo may just suffer from being overused  FROM SAM WALLACE IN PHILADELPHIA  Cristiano Ronaldos inclusion in the Olympic squad is ridiculous, feels Ferguson Sir Alex Ferguson admitted on Thursday that he feared Cristiano Ronaldos career was at risk from burn-out after the Portugal football federation called up the teenage winger for next months Olympic Games, with what the Manchester United manager described as gun to the head tactics. With the pre-season tour of America only a day old, the 62-year-old Ferguson was back in uncompromising form in an attack on the Portuguese authorities, in which he accused them of putting their interests before those of Ronaldo. The decision will mean the 18-year-old misses Manchester Uniteds first six Premiership matches as well as the whole pre-season. Ferguson also warned that Gabriel Heinze, 26, could lose his chance to establish himself at the club after he was called up for the Olympics by Argentina. Ferguson described Portugal under-23 coach Jose Romaos decision to name Ronaldo in his 18-man Olympic squad as absolutely ridiculous and warned that he would have to give the player a further two months rest which would mean the wingers United season would start in November. The clubs chief executive, David Gill, added that Manchester United were in negotiations with Fifa, who have endorsed the Olympic tournament, to get both players exempted. Ferguson said: Its one thing playing games but there is such expectation centred on Ronaldo. Even at Euro 2004, Portugal looked at him as their saving grace. He was the one who was going to take them to the championship. He emerged so brilliantly as the tournament progressed. Having seen that, all of a sudden they are saying, We will have him too. When you cut up the cake too many times there is nothing left. The boy may be exhausted. We would have to give him a two-month rest once he came back and wouldnt be able to use him until November. Thats absolutely ridiculous, the United coach said. Im not really concerned about how we are going to miss him but more about the future development of the player. We have to look at his physical and mental development so that he gets to the point where his potential is fulfilled. Its difficult for young people (to tell their country they do not want to play). Its the gun-to-the-head situation and it happens in internationals time and time again, he said. The Olympics would rule Ronaldo out of Fergusons plans from August 12-29 and then he would be expected to play for the senior national team on September 4 and 8. Chelseas new signing, Tiago, has also been called up, as has Fulhams Luis Boa Morte, while Rangers have stripped Craig Moore of the captaincy after he told them he wanted to represent Australia. Heinze has been chosen as one of the three over-age players Argentina are allowed to select, but for the 6.9 million signing from Paris St-Germain there was a warning from Ferguson about his chances of establishing himself in the United side. In words that would appear to be directed straight at Heinze, Ferguson said that the Argentine may never get into the United team. He said: When I start the season I may have another left-back. He may never get another game  who knows? He may find it difficult to get back in. His opportunity to start his career fresh has now been taken away. Meanwhile, Ole Gunnar Solskjaers career would appear to be under serious threat from a knee injury after Ferguson revealed that his striker would be out for six weeks and possibly another three months after the first stage of treatment in Sweden this summer failed to solve the problem. The Norwegian missed almost seven months of last season with the injury.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

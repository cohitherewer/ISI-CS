The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dont allow flair and creativity to be curbed
 - No point being skilled if you arent prepared to battle tough situations: Greg Chappell  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Greg Chappell  Aussie legends  favourite five
 Gary Sobers Graeme Pollock Sachin Tendulkar Viv Richards Sunil GavaskarSydney: Having registered 7,110 runs in Test cricket (and 2,331 in ODIs), Greg Chappell knows a thing or two about batting. Actually, over the years, the former Australian captain has been an inspiration, besides topping the favourites list of so many. On Friday morning, though, he picked his top batsmen for the benefit of The Telegraphs readers. Here goes... On the qualities he looks for in batsmen No.1 is the ability to score in a manner which puts the opposition under pressure... Just being able to get runs isnt enough... You shouldnt only survive, but prosper... Obviously, there has to be flair and mental toughness. If a mental system isnt in place, there will be problems... Indeed, a clear focus is required and the ones with more clarity do better than the rest. Like good golfers, good batsmen have pre-shot routines. Having said that, the skills must be put into operation. On his idols Richie Benaud and Neil Harvey, Colin Cowdrey and Gary Sobers... The latter, in fact, made the biggest impression. On his top five batsmen Sobers: Most certainly the best Ive seen and his record speaks for itself... He made runs everywhere, with the conditions being no deterrent. He could score quickly thanks to the wide range of shots and an exceptional skill-level. Because of the pace at which he scored, the West Indies had opportunities to push for victories. Graeme Pollock: Possessed an extraordinary talent. Again, like Sobers, scored very quickly. For reasons which had nothing to do with cricket, Graeme didnt tour the sub-continent, but would have been a success had the chance come his way. In any case, he scored heavily in England and Australia besides his own South Africa. Mentally, he was solid. Sachin Tendulkar: He hasnt been anywhere close to his best in this series, but his performance doesnt negate everything he has done over the last 14 years or so... Perhaps, hes a bit anxious and that anxiety is taking its toll. However, anybody who has been around for so long is bound to go through a period where it becomes difficult to summon the mental energy for big scores... His time will come soon... I expect his career to get prolonged as he now has three-four teammates to take the pressure off him. [As it turned out, Sachin was unbeaten on 73  his first fifty-plus score of the series  at stumps on Day I of the deciding Test.] Viv Richards: A lot of batsmen can make runs and a lot of them can absorb everything which goes with a quality attack. Viv, though, had the ability to decimate. Often, rampaging bowlers were made to search for answers. Truly, he was destructive. Sunil Gavaskar: Clearly the best opener of the modern era... Made runs against very good pace attacks, not least in the West Indies... Some of his innings were monumental and he tackled the spinners exceedingly well too. Besides the West Indies, he scored a good many runs in England, but wasnt successful in a big way in Australia... Im sure he would have been so had opportunities come on a regular basis. On the ones who narrowly missed out Barry Richards... He would probably have been my fifth batsman had he played enough international cricket. Its not his fault he didnt, but... Also, I had to leave out Rohan Kanhai and Brian Lara. Finally, his message to young batsmen (Grins) Dont allow your natural flair and creativity to be curbed and, just as important, work on mental toughness. Theres no point being skilled with the bat if you arent prepared to battle tough situations... If youre going to be immersed only in your technique, then your mental side wont grow.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Doubts over Venus return
 A lot other than tennis on Venus mind London: Niggles, knocks and persistent injuries have undermined Venus Williams for the bulk of her career. For all those physical failings it could well be a psychological weak spot which ends up driving her out of tennis. Stomach pulls, wrist strains and a range of tendinitis injuries have pock-marked the Americans professional career and this week she was forced out of the Antwerp Diamond Games. That she has the physique to return from this latest setback  a knee problem  is beyond doubt. Whether or not she has the resilience to return to the top of the game, the heart to put in the long hours required on the practice court, is another matter altogether. Four times Grand Slam winner, Venus returned to the big stage at the start of this year. Her trip to the Australian Open was her first competitive outing since losing to Serena in Wimbledon 2003 final. Oh yes I am back now, she nodded confidently after thrashing fellow-American Ashley Harkleroad 6-2, 6-1 in Round I. Her fragile belief was shattered days later in the third round when she was beaten by Lisa Raymond. Instead of hitting the practice courts, Venus had other plans. So I have two weeks off now woe is me. Ill be a tennis tourist, go see the Twelve Apostles now, who knows, Ayers Rock  all those good things, she grinned. Whether Venus did venture to the red centre of Australia is not the issue. What is telling is that she then pulled out of the Pan Pacific Open after just one match, citing a leg problem. Fans in Antwerp were left disappointed again this week when Venus was a no-show. While money is clearly no longer a major motive for the multi-millionairess, it seems increasingly clear that tennis goals are becoming less important to the 23-year-old. Certainly her off-court pursuits are many and varied. A career in design is burgeoning and these days the striking American, forced to grow up in front of the cameras, has more on her mind than forehands and backhands. Already she is chief executive of her company V Starr Interiors, named after her own exotic moniker, Venus Ebone Starr Williams. She has been spending more and more time hands-on at the companys Palm Beach Gardens headquarters in Florida.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

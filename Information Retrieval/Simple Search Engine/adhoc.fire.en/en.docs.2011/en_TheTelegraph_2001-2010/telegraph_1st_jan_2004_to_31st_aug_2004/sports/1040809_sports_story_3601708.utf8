The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Americans looking to avenge loss to Germany 
 - The World Cup defeat, which left US players in tears, still rankles...  GRAHAME L. JONES  The Games will be Mia Hamms swansong April Heinrichs could do worse than to call in the witch doctors. Thats what they did at the Copa America in Peru last month, and if Heinrichs, coach of the US womens national soccer team, wants to win the gold medal in Athexns, a little magic might come in handy. With flowers, good perfumes and good wishes we are asking the protective gods that no misfortune befall any player, and above all that there are good matches. So intoned Juan Osco, a man known in Peru as the Shaman of the Andes, as he and various other oddly clad figures rattled gourds, shook shrunken heads and cast spells and flower petals in Lima to ensure that all went well at the Copa America. It worked for Brazil, which won the event, but the other teams, especially losing finalists Argentina, will reserve judgement. At the third womens Olympic soccer tournament, it might be the US that wins. Or it could be Germany, or even Sweden or China. Some sorcery could make all the difference. If the ten-nation event were to follow form, the Germans and Americans would meet in the semi-finals at Heraklio on the island of Crete on August 23  the current world champions facing the former world champions for a spot in the gold-medal game. Heinrichs might be in need of some flowers, good perfumes and good wishes at that time because Germany, under experienced Coach Tina Theune-Meyer, present a formidable obstacle. It was the Germans, inspired by striker Birgit Prinz and goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg, who beat the US 3-0 last September in Portland in the semi-finals of the fourth Fifa Womens World Cup. That loss, which left American players in tears, still rankles ... and inspires, just as the semi-final loss to Norway in the 1995 World Cup did. It weighs on your mind all the time, Julie Foudy said. After the 95 loss to Norway, it was something we talked about daily, never being in that situation again, and we ended up winning the 96 gold medal. Its a topic all the time. We were just doing set pieces the other day in training during one of our last days in LA, and within that practice we brought up the Germany game four different times. I think its a great motivator. At the same time, its not like weve beaten ourselves up for a year and are negative about it. It happens. Germany was a great team. Lets give them a lot of credit because they are a great team, and now lets go back to this Olympics and make sure things are different. Before reaching that point, however, the US first must get past Greece, Brazil and Australia in the tournaments opening round, and then overcome their quarter final opponent, most likely Japan, Mexico or Nigeria. Of those six teams, only Brazil, in Thessaloniki next Sunday, is expected to cause Heinrichs squad any difficulty. Later, in all probability, will come Germany in the semi-finals. After that, it will probably be China or Sweden that await the winners when the final is played at Karaiskaki Stadium in Athens on August 26. The Swedes, beaten 1-2 by the Germans at the Home Depot Center in the World Cup final, have promised to return the favour. I think we were worth the gold medal, Swedish striker Victoria Svensson said. But they won and theres nothing we can do now. Were going to take the gold medal at the Olympics. That might be a tall order, especially considering that Sweden recently were trounced 0-4 by Norway, the Sydney 2000 gold-medal winners, and the Norwegians did not even qualify for Athens. For Heinrichs, meanwhile, the Athens Games could be a swan song, just as it will be for US veterans Joy Fawcett, Foudy and Mia Hamm, all of whom will retire from international competition after the Olympics. Hamm, like the others, says it is important that the old timers go out on top. We set out in every tournament to win, she said.  L A TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE  Copyright

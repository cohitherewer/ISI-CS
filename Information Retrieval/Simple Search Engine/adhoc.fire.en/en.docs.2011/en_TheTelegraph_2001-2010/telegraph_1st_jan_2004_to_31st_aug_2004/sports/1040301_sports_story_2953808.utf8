The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agarkar not available for ODIs
 - Struggling Kumble as good as out of Pakistan tours first leg
- Zaheer fit, but needs a week to go flat out  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Anil Kumble Calcutta: Much as he would have liked, Sourav Ganguly wont be able to lead the strongest Indian team in the five ODIs versus Pakistan. The script should be different when the three Tests begin. According to The Telegraphs sources, Ajit Agarkar isnt available, nor is it likely that Anil Kumble is going to be fit in time for the March 10 departure. Agarkar couldnt be contacted, but is understood to have told a confidant (late on Sunday) that he wont risk cutting it too fine. Moreover, Board consultant Dr Anant Joshi has suggested a fresh scan on the allrounders left fibula. With Agarkar not available, Ashish Nehra will benefit. Theres no official confirmation on Kumble, but it appears he is struggling with his bowling shoulder. As a source put it: The rehab has been slow For all intents and purposes, count the star leggie out. The Kumble development is really bad news because, now, the five national selectors have the unenviable task of choosing two spinners worthy of the most high-profile series in recent years. They meet here on Monday afternoon. One learns anybody could make the XV  even Murali Kartik, who did absolutely nothing in Australia. Also in contention are Sarandeep Singh, Sunil Joshi, Ramesh Powar and Kulamani Parida. Unbelievably, Nikhil Chopras name is doing the rounds as well. Frankly, nobody really deserves to be picked Yet, well have to choose two because the squad must have that many specialist spinners, remarked a hassled selector, who preferred anonymity. That weve been reduced to this state is crushing. Zaheer Khan, however, is fit but needs around a week to consistently go flat out. Dr Joshi is expected to convey that before the selectors begin deliberations. The left-arm quick suffered a right hamstring injury during the Test series in Australia and hasnt played competitive cricket for eight weeks. Hes a certainty, though, as also Irfan Pathan and Lakshmipathy Balaji. While theres confusion about the bowlers, the batsmen select themselves  a debate is only going to be over whether it should be Hemang Badani or Rohan Gavaskar. Badani is more experienced, yet Gavaskar didnt look out of sorts when opportunities came his way in the tri-series Down Under. He has backers, but it wont surprise if the selectors prefer Badani. The batsmen who cant be dislodged are: Sourav, vice-captain Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh plus Mohammed Kaif. Kaif will be making a big-bracket comeback, after missing out on the last set of ODIs owing to a thumb injury during the Asian A championship in Calcutta two months ago. Incidentally, its gathered that Parthiv Patel is under pressure to keep the specialist wicketkeepers place. Bihars Mahender Singh Dhoni and Hyderabads Ibrahim Khaleel have come into the picture. As of now, the in-form Sridharan Sriram is a dark horse, while Dinesh Mongia may come into the frame.The XV Scenario  Certainties: Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S.Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji.  Under pressure: Parthiv Patel. However, could hold on.  Keen tussle: Between Hemang Badani and Rohan Gavaskar. Badani, though, may squeeze through.  Spinners: Possibly Sarandeep Singh... And anybody could make it.  May emerge strong contender: Mahender Singh Dhoni.  Dark horse: Sridharan Sriram.  Copyright

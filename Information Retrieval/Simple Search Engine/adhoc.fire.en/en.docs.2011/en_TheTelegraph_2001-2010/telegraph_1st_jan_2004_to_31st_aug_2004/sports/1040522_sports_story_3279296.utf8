The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Best of a bad bargain for ZCU
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  DALMIYA: In demand Calcutta: Perhaps, everybody with a stake in Zimbabwe left it till too late to end the imbroglio but, at least, the sanctity of Test cricket isnt going to take a beating. That is the lone positive to emerge from the arrangement worked out by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU), which would have been isolated had the International Cricket Council (ICC) been compelled to go ahead with Fridays teleconference on the Test status issue. The crisis, after all, began as early as April 2 when Heath Streak was sacked as captain. Yet, the ICC went into overdrive after top guns Australia landed in Harare. In fact, Board of Control for Cricket in India president Jagmohan Dalmiya  who played a big hand  stepped in only a few days ago after an SOS from ICC chief Ehsan Mani. Dalmiya is a former ICC president and, as The Telegraph learns, couldnt say no to somebody who took the most reasonable line in the multi-million dollar Player Terms row before the 2003 World Cup. Besides, Mani is an old ally. While Dalmiya (quite sensibly) didnt exactly concern himself with the ZCU-rebel players dealings, he focussed on the bigger picture: Specifically, the possibility of Zimbabwe being stripped of Test status and its ramifications. Dalmiya, one understands, suggested a formula whereby the host nation itself would call for the two-Test series to be postponed if the key rebels didnt return to the fold immediately. An informal understanding was reached on Wednesday (reported in these columns on Thursday), which saw Streak and four others back at the ZCUs call, but with mistrust in the air it came unstuck just as quickly. The point Dalmiya now made, in one-to-ones with chairman Peter Chingoka, is that the ZCU stood to lose much less (than it otherwise would) by proposing the postponement  irrespective of the precedent element. The ZCU  which surely needs to learn lessons  eventually agreed, intimating that in writing (among others) to Dalmiya himself. Of course, internally, it retaliated by again sacking Streak and Co.  bizarre, but a reality nevertheless. Nobody, it seems, is very bothered about the quality of the playing XI in ODIs. However, we may see much off-the-field action if top England players opt out of the Test series in Zimbabwe later this year. Dalmiya will probably then be more busy  Copyright

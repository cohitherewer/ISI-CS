The Telegraph - Calcutta
Pak at peak, but India have the talent
Guest Column Mohinder AmarnathThere is a saying in Punjabi in Lahore: Lahori kabhi maat nahi khate (Lahorites cant be defeated). The current Pakistani team has plenty of players from Lahore and even in the past they have produced great cricketers. I was impressed by the way Pakistan came back so strongly in Lahore to thrash India, after having given up the Multan Test without a fight.All the Pakistanis played their part in the second Test in Lahore, but Umar Gul and Inzamam-ul Haq were the stars in the thumping victory. The most impressive aspect of Guls spell was his control; also the length he was keeping, bowling to all Indian batsmen. Gul troubled everybody with his natural incoming deliveries. That isnt stuff many of the other Pakistani bowlers have been bowling. They can learn from this youngster, that it is important to make a batsman play, to enable him to make mistakes. Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami are bowling more than 90 miles and hour, but how many deliveries are they making the batsmen play? Gul has excellent talent and is a good prospect for the future. He mixes the deliveries very cleverly. He bowled well on the first day, and had he not gone out of the field India possibly would have struggled to score the runs they did. It would not have been possible either, without a heroic century from Yuvraj Singh coming at the right time.His bold approach showcases his tremendous talent and he is likely to be successful in both versions of he game. He has announced his arrival with a bang, and we will surely be seeing a lot of him, provided he is not shifted up and down the batting order too often.On the bowling side, for me, the most memorable delivery of the match was when Umar Gul uprooted V.V.S. Laxmans off stump with a sharp leg-cutter.I personally feel that India are a better, more talented team. They just had a bad Test match in Lahore. Losing a Test isnt the end of the world. Drawing the series will not justify the Indian talent. They should be more positive and play to win. They have to be mentally tough and positive with their game plan. Sourav Gangulys presence will definitely help the team, but this will also make it difficult to choose who should open in the absence of Akash Chopra (it is very unfortunate that he has to sit out in the interest of the team). It would be better to open with Yuvraj Singh rather than the captain opening the innings himself. He has opened in the one-dayers, but here he is just back from injury and missing two Test matches and his unconvincing footwork may cause him problems against sheer pace.Yuvraj and Sehwag have, more or less, the same aggressive style and are good players of short bowling. Sourav should bat at his customary position. It would be beneficial for Laxman to come a drop down from his regular position because of repeated failures.This game can be so cruel and ruthless at times. Laxman could not do a thing wrong in Australia, but here everything seems against him. He looks all at sea against the moving, incoming delivery. It is horrible to see such a good player all at sea with his poor footwork. Ajit Agarkars bowling looked jaded and he did not seem the same man we saw in Australia. It might not be a bad idea if he is replaced by either Ashish Nehra (if fit) or to play another spinner. Ramesh Powar might be a better bet because of his allround abilities.  Copyright

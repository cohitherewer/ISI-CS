 Thipsay stuns Sasikiran
 Thipsay is in five-way lead Mumbai: Veteran GM Praveen Thipsay scored a brilliant upset victory over second seed Krishnan Sasikiran to emerge as joint leader after the sixth round in the Commonwealth chess championship on Thursday. Top seed Nigel Short of England registered his third straight victory to join the leading pack with overnight leaders Alexander Fominyh and Pavel Smirnov of Russia, Dzhumaev Marat of Uzbekistan and Thipsay. While the leaders are all on five points, a pack of eight players including Abhijit Kunte are breathing down their neck just half-a-point behind. Suryta Sekhar Ganguly (3.5) was held by D. Harika but statemate and fellow GM Sandipan Chanda beat P. Konguvel to move to 4.5. Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury also moved to 4.5 with a win over R.R. Laxman, but Saptarshi Roy (3) lost to R.B. Ramesh. Among other Bengal players, Nisha Mohota (3) lost to Lanka Ravi and Neelotpal Das (3) lost to K. Rathnakaran. To beat Sasikiran, the second highest-rated Indian ever after Viswanathan Anand, these days is considered very tough. Tougher still is to achieve that feat with black. Thipsay did it in style with his pet Kings Indian Defence. Employing the sharp Samisch variation, Sasikiran was in for a surprise in the early part of the middle-game as Thipsay sacrificed an exchange to get a firm control in the centre and just as his position became menacing, Sasikiran decided to part with his extra material. However, blacks dark colour bishop spat fire on the longest diagonal thereafter and Thipsay capitalised on his advantage in exemplary fashion.  (PTI)  Copyright

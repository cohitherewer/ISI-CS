The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Portuguese look for the perfect start
 - Modest Greeks should be no match for heavyweight hosts  Rui Costa is expected to be given the role of playmaker Porto: Luiz Felipe Scolari, who led Brazil to the 2002 World Cup, begins another bid to make history when his Portugal team plays Greece in the opening match of Euro 2004 on Saturday. Since the European Championship began in 1960, no country has lifted the Henri Delauney trophy managed by an overseas coach, which is exactly what Greece are also attempting to do  though German Otto Rehhagels ambitions are far more modest. For millions of Portuguese, this represents the best chance they have had of winning a major tournament. Most Greeks will be happy if their team avoids humiliation and scores some goals, while winning a match would be a bonus. The expectation on the hosts to start their group A campaign with victory is enormous, but Scolari,is used to the demands of an expectant public. He has tried to keep things in perspective recently and at least his chances of winning the opening match have been boosted by a clean bill of health for the squad. Rui Costa is expected to start as playmaker in preference to Brazil-born Deco, who might have to be content with a place on the substitutes bench at the Estadio do Dragao, home of his European Cup-winning club side Porto. Scolari said on Friday that Maniche will start in midfield rather than Benficas Armando Petit. I have no doubts, Maniche is going to play, the Brazilian coach said. Maniche will play for the first match, I dont know about the one after that. Minutes after Greece completed their final closed training session, team doctors said Nikos Dabizas, suffering from a back injury, would not play in the game. However, with leading striker Demis Nikolaidis on the road to recovery and towering defender Traianos Dellas eager to play despite a back injury, Rehhagel is expected to trust his usual 4-4-2 formation. Vassilis Tsartas on the left and Stelios Giannakopoulos on the right will be aiming to crack open the Portuguese defence and create opportunities for strikers Nikolaidis and Angelos Haristeas. The hosts start as firm favourites and it would be a shock if the opposing German coach achieved what his countrymen failed to do in the 2002 World Cup final and got the better of Scolari. The man with the whistle in the middle of the park will be the redoubtable Pierluigi Collina. PROBABLE TEAMS Portugal: Ricardo (1); Paulo Ferreira (2), Jorge Andrade (4), Fernando Couto (5), Rui Jorge (3), Costinha (6), Maniche (18), Luis Figo (7), Rui Costa (10), Pauleta (9), Simao Sabrosa (11).

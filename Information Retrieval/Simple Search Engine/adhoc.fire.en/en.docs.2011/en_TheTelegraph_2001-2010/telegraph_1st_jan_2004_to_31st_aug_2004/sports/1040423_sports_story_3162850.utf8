The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India lose lead
New Delhi: Sania Mirza lost 5-7, 4-6 to Wynne Prakusya as India lost their 1-0 lead against Indonesia in the Fed Cup tie on Thursday. Ankita Bhambri had given the hosts a flying start with a 6-4, 6-4 upset win over Sandy Gumulya. But Sania, who lost her second successive singles match, failed to protect the lead. Ankita overcame a long rain delay to score a sensational first singles win. Ankita was leading 6-4, 5-4 and on match point at 40-30 when a swirl of wind forced suspension of play. After the resumption, Ankita wraped up the match in just three minutes. The heavy dust storm quickly gave way to thick drops of rain, leading to the stoppage. The weather gods relented just enough for Ankita to wrap up the match. (PTI)  Copyright

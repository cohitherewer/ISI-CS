 Kapil praise for Pathan

Mumbai: Former India skipper Kapil Dev Friday praised Irfan Pathans bowling Down Under saying he has shaped up well. 
Kapil also felt that the young brigade is doing a very good job in Australia. 
I think the youngsters like Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Murali Kartik, Rohan Gavaskar and Yuvraj Singh have really shown maturity playing the best team in the world, Kapil said. 
I am particularly impressed with the way Pathan has shaped up after the Indians lost Zaheer Khan due to injuries. All in all, it is a very impressive display by the Indians and I hope they will continue to do well. 
When asked about the proposal to name the upcoming Indo-Pak series as Imran-Kapil Trophy, the former allrounder said: If at all such a proposal comes through, I should consider it a big honour.

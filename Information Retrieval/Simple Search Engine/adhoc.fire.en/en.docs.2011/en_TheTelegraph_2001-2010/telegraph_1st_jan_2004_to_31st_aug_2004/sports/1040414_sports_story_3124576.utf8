 13 Zimbabweans set to quit
Durban: Thirteen members of the Zimbabwe squad are set to quit after meeting the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) on Tuesday to discuss a range of concerns. It doesnt look good from our side, and Im pretty sure 13 of us are going to walk, one player said from Harare on Tuesday. It looks an absolute mess, and we cant play under the conditions. The issues included the decision by captain Heath Streak to resign after the ZCU dismissed his concerns over the composition of the national selection committee. Wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu, 20, has taken over as skipper. Theyre refusing a lot of our points without even negotiating them. Its a dictatorship, the player added. We are 99 per cent sure that they are not going to budge on any of our demands. He said he and his teammates would give the ZCU time to respond to their demands before deciding on the next course of action. The rebel players have called for an independent mediator working at a neutral venue to resolve the crisis which has split cricket in the African nation along racial lines. A letter from 12 white Test players has called for a shake-up of the way the game is managed. The players lawyer Chris Venturas earlier handed over the letter to Vince Hogg, chief executive of the ZCU. But Venturas said: The players want to try and fix this matter. They want to play. They want to go the extra mile for that. They are dedicated to the sport in Zimbabwe and are keen to find a solution. And so they, and Streak as well, are willing to play under new captain Taibu. But they do want to see considerable changes made to the ZCU administration, in particular the make-up of the selection panel. Meanwhile, the ICC on Tuesday called on Zimbabwes players and their board to resolve the dispute. I urge all parties involved to act in the best interests of the game, said ICC president Ehsan Mani in a statement.  (Agencies)  Copyright

 Schumacher wins opener
 - Barrichello ensures one-two finish  Michael Schumacher after winning his fourth Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on Sunday. (Reuters) Melbourne: World champion Michael Schumacher led a Ferrari parade in the park on Sunday to win the season opening Australian Grand Prix in a display of dominance. With Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello following Schumacher around the Albert Park circuit, the flaming red cars crossed the line in isolated splendour to celebrate a first one-two finish since Japan 2002. It was the Germans 71st win, fourth in Australia, and one of the more straightforward of a Formula One career that has brought him a record six titles. As Stephanie Sheene, widow of the late British motorcycling champion Barry, waved the chequered flag, the champion was 34.6 seconds ahead of Spaniard Fernando Alonsos third-placed Renault. Schumachers brother Ralf was fourth for Williams, ahead of Colombian teammate Juan Pablo Montoya and Briton Jenson Button in a BAR. Italian Jarno Trulli, in a Renault, and last years winner David Coulthard, in a McLaren, collected the remaining points. Both were lapped by Schumacher in a race that suggested an ominous return to the Ferrari Formula Yawn dominance of 2002, which led to sweeping rule changes and resulted in one of the closest seasons in recent years in 2003. McLarens Kimi Raikkonen, last years overall runner-up and a championship favourite, made only a brief appearance before joining the spectators as the seasons first retirement. Schumacher and Barrichello covered the miles without missing a beat. The two red cars made a smooth getaway, leaving Alonso to provide the thrills behind them as Renault picked up the mantle of Ferrari chasers from Williams and McLaren. The Spaniard threw his car round the outside of Montoya, putting two wheels on the grass and out-braking the Colombian as he swept through from fifth on the grid to third. Montoya was pushed from third to seventh, triggering an aggressive fightback from the Colombian whose determination showed as he forced Button on the runoff on lap 39 as he out-braked the Briton. Australian hopes were snuffed out on lap 29 when Jaguars Mark Webber, who had climbed to third place during the first round of pitstops, retired after losing the sixth and seventh gears.

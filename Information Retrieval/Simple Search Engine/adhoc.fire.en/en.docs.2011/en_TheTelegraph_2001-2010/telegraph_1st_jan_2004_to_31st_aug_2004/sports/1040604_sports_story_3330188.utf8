 Jail sentence for IOC vice-president
Seoul: The International Olympic Council (IOC) vice-president Kim Un-Yong was sentenced to two and half years in prison on embezzlement and bribery charges on Thursday in a ruling that will likely end his long, powerful career at the helm of affairs. Kim, 73, says he will appeal the ruling by a Seoul district criminal court. But he now faces the likelihood of becoming the highest-ranking IOC member to be expelled. He narrowly escaped expulsion after the Salt Lake City bid scandal five years ago. One of the most powerful officials in international sports, Kim was instrumental in Seoul hosting of the 1988 Olympics. An IOC member since 1986 and an influential power broker, Kim unsuccessfully challenged Jacques Rogge for the IOCs top job in 2001. A three-judge panel convicted Kim of embezzling $3.3 billion from the World Taekwondo Federation  which issues taekwondo credentials  and other sports organisations he controlled. Kim was also ordered to pay $679,000 in fines as compensation for illicit funds he collected from sports officials seeking his favour. Prosecutors had earlier sought a seven-year jail term against him. Judge Kim Byong-Woon said Kim infuriated the court by sending letters to IOC members defaming the South Korean judiciary system. The court gave a lesser sentence after considering Kims contribution to making the South Korean national sport of taekwondo into a global sport, the judge said. The court also cited Kims role in boosting sports exchanges with communist North Korea and his old age and severe case of high blood pressure. Dressed in a dark blue suit, Kim stood speechless before the court during the ten-minute hearing. An aide to Kim, Shin Bong-Soo, said the official would appeal. He has a week to do so. Kim has been under fire at home since last summer when he was accused of undermining South Koreas bid for the 2010 Winter Games in favour of his own ambitions for IOC presidency. South Koreas Pyeongchang finished second to Vancouver in IOC voting that took place simultaneously with the IOC presidential election in 2001. In January, Kim resigned from top posts at the World Taekwondo Federation and the world taekwondo headquarters. He also stepped down as a national legislator. The IOC executive board provisionally stripped Kim of all his Olympic duties on January 23, pending investigations by South Korean authorities and the IOC ethics commission. Kim was arrested four days later. (AP)  Copyright

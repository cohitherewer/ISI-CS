The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ashraful falls for 98
 - First test - Bangla still 128 adrift of Zimbabwes 441  Zimbabwe players celebrate Hanan Sarkars dismissal in Harare on Friday. (AP) Harare, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak kept his side on top and denied Mohammed Ashraful a century by claiming his 200th wicket on the third day of the first Test against Bangladesh today. Streak, who took four for 44, removed Ashraful for 98 before Bangladesh reached the close on 313 for nine, 128 adrift of Zimbabwes first innings of 441. The 19-year-old Ashraful, who became Test crickets youngest century-maker against Sri Lanka two years ago, departed after dragging a delivery from fast bowler Streak on to his stumps. The composed Bangladeshi, who came to the crease with his side in trouble at 77 for four, had batted for four hours, striking nine fours and three sixes in 181 balls as he closed in on his second Test century. Bangladesh, who resumed on 14 for one, lost their second wicket in the sixth over of the days play when Tapash Baisya drove at a delivery from Streak and was caught behind for four by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu. Three balls later, Bangladesh slumped to 35 for three when fast bowler Andy Blignaut had Habibul Bashar caught behind by Taibu for a duck. Opener Shariar Hossain and Rajin Saleh stabilised the innings with a cautious partnership that took Bangladesh to within sight of lunch without further loss. But 12 overs before the end of the morning session, Hossain was leg before to medium pacer Douglas Hondo for 48 to end the fourth-wicket stand at 42. Saleh continued to bat responsibly, sharing a stand of 85 for the fifth wicket with Ashraful. The partnership ended an hour before tea when Saleh (49) attempted to sweep a full delivery from Price, who was bowling over the wicket, and gloved it on to his stumps. Mushfiqur Rahman added 97 for the sixth wicket before Ashrafuls solid resistance was ended by Streak midway through the final session.  Copyright

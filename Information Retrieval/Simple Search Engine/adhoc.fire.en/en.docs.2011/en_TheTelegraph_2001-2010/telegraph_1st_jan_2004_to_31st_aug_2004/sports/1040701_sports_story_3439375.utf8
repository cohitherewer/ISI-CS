		 Thursday, July 01, 2004  RCTC plans attractive monsoon 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) plans to erect a giant TV screen in the grand enclosure for punters to have a better view of the city and outstation races, informed Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC. The screen is expected to be erected by the middle of September, said Parakh. 				 										The club is trying to give a facelift to the season which hardly gets patronised by the crowd normally seen during the winter months. We have worked a good deal to make the monsoon season attractive, added Parakh.				 										All departments of defence forces also figure in Parakhs scheme of things. Race meets for Army, Air Force and Border Security Force have already been finalised but the Naval authorities are yet to commit. Each one of them is expected to add a little to the days proceedings to make their respective afternoons memorable, Parakh continued.				 										Each of the 15 meetings during the monsoon season that starts from July 8 will have seven events. The season concludes on October 13. More importantly, there will be at least two cup events on each day. All fixtures, excepting the Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes which will be held on Friday, are billed for mid-week. A total of Rs 1.23 crore will be disbursed in stakes. However, horses summering down south may start arriving only in the month of August and until then RCTC may have to manage the show with the horse-strength of about 230 presently in the Hastings stables.

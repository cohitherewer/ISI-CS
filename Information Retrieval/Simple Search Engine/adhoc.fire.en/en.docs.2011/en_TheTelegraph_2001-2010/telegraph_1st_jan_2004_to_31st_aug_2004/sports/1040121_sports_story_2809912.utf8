The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly edge out bankmen
 - National League - Habib brace spoils IB party; Vasco triumph  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge Agragamis Sheikh Habib Ali (airborne) evades Kamaldeen Fuard of Indian Bank during their National League match at Howrah Stadium on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: As the top teams get themselves ready for a grab at the crown, its becoming quite evident that the battle to save the relegation in the National Football League will also be quite an interesting one. After Mohammedan Sporting beat JCT the other day, they might have hoped Indian Bank would pull off a surprise and keep them a couple of points clear off Tollygunge Agragami. The bankmen from Chennai were almost there, but debut kid Sheikh Habib Ali ruined their party. He scored twice as Tollygunge Agragami rallied to beat Indian Bank 3-2 at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday. With this win, the city team finished their first-leg engagements with ten points, while Indian Bank remain on two. Tollygunge are one point ahead of Mohammedan Sporting. Tuesdays match was quite a treat for a couple of thousand people who had thronged the stands. Both teams played open football trying to ensure full points. In fact, Tollygunge had the better of exchanges as the attackers Habib and Akeem Abolanle were fed well from the midfield. Akeem has quite a bulldozing effect and the Indian Bank defenders found it tough to keep him in control. He came close to making it 1-0 for the hosts in the 39th minute, but the Nigerians rasping right-footer from the top of the box struck the cross-piece and came back into play. Indian Bank, on the other hand, were trying to draw the opposition into their own half and raise sudden counter-attacks. Their Sri Lankan striker Kasun Nadika Jayasuriya is nippy in his off-the-ball runs, and the Chennai team was depending on him to catch Tollygunge off-guard. Jayasuriya didnt disappoint when Kamaldeen Fuards curling free-kick from the left in the 44th minute found him in the clear and he headed in past a hapless Rajnarayan Mukherjee. However, Jayasuriya seemed to be at an off-side position, which the referee didnt take into account. Stung by the reverse, Tollygunge went all out in search of the equaliser. Manik Burman, coming in place of Shamsi Reza, added sting to the attack and had a hand in the equaliser in the 54th minute. Tollygunge kept on attacking and went ahead in the 70th minute when Habib headed in a Kabijit Khotel flag-kick. But Indian Bank looked determined to take at least one point home. They increased men in attack and the chink in Tollygunge defence was exposed. Isiaka Awoyemi missed the flight of a Fuard lob in the 75th minute and Joseph K.G. had an open goal in front. His first attempt was deflected off the bar, but he kept his cool and scored in the second attempt. Tollygunge Agragami coach Krishnendu Roy brought in Ajay Singh in the 85th minute and it proved to be an inspired substitution. His first touch found Akeem in the clear and the Nigerians powerful right-footer beat the Indian Bank keeper.  TEAMS Tollygunge Agragami: Rajnarayan Mukherjee, Kabijit Khotel, Isiaka Awoyemi, Ebi Bar Bar, Amitava Chanda, Amit Das (Biman Mondal 80), Sandip Das, Shamsi Reza (Manik Burman 40), Jiten Rai (Ajay Singh 85), Akeem Abolanle, Sheikh Habib Ali.

(Joseph K.G., 46) Referee: Derek Rodrigues In Margao, Amaechi Tochukwu scored in 24th and 82nd minute to guide Vasco to a 2-1 victory over Churchill Brothers.

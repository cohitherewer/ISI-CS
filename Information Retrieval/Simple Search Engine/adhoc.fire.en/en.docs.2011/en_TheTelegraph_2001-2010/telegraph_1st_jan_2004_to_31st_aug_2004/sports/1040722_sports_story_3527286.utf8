 Argentina cruise into final
 - COPA AMERICA - Tevez strikes with another free-kick in 3-0 win over Colombia  Argentinas Juan Pablo Sorin heads in the ball past Colombian goalie Juan Carlos Henao during their Copa America semi-final match in Lima on Tuesday. (Reuters) Lima: Argentina easily ousted defending champion Colombia 3-0 and cruised into the Copa America final. Carlos Tevez scored his second free-kick goal in as many games in the 32nd minute, Luis Gonzalez hit a running shot in off a Luciano Figueroa pass in the 50th, and Juan Pablo Sorin knocked in an 81st-minute header to cap an unexpectedly comfortable victory on Tuesday. Argentina showed flashes of playing at its best today, said Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa. Only rarely have we played better. Colombias 10-match unbeaten Copa streak since 2001 ended in a timid and seemingly nervous display on its Independence Day. We have to go out of the tournament playing as well as we can, said Colombia coach Reinaldo Rueda. Tonight Argentina was too much for us. They showed personality, were dynamic, and played with precision. Argentina pinned Colombia on defence for most of the match, and the defending champions seemed to pay Argentina too much respect, and not take any risks until they were 2-0 down in the second half. We created good scoring opportunities and took advantage of them, Bielsa said. Cesar Delgado, Gonzalez and Sorin all took shots on goal in the opening 15 minutes as Argentina showed the attacking flair which has netted it a tournament-high 14 goals in five matches. It wasnt until the 19th that Colombia put Argentina goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri to work when Abel Aguilars cross forced him to come off his line to make a leaping save. Five minutes later, Gonzalez had an even better look at goal when Figueroas shot left keeper Juan Carlos Henao sprawled on the ground, and Luis Gonzalezs left-footed shot was headed off the goal-line by Colombia defender Andres Gonzalez. Tevez, starting for injured midfielder Andres DAlessandro, drew a free-kick when he was taken down by Aguilar, and scored when he curved the ball 25 metres over a six-man Colombian wall and past a diving Henao. The goal recalled 20-year-old Tevezs bending free-kick which beat Peru in the quarter finals on Saturday. On Tuesday, he celebrated by running towards Bielsa before he was swamped by teammates. Argentinas domination of the half was reflected by six corners and eight shots on goal at the 45,000-seat National Stadium which was, disappointingly, less than half full. Any hope Colombia had of pegging back the goal by starting the second half with a fresh outlook was flushed away within five minutes when an unmarked Luis Gonzalez one-timed a cutback pass from Figueroa for 2-0 and put the result beyond doubt. Colombia finally snapped out of its lethargy, however, as Edwin Congo and Tressor Moreno spearheaded the attack, albeit in vain. Argentina took us completely out of our game, Rueda said. We didnt communicate and we struggled to get organised. Colombias sweat was contrasted by the ease of Argentinas last goal, when Sorin easily slipped behind the defence and was almost on his knees when he headed in a free kick by replacement Mauro Rosales. For Argentina, injured Javier Saviola did not start for a third straight game, and Fabricio Coloccini replaced captain Roberto Ayala, who was suspended on yellow card accumulation. Midfielder Javier Mascherano was back after his one-game ban, and defender Javier Zanetti took over the captaincy, leading by example with several penetrating runs down the right wing. Colombia welcomed back defender Gonzalo Martinez off his ban on yellow cards.

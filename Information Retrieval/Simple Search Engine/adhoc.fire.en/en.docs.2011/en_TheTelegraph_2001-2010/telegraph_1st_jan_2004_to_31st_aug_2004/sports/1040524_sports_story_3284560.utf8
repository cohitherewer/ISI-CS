The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Injured Ferrero may pull out
 - FRENCH OPEN 
- Roger Federer comes to the fore; Intriguing competition in womens section on cards  Juan Carlos Ferrero, the defending champion, will make his decision on Monday Paris: The order is likely to change at Roland Garros. Defending champion Juan Carlos Ferrero, plagued by rib and wrist problems, has announced that he will make a last-minute decision about his participation in the French Open, which starts Monday. My chances to take part in the tournament are less than 50 percent, Ferrero told a news conference. Ill make a decision on Monday. But it is possible I might pull out, he said. That means Roger Federers sheer class keeps him favourite, though Argentine Guillermo Coria, a semi-finalist last year, can also claim to be the form player going into the championships. Ferrero, hampered by a wrist injury since the start of the season, pulled out of the Hamburg Masters earlier this month. Rib pains also prevented him from training properly at Roland Garros earlier this week. The Spaniard went to Spain Saturday to attend the royal wedding and his return to Paris seemed to indicate he would defend his title. But after training on Sunday morning, the Spaniard said he did not feel well. Ferrero is to face a tricky first round match against Germanys Tommy Haas, the former world number two. I practised for an hour this morning but I didnt feel good, said the 23-year-old Ferrero. I am still having problems. My ribs are very painful. I have taken painkilling injections but just moving around the court is painful. Last year, I played unbelievable tennis. If I dont play here, it will be very sad. If the tournament was in two months time, it would be alright but this is not the right time for me. Federer faces a credibility test. Beaten in the first round on his last two visits to Roland Garros, the 22-year-old top seed from Switzerland, recognised as the best all-round player on the tour, has yet to prove himself on the sapping Paris clay. The Wimbledon and Australian Open champion opens up against a qualifier so another first-round defeat seems unthinkable, but matters could quickly get difficult for the languidly brilliant Swiss with former champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil and Argentine David Nalbandian in his quarter of the draw. Coria, seeking his maiden Grand Slam, has a far from easy first-round match against Russian Nikolay Davydenko. Second seed Andy Roddick, like Federer, has yet to indicate he has the patience and application to win the most gruelling Grand Slam of the year. The US Open champion opens against a familiar foe in experienced compatriot Todd Martin with a possible quarter final against Andre Agassi. An intriguing womens tournament is in store with none of the leading contenders in tip-top condition, bar Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo. A winner on clay at Berlin and Rome, she has consistently under-performed in her home event Slam but this is undoubtedly her best opportunity to break her Grand Slam duck. The third seed opens up against Slovakias Ludmila Cervanova and such is the draw she may not be properly tested until a possible quarter final against American Lindsay Davenport. Holder Justine Henin-Hardenne says she is glad just to be competing after a viral infection deprived her of any real preparation. The Belgian world No. 1 and top seed faces a tricky opening game against French wildcard Sandrine Testud. Second seed Serena Williams, beaten in an acrimonious semi-final by Henin-Hardenne last year, is looking close to her best following knee surgery and should dispatch Czech player Iveta Benesova easily enough. She will have noted the presence in her quarter of the draw of Jennifer Capriati and 47-year-old Martina Navratilova, whose first Grand Slam match in 10 years against Argentine Gisela Dulko should be one of the highlights of the first round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Injury may rule out Chinese captain
	 - ASIAN CUP FINAL vs Japan  Li Weifeng says his chances are 50-50 Beijing: China captain Li Weifeng could miss Saturdays Asian Cup final against Japan after picking up a rib injury. The former Everton defender aggravated the injury in Chinas dramatic semi-final win over Iran on Tuesday, when the hosts were taken to penalties by the three-time champions. It is difficult to say but my chances are about fifty-fifty, said Li, who has also been battling a knee injury during the tournament. There is nothing I can do about it. China have never won the Asian Cup and their hopes of beating Japan in a high-profile clash in Beijing would suffer a severe blow if Li is ruled out. Li, who quit Everton in early 2003 following a frustrating spell at the Premier League club, has played a vital role in Chinas run to their first Asian Cup final since 1984. You know, with the knee and now the rib injury I dont know if I can play on Saturday, he said. I first hurt my ribs against Iraq (in the quarter finals). Li has been a towering presence alongside Zheng Zhi in defence and the 26-year-old knows the importance of their partnership as China look to beat bitter rivals Japan for the first time since 1998. To beat them we need to stay solid in defence, said Li. That will be the key. We are proud that we have only conceded three goals so far in the tournament. Chinas Dutch coach Arie Haan, already missing Everton midfielder Li Tie, has had several injury concerns during the tournament, among them Li Weifeng, playmaker Shao Jiayi and striker Hao Haidong. Shao, who plays for German club 1860 Munich, should play after recovering from a sore knee but talisman Hao is battling a head injury he sustained against Iran. Hao, who required five stitches, left the pitch with his shirt stained with blood and was taken to hospital for a precautionary brain scan.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

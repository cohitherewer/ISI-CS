 Sacked rebels back as Red Lions
 Heath Streak London, July 8 (Reuters): Zimbabwes sacked rebel cricketers have launched themselves as a new team called the Red Lions and will play their first match on July 14 in England. The Lions, who plan to raise money for two charitable trusts, face Kent club side Lashings at Wimbledon Cricket Club next Wednesday. Five more one-dayers are scheduled at other grounds around the country before the end of the month. Players include former captain Heath Streak, Grant Flower and Stuart Carlisle. The Red Lions have been formed out of the desire to promote the great game of cricket by playing matches against worthy opposition in an atmosphere of fun and frivolity, said spokesman Clive Field. We have chosen England as the destination for our inaugural tour because we have many friends and fans there gained from our past touring experiences. We hope to build on this success and carry this through into other countries. The players, angry over Streaks departure as captain, made themselves unavailable for selection and were sacked, leaving Zimbabwe with a side unable to compete at the top level.  Copyright

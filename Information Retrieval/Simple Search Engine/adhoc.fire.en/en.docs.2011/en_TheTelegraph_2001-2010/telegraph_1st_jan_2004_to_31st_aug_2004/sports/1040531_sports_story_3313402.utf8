The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venus, Serena, Moya in quarters
 - Henman makes last 8 for first time - Dementieva dumps Davenport - Capriati, Mauresmo move on  Lindsay Davenport grimaces during her match against Elena Dementieva on Sunday. Davenport lost 1-6, 3-6 Paris: Amelie Mauresmo warmed French hearts on a blustery, cold day at Roland Garros on Sunday, wiping Magdalena Maleeva off the court 6-2, 6-1 to reach the French Open quarter finals for the second successive year. The third seed has suffered from crippling nerves at her home Grand Slam in the past but on Sunday played a sublime match to line up a quarter final against Elena Dementieva. Dementieva and Maria Sharapova had earlier led a Russian charge into the last eight. Ninth seed Dementieva pummelled former world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport 6-1, 6-3, while Sharapova raced past Germanys Marlene Weingaertner 6-3, 6-1. Zheng Jies run, meanwhile, came to an end when she was beaten 4-6, 5-7 by 14th-seeded Argentine Paola Suarez. Zheng, who became the first Chinese woman to reach the fourth round of any Grand Slam event at Roland Garros, slipped to defeat in an hour and 40 minutes. In mens action, Britains Tim Henman came back from the dead again to reach the French Open quarter finals for the first time with a 6-7 (2-7), 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 9-7 victory over wildcard Michael Llodra of France. The ninth seed fought back majestically after an abysmal start and saved a match point before claiming victory on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Henman became the first Briton to reach the mens quarters at Roland Garros since Roger Taylor in 1973. It was also the first time Henman reached the last eight of a Grand Slam outside Wimbledon. 			The 29-year-old sealed a stunning victory after four hours and 11 minutes with a forehand down the line.Henman will play 22nd seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina for a place in the semi-finals. Chela defeated Olivier Mutis of France 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in another fourth round match. Fifth seed Carlos Moya beat fellow Spaniard Tommy Robredo 7-6 (10-8), 6-4, 6-2 to advance into the quarter finals. In later matches, Venus Williams wore out Colombias Fabiola Zuluaga 6-1, 7-6 to reach the last eight at the French Open Sunday. American seventh seed Jennifer Capriati also reached the quarter finals with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Italian 17th seed Francesca Schiavone. Capriati will face second seed Serena Williams for a place in the semi-finals. Serena reached the quarters by defeating Japans Shinobu Asagoe 6-3, 6-1. In other matches of the day Amelie Mauresmo warmed French hearts on a blustery, cold day at Roland Garros, wiping Magdalena Maleeva off the court 6-2, 6-1 to reach the quarter finals for the second successive year. Sixth seed Anastasia Myskina scraped into the quarters for the first time battling back to edge out fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 1-6, 6-4, 8-6. Third seed Guillermo Coria eased into the quarter finals when his French opponent Nicolas Escude retired injured after losing the first set 0-6. The Argentine clinched the first set in 25 minutes before the Frenchman decided to stop. The nature of Escudes injury was not immediately clear, although he has a history of back and groin problems. Earlier, 2002 champion Albert Costa lost 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-8 to Belgiums Xavier Malisse in a third-round match held over from Saturday. Dementieva was in cracking form against Davenport. The Russian was in charge from the start and Davenport, with a sore right knee taped, quickly slumped out of the only Grand Slam she has yet to win. The victory put ninth seed Dementieva into the quarter finals of the French Open for the first time. Sharapova, a 17-year-old originally from Siberia, has yet to drop a set in the tournament and she swept aside her fourth-round opponent with ease. She will play Suarez in the last eight and could face Mauresmo in the semi-finals. Mahesh-Max wins Meanwhile, Indias third-seeded pair of Mahesh Bhupathi and his partner Max Mirnyi beat the Croat pair of Mario Ancic and Ivan Ljubicic 6-2, 6-2 in the third round. Among boys, Karan Rastogi beat Jonathan Dasnieres of France 6-3, 6-7 (1-7), 6-3. On Saturday, Leander Paes advanced to the second round of the mixed doubles with Martina Navratilova. Paes and Navratilova, sixth seeds, breezed past Magui Serna and Martin Rodgriguez 6-3, 6-2 into the second round (as reported in Sundays Late City edition).  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pakistan hold upper hand
 All eyes are on Shoaib Akhtar Auckland: The cricketing gods have given Pakistan all the aces for the one-day series against New Zealand starting on Saturday. Not only do the tourists bring enterprising top-order batting and a more than useful lower-order into play, they have a bowling attack with strengths across the board. In the just completed Test series won by Pakistan 1-0, the New Zealand batsmen had no answer to the lethal pace and reverse swing of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami, and the problem will be compounded with the need for instant runs in one-day matches. Pakistan have an impressive recent record against the Black Caps in one-day Internationals, having won 13 of the past 15 encounters, including a 5-0 whitewash in last months series. New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns gave a blunt summation of the problems facing the team in the five one-day matches: It is pretty hard trying to hit 150kmh reverse-swinging yorkers all over the park. Cairns, who is expected to play after being struck by a virus that sidelined him from the second Test, said New Zealand would have to produce a healthy run rate right from the start of the innings before the strike power of Akhtar and Sami return at the death. Bowling at the death is one of their strengths, he said. As a batsman, you just have to accept that you are unlikely to be as effective as you usually would in the closing stages. Inzamam-ul-Haqs team may have lost some of their more famous names but the young guns at the top of the order had made a big impression, and have the security of a seasoned middle and lower support group. In the recent series in Pakistan openers Yasir Hameed and Imran Farhat set a world record with four successive 100-run partnerships and Hameed finished the series with 356 runs while Farhat made 348. We need to take wickets at the top of the order. Their main game plan revolves around their young batsmen making a good start and getting them through to the 30 and 40-over mark with eight or nine wickets intact, said Cairns. In one-dayers New Zealand are on a seven-match losing streak while Pakistan showed they remain in top form by beating Wellington in a warm-up match this week.  THE SQUADS New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Craig Cumming, Hamish Marshall, Craig McMillan, Scott Styris, Chris Cairns, Brendon McCullum, Jacob Oram, Andre Adams, Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey, Ian Butler. Pakistan: Taufeeq Umar, Imran Farhat, Saleem Elahi, Yasir Hameed, Yousuf Youhana, Inzamam ul-Haq (captain), Asim Kamal, Younis Khan, Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Danish Kaneria, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Umer Gul, Azhar Mahmood.

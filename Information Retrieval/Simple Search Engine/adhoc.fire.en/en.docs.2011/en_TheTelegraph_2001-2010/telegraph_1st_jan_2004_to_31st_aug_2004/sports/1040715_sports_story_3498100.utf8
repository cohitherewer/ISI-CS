The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Javed Miandads Indian channel
 - Former Pak coach to be expert on television across the border  Miandad is not averse to taking up coaching assignments in India Islamabad: Cold-shouldered at home, former Pakistani coach and skipper Javed Miandad has found solace in New Delhi. At a studio in Indian television network Zee TV, to be precise. Miandad on Wednesday left for the Indian Capital to take up an assignment with the TV channel and evaluate various offers on coaching. Miandad will be an expert on the channel during the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka, and will stay in India for over three weeks. I have accepted to work for the Indian channel despite a similar offer from some of the Pakistan television networks, and I am looking forward to a fruitful and happy stay in India which I always have had in the past, he said before his departure. By accepting the new assignment, Miandad has joined the ranks of his former colleagues  Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Rameez Raja and Imran Khan  who have done stints as commentators in India for various channels. Still bitter about the way he was sacked by the Pakistan Cricket Board, Miandad said he was happy that Intikhab Alam had accepted to coach Punjab and earn the distinction of being the first Pakistani cricketer to coach in India. I am not averse to taking up coaching assignments in India. There are few offers but I will decide after talking to various Indian cricketers and officials, he said adding that he has been sounded by the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai to coach the boys at its academy. Miandad said it was ironical that former Pakistani cricketers were travelling to India on coaching assignments, while the PCB was busy hiring more and more foreign experts to train the local cricketers. Besides chief coach Bob Woolmer, the PCB has hired Barry Richards and Greg Chappell as batting consultants and Darryl Foster as bowling coach in addition to two South African physical trainers. After removing me as coach, they have taken the same team for the Asia Cup, which I built during the last one year, Miandad said. I moulded this team after the disastrous performance in the World Cup and made it fit enough to defeat South Africa and give a close fight to India during the recent series. They do this to me every time. In the past too I was removed after the team started performing well. The story is the same. I have done wonderful job for Pakistan team, which is praised by Woolmer himself, said Miandad who has been sacked thrice as coach of the team. Woolmer admires me so much both as a cricketer and as a coach, he said recalling his recent meeting with the new coach. Miandad refused to accept the criticism that the team had performed badly against India in the recent home series. It was a closely fought series. I am happy the way we played. My feeling would have been the same if we had won the close matches. I am proud of my work and I am entitled to get some respect for it. Miandad said after the World Cup debacle, newcomers like Umar Gul, Shabbir Ahmed and Yasir Hamid had been doing well under his coaching and skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, who had a prolonged failure till the world cup, also started performing well. He said the main problem dogging Pakistani cricket today was that many cricketers wanted to join the team to improve their skills.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB scrape past Wari
	 - SUPER DIVISION  A STAFF REPORTER  Malsawmtluanga in action against Wari on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Dogged by some poor ground conditions, it was another dull day for East Bengal. They, however, managed to scrape past Wari AC by a third minute strike from Shylo Malsawmtluanga in a CFL Super Division match at their home ground on Tuesday. East Bengal had managed a free-kick just outside the box and as veteran Tushar Rakshit floated the ball inside the box from the right corner, Malsawmtluanga headed home with immaculate precision. East Bengal got a chance to increase the lead in the 26th minute when they were awarded a penalty, but Douglas da Silvas left-footer was saved by Wari goalkeeper Kalyan Lodh diving to his left. This was after a Rakshit forward pass was nicely intercepted by Malsawmtluanga, who was brought down inside the box by Pradip Tewari. After the breather, Subhas Bhowmick made a double-substitution, bringing in Akshay Das and Bhola Prasad in place of Prasanta Sarkar and Chandan, respectively. But that too didnt help and on a few occasions, the glamour side had to fall back on Malsawmtluanga and Douglas in the defence.

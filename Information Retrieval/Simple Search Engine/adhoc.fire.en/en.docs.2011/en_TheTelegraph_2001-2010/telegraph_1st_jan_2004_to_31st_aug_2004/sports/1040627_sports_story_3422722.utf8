The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nothings impossible now, feel giant-killers
 - Greeks hail greatest moment in their sporting history  Angelos Haristeas celebrates Greeces matchwinner at the Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon on Friday. (Reuters) Lisbon, June 26 (Reuters): Greece believe they can go all the way to the European Championship final after their stunning 1-0 victory over holders France in the quarter finals on Friday. Our aim now is the final, of course Now nothing is impossible any more after this result, assistant coach Yannis Topalidis said. In what was the biggest upset in the tournaments history, Greece knocked favourites France out of the meet to reach the semis. Having won 2-1 against Portugal in the meet-opener, Greece became the first team to beat both champions and hosts in the same championship. Of course, we are satisfied with this result but we want to go to the final and for that we may need a bit of luck as well, Topalidis said. Striker Angelos Haristeas, who scored the winner, said: Tonight we really showed what we can do. Weve shown Greece deserves to be exactly where it is. This had nothing to do with luck. I believe at this stage this is a great opportunity and since we have fought hard and played as a team in all the (previous) games why not go all the way, he said. Otto Rehhagel, the 65-year-old German who steered Greece into history books, said: This story will go around the world. I want to congratulate my players for this unbelievable victory which was delivered with passion. The French thought at first were the best and it was only later on that they noticed uh-oh. And then they went to kick and run football and, oh, what a mess. My team kept with the strategy that we had agreed and we won this game. Now we must regroup and are looking forward to the next game with great joy. The Greeks were always great individualists but they have come to understand that success only comes through the team. Its always all about the team, the German said. Back home, the Greeks hailed their triumphant soccer team as lions and gifts from the Gods for delivering to the nation what many described as one of its greatest sporting moments since the ancient Olympics. From the capital Athens to the hundreds of islands, Greeks sought each other out in town squares and on beaches to cheer, dance, set off fireworks and marvel that two months before the Athens Olympics they are already in the spotlight of world sport. They were fantastic, brilliant. They were lions, said shop owner Dimitris Papadopoulos in the Athens main nightlife district of Plaka. Now we are going to win the whole thing. Were going to take it. Everybody thought that France would have beaten us by four or more goals. But now that we are in the semi-finals, we are going all the way. It is unbelieveable, undescribable. I really cannot believe it. Its the greatest moment in our sporting history that we beat all those great teams, said fellow shop-owner Nikos Bakosis. But I dont know how it has happened. Maybe its gifts from the Gods. Within minutes of Greece winning against hot favourites France, town squares across the country of 10 million were swollen with thousands of people. Streets were jammed with cars and motor bikes blowing their horns and people waving every size of Greek flag and setting off ship flares. Even the capitals famed stray dogs, who are just part of the scenery for most city residents, joined in the din barking endlessly at the uproar around them. On the island of Evia off Athens, where, as in many places elsewhere, hundreds of people watched giant TV screens set up on the beach, housewife Katya Velissariou screamed with tears streaming down her cheeks: Greece is going to burn tonight. The countrys most famed sports commentator Yannis Diakogiannis spoke for all Greeks when he said that with the Olympic Games still to come in Athens in August, the country, which has known little sporting success in recent years, was in the midst of a magical era. This is the best advertisement there could possibly be for the Olympic Games. This is the summer of Greece, he said.  Copyright

 Bashar ton puts Bangla on top
Gros Islet (St Lucia): Habibul Bashar completed his third Test hundred, as Bangladesh continued their defiance before rain prompted an early tea break on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies on Friday. Choosing to bat, the visitors had reached 166 for two at the tea break with Bashar, the Bangladesh captain, undefeated on 111 and Rajin Saleh unbeaten on 10 when an unexpected shower arrived about 50 minutes before the break. Bashar pulled a short delivery from fast bowler Tino Best to long leg for a single to reach his landmark. He hit 15 boundaries from 124 balls in just over three hours to be the rock upon which his side has built their total. West Indies only success before the break was Javed Omar. The opening batsman was caught at gully off left-arm medium-fast bowler Pedro Collins for 32 to end a 121-run stand with his captain that had put the home team on the back foot before lunch. Bashar and the circumspect Omar had taken Bangladesh to 101 for one at the lunch interval, after the visitors made an inauspicious start. Hannan Sarkar was adjudged leg before to the first ball of the match from Collins for 0. With the West Indies fast bowlers unable to extract help from the Beausejour Stadium pitch, Bashar and Omar mixed sound defence with aggression to stage a brave recovery. Omar was also fortunate though, having been dropped on seven when he whipped a sharp chance to forward short leg fielder Dwayne Smith off Fidel Edwards. On 36, Bashar too, had top-edged a hook at a delivery from Jermaine Lawson, but wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs could only get his fingertips to the ball. It might not have mattered anyhow, since umpire Daryll Harper signalled leg byes. Collins has been the most successful West Indies bowler with two wickets for 59 runs from 13 overs. (AFP)  Copyright

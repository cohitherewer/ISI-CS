The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Losing early wickets the cause: Sourav
Dambulla: Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly on Sunday sought to play down the disappointing loss to Sri Lanka in their last Asia Cup league match and said his team still had an opportunity to bounce back. We still have an opportunity, Sourav said after India went down to hosts by 12 runs here. The points system is such that we start all over again and hence we will have the opportunity to make amends. India, who finished second in its pool, will now face off against Bangladesh on Wednesday before taking on pool B toppers Pakistan Friday and the hosts again on July 29. Sourav said the team lost too many wickets in the first 15 overs and could not recover from the setback. I thought we gave lot of runs in the last ten overs and lost too many wickets in the first 15. We then did well to reach 270, but I thought we lost too many wickets in the first 15 overs, he said. When asked about the reasons for promoting wicket-keeper batsman Parthiv Patel to the top of the order, Sourav said: Patel is a good player of fast bowling. The pressure on number six and seven batsman is very much and so I wanted Yuvraj and Kaif to play in that position. He also expressed concern over the fitness of fast bowler Zaheer Khan, who came with a runner to bat. Zaheer (his injury) is a worry. Hope he recovers soon. Sri Lankan vice-captain Mahela Jayawardene expressed satisfaction over the overall performance of the team. We managed to keep wickets and then launch an onslaught in the last 10 overs. The fast bowlers also bowled a very good line in the opening spell and took early wickets. (PTI)  Copyright

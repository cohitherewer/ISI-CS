The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Big W awaits fiery encounter
 Roddick helped Schalken escape a hotel fire in Rome last month London: Andy Roddick and Sjeng Schalken share a bond that goes beyond tennis. Last month, Roddick helped Schalken escape from a hotel fire in Rome that killed three people. Now their paths are crossing again  in the Wimbledon quarter finals. Any time you share a very traumatic situation, and kind of share that fear with someone and get out of it, theres always something there, Roddick said. I dont know what that is, but there is kind of something between us now. By the same token, were both going to try to win a Wimbledon quarter final. Roddick advanced to the final eight with a 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 win over Alexander Popp of Germany, while Schalken beat Vince Spadea 6-2, 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 on Monday to reach the quarter finals for the third straight year. Roddick has defeated Schalken in three of their four matches, including a 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 rout at the Australian Open in January. Ive done pretty well against him our last couple of matches, but weve never played on grass before, Roddick said. He definitely knows how to play on grass. Roddick, Schalken, Marat Safin and other players were staying at a luxury hotel in Rome for the Italian Open when a fire broke out in the early morning hours of May 1. Schalken jumped from his balcony to Roddicks balcony a floor below, with the American helping to catch him. From there, they were rescued by fire truck ladders. Roddick helped about a dozen guests to safety from his balcony. Roddick, who lost his first-round match in Rome, said last week it was probably the first time in my life, I was out on the court and could care less if I won or lost. I wanted to go home and I wanted to see my family. Asked about playing Roddick for the first time since the fire, Schalken said with a smile, I hope hes thinking about that a little bit, and taking it easy on me. He didnt do that the last three times. No, well go out, go for it. Before and after well be good friends, and on the court well try to win.  (AP)  Copyright

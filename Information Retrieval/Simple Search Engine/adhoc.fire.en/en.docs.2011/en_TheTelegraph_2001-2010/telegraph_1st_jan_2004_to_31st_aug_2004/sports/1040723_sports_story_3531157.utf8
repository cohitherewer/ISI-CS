The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Somas focus now on speed and endurance
	 - Coach says heptathlete can reach 6462 points  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Soma says she has now overcome the awe of Olympics that troubled her in Sydney. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Asian Games silver medallist heptathlete Soma Biswas, who has become only the second athlete from Bengal to have qualified for the Athens Olympic Games (the other being paddler Mouma Das), believes that she could well move into the top ten-bracket if she can improve on her high jump and the 800/200 features. At a press meet here on Thursday, Soma said she was probably peaking at the right time, and her coach Kuntal Roy felt it was possible to add around 300 points to her qualifying total of 6162 points (with which she beat the A qualifying mark of 6050). This is a possibility, because I believe she has still more to give, her personal best (set as a national record at the 2000 inter-state meet in Chennai) being 6186, said Roy. Somas national record has since been rewritten by J.J. Sobha at 6211. Sobha qualified earlier. The high jump is a good place to gain points, he said, each extra centimetre adding 13 points. And since one can only add in multiples of three centimetres, its 39 points in one go, if she can. Soma, 26, who moves over to the national camp Friday, intends to take up special coaching in speed and endurance, the two aspects that will help me in the 200 and 800, respectively. And I believe in the days left (she takes to the Olympic track on August 20) she will be able to make the best of this concentrated training. In most, she has performed under her personal best at the just-concluded Chennai inter-state meet. In the long jump, for example, she has done 6.27, where her personal best is 6.32, and while in the high jump she did 1.67m in Chennai, her personal best has been 1.73, of 2002. There is all this strength still, latent, inside her, said Roy, and I believe she can take that much more out. Roy said: Let me tell you that Soma will be among the top four in the 800m heats and among the top two in the 200m heats in Athens. Soma said she has now overcome her scare of the Olympics that she had felt in Sydney  I was innocent, so to say and too fresh, but I have grown mentally thereafter and I feel more confident. I dont even feel too bad that India does not have any foreign coach for my discipline. My target in Athens will first be the 6200 mark, and then to beat the national mark of 6211 (by Sobha). That will be a fight within a fight for the two heptathletes. She remains a bit worried that her personal coach Roy will not be accompanying her to Athens. This will worry me, surely, Soma admitted. The Bengal Amateur Athletic Association, West Bengal (AAAWB) gave a purse of Rs 10,000 to Soma for food supplements, as secretary Debashis Banerjee put it. It was handed over by Prasun Mukherjee, AAAWB president and Additional DG of Police (Railways).  Copyright

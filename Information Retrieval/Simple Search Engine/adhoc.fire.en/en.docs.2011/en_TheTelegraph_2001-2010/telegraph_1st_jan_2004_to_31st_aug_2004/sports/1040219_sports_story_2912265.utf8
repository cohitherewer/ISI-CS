The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Randhawa ready to fire
 - MALAYSIAN OPEN 
- Montgomerie, Harrington confident of handling Asian challenge  Indian hopes centre around Jyoti Randhawa New Delhi: Indian golfing ace Jyoti Randhawa will lead the Indian challenge in the $ 1.21 million Carlsberg Malaysian Open which tees off at the Saujana Golf and Country Club, Kuala Lumpur, on Thursday. Randhawa, who is currently placed 90th in world rankings, had finished joint-second in the Johhny Walker Classic in Malaysia last week. With defending champion Arjun Atwal skipping the tee-off order, Indian hopes are pinned on Randhawa in the European and Asian PGA Tour joint-sanctioned event. The Gurgaon-based pro who is currently in second position in Asian rankings is raring to go. I am playing well. I am confident of a good finish, said Randhawa. Jeev Milkha Singh, who had a bumpy ride last season, will also be hoping to regain his form. The other Indians in fray include Vijay Kumar, who currently leads the Hero Honda Indian Golf Tour Order of Merit list. Harmeet Kahlon who had injured his elbow recently, will be back in action. Amandeep Johl and Arjun Singh complete the list of Indian entries. Some of the top names in world golf are also in fray. Scotlands Colin Montgomerie, the Irish duo of Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley will be among the favourites. Harrington and seven-time European No. 1 Montgomerie have been successful campaigners in Asia and are eyeing this event brimful of confidence. World No. 11 Harrington and Briton Montgomerie have each won twice on the Asian continent in the last two years and admit to enjoying the comfort level in this part of the world. Ive been second twice here in Malaysia and had a fourth place finish in 1999, so I do like it here, the 32-year-old Harrington said as he prepared for the opening round. I dont have a problem with the heat and I feel very comfortable in it. Plus I have played well in Asia, winning the BMW Asian Open in Taiwan two years ago and then the Hong Kong Open just before Christmas, added the Irishman, who returns from nine weeks off to make his first tournament appearance of the year. Harrington is the highest-ranked player in a co-sanctioned field that also includes compatriot and fellow Ryder Cup player McGinley and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. Montgomerie returns to action after tying for 16th and 13th at the South African Open and Johnnie Walker Classic earlier this year, satisfying finishes for a player using new clubs and a new caddie this season. I am putting better now than the first two weeks of the year and, if I can putt well, I am usually around the top of the leader board, so lets hope that is the case this week, the 40-year-old Scot said. But Im very happy with my start to the season as I have new Yonex equipment and I am pleased with the way I am striking the ball. Like Harrington, Montgomerie is delighted to be back in Asia. I feel comfortable here and like the people and the hospitality around it, he said. I seem to do well in Asia, he added, referring to his 2002 victory at the inaugural TCL Classic in China and his win in the Macau Open at the end of last year. McGinley, bidding this week for his first European Tour title since the 2001 Welsh Open, is determined to play his way on to Europes Ryder Cup team to face the US at Oakland Hills, Michigan, this September. I want to make the Ryder Cup team, thats something I really want to achieve, said the 37-year-old Irishman, who holed the winning putt at The Belfry to clinch victory for Europe at the 2002 Ryder Cup. Its going to be tough to make it this year, though, as I think we are going to have the best European side ever. Weve got a lot of strong players coming through and the qualification system will make the team even stronger. Its not going to be easy as you will really have to play well to make the side.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Seniors finish last
Sydney: Defending champions India finished last, losing to South Africa 0-1 in the play-off for the third place, as Australia won the four-nation hockey title thrashing Malaysia 7-1 in the final on Sunday. The injury-plagued Indianslooked in complete control for most part of the play-off but were done in by a goal from penalty corner specialist Greg Nicol who struck in the 49th minute. Later in the day, Australia quickly made the final a no-contest, pumping in four goals before half-time. There was no letdown in the Australian fury after the break. India, who beat the same rivals 4-3 on Saturday, began well. However, caution was the watchword for both sides, desperate to clinch the consolation third place. The first half, which ended goalless, saw both sides probing the rival area in search of a breakthrough. India came close more than once but Jatinder Pal Singh and Kanwalpreet Singh failed to make use of few gilt-edged chances. After changing ends, India were reduced to ten men when right half Sunil Yadav earned a yellow card suspension in the 46th minute. Three minutes later, South Africa made full use of their numerical advantage when Nicol beat Indian goalkeeper Devesh Chauhan, converting the fourth penalty corner earned by his team, with a low flick. India lost Malaysia 0-3 in their first match. They drew 2-2 with favourites Australia before beating South Africa 4-3. A dejected Indian coach Rajinder Singh said his team was handicapped due to injuries to three key players. Captain Dilip Tirkey said he was disappointed at being unable to clinch even the third place. However, he said the two tournaments had proved to be an eye-opener. It has been great in providing exposure to the younger players. Tirkey felt matches against Australia would help them in the Olympics.  (PTI)  Copyright

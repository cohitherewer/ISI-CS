The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I didnt expect so much from Pak: Miandad
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Lahore: Pakistans showing in this close series has surprised even Javed Maindad. I didnt expect so much from our team. The batting has been tremendous and if the bowling clicks we have a good chance tomorrow, the Pakistan coach said on the eve of the fifth and final ODI. When Rahul Dravid was told about Miandads assessment of his own team, the Indian vice-captain brought the house down. But we are not surprised at all. Maybe we have a better opinion of the Pakistan team than he himself has, Dravid quipped. The press conference began with home team manager Haroon Rashid apologising on behalf of Inzamam-ul Haq who had asked a local journalist to shut up when he sought the skippers reaction on allegations that they had deliberately lost Sundays game. Miandad defended Shoaib Akhtar who has been guilty of spraying the ball around. Shoaib is doing his best with the ball. Sometimes he gets out of control but he realises what he needs to do tomorrow. I would only advise him not to repeat the mistakes. He is among the worlds best but the opposition too is quite tough. The coach hoped everyone is a professional and will learn from mistakes. Indias performance hasnt surprised him. Im not surprised because they came into this series with a new-found confidence from the Aussie tour. But both teams are playing excellent cricket. On the bowling coach issue, Miandad requested Imran Khan to come forward and lend a helping hand if he felt the need.  Copyright

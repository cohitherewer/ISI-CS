 Gill warning to players
 Rach came under fire Athens: Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) chief K.P.S. Gill on Thursday pulled up the players for the dismal Olympic show and warned them that indiscipline would not be tolerated any more. Taking a serious note of players airing their views in public against coach Gerhard Rach, Gill also came down heavily on the senior members of the side for not playing as a team. The players had problem with (coaches) Cedric (DSouza), (Vasudevan) Baskaran and also Rajinder (Singh). Rach has been there for one month only. But they have started to say things against him too, Gill said. I had been charged of being autocratic in the past. I wish I had been. I assure you, I will be one now. The players are not playing as a team. By dribbling past two or three players, you can impress the spectators. But this is a team game, he said in a TV interview. Gill said the IHF would continue with a foreign coach even after the Olympics. We need to start afresh. Since the last two-three Olympics we have been finishing round about the same position, he said.  Copyright

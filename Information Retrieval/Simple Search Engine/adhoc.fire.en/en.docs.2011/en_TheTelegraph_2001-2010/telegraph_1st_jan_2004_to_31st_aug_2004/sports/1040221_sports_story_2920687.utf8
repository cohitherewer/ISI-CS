The Telegraph - Calcutta
 All-Goan clash today
Margao: Haywards 2000 Sporting Club will meet Vasco at Nehru Stadium in the second leg of the National Football League (NFL), which begins Saturday at three different venues. Both teams have 15 points each at the end of first leg. With keeper Felix Dsouza and Luis Barreto injured, Sporting have recruited Dipankar Choudhary and Sarsraz Ansari. The Goa side will depend on Nigerian pair Abdul Lateef Seriki and Dudu Omagbemi. The break has helped our boys to recover from injury and we are looking for a positive start. We will continue out attacking game and hopefully collect full points, Vasco technical director Peter Valles said. Vasco will be looking to their Brazilian duo Marcos Perreira and Tochukuwu Amaechi to see them through.  (PTI)  Copyright

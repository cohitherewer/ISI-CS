The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Korea in last eight
Jinan: Striker Lee Dong-gook scored twice in the first half as South Korea crushed Kuwait 4-0 to reach the quarter finals of the Asian Cup on Tuesday. South Korea, who had failed to impress in their first two games, finished on top of group B with seven points. They will face the runners-up of group D. Lee put South Korea ahead in the 25th minute, curling a free kick from the edge of the box. Four minutes before halftime, he made it 2-0 from close after latching on to a cross from Park Jin-sub. With this strike, he became the top scorer at the Asian Cup with three goals. Germany-based forward Cha Du-ri thumped in the third goal from 25m in first-half injury time to put the result beyond doubt. Substitute Ahn Jung-Hwan added a fourth in the 76th , crashing home a right-footer from 30m to complete the last rites against the 1980 champions. South Korea have not won the Asian Cup since 1960. Meanwhile, Jordan reached their first Asian Cup quarter finals with an uninspiring 0-0 draw against the UAE on Tuesday. Jordans King Abdullah, sporting a national team shirt, was among a sparse crowd of 11,000 in Beijing and was clearly delighted by their achievement in reaching the last eight on their first appearance at the tournament. They finished second in group B behind South Korea on five points to set up a quarter final clash against the winners of group D, either Japan or Iran. Japan face Iranian test Japan are expecting a serious test of their Asian Cup credentials when the holders take on three-time champions Iran on Wednesday, with striker Ali Daei one of their main concerns, adds a report from Chongquing. Already in the quarter finals, Japan need a draw to finish on top of group D. Daei missed Irans training session on Monday after complaining of a sore right ankle but Japans players put his no-show down to a psychological ploy. Iran must draw with Japan to make sure they join the holders in the quarters but their task has been complicated after losing three defenders through suspension. Mohammad Nosrati has been banned for the rest of the tournament and Rahman Rezaei and Ali Badavi for two games each after two separate incidents of off-the-ball violence.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

(Reuters) Turin: AC Milan beat champions Juventus 3-1 on Sunday to take a big step towards their 17th Italian title as challengers Roma stumbled to a goalless draw at lowly Reggina. European champions Milan now have 64 points, seven more than second-placed Roma and nine ahead of Juventus with nine games remaining. Dutch international Clarence Seedorf scored twice in the second half as Milan added to Juves misery following their exit from the Champions League. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said there was no doubt his side was now closing in on his first Serie A title as coach. We are certainly much closer now, said Ancelotti. We are on the downhill stretch now but the team will keep themselves tough right until the end. Juve were without both their first-choice strikers, Alessandro del Piero and Frenchman David Trezeguet, and it showed as they failed to take the chances they created in a fast and entertaining first half. European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved, again looking well below his best, headed wide from a promising position in the 11th minute as Juve took the game to the team who had beaten them on penalties in last seasons Champions League final. Milan responded with swift counterattacks as Seedorf fed Brazilian Kaka, who forced Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon into action with a stinging shot. It was end-to-end football with Juve certainly playing their part. But Seedorf then created the opening goal for Milan with a cross from deep on the right flank, picking out Andriy Shevchenko who powered a header past Buffon and changed the course of the game. Alessio Tacchinardi wasted another opportunity for Juve as he fired wide after being set up by a smart pull-back from Nedved, but Juves fragile defence was twice opened up only for Shevchenko to miss the target on both occasions. Seedorfs 63rd-minute deflected strike and his sweetly-struck shot 12 minutes later, after a break down the right by Cafu who found the Dutchman unmarked on the edge of the Juve area, put the game beyond Juves reach. Juve defender Ciro Ferrara pulled one back in the 81st minute with a volley from a Mauro Camoranesi corner. Valencia closed the gap on leaders Real Madrid to just four points at the top of the Spanish league thanks to a 2-0 win at relegation-threatened Celta Vigo, adds a report from Madrid. Rafa Benitezs side was given the chance to narrow Reals lead after the champions dropped points at home for only the second time this season on Saturday. Midfielder Francisco Rufete grabbed both Valencia goals, volleying in from ten metres out after keeper Pablo Cavallero spilled a free-kick five minutes before the break and then finishing off a rapid counterattack in injury time. Earlier, in-form Barcelona made the most of a slip-up by Deportivo Coruna to overtake the Galicians and climb to third place in the table with a 2-0 victory over basement club Murcia.

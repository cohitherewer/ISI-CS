 Odumbe hearing on Tuesday
 Maurice Odumbe London: Kenyan cricketer Maurice Odumbe would face a hearing for allegedly receiving money, benefits and other rewards from a bookmaker in Nairobi from Tuesday. The ICC code of conduct hearing into the allegation that Kenyan cricketer Maurice Odumbe received money, benefit or other reward which could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute will begin in Nairobi on Tuesday, July 27, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said in a release here on Friday. Odumbe will face allegations that he had inappropriate contact with a known bookmaker and received money, benefit or reward from that bookmaker. The charge relates to an alleged breach of the ICCs code of conduct for players and team officials and follows an investigation by the ICCs Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU). The ICC said justice Ahmed Ebrahim would preside over the hearing and each party would have the opportunity to put forward evidence and call witnesses during the course of the hearing, which is expected to last five days. If found guilty, the player can face penalties ranging from a suspension for a minimum of two years to a ban for life depending upon the nature of the charge. The full hearing follows a preliminary hearing in Nairobi in May at which justice Ebrahim determined that there was a case to answer against Odumbe.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes record 70th win
 - DAVIS CUP - Same old story as India catch up with Japan Osaka: Japans Gouichi Motomura recovered from a slow start while India captain Leander Paes cruised to victory as the two teams split the opening singles of their Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group I clash on Friday. Motomura defeated Prakash Amritraj 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in the first match at Utsubo Tennis Centre as Japan got off to a winning start in the second-round tie. Not surprisingly, India bounced back through the one and only Paes who defeated Takao Suzuki 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. This was the third time in three ties that the Indian ace had tamed Japans top player. It brought up Paes 70th win in the competition, making him the most successful Indian Davis Cupper. The record had belonged to Ramanathan Krishnan (69) all these years. Paes looked to be on way to a straight-set victory before Suzuki took the third set. Chances of a Japanese comeback were dashed when Paes broke serve to go up 5-4 in the final set and then sealed the win with a brilliant crosscourt forehand. The doubles match  featuring Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi and Thomas Shimada-Takahiro Terachi  will be played on Saturday and the reverse singles on Sunday. The winner of the tie will advance to Septembers play-off ties for the World Group. Motomura said: Ive played a lot of five-set matches recently. You cant get too down on yourself if you lose the first set and I just told myself to battle back. Motomura won the first game of the first set and then lost the next five before coming back. It took me a while to adjust to the mood, said Motomura. I started to feel better midway though the first set. Motomura broke Amritrajs serve to go up 5-4 in the final set and then served out to win the match in two hours and 21 minutes. To break his serve and go up 5-4 was huge, said Motomura. We really wanted to win this first match and start things off on the right foot.  (AP)  Copyright

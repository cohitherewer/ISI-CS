The Telegraph - Calcutta
Bangla continue to bleed runs
- FINAL TEST
- Brian Lara hits 26th century to catch up with Gary Sobers 
 Brian Lara sweeps en route to his century at Sabina Park, Kingston, on SaturdayKingston: Bangladesh had little success and West Indies continued to plunder the runs on the third morning of their second and final Test on Sunday.  At lunch, West Indies, replying to Bangladeshs first innings total of 284, were 389 for the loss of four wickets with Ramnaresh Sarwan batting on 157, his highest Test score, and left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul unbeaten on 40. Bangladesh, looking to stem the flow of runs, were stonewalled when Sarwan, the West Indies vice-captain, and Chanderpaul came together, after Tapash Baisya made the breakthrough in the third over of the day. Sarwan and Chanderpaul have so far added 92, unbroken, for the fifth wicket, but Bangladesh claimed the wicket of nightwatchman Tino Best when he was caught behind for four touching a short, rising ball to give Khaled Mashud his third dismissal  all catches  in the West Indies innings. Sarwan, in the middle of his fifth Test hundred, reached the 150-run mark when he turned a ball from Mushfiqur Rahman through mid-wicket for a single. The West Indies vice captain has smote 18 boundaries from 268 balls in just under seven hours. Half of Chanderpauls runs have come in boundaries from 59 balls in just under two hours that has helped to fortify West Indies position in the Test. On Saturday Brian Lara blasted 12 fours and three sixes in a typically magnificent 120, his 26th century in 108 Tests.The effort placed Lara alongside Gary Sobers as the West Indian with maximum Test tons. Lara scored 120. He raced to 50, with two sixes and his sixth four off 54 balls in just over an hour. With blazing Lara strokes continuing to flow, Sarwan was content playing the silent partner, although he, too, produced some delightful shots all around the outfield. It was not long before the Jamaican crowd was saluting another Lara milestone. He nudged his 121st ball to mid-on to reach three figures. Bangladesh finally ended Laras gem as Mohammed Rafique induced an edge.  (Agencies)  Copyright

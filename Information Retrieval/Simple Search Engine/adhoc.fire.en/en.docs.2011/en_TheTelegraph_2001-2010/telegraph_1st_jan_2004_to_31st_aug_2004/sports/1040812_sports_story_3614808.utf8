 Sangakkara dominates Day I
 - FINAL TEST- Muralidharan misses out, to undergo shoulder surgery  Kumar Sangakkara en route to his unbeaten 157 in Colombo on Wednesday, Day I of the second and final Test between Sri Lanka and South Africa. (AFP) Colombo: Kumar Sangakkara scored his sixth Test hundred as Sri Lanka posted 303 for three on the first day of the second and final Test against South Africa on Wednesday. Sangakkara, playing as a specialist batsman in the series, was unbeaten on 157 after sharing important partnerships with Sanath Jayasuriya (43) and Mahela Jayawardene (82). Jayawardene, a double-centurion in the first Test, provided the support role for Sangakkara before being bowled late in the day by a Makhaya Ntini inswinger. Chaminda Vaas is at the crease with four. There was some bad news for the hosts in the morning when Muttiah Muralidharan was ruled out with an injured shoulder that will require surgery. The record-breaking off-spinner, who has 532 Test wickets, needs surgery to have fluid removed from his bowling shoulder and is expected to miss the rest of South Africas tour. Muralidharan was replaced by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath while fast bowler Lasith Malinga replaced allrounder Farveez Maharoof. Sangakkara and Jayawardene shared a record 192-run third-wicket stand for Sri Lanka against South Africa, surpassing the 168 they put together in Durban in 2000. Both were fortunate as Jacques Kallis missed Sangakkara at slip on 57 and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher dropped Jayawardene on 16 off a thick edge from Nicky Boje. Sangakkara, who passed 3000 runs earlier in the day, stroked two boundaries in the penultimate over to carry Sri Lanka past 300 and himself past 150 for the third time. The previous two times he passed 150, he went on to score double centuries. The 26-year-old left-hander came to the crease in the first over after captain Maravan Atapattu smashed one cover drive for four before nicking a Shaun Pollock outswinger to Boucher. Jayasuriya, perilously close to being leg-before on one and then fortunate when he slashed through the slips, was unlucky to be adjudged leg-before shortly before lunch to Boje. Sangakkara later said negative South African tactics had allowed the home team to seize control of Day I. It was surprising to see a negative approach right from the start, said Sangakkara. We lost the first wicket in the first over and the pressure was right on us. However, there werent many close catchers behind the wicket and there were lots of guys saving boundaries.

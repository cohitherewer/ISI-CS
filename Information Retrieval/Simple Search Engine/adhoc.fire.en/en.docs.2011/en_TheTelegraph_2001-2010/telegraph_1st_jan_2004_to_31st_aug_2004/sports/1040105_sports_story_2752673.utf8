 Harsh, Prakash in first-round clash

(AFP) Chennai: India is assured of a first round win in singles as two wild cards  Prakash Amritraj and Harsh Mankad  have been drawn to play in the main draw of the ATP Tour Tata Open starting on Monday. Top seed and former world No. 1 Carlos Moya of Spain will open his 2004 campaign on a relatively easy note as he runs into a qualifier while defending champion Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand will clash with Albert Motanes, also of Spain. The tournament has been proving that Indians are perfect hosts, so selfless that they frittered away chances through wild cards so far in eight years, barring once when Leander Paes made good use of it losing in the 1998 semi-finals to top seed Patrick Rafter. He had also won first round matches in 1999 and 2000. Though Paes was expected to use the event to return to competitive tennis after his illness and make the much-awaited reunion with Mahesh Bhupathi, his decision ruling himself out to take more rest before the Australian Open has affected the field in doubles. The continued separation of the Indian duo, arguably one of the best pairs in world doubles in recent times, has also resulted in dwindling crowd support to the tournament. Paes withdrawal has forced Bhupathi to pair with an unknown Dmitry Tursinov of Russia. But, Bhupathi expressed confidence of doing well, having been drawn to play against the top-seeded duo of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel in the first round. The Paes-Bhupathi combine still holds the record of having won on four occasions (1997, 1998, 1999, 2002) in six appearances. In 2000, Bhupathi did not compete due to an injury and Paes partnered Byron Black of Zimbabwe. Last year, Bhupathi in Tood Woodbridges company lost in the semi-finals, while Paes with David Rikl lost in the quarter finals. Reacting to the draw, Bhupathi said: It does not look a strong field and I should be able to do well. Paradorn said he had never played against his first round rival Motanes. I never plan to win a title but scheme my way on winning match by match. On his being the lone Asian in top flight tennis, the Thai said: ATP Tour events are fairly easier than Grand Slams. I had in both Wimbledon and US Open made the last 16. My first goal will be to move successfully from first to second week and so on. I am proud to play in ATP tournaments held in Asian countries which is very special to me. I play for the Asians. I am coming to Chennai for the third time since the knowledgeable crowd appreciates good tennis and I am able to raise my game because of their support, said Paradorn. (PTI)  Copyright

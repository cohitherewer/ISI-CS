 Dalmiyas vote for Wright
New Delhi: The BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya didnt exactly reveal a secret when he indicated on Thursday that John Wright would continue as coach of the Indian team. Wright, whose contribution to the success of the Indian team has been widely acknowledged, is likely to get a fresh contract when his current term ends in September. Acknowledging that the former New Zealand skipper has done a good job since taking charge in November 2000, Dalmiya said he believed in continuity. The decision regarding the re-appointment of Wright will be taken by the working committee. We have no plans of saying goodbye to anybody at the moment, Dalmiya said. Wright has done a good job, but it is a decision which will be taken by the working committee at a later stage, he added.  (PTI)  Copyright

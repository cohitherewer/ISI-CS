The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal, United win
London: Arsenal clocked up a record-equalling unbeaten start to the season on Saturday with a nervy 2-1 win over Bolton Wanderers that kept them nine points clear at the top of the Premier League. Goals from Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp ensured Arsenal matched the feat of Leeds United in 1973-74 and Liverpool in 1987-88 of going 29 top-flight league matches without defeat from the start of a season. Arsenal, with 73 points, did not extend their lead at the top, though, after second-placed Chelsea beat Fulham 2-1 and Manchester United trounced Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 to reach 61 points in third place. A last-minute goal from Sami Hyypia gave Liverpool a 1-0 win over lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers. (Reuters)  Copyright

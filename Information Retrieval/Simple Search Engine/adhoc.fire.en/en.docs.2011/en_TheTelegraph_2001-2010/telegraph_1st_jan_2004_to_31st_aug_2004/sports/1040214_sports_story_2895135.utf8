 Manav in semis

Joining him in the last four stage are BG Lalithakumara of Sri Lanka, James Smith of England and Matthew Kent of South Africa. All these four had to survive the intense competition of the pre-quarters as well as quarter finals, which took place on the same day.

In the losers plate final played on stableford format against full handicap, RCGC captain Ashit Luthra narrowly lost by a single point to K Prabagaran of Sri Lanka.

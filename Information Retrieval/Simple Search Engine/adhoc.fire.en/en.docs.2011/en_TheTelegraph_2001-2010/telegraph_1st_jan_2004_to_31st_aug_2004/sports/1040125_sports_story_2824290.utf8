The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Legal hurdles in the way
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Barreto  Calcutta, Jan. 24: Mohun  Bagan, trying to avail of a foreigner in the striking zone  in place of Jose Ramirez Barreto who has left for Brazil,  may run into some legal hurdles, with the National Football  League rules having no provision so far to replace a registered  foreign player. The maximum quota of foreigners per club  for the NFL is four. Mohun Bagan have two Brazilians in Eduardo and Leonardo. They are also wanting to register medio Noel Kasak. Hence they need a slot for any new foreigner in attack which they need when the second leg of the NFL starts. That place so far belongs to Barreto, whose name remains on the list. AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco told The Telegraph over phone from Goa that he has yet to receive any request in this regard from any quarter (protocol being player to club to state body to national body and back). He said: If a request comes the case will have to be placed to the NFL committee individually. Either the rules will have to be amended for this, or this will be treated as a special case, if cleared at all. No personal request from Barreto will be entertained. That will be referred back to the state body, Colaco said. And Barreto will, anyway, have to get an international transfer certificate to play anywhere else. No request from any club has so far reached the IFA, said secretary Subrata Dutta. The process is likely to be intensified from Monday. Meanwhile, Colaco said that the AIFF wants its headquarters to move to New Delhi as soon as possible.  Copyright

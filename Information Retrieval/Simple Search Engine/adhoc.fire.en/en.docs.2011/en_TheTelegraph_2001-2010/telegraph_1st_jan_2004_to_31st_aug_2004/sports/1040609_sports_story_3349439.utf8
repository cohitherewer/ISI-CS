 No entry for Lele
Vadodara: Former BCCI secretary J.Y. Lele was denied permission to attend the AGM of the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) on Tuesday. Lele, also a former BCA secretary, was not allowed because he is no longer a member of the association. He came to the meeting as a representative of the Anonya Cricket Club, which participates in tournaments conducted by the BCA. Lele, whose wife Anjali could attend the meeting as she is still a member of the BCA, later said he would take legal action.  (PTI)  Copyright

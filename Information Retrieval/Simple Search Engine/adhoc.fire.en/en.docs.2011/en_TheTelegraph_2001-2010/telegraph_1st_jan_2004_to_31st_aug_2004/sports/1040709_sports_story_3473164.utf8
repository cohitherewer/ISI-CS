 Kasimdzhanov draws first blood
	 - WORLD CHESS FINAL Tripoli, July 8 (PTI): Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan crashed through the defences of Englishman Michael Adams in the second game of the finals of the world chess championship on Wednesday (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). Kasimdzhanov leads the six-game match 1.5-0.5. It may be recalled that coming to the finals, the Uzbek had shown the exit door to three of the top four seeds, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, Alexander Grishchuk of Russia and Vassily Ivanchuk of the Ukraine. Unlike the first game that was drawn without a real contest, the second provided ample fireworks. Kasimdzhanov started sniffing a chance from the 35th move and the game lasted 20 moves thereafter. Adams made up for some of the slight lapses on his part and precisely defended for some time, but the end came quite abruptly with Kasimdzhanovs rooks doing the damage. It was another excellent result for the Uzbek, after drawing easily with black in the opening game, and four draws in the remaining games will fetch him something that he might have been very secretly hoping for. It was a Petroff Defence where nothing worked well for Adams who played black. He was caught in a knight sortie in the middle-game that ensured Kasimdzhanov a lasting advantage and he nurtured it for a long time. Even the trading of pawns at regular intervals did not help the Englishman and Kasimdzhanov made steady progress to maintain the pressure. However, with time running out, Kasimdzhanov missed a simple tactical move and much to his relief, Adams failed to spot it on move 40. He was gradually outplayed in the ensuing rook and pawns endgame after a little more drama, wherein Kasimdzhanov once more missed a more promising continuation. In the next game, Adams has white pieces and will certainly try to do better than the first game of the match that lasted only till the 18th move.  Copyright

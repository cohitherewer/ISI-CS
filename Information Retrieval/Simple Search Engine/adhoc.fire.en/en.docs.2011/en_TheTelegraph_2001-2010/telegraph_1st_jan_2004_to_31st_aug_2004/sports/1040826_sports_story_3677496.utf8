The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lanka win series
 - Pollocks feat not enough as hosts go 3-0 up  Shaun Pollock, who became the seventh bowler to take 300 wickets in ODIs, unsuccessfully appeals against Maravan Atapattu in Dambulla on Wednesday Colombo: Sri Lanka skipper Maravan Atapattu scored an unbeaten 97 to guide his team to a four-wicket victory and an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series against South Africa on Wednesday. Sri Lanka, set a target of 192 after a fine performance from their spinners, lost both openers cheaply and suffered a late-innings wobble before winning with 14 balls to spare. Atapattu led from the front on a difficult batting track, hitting eight boundaries and sharing important partnerships with Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Chaminda Vaas. Sri Lanka were cruising on 111 for three but the loss of Jayawardene (21), Tillekeratne Dilshan (3) and Upul Chandana (6) in quick succession left them precariously placed at 145 for six. Needing 46 from 54 balls, Atapattu released the pressure with a brace of boundaries off Lance Klusener and with South Africa dropping Vaas twice, Sri Lanka sneaked home. Pace bowler Shaun Pollock became the seventh bowler in history to take 300 one-day wickets when he had opener Sanath Jayasuriya caught in the gully. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath and part-time off spinner Tillekeratne Dilshan starred with the ball, taking six for 53 between them as South Africa lost their last seven wickets for 47 runs. Herath was chiefly responsible for South Africas downfall, snapping up three crucial top order wickets to finish with three for 28, while Dilshan mopped up the tail and finished with three for 25. The tourists have now lost eight successive matches.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

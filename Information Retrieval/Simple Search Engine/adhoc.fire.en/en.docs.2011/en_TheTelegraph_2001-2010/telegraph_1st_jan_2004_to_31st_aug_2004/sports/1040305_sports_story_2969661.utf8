 Waugh twins make quiet start
 Mark Waugh Steve WaughSydney: The Waugh twins took to the field for what could well be their first-class swansong on Thursday, but neither got a chance to show their mettle with either bat or ball. Apart from the last over of the day, bowled by Steve Waugh to the musical strains of For hes a jolly good fellow, the pair spent the day fielding as New South Wales fought for a place in the Sheffield Shield final. Facing a powerful Queensland batting outfit, neither risked rolling their arm over. The four-day match, being played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, will help determine which state plays in the final against Victoria starting on March 12. At stumps, Queensland were 282 for six after New South Wales skipper Steve had sent them into bat. For the Waugh brothers, it is their last match at their beloved home ground. The final, should they reach it, will be played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Colombian footballer shot dead
 Bogota: Former Colombia footballer Albeiro  Palomo Usuriaga was shot dead at his home in Cali, police  said. Usuriaga, 37, was playing cards with friends on Wednesday  when he was shot several times with a handgun.  Police colonel Mario Gutierrez said there were no  leads at present. Usuriaga played most of his career with  Nacional Medellin, winning the South American club championship,  the Copa Libertadores, in 1989.  He helped Colombia qualify for the 1990 World Cup  finals but was surprisingly overlooked for the tournament.  (AFP)  Copyright

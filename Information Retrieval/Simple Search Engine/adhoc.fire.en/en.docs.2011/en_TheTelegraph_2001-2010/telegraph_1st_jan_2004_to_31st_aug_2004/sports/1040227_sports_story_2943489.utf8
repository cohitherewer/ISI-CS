The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First day washed out
Bulawayo: A downpour in the early afternoon washed out the first day of the second and final Test between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh on Thursday. Umpires David Orchard of Australia and Englands Neil Mallender decided that an already sodden outfield at the Queens Sports Club caused by heavy overnight rain had deteriorated too far to think about starting the match. Ground staff spent several hours mopping up and the boundary rope had been moved inwards to leave some of the affected outfield beyond the normal playing area.  (AFP)  Copyright

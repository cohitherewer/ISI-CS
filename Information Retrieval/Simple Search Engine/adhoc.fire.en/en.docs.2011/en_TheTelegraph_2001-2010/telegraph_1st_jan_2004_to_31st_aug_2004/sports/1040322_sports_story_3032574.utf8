 Shaharyar not for off-shore meets 
 Shaharyar Khan Lahore: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan is not in favour of frequent India versus Pakistan matches so soon after resumption of bilateral cricketing ties between the two countries. I would rather prefer we play a proper bilateral series once a year, instead of playing here and there throughout the year, Shaharyar was quoted as saying in a Pakistan paper. The PCB chief said he saw very little chance of Pakistan taking part in any triangular series this year. [PCB chief executive Rameez Raja had confirmed last week that India, Pakistan and Australia will take part in a tri-series in Amstelveen (Holland) in August and that there was a possibility of another series possibly in November.] There has been some talk about playing with India later this year, but I doubt whether we would be able to do it. I dont want a situation where we go overboard in our efforts to play against each other to make money just because we have resumed cricket ties after a long period, he said. Shaharyar said he was not in favour of having matches with India at off-shore venues unless the tournaments were scheduled well in advance. I am more in favour of having a proper tour of India early next year to play Tests and one-day Internationals. But we have to sit down and discuss this with the Indian board in due course. Indian fans Captains of Indias trade and industry, politicians, film stars, as well as cricket lovers, were all in Lahore on Sunday to watch the Indo-Pak duel. An estimated 7,000 Indians came by buses, trains and planes and filled the stands along with thousands of Pakistanis at the Gaddafi Stadium under a blazing sun in Lahore, which is passing through some unusually high temperatures of late. From the corridors of power came the Indian Prime Ministers principal secretary and the national security advisor, Brajesh Mishra, who has been deeply involved in the much-hyped peace moves between India and Pakistan in recent months. Keeping him company was Indias high commissioner in Islamabad, Shivshankar Menon. The minister for information and broadcasting, Ravi Shankar Prasad, also flew across from Delhi to watch the match. Several other Indian politicians were also present. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Unchanged England 15
London: England named an unchanged 15-man squad on Wednesday for their four-Test tour of the West Indies in March. Pace bowler Richard Johnson, who requires surgery on his damaged right knee, is the only omission from the team which lost the Test series in Sri Lanka. One pacer will be added to the squad, possibly Simon Jones who has not played Test cricket for 14 months. Jones will need to prove his fitness on an English A tour of India in February. THE SQUAD Michael Vaughan (captain), Marcus Trescothick, Mark Butcher, Graham Thorpe, Paul Collingwood, Nasser Hussain, Andrew Flintoff, Rikki Clarke, Chris Read, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Gareth Batty, James Anderson, Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The final words on sledging
Sydney: It was not all camaraderie in the last match of the tri-series with Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly being sledged by Aussie speedster Brad Williams during the tri-series final on Sunday. Williams started abusing Sourav from the moment he came out to bat and the Indian captain had to draw the attention of his counterpart Ricky Ponting before taking guard in the middle. From the time I walked out of the gates till I reached the middle, it kept going. I spoke to Ponting because I didnt want it to start all over again. I didnt want to blow it out of proportion. But it was not as if only India were at the receiving end as young paceman Irfan Pathan was also quite vocal. He was having a go at Matthew Hayden and clapped in the face of Damien Martyn after dismissing him, forcing the batsman to complain to the umpire before he left the ground. I keep telling my boys that every time they get aggressive, my match fees get deducted. I keep telling them to be careful because at this rate I might land up with no money after this tour, he said.

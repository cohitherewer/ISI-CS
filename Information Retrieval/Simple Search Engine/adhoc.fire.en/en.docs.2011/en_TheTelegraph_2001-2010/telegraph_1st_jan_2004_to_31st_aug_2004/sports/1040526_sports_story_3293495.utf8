 4 new faces in India squad
Margao: India coach Stephen Constantine has named four new faces in the squad for the World Cup football qualifying match against Japan to be held on June 9 in Saitama. Defenders Habibur Rahman, Selwyn Fernandes, Debabrata Roy and medio Gourmangi Singh are the new names in the team led by Bhaichung Bhutia, Constantine said on Tuesday. Defender Debjit Ghosh and striker Abhishek Yadav, who are injured, have not been included. Samir Naik, who missed the last match against Oman which India lost 1-5, is back in the side. Ranvir Singh, the US-based non-resident Indian who attended the camp, was not selected. Ranvir was in top shape and showed a lot of promise, but could not find a berth as other players that we have are better than him, Constantine said. Ranvir is willing to stay in India this season and also ready to play for any club. If he shows improvement he may find a place in the team for the two remaining matches, the coach added. The Indian team will play two practice matches against Indonesia on May 30 and June 3 in Indonesia before leaving for Japan. Japan, who are ranked much higher than us, are a strong side but not unbeatable. If we play to our potential we can upset them, Constantine said. THE SQUAD Goalkeepers: Sangram Mukerjee, Prasanta Dora. Defenders: Mahesh Gawli, Habibur Rahman, Selwyn Fernandes, Dipak Mondal, Debabrata Roy, Satish Bharti. Midfielders: Rennedy Singh, Climax Lawrence, Samir Naik, Subhas Chakraborty, Joe Paul Anchery, Jatin Bisht, Gourmangi Singh, S. Venakatesh. Forwards: Bhaichung Bhutia, Ashim Biswas, R.C. Prakash, Bijen Singh.  (PTI)  Copyright

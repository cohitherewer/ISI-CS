 Jeev Milkha takes lead
New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh braved gusty winds to shoot into the midway lead Friday at the $ 1,50,000 Philippine Open golf tournament at the par-71 Riviera Golf and Country Club. Jeev, a four-time winner in Asia, carded an even par 71 for a tournament tally of three-under 139. The Indian is currently placed one stroke ahead of overnight leader Adam Groom of Australia, who shot a 75 Friday, according to information received here. There was more joy for Indian golf lovers as Amandeep Johl, Jeevs fellow Chandigarh pro, sat tied along with Englishman Jonathan Cheetham at the third position at one-under 141. Jyoti Randhawa, the Asian number one in 2002, endured a roller-coaster 73, carding three birdies against five bogeys for the tied 11th place along with Vivek Bhandari and a host of other golfers at 145.

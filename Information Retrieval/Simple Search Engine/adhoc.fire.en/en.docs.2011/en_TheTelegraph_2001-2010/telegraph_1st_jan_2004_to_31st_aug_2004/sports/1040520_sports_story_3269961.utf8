 Lanka PM to seek Indian help
 Murali is a national treasure, says Lanka PM Colombo: Sri Lankas Prime Minister Mahindra Rajapakse on Wednesday sought the support of India and other south Asian countries in his bid to sue the International Cricket Council (ICC) over its decision to outlaw Muttiah Muralidharans doosra delivery. Rajapakse said he will meet Indias ambassador to Sri Lanka, Nirupam Sen, this week as well as other top diplomats from Bangladesh and Pakistan to seek their views on as well as support for Muralidharan. Rajapakse said that he will also consult lawyers on Thursday on action to be initiated against the ICC. What we are doing is not politics, Rajapakse said. It is my duty to protect one of our national treasures. Muralidharan is the pride not only of Sri Lanka, but of the entire region. Rajapakse said he would do everything within his power and that of the government to defend the bowler. He brushed aside ICC chief Ehsan Manis advise to him and his Australian counterpart John Howard to stay out of the Muralidharan controversy and allow the ICC to deal with the situation. It was Howards remarks last week that he believed Muralidharan was a chucker which prompted Test crickets highest wicket-taker to consider boycotting Sri Lankas tour of Australia in July. Atapattus worry Meanwhile, Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu is worried with Muralidharans reluctance to tour Australia. If Murali decides he is not going to Australia, it will be one heck of a challenge for us. It will be a big struggle trying to contain the strong Australian batting line-up without him, Atapattu was quoted as saying by the Daily News on Wednesday. If you take our team as a whole, Murali is the most respected cricketer, performance-wise, in our team. You dont go around saying things about him and trying to undermine his achievements after he has broken the world record by taking more than 520 wickets, Atapattu said. We hate to see somebody saying nasty things about another player who has achieved something. When the world says this is the best bowler in the game today you dont go and say something nasty to him.

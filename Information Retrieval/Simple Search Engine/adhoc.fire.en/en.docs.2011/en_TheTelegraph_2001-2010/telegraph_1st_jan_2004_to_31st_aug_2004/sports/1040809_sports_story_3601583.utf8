The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA secure draw
 - FIRST TEST l Muralidharan fails to make any impression on final day  Graeme Smith hits one during his gritty knock on the final day of the first Test in Galle on Sunday. (Reuters) Galle: Captain and opener Graeme Smith top-scored with 74 to help South Africa secure a draw with Sri Lanka on the fifth and final day of the first Test on Sunday. The tourists, set a challenging victory target of 325 runs on a crumbling pitch, batted out the day to finish on 203 for three, with allrounder Jacques Kallis unbeaten on 52. Smith, restored to the openers berth after his recovery from a virus, defied Sri Lankas five spinners during the first two sessions on his way to a match-saving innings from 209 balls. However, the left-handers unusual dismissal two balls before tea, when he inadvertently kicked an Upul Chandana delivery on to his stumps, raised Sri Lankas hopes of forcing a win. But Kallis, South Africas leading batsman, continued a rearguard effort in the final session of play. He added an unbroken 68 runs for the fourth wicket with first innings centurion Jacques Ruldolph, who finished 27 not out. Dippenaar, standing in for the injured Herschelle Gibbs in the series opener, was caught at silly point off Muttiah Muralidharan in the 16th over of the day. Sri Lankas bowlers were then frustrated after a couple of strong shouts for leg before, against Smith on 20 and Martin van Jaarsveld on nought, were turned down. Smith, on 32, also survived a narrow escape when an appeal for caught and bowled off Chandana was referred to the television umpire shortly before lunch. However, the replays were inconclusive as to whether the ball had touched the ground before ballooning up off his boot. The batsman was adjudged not out. After lunch, Van Jaarsveld on 18, was dropped at first slip by Thilan Samaraweera after edging a Chandana leg-break. The second-wicket pair added 64 runs before Tillekeratne Dilshan trapped Van Jaarsveld leg before with a straighter delivery. Kallis and Smith, however, averted any chance a collapse with a solid stand of 37 in 120 balls. Muralidharan, unable to use his controversial doosra delivery, failed to make much of an impression on the final day, toiling away for 20 overs for figures of one for 37. The second and final Test, being played at the Sinhalese Sports Club, starts on Wednesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

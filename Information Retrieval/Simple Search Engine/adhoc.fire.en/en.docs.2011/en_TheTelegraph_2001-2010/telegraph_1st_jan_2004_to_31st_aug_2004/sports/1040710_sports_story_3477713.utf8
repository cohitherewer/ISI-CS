 Lee wants county stint
 Brett Lee has India tour in sight Cairns: Brett Lee is looking for a short stint with an English county to stay in reckoning for a place in the Australian squad for the tour of India later this year. Lee is recovering from ankle surgery and his place in the team is under threat from Michael Kasprowicz and the return of Glenn McGrath, who had similar injury problems. Lees manager Neil Maxwell said on Friday the 27-year-old fast bowler is regaining full fitness and looking at playing in England to accelerate his return. Hes going to do some work with (former Australian fast bowler) Dennis Lillee in ten days time in Brisbane, hes having a bowl with the Australian team in Cairns and hopefully he will be able to play a few county matches as well, Maxwell said. The focus is India and it will be interesting to see if he can do that because his recovery is going well and hes got a wider range of movement in the ankle than ever. National selector Allan Border said lee might struggle to force his way back into the Australian team. Brett will have to bide his time, Border pointed out this week. Kaspers (Kasprowicz) in the side and he is doing a great job. That makes it difficult to get in. Maxwell said the details of an English county posting were yet to be finalised but it was an option Lee was thinking of. Lees return to the Australian team has been made tougher by the outstanding form of his replacement Michael Kasprowicz, who took seven for 39 against Sri Lanka in Darwin last week.  (AFP)  Copyright

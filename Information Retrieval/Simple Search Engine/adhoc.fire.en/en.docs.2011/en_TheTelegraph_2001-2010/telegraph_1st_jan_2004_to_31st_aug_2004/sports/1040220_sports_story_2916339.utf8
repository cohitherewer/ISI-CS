The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lehmann claims hes No. 1, not Kahn
 Lehmann has gone too far, feels Voeller Berlin: Arsenals Jens Lehmann has stirred controversy by saying he is the best German goalkeeper and should replace Oliver Kahn in the national team. The better player has to play, Germanys reserve keeper told a soccer magazine. My performances are more consistent, added the 34-year-old. Over the past year I have lost two games and made two mistakes. I cant really say that anybody else is better than I am. Germany coach Rudi Voeller criticised Lehmann for making such statements and said he would talk to the player about them. Jens has gone too far, Voeller told newsmen on Thursday. I was planning to go to England in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it. I dont want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international, Voeller, whose team beat Croatia 2-1 in a friendly on Wednesday in Split, said when asked whether there would be any sanctions. Bayern Munichs Kahn, the undisputed number one and Germanys captain, has said he wants to carry on until the 2006 World Cup finals on home soil. Lehmann was on Germanys bench for Wednesdays game, in which Kahn made several fine saves but also a mistake that led to Croatias goal. In the interview, Lehmann made no secret of his difficult relationship with Kahn. I didnt know we were supposed to talk, he said when asked why the two did not speak to each other. I dont have a 24-year-old girlfriend. I have a different life. Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said he felt Lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments. I would not tolerate it at Bayern if the reserve goalkeeper was to speak about Kahn that way, Hitzfeld told a news conference on Thursday. Lehmann said that while the decision on who plays for the national team belongs to Voeller, he was confident his time would come. (Reuters)  Copyright

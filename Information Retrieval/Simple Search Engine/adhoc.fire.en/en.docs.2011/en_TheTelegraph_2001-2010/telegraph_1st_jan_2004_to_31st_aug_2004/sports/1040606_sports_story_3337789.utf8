 Call for better co-ordination 
Islamabad, June 5 (PTI): The Advisory Council of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sought better co-ordination between team management and the selectors  not only to ensure better results but also to do away with the blame-game that usually follows a debacle. The PCB Advisory Council met in Lahore on Friday to look into, among other things, the Indian humiliation in the recent one-day and Test series. The Advisory Council members, after getting a complete briefing from coach Javed Miandad and chief selector Wasim Bari, were not satisfied with the fact that until now no one could be pinned down to take responsibility for the defeat to India, a PCB source said. The consensus was that regardless of a win or a loss, there should be better co-ordination between the team management and selection committee so that strategies can be better formulated and be more fruitful while somebody should be held responsible for the results, a source said. The Advisory Council also agreed that there was need to have a better support staff for the players and the board should waste no time in hiring a qualified physical trainer, physiotherapist and a bowling coach. Meanwhile, according to the PCB sources, Australian great Greg Chappells expertise will not only be utilised for the National Cricket Academy in Lahore but he will also be asked to help out the Pakistan senior and A teams.

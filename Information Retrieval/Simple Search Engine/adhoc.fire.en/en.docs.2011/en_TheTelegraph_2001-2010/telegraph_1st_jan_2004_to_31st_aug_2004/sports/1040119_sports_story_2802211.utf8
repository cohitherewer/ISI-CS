The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venus factor looms large 
 Venus Williams in Melbourne on Sunday Melbourne: The imposing figure of Venus Williams is standing between Justine Henin-Hardenne and a third Grand Slam title as the Australian Open gets underway on Monday. Injuries to former champions have decimated the womens field for the seasons opening major, with last years winner Serena Williams and 2001-2002 queen Jennifer Capriati both missing. So unless fifth-seeded Lindsay Davenport can repeat her Melbourne Park triumph of 2000, a new name will be on the womens trophy this year and Henin-Hardenne is quietly confident it will be hers. The Belgian top seed, who emerged from the shadows of the Williams sisters last year to lift the French and US Opens before finishing the year as world No. 1, has enjoyed a trouble-free start to 2004. She warmed up for Melbourne by dispatching Frances Amelie Mauresmo 6-4, 6-4 in the Sydney International final on Saturday, and is revelling in the unfamiliar status of being tournament favourite. The 23-year-old Venus, who opens against compatriot Ashley Harkleroad, will be playing in her first competitive tournament since losing the Wimbledon final to sister Serena. Williams is seeded to meet Henin-Hardenne in the final, and will go into any match with the Belgian secure in the knowledge that she has won seven of eight meetings. To reach this years final, the two-time US Open and Wimbledon champion must negotiate a half of the draw which includes second seed Kim Clijsters as her principal rival. The Belgian withdrew from last weeks Sydney meet but has declared herself ready for the demands of a possible seven matches in two weeks. If I didnt think I could do it I wouldnt be playing here, said Clijsters. I dont think it would be fair to myself, the crowd or the tournament otherwise.  (AFP)  Copyright

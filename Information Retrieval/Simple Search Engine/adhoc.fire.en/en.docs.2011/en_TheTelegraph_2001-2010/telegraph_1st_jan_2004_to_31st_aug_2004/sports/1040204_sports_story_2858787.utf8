The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Andy Bichel hits out after getting the axe
Melbourne: Australia fast bowler Andy Bichel suggested he was the victim of double standards on Tuesday after being axed for the tri-series finals against India. Bichel, 33, was dropped from a 13-man squad in favour of Michael Kasprowicz. The first game of the best-of-three finals will be in Melbourne on Friday. The hard-working Queenslander, who was also dropped during the Test series against India, felt he was not given as many chances as some of his teammates. Maybe there are double standards and thats the disappointing factor, knowing that I have so many supporters out there who are right behind me, Bichel told newsmen in Brisbane on Tuesday. But thats the way it is and you have to take it on the chin. By double standards, Bichel must have referred to some teammates who have also struggled. Brett Lee, the blond pin-up boy of Australian cricket who endorses a wide range of products, took one for 83 against India in the Brisbane ODI after a dismal Test series, but has since returned to form. Batsman Damien Martyn has been retained in the squad despite making 122 runs at 17.42 in the tri-series. Bichel said being dropped from the Test side had been hard to swallow, adding: I probably dont play the media bandwagon too much, Ive just got on and played my cricket. I think you get that in every sporting team around the world, there are different guys who get the limelight. Bichel was a huge success at last years World Cup, taking 16 wickets at an average of 12.31 while contributing significantly as a lower-order batsman, but has only managed three wickets for 197 runs from six matches in the tri-series against India and Zimbabwe. Chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said in a statement: It is fair to say that Andy Bichel has not been bowling as well as we would like and we feel that a spell at state level might help him recapture his form. The 31-year-old Kasprowicz will win his 19th one-day cap. Australia also retained Simon Katich while Mike Hussey, who made 17 not out on his debut against India in Perth on Sunday, was dropped.

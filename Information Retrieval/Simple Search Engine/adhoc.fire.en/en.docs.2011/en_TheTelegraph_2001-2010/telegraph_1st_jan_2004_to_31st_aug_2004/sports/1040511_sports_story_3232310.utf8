The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Moya shifts focus to French Open
 - Spaniard feels he is hitting form at the right moment  Carlos Moya sprays the bubbly after defeating David Nalbandian to clinch the Italian Open crown on Sunday. (AP) Rome: Carlos Moya believes he can triumph again at the French Open following his impressive straight sets win over David Nalbandian in the final of the Rome Masters. A winner at Roland Garros in 1998, Moya beat the Argentine fifth seed 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 at the Foro Italico on Sunday to become the sixth Spanish player to win the Italian claycourt tournament. Moya, the sixth seed, said his surprisingly easy victory did not make him favourite for the French Open, but put himself among those capable of winning the second Grand Slam of the year, which starts on May 24. At their best Guillermo Coria and Juan Carlos Ferrero are still the biggest favourites, and I would even say that Ferrero at 100 per cent is the best player around on clay, he said. But, you know, they are not at 100 per cent. Both players have suffered from injuries and thats very unlucky during the claycourt season. Now I have to take advantage of that. To highlight his point, Ferrero on Sunday withdrew from the Hamburg Masters, with a wrist injury. Moya, 27, said he was hitting form at just the right time for Roland Garros where he has not gone beyond the quarter finals since lifting the trophy six years ago. Ive played very well here all week, very solid, he said. The only match I had trouble with was against Ivo Karlovic (in the second round) because he has a big serve and doesnt allow you to find a rhythm. I was close to losing that match, but after I won it I realised how well I was playing and my confidence grew. Nalbandian looked a shadow of the player who beat Albert Costa in the semis, but Moya still tipped the 22-year-old as a potential winner in Paris. I think he was a little tired, but he is still a very good player and hes going to be even better in the future, Moya said. Hes certainly one of the contenders for the French Open. (AFP)  Copyright

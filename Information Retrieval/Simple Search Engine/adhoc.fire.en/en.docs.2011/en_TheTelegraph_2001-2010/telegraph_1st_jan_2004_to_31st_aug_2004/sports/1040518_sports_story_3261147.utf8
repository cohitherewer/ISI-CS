The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Eriksson banks on novices to shore up defence
 England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson at a press conference in London on Monday, where he announced his initial squad of 23 for Euro 2004. (AFP) London, May 17 (Agencies): England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson turned to Liverpools Jamie Carragher and Tottenhams Ledley King to shore up his sides defence when he announced his provisional squad for the Euro 2004 finals in Portugal on Monday. Eriksson overlooked the defensive claims of Gareth Southgate even though the experienced Middlesbrough man insisted he could recover from injury in time. Also omitted were Manchester Uniteds Wes Brown and Southgates Middlesbrough teammate Ugo Ehiogu. Southgate had the minor consolation of being placed on standby along with Birminghams Matthew Upson. Four other players have also been left with an outside chance of making it into the final squad, due to be named on June 2, including Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe. Eriksson kept faith in Liverpool striker Emile Heskey who has been far from impressive this season. There were few changes from the 2002 World Cup squad. Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has been replaced by Chelseas John Terry since he started his eight month suspension for missing a drugs test. King and Carragher come in as cover to Terry and Arsenals Sol Campbell. Manchester United brothers Gary and Phil Neville make the squad, as does United teammate Nick Butt whose position was under threat when he dropped out of the Old Trafford first-team in mid-season. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard who missed the 2002 World Cup through injury and Chelseas Frank Lampard, who made his debut after the World Cup, strengthen Englands midfield that will be led by Real Madrids David Beckham. Heskey, soon to join Birmingham, Liverpools Michael Owen and Evertons 18-year-old Wayne Rooney fill the striking positions along with Aston Villas Darius Vassell. I am happy with the overall balance of the squad, Eriksson told a news conference. I hope they all stay fit. If they do we will have a very, very good team. Wayne Rooney is an excellent footballer, Eriksson said. I know he is young but when he is on the pitch he doesnt seem very young. England, who fell at the first hurdle at Euro 2000 but reached the 2002 World Cup quarter finals, open their campaign in Euro 2004 Group B against holders France.THE SQUAD  Goalkeepers  David James (Manchester City), Paul Robinson (Tottenham Hotspur), Ian Walker (Leicester City).

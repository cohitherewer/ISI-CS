- Look to play late while attempting the flick
Cricket Online Ravi ShastriI am a right-arm medium pacer. Though I bowl an off stump line, my deliveries constantly fall short of length despite my best efforts to pitch the ball up. Please help.(Sumantra Banerjee, 17, Calcutta 15)Watch your left shoulder. Its probably falling away a little too early.I am a medium-pacer. How can I increase my pace? Could you suggest some specific exercises?(Soumik Ghosh, 16, Calcutta 40)A proper fitness regime with special emphasis on weight training. I am a medium-pacer. I want to increase my pace but my coach stresses more on accuracy. Please let me know which is more important?(Adhish Kr Sinha, 13, Dhanbad)In trying to bowl fast, you may be bowling all over the place. Hence your coach is asking you to concentrate on accuracy, which is so important. I often hit the ball into the air when trying to drive overpitched deliveries. Please help.(Manish Kumar, 16, Giridih)You are not getting to the pitch of the ball. You may be also lifting your head a little too early.I am a right-handed batsman. I often get bowled or am adjudged leg-before when attempting the flick. Please help.(Aryabrata Das, 13, Balasore)You are obviously playing far too much across the line. Look to play late and allow the ball to come on to the bat. I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to lift the ball, it goes high but never reaches the boundary. Is it due to less bottomhand into the shot?(Piyush Satyarthi, 16, Ranchi-2)Yes, that could be the reason. As a result of which you are losing power and timing. I have a very aggressive approach to my batting. Often I get runs in one-dayers but it does not always work in four-day games. Should I change my approach?(Ravi Patnaik, 19, Cuttack)They are two different forms of the game.You must work on your concentration and discipline in the longer version of the game. I am a left-arm spinner. I often bowl too many wide balls. Repeated attempts to correct the run-up at nets have failed. Please help.(Subir Ganguly, 19, Howrah)More than the run-up, it is your action youve got to watch. I am a middle-order right-handed batsman. Should I take a leg stump or middle stump guard?(Arya Sen, 15, Calcutta-14)It all depends on your footwork and technique. Your coach should be able to advise. Why is the first session in a Test match or a four-day game very crucial for batting?(Gurpreet Singh, 20, Burdwan)Because it is the session that could set up the game for batting or fielding side.

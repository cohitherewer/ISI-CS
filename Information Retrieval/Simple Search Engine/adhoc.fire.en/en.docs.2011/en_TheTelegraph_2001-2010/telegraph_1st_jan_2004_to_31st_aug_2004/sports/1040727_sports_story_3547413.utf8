The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004  Islam gave real fright to Chisty 
 BY STAR RACER Chisty on Sea LegendShanker on Shalom (left) winning the Aladancer Cup from Elusive Romance, Make A Wish and Scent of Victory 				 										Three winners, Shalom , Amonita and Jaannisar went on to win their respective events, last Wednesday, having let down sizeable followings on Day I of the season. The run advantage had done them a world of good thereby justifying the fact that few hard gallops are no substitute for a race run. Vijay Singh who had been dividing his time between the city racing and the upcountry centers trained the first two. Interestingly, all three landed the goods at nourishing odds.				 										Shalom, a 7-2 chance, after Daniel Davids strongly fancied duo of Scent Of Victory and Make A Wish, had to sweat it out before clinching the issue in the 1,400m Aladancer Cup, the opener. Jockey S. Shanker let the Concordial-Queens Lake daughter chase the leader Make A Wish till 250m from home before skating clear of the field. She, however, found the last half-a-furlong of the race a bit taxing thereby allowing the beaten leader and the rest in the field to nearly undo her fine work. The second placed Elusive Romance was bright in his defeat as the Bharath Singh-trainee covered plenty of ground in the final stretch.				 										Amonita, too, had to struggle it amply to account for Sanjeev Charans Frontier Flame who looked a picture during in the paddock parade for the 1,000m Freelancer Handicap. Having shrugged off speedy Castle Moons challenge inside the last furlong Shanker had to fire all cylinders on the Penine Ridge-Acer daughter to retain supremacy for rest of the journey. 				 										A short-head and a head separated the three horses involved in the camera verdict. Splendid Quest, the 5-4 favourite was totally outclassed to occupy the fourth slot. The Errol Bhungard-trainee indeed needed the run and, more importantly, slightly extra ground to do her best.				 										A winner of the Grand Annual Handicap in the winter always gets due attention in the monsoon season. Therefore, all eyes were on Regal Fortune in the 1,400m Woolver Valley Handicap which the Green Forest-Arches Of Gold filly won after she was given some anxious moments by Followme in the last 150m of the race. 				 										Hitting the front, her customary style, the Daniel David-trainee started shifting out of the straight course in the final 250m and thus allowed Bharaths Followme to come abreast of her. However, an alert Imran Chisty put the half-money favourite on an even keen and drove Regal Fortune with hands and heels to effectively counter the Followme-challenge by half-a-length. 				 										Close finishes being the order of the day, Chistys favourite Sea Legend, a Bhungard-trainee in the 1,200m La Gitana Cup, was extended to the fullest by Tasmac, another of Bharaths challenger. It was a race that would linger in the memory for long as the duel between the two began 300m from home. Apprentice Md Islam did find himself at a receiving end in the last stride that brought about the defeat of the topweight, but his riding did win hearts of many for giving a real fright to the seasoned rider.Those who won their respective events untroubled were H. S. Baths Rheinheart and Sanjeev Charans Jaannisar. But Daniels High Chief could have also joined this bracket had jockey Salim Khan not gone all over the course before landing the prize comfortably in the 1,000m Cherry Handicap.

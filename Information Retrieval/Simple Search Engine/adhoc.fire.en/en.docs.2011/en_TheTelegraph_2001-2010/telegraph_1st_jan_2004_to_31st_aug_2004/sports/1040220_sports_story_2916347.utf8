 Klusener, Hayward join Middlesex
 Lance Klusener London: Middlesex have made a double South African swoop to sign fast bowler Nantie Hayward and allrounder Lance Klusener for the 2004 season. The duo has agreed to deals at Lords after the county missed out on initial targets Anil Kumble and Ashley Noffke, the Australian paceman who played seven county championship matches for them last summer. Queenslander Noffke decided prolonged rest was the only cure for a chronic back problem. Hayward, who claimed 67 first-class victims at an average of less than 23 for Worcestershire last summer, was only halfway through his two-year deal at New Road. But the Midlands County mysteriously pursued and signed former player Andy Bichel, leaving Hayward surplus to requirements. Klusener, 32, had a brief stay on the county scene with Nottinghamshire in 2002 and will be available between May and July for Middlesex, with international call-ups dictating whether he stays for the full campaign.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Srinath should come into the picture
	 - BOWLING COACH FOR TOUR OF PAKISTAN  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Calcutta, Feb.14: Jawagal Srinath, who retired  three months ago, should come into the picture in a big  way if the Board decides to appoint a bowling coach for  the forthcoming tour of Pakistan.  In fact, according to a well-placed  source of The Telegraph, the 34-year-old will be  the logical choice given that Bruce Reid (who wore that  hat for much of Team Indias Australia sojourn) is unavailable. In any case, with the trip scheduled to begin in early March, the Board wont have the time to negotiate with somebody from overseas. Moreover, most may not be keen on touring Pakistan. Of course, much is going to depend on Srinaths own availability. Calls to his cell, by the way, went unanswered throughout the evening. The source added: Srinath is liked and respected by the current players and, so, it wont be difficult for him to slip into a role which calls for much interaction with quite a few boys Its not insignificant that Zaheer Khan, for one, has been nursed by Srinath. Obviously, the Irfan Pathans too can gain if he is around.  In a dozen years of international cricket, Srinath  took 236 wickets in 67 Tests and had 315 victims in 229  ODIs.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Strong reply by WI
Kingston: West Indies hit back strongly on day two of the first Test as they removed both England openers cheaply to leave the tourists struggling on 51 for two at lunch, 260 runs behind. Fidel Edwards bowled Marcus Trescothick for seven, before having England captain Michael Vaughan caught by Brian Lara for 15. Mark Butcher, who was dropped at short leg, was four not out at the interval, while Nasser Hussain survived a few scares to be unbeaten on seven. Resuming on 311 for nine, West Indies failed to add to their total as England wrapped up the innings in two overs. (REUTERS)  Copyright

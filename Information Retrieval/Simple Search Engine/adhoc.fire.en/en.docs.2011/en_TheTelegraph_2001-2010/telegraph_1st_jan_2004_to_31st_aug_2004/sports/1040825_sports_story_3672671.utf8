The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
 A Greek judoka, who 17 days ago jumped off a balcony after a row with her boyfriend hours before she was due to go into the Athletes Village for the Athens Games, died in hospital on Tuesday. Eleni Ioannou, 20, jumped after the couple had quarrelled over their relationship. Her boyfriend jumped off the same balcony two days later, blaming himself for her leap.				 																																	Ioannou died from her wounds suffered by the fall, said the Health Ministry in a statement. 				 																																	Ioannous 24-year-old boyfriend Michalis Chrisostomidis, a kickboxer, is still being treated in a different Athens hospital. He is out of intensive care. Greek financial crime watchdogs have raided the work premises of Christos Tzekos, the coach who is at the centre of a doping scandal involving Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou. The raid follows a search by drugs enforcement officials last week that yielded scores of banned nutritional supplements at the premises used by him. Government officials say they have uncovered evidence that Tzekos company sold unlicensed nutritional supplements including those containing the ephedrine stimulant, banned in the US for a suspected link to heart attacks and strokes. Commemorative stamps featuring doped Greek weightlifter Leonidas Sampanis stand to become a collectors item after the Greek posts decision to withdraw the issue because the athlete failed a drugs test. The Greek post office, Elta, issues commemorative stamps of every Greek athlete winning a medal.				 																																	But the Elta on Sunday decided to withdraw from circulation the Sampanis stamp issue after the athlete tested positive for a banned substance and had his medal withdrawn.Chinese has a reputation as one of the worlds hardest languages, but Beijing is hoping a slick new primer will get foreigners ready to at least greet locals with a friendly ni hao! when they come to town for the 2008 Olympics.				 																																	The Chinese phrase for hello is the first lesson in Basic Chinese 100 for Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. That works up to more complex, cheery statements such as, the sports facilities are very good, everything is exceptionally well organised and the service is great. Former rivals Marie-Jose Perec and Cathy Freeman have affirmed their growing friendship after meeting for the first time in four years and since their long anticipated battle for Olympic supremacy did not happen at the Sydney Games.				 																																	Four years on, and on the eve of the womens 400m final, the former track foes met and showed that theirs was never a personal battle.  Martin Marinov is very proud to be canoeing at the Olympics for his adopted country Australia but he still misses the fame and stardom he won in his native land from being Mr Bulgaria 1993. I used to be famous, he said after his race on Tuesday. I used to be the centre of attention. 				 																																	Marinov, an Olympic medallist for Bulgaria in 1988 and 1992, won the Mr Bulgaria contest after being pushed into it by his wife  and he really enjoyed it. It was good fun, he said. Im still very famous in Bulgaria.				 																																	While Marinov, who speaks six languages, is much more anonymous in Australia, he is still happy he made the move.

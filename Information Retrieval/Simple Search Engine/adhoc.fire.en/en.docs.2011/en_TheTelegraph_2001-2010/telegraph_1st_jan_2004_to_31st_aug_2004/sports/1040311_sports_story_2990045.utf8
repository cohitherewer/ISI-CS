The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Guarantee money released 
Auckland: Ratifying the decision it arrived upon at its last meeting on October 30 last year in Barbados, the International Cricket Councils (ICC) governing body Wednesday decided to hand over the guarantee money it had retained from last years World Cup to member boards. The money has so far been withheld pending a claim from its commercial partner in the Cup, Global Cricket Corporation (GCC). ICC chief executive David Speed said some countries had had more money withheld than others. What we have decided is to give back that extra money, so that all countries are now having the same amount of money withheld, Speed said. The reason money is still being withheld is that there is a claim against us and we need to have something in the bank if the claim succeeds. [A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: The decision had been taken at the Barbados meeting, but the ICC decided there that each of the ten full members of the board should furnish an individual indemnity that if GCC succeeds in any of its claims with IDI (the ICCs commercial arm), each full member board would pay one-tenth of the amount of the IDI liability to the GCC. Decision was also taken that if a GCC claim has to be settled a panel of experts would determine the liability of individual boards and the decision of the panel would be final. [The ICC sent in a draft of the Indemnity required. However, the BCCI had reservations on certain clauses in this and hence it was agreed that a final decision on this will be taken in Auckland. [The entire thing took shape because in that Barbados meeting India had proved that most of this $ 50 claim by GCC was fictitious, according to a Board functionary. And subsequently the ICC decided that it would release the guarantee money withheld from all members on the indemnity condition. [The BCCI has had $ 6.5 million withheld.] The amount being kept back was the same for each country and would not be disclosed for commercial reasons. The ICC, meanwhile, has deferred a decision on whether its headquarters should be moved out of the Lords. In another decision alongside, New Zealand, who had refused to play in Kenya on security grounds and had money withheld from it, had this money released as well. (AFP)  Copyright

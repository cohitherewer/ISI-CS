The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lack of evidence may save Eriksson
 BY MIHIR BOSE All three men now in the spotlight in the Svengate affair could well survive Thursdays meeting of the Football Association board, which will be held at 2 pm in a secret location away from Soho Square. The roles of England head coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, chairman Geoff Thompson and executive director David Davies, in the controversy which has already cost Mark Palios his job as chief executive, will be discussed. [According to a Reuters report from London, Eriksson will not attend Thursdays board meeting. Those employees involved in this matter... will not be attending the board meeting, the FA said on its website.] Eriksson secretly gave evidence on Tuesday to the two-man legal team, which is investigating the affair. He then returned to his home. A source who saw him as he left the lawyers office said: He looked very far from a broken man. Eriksson was questioned about what he said to Davies on July 19 when asked about the affair with Davies secretary, Faria Alam. Davies is believed to have already told the lawyers that he asked Eriksson an unambiguous question about the relationship. Eriksson is believed to have repeated to the lawyers what he has already implied in his public statement, that he neither confirmed nor denied the affair as part of his policy of never commenting on his personal relationships and also that he was not aware the FA was issuing a statement to the public denying the affair. Indeed that evening around 6 oclock, after this now fateful conversation between Davies and Eriksson, the two of them, along with Palios and Sir Trevor Brooking, the FAs development director, drove together to 10 Downing Street for the summer reception hosted by Prime Minister Tony Blair. This must have been a remarkable journey given that Palios had also had an affair with Alam and the FA had just issued a statement denying her affair with Eriksson. One board member said: It seems the whole thing is now much more ambiguous. It is not exactly clear who said what to whom. Unless we have clear evidence that Eriksson deliberately set out to lie to the FA it would be very difficult to sack him. Legal experts specialising in employment law are convinced Eriksson is on strong ground and could claim that the FAs handling of this whole affair constitutes constructive dismissal, allowing him to walk away and still claim millions in damages. One board member told me: Davies had no business making those statements. It was taken as a vote of confidence in Eriksson when Davies is in no position to do so. It is for the board to decide whether Eriksson goes or not. Davies should have been told to keep his mouth shut. Davies may well be reprimanded but is unlikely to be sacked. The fact that he was in a position to make those comments has increased the pressure on Thompson although I understand that there are no moves to have a vote of no-confidence in him.

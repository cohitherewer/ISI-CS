 Moya survives scare
 - ATP Chennai meet - Prakash throws away first set advantage  Carlos Moya in action against Paul Goldstein in Chennai on Thursay. (AFP) Chennai: Top seed Carlos Moya of Spain survived a huge scare from unseeded Paul Goldstein of the US before scampering into the quarter finals with a hard-fought 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 win in his second round match of the Tata Open ATP championship on Thursday. Down a set and into the tie-break in the second set, an off-colour Moya was on the brink of a shocking defeat as he conceded a match point to the American, but just managed to win the set by a whisker and then the match with a crucial break in the seventh game of the intensely fought decider. The 27-year old Goldstein, ranked 169 on the ATP list, gave the former world No. 1 a real run for his money as he dominated most part of the match, but the latter won a couple of big points, including a lucky net chord, to emerge unscathed in the centre court match which lasted nearly two-and-half hours. Earlier, Prakash Amritraj failed to capitalise on a first set lead to crash out 6-3, 1-6, 2-6 against the higher-ranked Thierry Ascione of France in a second round match, bringing the curtains down on the Indian challenge in singles. The 20-year-old Prakash, the last of the three Indian wild card entrants to survive, clinched the first set with superb allround show, but committed errors in the subsequent sets confronted with the power game of his rival to surrender meekly. Prakash raised hopes of becoming only the second Indian to enter the quarter finals of the premier tournament in the country after Leander Paes, as he broke the tentative Ascione in the eighth game to take the first set. But Ascione, who had upset sixth seeded Rafael Nadal in the first round, had different ideas and bounced back into the match lifting his game several notches in the second set. With breaks in the fourth and sixth games, the 149-ranked French took the set in no time even as the Indian made a series of unforced errors.  (PTI)  Copyright

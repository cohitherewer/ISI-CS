The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday show big plus: Sourav
 - Series Decider mran gives psychological advantage to India  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Inzamam feels his team will have to tackle the pressures of playing a final at home Lahore:The common feeling here is that Pakistan will find it tough to clinch the one-day series after Indias superb display on Sunday. The confidence the Indian batting has gained from the fourth match will be hard to contain. Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly agrees. Its true that our confidence has reached a high pitch after levelling the series 2-2. This will be a big plus for the final (match), Sourav told The Telegraph on Monday morning. Like every other Indian he too was in doubt when India were reduced to 94 for four. It definitely makes you concerned. But we took heart from the fact that the likes of Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif had pulled out matches from such circumstances before. Ultimately that was what happened, Sourav explained. He felt maintaining a good run rate came in very handy. Though we lost wickets the steady flow of runs kept the average within limits. As a result the asking rate never went beyond us and it helped, Sourav said. Sourav did not agree Shoaib Akhtar had been able to make a psychological impact on the Indian batsmen. Hes been giving away almost 70 runs in his ten overs. So what impact are you talking about, he retorted. As of now, India will field the same XI on Wednesday. Incidentally, an injured Ashish Nehra left for home Monday. Imran Khan, too, admitted that India had wrested the psychological advantage. By winning Sundays match from nowhere India have gained a psychological advantage and come Wednesday, Pakistan will be under more pressure, he warned. Echoing the same feeling, Inzamam-ul Haq feels the confidence factor will favour India. It will make them feel that any total is gettable. The youngsters will also have to tackle the pressures of playing a final at home, Inzamam pointed out on Monday. A fact acknowledged by Javed Miandad as well. The coach warned his team of gearing up to battle against a different Indian side on Wednesday. There is more pressure on us as we are playing at home. Its a 50-50 situation. But if we can stop gifting runs through extras we have a chance to beat India despite their strong batting, Miandad said. I had wished to wrap up the series on Sunday but the bowlers let us down, he said. Our batting has done more than we expected but the bowling let India make 349 in the first match, almost gave them 330 in the second and on Sunday failed to defend 294 it is disappointing, he said. This tendency of gifting runs through extras is letting us down badly, he said. Its time the bowlers stand up and take responsibility. Pakistan conceded 98 runs in wides and no-balls in the series with Shoaib sending down 14 wides on Sunday. We might have to think about seeking specialist help if this is not solved, Miandad said. But they are professionals and its time the bowlers themselves worked on it. He said Imran and Wasim Akram had, on their visits to the training camp before the series, emphasised on how vital it was to contain extras. Imran has also vouched for Aaqib Javed as bowling coach if Akram or Waqar Younis was unable. Daryl Foster was Pakistans bowling coach for their tour of England in 2001 and then for last years World Cup. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said there was no need to panic and if needed a bowling coach will be appointed but not in the middle of a series.  Copyright

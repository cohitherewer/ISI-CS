The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Waqar, Saqlain may be recalled
 Latif is also in contention Islamabad, Jan. 24 (PTI): Pakistans new selection committee may recall experienced stars Waqar Younis, Shahid Afridi and Saqlain Mushtaq for the upcoming series against India in March. Also in contention is Rashid Latif as the selectors headed by former Test captain Wasim Bari sit down to finalise a pool of 40 players in the first phase of the selection process. I can say for sure, at this stage, that we will be having the preliminary selection process with an open mind and seniors like Waqar Younis, Rashid Latif, Saqlain Mushtaq and Shahid Afridi are definitely under consideration for the India series, Bari was quoted as saying in The News. Bari said he wanted to basically adopt a horses for courses policy for the Indian series. We will pick the best possible combination and everyone will be considered who makes it to the pool of 40. The seniors should not worry that they will not get a fair chance. Our job is to select the best possible combination, he said. Bari said Pakistan needed to scout out batsmen who could also bowl in the one-dayers. According to him playing with just five bowlers is not good enough. We also need to strengthen our bowling attack for the India series to counter their strong batting line-up.  Copyright

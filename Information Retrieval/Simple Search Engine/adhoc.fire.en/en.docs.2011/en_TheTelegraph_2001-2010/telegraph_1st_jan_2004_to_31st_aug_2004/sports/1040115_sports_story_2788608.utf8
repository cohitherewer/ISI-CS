The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CA no to Sharjah tournament
Melbourne: Cricket Australia said on Wednesday it has declined an invitation to play in Sharjah in March. The three-week tournament, which starts in late-March, follows Australias Test and ODI tour of Sri Lanka. CA chief executive James Sutherland said the Australian team will instead concentrate on Septembers ICC Champions Trophy in England. Our international playing plans for 2004 are better suited to planning a warm-up series after the players leave period in July-August to fine-tune our form and fitness before Septembers Champions Trophy. Sutherland said in a statement. The Champions Trophy has become a prestigious and permanent part of international cricket and we are keen to improve on our previous performances in this event. We have never won the championship and it and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy are two of the few global trophies we dont have in our trophy cabinet.  (AFP)  Copyright

				 																																	New Delhi: WGM Aarthie Ramaswamy earned her first IM norm, while national champion Surya Shekhar Ganguly and GM Koneru Humpy advanced to joint second in the ninth round of the second Parsvanath International chess championship on Tuesday.				 																																	Aarthie achieved her first IM norm after she split points with Dinesh Kumar Sharma and the two were at six points in joint fourth.				 																																	With just two rounds to go, seven Indians, including defending champion R.B. Ramesh, GM Dibyendu Barua, IM C.S. Gokhale, IM Sriram Jha and R. Balasubramanium, were in second place with seven points.				 																																	Overnight leaders Pavel Kotsur of Kazakhstan and Saidali Iuldachev of Uzbekistan have been joined at the top by GM Serik Temirbaev of Kazakhstan with 7.5 points each.				 																																	Manthan Chokshy, C. Praveen Kumar and Mohammed Javed of Bangladesh also earned their first IM norms.				 																																	Brits (South Africa): South Africas Corrie Sanders will quit the ring for good if he fails to beat Vitali Klitschko for the WBC heavyweight title next month, but will fight the Ukrainians younger brother as a swansong if he wins.				 																																	For sure, the big left-hander said when asked if he would win the April 24 bout against Vitali in Los Angeles. Nobody gave me a chance against Vladimir.				 																																	Sanders knocked the younger Klitschko brother out with a second-round punch last March to win the WBO heavyweight crown. The 38-year-old gave up his WBO belt in October. The WBC crown was left vacant by Briton Lennox Lewis, who announced his retirement last month.				 																																	If I lose (to Vitali), Im retiring... if I win Ill have one more fight, he said. Id love to beat Vitali and then beat his brother again in a rematch.				 																																	Paris: Nicolas Anelka has issued a public apology to France coach Jacques Santini three months before the start of the Euro 2004 finals in Portugal.				 																																	Anelka, who won the last of his 28 caps against Russia in April 2002, has now said he is sorry for his behaviour. Those who know me, know that despite our differences I have always had the greatest respect for the French team, the 24-year-old said on his personal website on Monday. This is why I feel it is necessary to make a public apology to Mr Jacque Santini and to the French team. 				 																																	Bangkok: Billionaire Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is expected to clinch a deal soon for a 25 per cent stake in Premier League club Liverpool, his adviser said on Tuesday.				 																																	The prospect looks quite good because we do not seek a controlling interest and we do not seek to take over the club, said Thawatchai Satchakul, who advised Thaksin in his failed pursuit of Fulham last year. All we want is to use it as a springboard for talented Thai and Asian soccer players to go international.Sport on ScreenCricket, Australia in Sri Lanka: Second Test Day II, live from 9.30 am on TEN Sports

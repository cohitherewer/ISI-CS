 Nedved wants to set pace
Porto, June 26 (Agencies): The Czech Republic have demonstrated their powers of recovery at Euro 2004, but Pavel Nedved would like to see the comeback kings make Denmark play catch-up when the teams meet here in Sundays quarter final. Beaten finalists at Euro 1996 in England, the Czechs had to come from behind to win all three of their group D matches against Latvia, The Netherlands and Germany. Weve always had to fight back, but now I hope we will be able to lead from the front, said Nedved. Two goals in the last 17 minutes saw the Czechs edge Latvia 2-1 in their opening game before they stormed back from 0-2 down to snatch a five-goal thriller against the Dutch. Nedved, a member of the team which lost to Germany at Wembley eight years ago, rejects suggestions that the Czechs should be seen as favourites They like to attack like we do and will be a tough nut to crack, added the Czech captain. PROBABLE TEAMS Czech Republic: 1-Petr Cech; 2-Zdenek Grygera, 21-Tomas Ujfalusi, 5-Rene Bolf, 6-Marek Jankulovski; 8-Karel Poborsky, 4-Tomas Galasek, 10-Tomas Rosicky, 11-Pavel Nedved; 15-Milan Baros; 9-Jan Koller. Denmark: 1-Thomas Sorensen; 6-Thomas Helveg, 4-Martin Laursen, 3-Rene Henriksen, 2-Kasper Bogelund; Jesper Gronkjaer, 7-Thomas Gravesen, 15-Daniel Jensen, 10-Martin Joergensen; 11-Ebbe Sand/14-Claus Jensen, 9-Jon Dahl Tomasson.

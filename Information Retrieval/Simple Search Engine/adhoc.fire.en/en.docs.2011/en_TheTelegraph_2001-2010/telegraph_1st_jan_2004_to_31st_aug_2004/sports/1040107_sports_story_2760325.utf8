The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Blake takes the US past Czechs
 - HOPMAN CUP - Slovakia tame Hungary despite Hantuchova loss  Lindsay Davenport in Perth on Tuesday Perth: Shorn of his trademark dreadlocks and playing in borrowed clothes, James Blake battled past Jiri Novak 4-6, 6-1, 7-5 on Tuesday to hand the US victory over the Czech Republic in the Hopman Cup. Dressed in spanking new kit and wearing brand new shoes  his luggage is somewhere between Los Angeles and Australia  the shaven-headed heartthrob had a few sticky moments at the Burswood Dome before dispatching the world number 13. Hes a top player and has had my number in the past... thats why Im so pleased to get the win, said the smiling 37th-ranked Blake. Earlier, Lindsay Davenport  a late replacement for Serena Williams who partnered Blake to the title here last year  put the Americans ahead with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Barbara Strycova. The Americans also teamed up to win the mixed doubles 6-3, 6-2. In the first match of the night session, Daniela Hantuchovas poor early-season form dipped further as she lost 0-6, 6-7 to unheralded Hungarian Petra Mandula. Karol Kucera beat Attila Savolt 6-3, 7-5 to tie scores. The Slovaks then won the decisive mixed doubles 6-3, 6-1. Former world No. 1 Davenport made a tentative return to action after foot surgery last year. I am not prepared as well as I would like, she said. I had surgery in mid-October and started hitting in December, so I am still a few weeks away from being where I want to be. Blakes new look is partly down to charity  his locks will be auctioned at the Australian Open later this month to raise money for a friend in the US who runs an inner city basketball team  but he showed little goodwill to Novak despite looking rusty. His vast arsenal of shots and maverick style came to his rescue, a flurry of winners flying from his racket at key moments. Solid as Novak is, he was unable to grind out a victory against a player who was at times inspired. He played great and I got a little lucky, came out with some great shots I guess, Blake said. I had a great time.  For two months you get used to staying at home but then you get itchy and want to get back on court. I am so lucky to be doing this for a career. Blake thanked his sponsors Australian arm for coming up with some clothes and shoes at the 11th hour to allow him to compete. Yeah, that was great, he smiled. I dont know where my luggage is right now.   Im okay for a couple of days but hopefully my stuff  is on its way. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Zimbabwe clinch series
Harare: Heath Streak played a captains knock and led Zimbabwe to a laboured 2-1 series victory over Bangladesh in the fifth and final ODI on Sunday. Zimbabwe won the series decider by three wickets, with Streak scoring an unbeaten 31 off 54 balls after his team had slumped from 112 without loss to 120 for five. After dismissing Bangladesh for a mediocre 183, Zimbabwe made 185 for seven in 42.3 overs. Earlier, Khaled Mahmud kept Bangladesh in the hunt for a first series triumph in their 18-year history as an international team, taking four for 19 in 10 overs of accurate medium pace. Grant Flower top-scored for Zimbabwe with 59, while Manjural Islam Ranas 63 led Bangladeshs batting effort. Bangladeshs Mohammed Rafique has been sent home from Zimbabwe as a disciplinary measure. He reportedly became involved in a row with Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar on Saturday. Bangladesh manager A.M. Latif Khan refused to discuss the issue but a senior member of the ZCU confirmed the incident. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

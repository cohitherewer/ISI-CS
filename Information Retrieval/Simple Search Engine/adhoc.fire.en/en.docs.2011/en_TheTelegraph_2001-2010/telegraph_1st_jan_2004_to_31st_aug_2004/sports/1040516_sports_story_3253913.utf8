 SA gets 2010 World Cup
 - Morocco blames Blatter after losing by 10 votes to 14  Fifa president Sepp Blatter announces South Africas victory in the 2010 World Cup finals bid, in Zurich on Saturday. (AFP) Zurich, May 15 (AFP): South Africa on Saturday won the right to host the 2010 World Cup finals, the first to be held on African soil. The 2010 World Cup will be organised by South Africa, Fifa president Sepp Blatter announced after a single-round of voting of the world football governing bodys 24-member executive committee. Blatter said South Africa gained 14 votes to 10 for Morocco and none for Egypt. The South African delegation, including former president Nelson Mandela, erupted in noisy celebrations after finally overcoming the disappointment of losing to Germany by a single vote in the race to host the 2006 World Cup. Morocco failed in its fourth bid, dashing hopes of becoming both the first African nation and first Arab country to host footballs showpiece. Mandela climbed stiffly on to the stage and lifted aloft the golden World Cup trophy in joy after the announcement. I feel like a young man of 15, said Mandela. And the beauty of this victory is that we were dealing with highly capable competitors which made it difficult for us to forecast what the result was going to be. I thank everyone who has supported us and I would like to say to those who were not as lucky that they must not be disillusioned. My message is that South Africa should accept the result of this vote with humility because we are all equal, he added. Irvin Khoza, the South Africa bid chairman, also extended a hand of friendship to the other African bidders. This is for Africa. This is for African renewal, Khoza said. Of the five original candidates, only South Africa, Morocco and Egypt entered the voting on Saturday. Libya was asked to withdraw because not all the relevant conditions had been fulfilled and because Fifa inspectors had concluded that South Africa, Morocco and Egypt were capable of hosting the event on their own. Tunisia pulled out of the race on Friday after accepting that Fifa had rejected its bid to co-host the finals with Libya. South Africa were favourites to get the 2006 World Cup before Germany won after the Oceania representative, Charles Dempsey, abstained in the last round in the knowledge that Germany were leading 12-11 and that the casting vote (in the event of a tie) would go to the Fifa president, who was likely to have chosen South Africa. In Pretoria, South Africa President Thabo Mbeki pledged to make the 2010 World Cup an African Cup. Deciding factor In Rabat, Moroccan officials expressed their disappointment after losing out to South Africa, saying that Blatter had been the deciding factor. Morocco were seen as the main threat to South Africa. Today Blatter used all his weight to influence the outcome of the vote, Said Nejjar, a member of the Morocco organising committee said. He is the master of Fifa and decides everything.  Copyright

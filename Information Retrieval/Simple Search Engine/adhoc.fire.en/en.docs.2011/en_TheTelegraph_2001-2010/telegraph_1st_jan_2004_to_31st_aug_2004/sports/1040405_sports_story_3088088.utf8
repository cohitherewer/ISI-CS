				 																																	London: David Beckham rebutted Sunday a British tabloid newspaper report that he had an affair with his personal assistant in Madrid.				 																																	The News of the World alleged Beckham had an affair with 26-year-old Rebecca Loos, the daughter of a Dutch diplomat, because his wife Victoria Adams had refused to move permanently to the Spanish capital where he plays for Real Madrid.				 																																	In a statement issued via his agent, the England football captain said the allegations were ludicrous and added he had a wonderful wife and two very special kids. The statement said: During the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life. What appeared this morning is just one further example. Beckham could yet take legal action against the News of the World.				 																																	London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has rubbed salt into Arsenals wounds by suggesting the Londoners may struggle in their Champions League quarter final return against Chelsea Tuesday. United ended Arsenals hopes of a treble Saturday when Paul Scholes first-half goal gave them a 1-0 victory over the holders in a tense FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park.				 																																	I think (Chelsea head coach Claudio) Ranieri is due luck, (after) the season hes had, the pressure hes been under. I think its a difficult game for them (Arsenal), said Ferguson.				 																																	Port-of-Spain: University of West Indies  Guardian Life will be honouring Sonny Ramadhin, the Indo-Trinidadian player who represented West Indies in Test cricket in the 1950s, by naming a series of lectures on cricket after him.				 																																	The Sonny Ramadhin Annual Cricket Lecture will be launched on April 23 as a recognition of the players contribution to cricket in the West Indies.				 																																	The lecture will be delivered by veteran West Indian cricket journalist and commentator, Tony Cozier. The series will be co-ordinated by the faculty of social sciences and held in Trinidad and Tobago. Laurels and recognition have come easily to Ramadhin, who grew from playing with coconut bats in central Trinidad, to being a Test cricket genius. 				 																																	San Francisco: Urine samples taken from baseball star Barry Bonds and other players during the 2003 season still exist and are being sought by a grand jury investigating possible steroid distribution by a northern California laboratory, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday.				 																																	It had been believed that only the results of the tests were available but four sources have told the Chronicle that, in fact, the actual urine samples remained and could be used to test for THG, a designer steroid that has been banned by baseball.				 																																	Attorneys for Bonds, who plays for the San Francisco Giants, and for Major League Baseball were not available forcomment. 				 																																	Bonds and several other professional and Olympic athletes have already testified before the grand jury in a months-long probe of Balco.				 																																	New Delhi: The foursome of Czech ambassador Jaromir Novotny, Monica Tandon, Atul Malhotra and Vinod Dhall have secured the top honours in the FICCI invitational golf tournament held at the DLF Golf and Country Club. The winning team posted a total of 118 stableford points Saturday, pipping Amit Luthra, Rajiv Bal, Ashok Jaipuria and Harinder Bansi, who tallied 111 points forthe runners-up spot.Sport on Screen Cricket, India vs Pakistan, 2nd Test, Day I, live from 10.30 on TEN Sports

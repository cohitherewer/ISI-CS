The Telegraph - Calcutta
 At last, a final Djorkaeff can enjoy
 Djorkaeff feels there will be much less pressure in his latest final Manchester: Youri Djorkaeff will finally be able to enjoy a final when Bolton Wanderers play Middlesbrough in their League Cup showpiece on Sunday because he will not be under intense pressure to win. The forward has a successful record in major finals having won both the World Cup and the European Championship with France as well as the European Cup Winners Cup and Uefa Cup with Paris St Germain and Inter Milan, respectively. Playing in a final for a player is the most beautiful thing in his life. Im very proud to be playing on Sunday, he said. I have played in many finals in my life and I will prepare for this one just like I did for the World Cup final with France or the European Championship. There is a difference though. There is less pressure. When I played in the World Cup final in France, there was a lot of pressure. The team had to win. Here people think Middlesbrough will win and we are just the underdogs. Djorkaeff was surprisingly persuaded to sign for Bolton by manager Sam Allardyce in February 2002. He initially joined on a three-month contract before agreeing on a two-year deal. To me it isnt a surprise how Bolton have done, he said. When I came here people were saying you are crazy to sign for Bolton. They said it is a premier division team but not really a Premier League team. I told them people here want to improve. They want to get to another level. It was a challenge for me to come here and help this club do better. I had other challenges in the past and now I wanted to try this one. Djorkaeff, like teammate Jay Jay Okocha, has yet to sign a new contract for next season with the Frenchman considering retirement at the end of the campaign. He could be persuaded to carry on for a further year if Bolton gain a UEFA Cup place by beating Middlesbrough though. A place in the Uefa Cup will be fantastic for Bolton. Thats why its good we are playing Middlesbrough rather than Arsenal in the final, he added. We have to beat Middlesbrough to play in the Uefa Cup next season. If it was Arsenal, they would be in the Champions League and we would already have a place without having to win.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

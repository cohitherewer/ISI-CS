The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3 rookies in India hockey squad
New Delhi: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) on Friday sprang a surprise by naming a few unheralded players for the twin tournaments in Australia this month in the lead-up to the Athens Olympics. Uncapped players Raju, Jatinder Pal Singh and Sunil Yadav were named in the squad. Several senior players were not included in the 18-member squad which will play two tournaments in Canberra and Sydney from April 14 to 18 and April 21 to 25, respectively. Players like Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon are vastly experienced and so they can join the team at any moment. The move to give the youngsters a chance in Australia is aimed at giving them exposure before the Olympics, chief coach Rajinder Singh said. Rajinder said players like Harpal Singh and Ajit Pal Singh would be tested during the meets. THE SQUAD Goalkeepers: Devesh Chauhan, Bharat Kumar Chhetri. Full backs: Dilip Tirkey, Kanwalpreet Singh, Jatinder Pal Singh. Half backs: Ignace Tirkey, Bimal Lakra, Harpal Singh, Viren Rasquinha, Len Aiyappa. Forwards: Gagan Ajit Singh, Prabhjot Singh, Arjun Halappa, Inderjeet Kumar, Deepak Thakur, Raju, Ajit Pal Singh, Sunil Yadav. (PTI)  Copyright

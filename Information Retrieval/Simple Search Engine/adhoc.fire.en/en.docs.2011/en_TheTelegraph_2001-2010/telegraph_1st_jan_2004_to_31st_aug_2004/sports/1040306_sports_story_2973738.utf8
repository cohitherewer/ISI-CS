The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Series win by Indians
New Delhi: Sandeep Singh scored a brace from drag-flicks as India handed Malaysia a 5-0 drubbing in the third Test to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the four-match junior hockey series on Friday. Sandeep Singh scored in the fourth and 26th minutes from two penalty corners and those were followed by three more from Vivek Gupta (29th), Suresh (50th) and Bikas Toppo (63rd). The final match is in Chandigarh on Sunday. The boys played well although the midfielders were most impressive. They hardly gave any space in the middle and their game was intact, coach Harendra Singh told reporters after the match. The series, Harendra said, provided a good exposure to the team ahead of the next months junior Asia Cup in Karachi. We made use of all the resources that we had at our disposal. So all the players were given a feel of the turf during the series, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

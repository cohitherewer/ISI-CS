The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Douglas sets fortnight target

 - Physio Robson joins Vasco 

 - Bagan to seek foreigner as replacement for Barreto 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 
 Robson left for Goa on Friday 
Calcutta: Its been a tough couple of months for Douglas da Silva. His team East Bengal have gone from strength to strength reaching the second spot of the National Football League, but he had to sit out all the while with a stress fracture in his right leg. 
Though Douglas is desperate to take the field within a couple of weeks and play East Bengals first game in the AFC Champions League on February 10, doctors treating him feel it may take some more time before he is back in the field. 
Im trying my best to be back on field by February 6, Da Silva told The Telegraph on Friday. 
That gives him an outside chance to take part in the Champions League game against Geyland United four days later. 
But East Bengal doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta believes itll be a little tough for the Brazilian to play on February 10. 
An X-ray will be done in about 10 days. Even if his injury heals by then, I dont think the Brazilian will be available against the Singapore team. 
If things dont get too bad, I believe he can play against Geyland at home on February 25, Dr Dasgupta said. 
Da Silva said he is regularly working out at the gymnasium to keep his cardio-vascular system in proper shape. 
He made it clear that the injury sustained during East Bengals match against Salgaocar in Goa in December wasnt due to a hasty return from an earlier injury. 
See, I was hit in the same place I sustained the injury earlier its sheer bad luck. But still, I dont want to rush and come back before being fully fit. 
He, however, sounded quite satisfied with the way East Bengal have been performing without him. 
The boys know their job and are trying their best to fill up my and Suley Musahs absence The way they played against Mohun Bagan was quite commendable. 
Also the Junior factor is making the difference he has really played a stellar role. 
Da Silva suggested Cristiano Juniors name to the club authorities and the striker hasnt disappointed, scoring seven goals in eight matches. 
Junior, however, has sustained a bit of an injury in his right leg, but East Bengal authorities believe its not serious. 
On Thursdays derby, Da Silva praised his compatriot Leonardo of Mohun Bagan. I think it was because of him that Mohun Bagan ran us so close Leo was just outstanding in defence, he said. 
Mohun Bagan physio Robson Mattos de Oliviera has joined Vasco Sports Club, Goa, for the second phase of the NFL. His visa was to expire on Saturday and Mohun Bagan authorities were not keen to retain him. It was learnt that the Vasco authorities contacted him on Thursday night and he left for Goa on Friday. 
Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, are looking for a foreign forward in place of Jose Ramirez Barreto. Club assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury said AIFF has the provision of registering an extra foreigner if someone leaves midway in the NFL. 
Meanwhile, Eduardo, who had a reasonable game against East Bengal on Thursday, has sustained a muscle injury and he will be out of practice for at least three weeks.

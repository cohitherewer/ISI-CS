 Benfica chief may quit
Lisbon: Luis Filipe Vieira has hinted he might quit as Benfica chairman following the on-pitch death of the clubs player Miklos Feher, private TSF radio reported on Wednesday. Vieira said the death of the 24-year-old Hungarian international during a match on Sunday had forced him to reconsider his future with the Lisbon club, one of Portugals traditional powers. Unfortunately, in soccer its only when things like this take place that people unite and people try to bring out their best, the 54-year-old Vieira said late on Tuesday at the end of a mourning period at the clubs Stadium of Light, where Fehers coffin was put on display. Meanwhile, Hungarys new coach Lothar Matthaeus expressed his sadness at the sudden death of Feher saying the soccer world was stunned by what had happened.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

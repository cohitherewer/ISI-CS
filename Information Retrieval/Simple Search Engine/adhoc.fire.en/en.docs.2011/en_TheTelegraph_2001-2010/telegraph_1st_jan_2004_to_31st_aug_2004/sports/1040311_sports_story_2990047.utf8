The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara warns England
Kingston: For several reasons, there is a buzz in the Caribbean ahead of the opening Test of four between the West Indies and England, starting at Sabina Park on Thursday. Its not hard to comprehend why. It was the English settlers of the day that brought the gentlemans game to the region a few centuries ago and victory over them will be a clear indication of how well the student has learnt from the teacher. That should be uppermost in the mind of West Indies captain Brian Lara and his team, when they consider that the visitors are looking to become the first English team to win a Test series in the Caribbean in 36 years. Although England ended their sequence of home series losses to the West Indies during a five-Test rubber between the two sides four years ago to wrest the Wisden Trophy, they have not won on Caribbean soil since Colin Cowdreys side eked out a 1-0 victory in a five-Test series. Losing to England was a bitter moment for us, Lara said on Monday. The Wisden Trophy is in Englands hands and we would like to get it back. This is a chilling warning for England who came with similar beliefs on their last tour six years ago, but were convincingly beaten 1-3 in a six-Test series following some spectacular batting from Lara, supported with skilful bowling by Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose.

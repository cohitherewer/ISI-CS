The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dalmiya may have special status
 - Proposal expected to be placed at SGM  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Jagmohan Dalmiya Calcutta: September will see the end of Jagmohan Dalmiyas three-year term as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, but he is likely to wear a new hat immediately thereafter. According to The Telegraphs sources, its almost certain that a Special General Meeting (ahead of the AGM) is going to create a post  possibly permanent representative at the International Cricket Council (ICC) or adviser on international relations  which will become functional when Dalmiya leaves the presidency. As of now, he is going to be succeeded either by savvy BJP leader Arun Jaitley or former BCCI secretary Ranbir Singh Mahendra. Zone-wise, its Norths turn, with both eligible. Significantly, neither Jaitley nor Singh should have reservations over Dalmiya, as he will be taking care of a critical area. As the post is unlikely to be permanent, the BCCIs constitution wont have to be amended. Instead, a simple majority is going to suffice. For an amendment, two-thirds support at the Special General Meeting will be mandatory. Dalmiya is a former ICC chief and remains the sub-continents most powerful sports administrator. In fact, the influence he still wields within the ICC is extraordinary. Its no secret that Dalmiya has the best contacts Moreover, given that complex situations keep cropping up, his expertise is going to be needed to ensure that the BCCI is properly heard. In the present times, he is indispensable, one of the sources pointed out. Dalmiya, who is in Mumbai, couldnt be contacted for a comment, but he is understood to have told confidants he wont step back if the institution itself felt his services were to be needed (in a formal capacity) after September. Privately, Dalmiyas detractors  who have dwindled in number  too will admit his experience is going to be required. The Special General Meeting, its learnt, wont only have a post-for-Dalmiya on the agenda. Apparently, the affiliation of Jharkhand, Uttaranchal and Chattisgarh will also be listed. The meetings date is going to be decided at the next working committee sitting.  Copyright

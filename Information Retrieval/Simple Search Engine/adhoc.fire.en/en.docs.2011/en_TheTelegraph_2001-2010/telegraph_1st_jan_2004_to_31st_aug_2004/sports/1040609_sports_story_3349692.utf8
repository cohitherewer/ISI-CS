 Ranieri returns to Valencia
Madrid: Former Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri began his second spell in charge of Valencia on Tuesday when he returned to ink a two-year deal with the Spanish champions. Im delighted to be back home, the 52-year-old Italian said at the clubs Mestalla stadium. I promised I would return and here I am. When the club asked me if I wanted to return I jumped at the chance. The club said that Ranieri, who coached Valencia between 1997 and 1999, had signed for two seasons with an option to extend the deal for another year. Ranieri, who still had three years left on his contract with Chelsea, was sacked last week despite steering them to the semi-finals of the Champions League and second place in the Premier League. He reached a financial agreement with Chelsea on Monday, hours before flying out to Spain to put the finishing touches to his new contract with Valencia. Ranieri succeeds Rafa Benitez, who quit last week after leading the side to victory in both the Spanish title race and the Uefa Cup. (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali may opt out of tour Down Under
 - The crowd is the main problem, not officials or players  Murali is looking forward to the challenge of bowling against the world champions at home Colombo: Spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan Tuesday reiterated again that he could opt out of Sri Lankas upcoming Test tour of Australia following his nightmarish experience with cricket fans in that country. The 31-year-old, called for chucking by three Australian umpires in his career, was the butt of spectators taunting remarks on the previous tour there last year and also had a missile thrown at him from the stands. He had then said he would never tour Australia again. Before I bowl, they (spectators) are calling no-ball, Murali told reporters ahead of the five-match one-day series against Australia starting on Friday. Murali is the third-highest wicket-taker in Test history with 485 victims after West Indian fast bowler Courtney Walsh (519) and Australian Shane Warne (491). It is annoying if they call out every ball, he said. Its okay once or twice, but not if you are going on and on about it. They dont think about my performance and what I do. Sri Lanka will tour Australia in July for two Test matches, but the controversial off spinner said he was not sure if he will be able to go. Well have to wait and see, he said. Last time I had a lot of bad feelings, but I dont know what will happen in the future and how the public will react. The crowd is the main problem, not officials or players. Ill think very carefully when the new contract comes. The Sri Lankans bowling action still triggers a debate despite being cleared by the International Cricket Council. You cant keep bringing up the past and accusing someone, said Murali, who was once called a javelin thrower by former India left-arm spinner Bishan Singh Bedi. He hopes Australias selectors will name leg spinner Shane Warne in their squad for the three-match Test series here. Murali wants to race with Warne, who is available for selection after a one-year drugs ban, to the historic 500 Test wicket milestone and then on to Courtney Walshs world record. I definitely want Shane to come to Sri Lanka and I am looking forward to the challenge, Murali said. Shane has done cricket proud during the past decade and he is a player that I greatly admire. If he reaches the record first then good on him, he said. Even if he does get there first though I will probably have a little bit more time than him and I can break the record after that. Murali is looking forward to the challenge of testing his abilities against the world champions.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Security stays a real hot potato
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: The Indian cricketers are keen that somebody put his neck on the line and assure security will actually be foolproof on the forthcoming trip of Pakistan. In fact, speaking to The Telegraph, one of the seniors specifically said: Look, we shouldnt be the only ones to Let somebody (else) also put his neck on the line Somebody must be accountable. This remains their stand even as the Board has named a three-member delegation to oversee arrangements  specially security  in Pakistan. The trio leaves on February 9. PTI adds from Melbourne: Meanwhile, some players had a meeting on Wednesday evening to win wider support for possibly skipping the proposed tour. Nobody wants to be seen as being alone in deciding on the issue  one way or the other. Indias last full tour was back in November-December, 1989.  Copyright

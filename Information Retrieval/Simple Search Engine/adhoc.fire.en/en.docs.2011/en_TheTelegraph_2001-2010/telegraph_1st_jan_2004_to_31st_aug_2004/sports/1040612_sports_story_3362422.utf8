The Telegraph - Calcutta
Ralf bored with chasing scarlet cars
- Schumacher Jr still dreams of becoming world champion
 Ralf Schumacher has had a disappointing time with Williams Montreal: Williams-BMW driver Ralf Schumacher said here on Thursday that Formula One has become boring for all but his elder brother Michael this season because Ferrari are so dominant. World champion Michael has performed to virtual perfection for Ferrari this season, winning six of the seven races and starting from pole in five events. He failed to win in Monaco after crashing out in the tunnel. His closest rivals from last season  Williams-BMW and McLaren-Mercedes  have dropped back to leave BAR-Honda and Renault leading the chase and Ralf believes the rest of the field are fed up of running around behind the scarlet cars. It starts to become boring for all of us that we are unable to beat them, said Ralf. We have tried many years now, but they do something which all of us have not figured out yet. Michael has amassed 60 points so far this season compared to teammate Rubens Barrichellos 46 and the 38-point haul of closest non-Ferrari driver Briton Jenson Button (BAR-Honda). He has claimed four consecutive world titles since 2000 while his brother Ralf, who joined the front-running Williams team in 1999, has only managed a highest placing of fourth in the championship in 2001 and 2002. This year looks set to be fifth in a row for the Ferrari-driving Michael while Ralf, who has just 12 points, is yet to climb on the podium this season and openly admitted he has been disappointed with his time at Williams. My expectations were clearly bigger, no doubt about it, said Ralf, whose contract is up for renewal at the end of the year. It has been a nice time so far and if I had to take the same decision again I would do it. But I still havent given up on the fact I want to be world champion one day and whether I stay or go is not a short-term decision  its all going to take one or two years at least to be able to run for the championship.

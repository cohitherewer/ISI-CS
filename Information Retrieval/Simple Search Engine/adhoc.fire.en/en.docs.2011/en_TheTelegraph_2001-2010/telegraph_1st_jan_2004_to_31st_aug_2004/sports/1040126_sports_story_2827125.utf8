 Mixed day for Bhupathi
 Bhupathi and partner Mirnyi have moved into the doubles quarter finals New Delhi: Second seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi moved into the quarter finals of the mens doubles at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Sunday. According to information received here, the Indo-Belarussian pair defeated Hicham Arazi of Morocco and Nicolas Mahut of France 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). The duo will now take on fifth-seeded French pair of Michael Liodra and Fabrice Santoro in the quarters. In the mixed doubles, however, Bhupathi, paired with Elena Likhovtseva of Russia and second seeded, could not keep the momentum and lost in an exhausting first round match. Bhupathi-Likhovtseva were upset by the unseeded pair of Jeff Coetzee (South Africa) and Tina Krizan (Slovenia) 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-7 (8-10). (PTI)  Copyright

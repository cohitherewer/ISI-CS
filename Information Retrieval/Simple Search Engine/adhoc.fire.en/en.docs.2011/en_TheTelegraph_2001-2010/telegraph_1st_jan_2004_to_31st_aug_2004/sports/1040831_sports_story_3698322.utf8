The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No Indians to officiate
London: India may be the financial hub of modern cricket and Sourav Gangulys men raring to topple Australia for the Test and one-day World Champion status, but the subcontinent giant will have no representation in the Umpires and Referees Panel for the ICC Champions Trophy. Former Test batsman Gundappa Viswanath is among the ICC Referees Panel while K. Hariharan, A. V. Jayaprakash and I. Shivram are in the list of ICC international umpires. But none of them was appointed to officiate in the 12-nation event in England from September 10 to 25. The ICC statement which confirmed the appointments on Monday, however, did not specify the reasons for the non-inclusion of the Indian officials. Chris Broad, Clive Lloyd, Ranjan Madugalle and Mike Procter of the elite panel of ICC referees will share referee duties over the group stage of the tournament. All eight members of the elite panel of ICC umpires will officiate on the field and as third umpires over the 12 preliminary matches.

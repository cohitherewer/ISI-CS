The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Serena is top seed
 - Absence of Justine, Kim raises hopes of an all-Williams final  Serena may open against compatriot Angela Haynes Key Biscayne: Serena Williams, returning after an eight-month lay-off, was made the top seed at the WTA and ATP Miami Masters Series and could face second-seeded sister Venus Williams in the final. Two-time defending champion Serena has not played since defeating elder sister Venus in last Julys Wimbledon final. She is only ranked sixth in the WTA while Venus, also a former world N0. 1, has slid to 17th. If Serena intends to reclaim her womens throne, the trek starts now. It definitely takes a lot (to get) back to the top, said Serena. I think Im definitely willing to put in the time and put in everything that I need to. The absence of the WTAs four top-ranked players helped push Serena atop the seedings, although Venus was moved into second despite her sister and 10 others in the field ranked above her in Mondays latest list. The top-32 seeds receive first-round byes in the 96-woman draw, so Serena will open against either a qualifier or fellow American Angela Haynes. Venus opens against either a qualifier or Chinas Zheng Jie. All day long I think about it, Serena said. Im really excited to get out there and play. Im more excited than everyone else. As excited as everyone else is, Im 10 times more excited. World No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne and second-ranked Kim Clijsters will not play in the $3.06 dollar hardcourt event. Also absent are Frances Amelie Mauresmo and American Lindsay Davenport. That leaves Russias Anastasia Myskina as the third seed, followed in order by American Jennifer Capriati, Russias Elena Dementieva, Japans Ai Sugiyama and Russians Vera Zvonareva and Natalie Petrova. It also increases the chances that the Williams sisters might push through into the Key Biscayne final. Serena, who could join her sister and Steffi Graf as the only three-time womens winners here, has Capriati as a possible semi-final foe. Capriati lost the past two finals here to Serena and the 2001 final to Venus.  (AFP)  Copyright

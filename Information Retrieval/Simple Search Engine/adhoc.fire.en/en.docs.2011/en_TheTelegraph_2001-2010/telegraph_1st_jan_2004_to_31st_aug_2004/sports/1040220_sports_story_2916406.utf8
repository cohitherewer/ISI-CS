 Chambers completes defence 
London: European 100m champion Dwain Chambers, who tested positive for a new designer steroid last year, completed his defence at a disciplinary hearing on Thursday in 45 minutes. The case against him, put by UK Athletics, had earlier lasted around four hours after four expert witnesses were called before a panel which could impose a two-year ban and end Chambers sprinting career. A spokeswoman for UK Athletics said the summings-up began early on Thursday afternoon after Chambers defence was concluded having started after a lunch break.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

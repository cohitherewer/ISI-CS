(AP)Kingston: West Indies beat Bangladesh by an innings and 99 runs on the fourth day of the second and final Test on Monday to win the series 1-0. In reply to West Indies first innings score of 559 for four declared, Bangladesh were all out for a mere 176 in their second innings. The visitors lost six wickets for 10 runs in a sensational final half-hour prior to lunch. In a dramatic collapse following a stand of 120 for the fourth-wicket between captain Habibul Bashar and left-hander Manjural Islam Rana, Bangladesh slumped from 154 for three to reach 164 for nine at lunch. Pedro Collins wreaked the most damage, to take Test-best figures of six wickets for 53 runs from 18 overs into the interval. It was Collins third haul of five wickets or more in 24 Tests and second against the Tigers. On Sunday, Ramnaresh Sarwan hit an undefeated 261 while Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored an unbeaten 101.

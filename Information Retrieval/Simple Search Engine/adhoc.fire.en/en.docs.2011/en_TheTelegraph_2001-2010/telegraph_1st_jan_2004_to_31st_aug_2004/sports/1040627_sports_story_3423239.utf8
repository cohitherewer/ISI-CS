 Rain plays spoilsport
London, June 26 (Reuters): The ODI between New Zealand and the West Indies was abandoned at Edgbaston on Saturday because of persistent rain as the Black Caps closed in on victory. Hamish Marshall (24 not out) and Scott Styris (26 not out) batted through the drizzle to guide New Zealand to 97 for two from 13.4 overs chasing a Duckworth-Lewis adjusted target of 140 in their allotted 21 overs. But the rain began to fall more heavily and the players were forced from the field for a final time.  Copyright

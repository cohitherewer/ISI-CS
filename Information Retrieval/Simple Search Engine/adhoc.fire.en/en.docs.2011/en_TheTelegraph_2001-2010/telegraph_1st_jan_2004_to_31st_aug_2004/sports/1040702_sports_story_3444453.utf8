 Argentina favourites, says Brazil coach
Teresopolis (Brazil): Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira believes arch-rivals Argentina are favourites to win the Copa America starting next week. Argentina are taking a squad of almost full strength to the tournament in Peru while Brazil are resting top players such as Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka and Roberto Carlos. Argentina are certainly favourites, Parreira said on Wednesday. Theyre taking their first team and that makes a difference because they have a team ready-made for the competition. Each side has their own motivation for the tournament. Argentina didnt take part last time and maybe theyre under pressure to take a full-strength side. However, he added that world champions Brazil should not be underestimated in Peru. Our teams good and we dont have to fear any opponent, he said. Parreira has criticised the timing of the tournament which falls in the European close season, when most Brazilian internationals are on holiday.  It is also the middle of the South American World Cup qualifying competition. Castros wish Meanwhile, President Fidel Castro, self-proclaimed friend and admirer of Diego Maradona, said he hopes the former Argentine soccer superstar can return to Cuba, where he spent several years undergoing treatment for drug problems. I hope he can come, Castro said last night during a reception at the home of Argentine ambassador Raul Taleb. The Cuban leader said he recently had a friendly telephone conversation with Maradona, who bears a tattoo of Castros face on one leg. He has struggled with the problem he had and it hasnt been easy, Castro said of Maradona. He is a person who has prestige, fame. I think he is a noble guy and undoubtedly a great athlete.

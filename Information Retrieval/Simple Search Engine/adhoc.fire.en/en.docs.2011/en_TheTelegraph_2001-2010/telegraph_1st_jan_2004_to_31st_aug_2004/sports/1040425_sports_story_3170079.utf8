				 																																	Monte Carlo: The IAAF has ratified the latest womens pole vault world record set by Russias Yelena Isinbayeva. Isinbayeva cleared 4.86m on March 6 at the world indoor championships in Budapest. The mark is both an overall world record as well as an indoor world record. The IAAF on Friday also ratified the previous world and world indoor mark of 4.85m set by Russian rival Svetlana Feofanova on February 22 in Athens. The IAAF certified the world indoor mark in the mens triple jump by Swedens Christian Olsson. He jumped 17.83m on March 7 in Budapest. The world indoor record by Russias Tatyana Lebedeva (15.36m) in Budapest was also ratified.				 																																	New York: A $7,350 cheque from track star Marion Jones bank account was written to the founder of the California lab at the centre of a performance-enhancing drug scandal, the New York Times reported on Saturday. Citing two people familiar with the bank records  previously noted in a government affidavit  the newspaper said the cheque was written to Victor Conte of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative.				 																																	The Times reported that Jones lawyers, while not disputing the cheque came from her account, said on Friday that Jones had not signed or authorised the cheque to Conte. While Jones lawyers declined to say who had signed the cheque, the newspaper reported that two other people familiar with the cheque said the signature belonged to C.J. Hunter, Jones former husband.				 																																	New Delhi: Mansher Singh failed to reproduce his top form as he finished a dismal 34th in mens trap event in the World Cup shooting at Athens.				 																																	The 38-year-old Indian, who missed the bronze medal by a whisker in the World Cup in Cairo earlier this month, ended with a total of 106 despite shooting a perfect 25 in the fifth and last round at the Markopoulo Olympic Shooting centre, according to information received here on Saturday. But Manshers scores in the first four rounds, where he shot 21, 19, 22 and 19, had already done the damage as he failed to make the final.				 																																	Mansher had scored 119 in the preliminary round at Cairo before shooting 23 in the final for a total of 142.				 																																	London: Speculation was growing on Saturday that Liverpool striker Michael Owen could be on his way to Spanish giants Barcelona at the end of the season. 				 																																	The Catalonian side has made it clear they are in the market for a top-rated striker in their bid to regain the top spot in Spanish football from archrivals Real Madrid. 				 																																	Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard has propelled the side up the league after a poor start to the season and Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho has been an undoubted success. 				 																																	But striker Patrick Kluivert has been in poor form and Rijkaard has been given a free hand to go out and get a proven goal-scorer. 				 																																	Barcelona had been linked with Manchester Uniteds Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the Dutchman has ruled out leaving Old Trafford. The 24-year-old Owen could be next in line and Rijkaard was not ruling it out. 				 																																	We need a fast striker who is also technical and knows how to create numerous goal-scoring opportunities. Am I referring to Owen? What do you think? he told the Daily Mail.				 																																	Lisbon: Sportings Portugal defender Rui Jorge has tested positive for an anti-allergy medicine that his club doctor failed to declare in time.				 																																	Sporting doctor Jose Gomes Pereira told a news conference on Friday that he was to blame for not notifying the National Anti-Doping Council that he had prescribed the medicine, which is allowed if declared. There was a delay in the notification of the drug... and the test took place during that time.Rui Jorge, 31, had the test on February 13 after Sportings 1-0 win at Moreirense. I have a hayfever allergy problem and was prescribed two medicines. It was a surprise when I heard this news but I have a clear conscience.Sport on ScreenCricket: Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe third ODI, live from 12.50 pm on ESPN

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Walking on, with an eye on history
 - Polands Olympic champion gunning for record fourth gold  Athens heat is a concern for Robert Korzeniowski Athens: When a young Robert Korzeniowski gave up judo for competitive walking it looked as though he had made a big mistake. Other disciplines such as the sprints and pole vault were regarded as the glamour events of athletics while walkers were ridiculed by spectators who dubbed them ducks because of their characteristic wobbly walk. But Korzeniowski is having the last laugh. Twenty years, 120,000 kilometres and three Olympic titles later, he is a national hero in Poland and the countrys hottest prospect for the Athens Games. In August, a month after he turns 36, he will be stepping out for a place in history as Polands best Olympic athlete ever. A fourth gold would put the slender athlete ahead of Irena Szewinska, a sprinter in the 1960s and 1970s who won three Olympic golds, three silvers and one bronze medal. I am aiming for gold, but I dont think about such statistics, Korzeniowski said. Each event is a new challenge, past medals are  both symbolically and literally  tucked away. Korzeniowski, who is afforded a celebrity status usually reserved for soccer players and entertainers at home, will defend his 50km walk title on August 27. He has visited Greece twice over the last six months and will acclimatise himself in the country for two weeks before his event. He plans to retire after Athens, having turned his much-derided discipline into gold on and off the track. After a disappointing Olympic debut in Barcelona in 1992, when he was disqualified from the 50km at the entrance to the stadium while in second place, Korzeniowski spent several years in France. He won his first Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996 over 50km and added two titles in Sydney four years later, over 20 and 50km. He has won world championship gold three times and is world record holder in his favourite 50km event, on which he will concentrate in Athens. When back in Poland, he divides his time off the circuit between charity work, promoting walking among schoolchildren, a track and field team he helps to run and his own brand of sports clothing Walker. In an unusual tribute to his popularity, one Polish sex website used his name as bait to lure surfers to its pages. The 50km walk, where athletes clock up more than three-and-half hours, is the longest athletics event and Korzeniowski, who won his first world championship title in Athens in 1997, said the sweltering August heat would be a major challenge. Of course Ill be in Athens for the event and will visit fellow athletes in the village, but Ive been to three Olympics and I know that it is better to concentrate and prepare in peace. In Greece, after a brief reconnaissance in February, he has chosen a small town in the Peloponese, some 200kms from Athens. It wasnt easy to find the right place...Greece has a lot of mountains and there are a lot of roads that are just too steep, he said. Security will be a top concern of the organisers of the first summer Olympics since the September 11 attacks on US cities and last years war in Iraq and Korzeniowski said he welcomed the heightened precautions. I am aware of the threats and I respect those who protect us and the procedures. The Games increasingly resemble a military camp... but we live in such a world that it is necessary.

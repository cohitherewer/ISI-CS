The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The humiliation of King David
	 - The England skipper comes crashing down to earth in Spain  FROM PAUL HAYWARD IN MADRID  David Beckham (seen above being roughly challenged by Atletico Madrids Gonzalo de los Santos in Madrid on Saturday) is the biggest target today When David Beckham was kicked in the stomach 12 minutes into a typically venomous Madrid derby here on Saturday night, it was not the first time this spring that a fellow resident of the Spanish capital had put the boot into the England captain. This was an especially intense encounter between the Atletico and Real tribes. There were mounted police charges before the match, a hail of projectiles as Reals Galacticos fled down their foxhole to the changing rooms and a row of acridly burning seats behind one of the goals. Fifteen spectators and one police officer were hospitalised in subsequent fighting. Atleticos Vicente Calderon stadium, where Reals highly fortunate 2-1 victory left them with a precarious one-point lead in La Liga, was a cauldron in every sense. For Beckham, though, it was probably nothing compared to the atmosphere at home. For Galactico No. 23 and Englands leader at Euro 2004, which is eight brief weeks away, April is the cruellest month. Refusing to speak to the Spanish media, Beckham flew to London to be with his family in what one imagines to be the worlds most expensively furnished doghouse. By the time he was able to race to the airport it was already Sunday morning, which, for him, has become a time of trial by text message and cringe-inducing scrutiny of his sexual and marital lives  all of which, some argue vehemently, is the price he has come to pay for presenting himself as the perfect family man and turning his life into a soap opera and a commodity; for hanging a for-sale sign on so much of his celebrity marriage. With its 10pm kick-off, this match nearly spanned two days. By the time he had showered, Beckham had doubtless already been briefed on the next set of blows to his ribs. When the papers thumped on to British doormats, there was the inevitable appearance of girl No. 3 in the kiss n tell epic and a claim in the News of the World, who did the original, brutal telling, that he had confessed to a dalliance with Rebecca Loos, the so-called Sleazy Senorita who apparently looked after her boss rather too well when she was appointed his personal assistant in Spain. However many misgivings the neutral observer might have about the commercial choreography that so dominates his life, there can be little doubt that there is suffering in the Beckham hacienda, and that anyone who takes pleasure from that qualifies for membership of the society of ghouls. In Madrid, a city of mangled trains and blood on the tracks, Beckhams marital dramas dont seem so immense. Under intense emotional strain, he did what he always does as Real laboured unimpressively to heal the wound of their premature exit from the Champions League. He applied himself unflinchingly, scuttling around hostile territory with that horse riders gait of his, and confining himself mostly to short, efficient passes on the right side of central midfield. A minute after Atleticos Nano had kicked him under the rib cage as he chased a through ball, Beckham was bombarded by seat covers and an assortment of other projectiles as he prepared to take a corner. My God, he must have thought, hell is raining fire on me. By then Real were leading from a fifth-minute goal by Santiago Solari, who later said of his troubled team-mate: Its horrible to see this happen to anyone. Its horrible that when youre famous people want to do this to you. Did Solari think Beckham would stay at the Bernabeu next season? Of course. Hes very focused on every game and every training session. These are momentous hours in the chronicle of Beckham the hyper-celeb. Why? Because he has just left the pages of Mills and Boon and taken up residence in The Human Stain  Philip Roths classic meditation on, among other things, the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair. Roth wrote: It was the summer in America when the nausea returned, when the joking didnt stop, when the speculation and the theorizing and the hyperbole didnt stop... when the smallness of people was simply crushing, when some kind of demon had been unleashed in the nation and, on both sides, people wondered Why are we so crazy?. The readjustment is almost complete. The celeb-obsessed are abandoning the myth of Beckham as some kind of deity and learning to regard him instead as someone altogether more human: flawed and fallible, as we all are. For so long we could not find the middle ground on this ubiquitous, hard-working, ball-curling, self-grooming hero of aspirational England. After France 98, he was the self-absorbed villain who got England knocked out of a World Cup with his playground hack at Diego Simeone, the Argentine agent provocateur. Then, after his free-kick against Greece and the relentless parading of his paternal skills with Brooklyn and Romeo, he was a paragon. He is neither. Roths point is that we are all something in between. Tellingly, perhaps, there has been no stampede back home to judge or blame. The mania has been to devour every embarrassing detail. In this festival of excruciation, the detail becomes the entertainment. In the menagerie of exposure and titillation, strangely, Beckhams problems echo those of Sven-Goran Eriksson, the England coach, in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup. Then it was Ulrika Jonsson. Now its Erikssons lieutenant writhing on the hook with an international tournament imminent. The bare details of Beckhams Saturday night are that Atletico equalised from a penalty by Veljko Paunovic after Reals Francisco Pavon had been sent off for bringing down the home teams Demis Nikolaidis  and that Beckham then played a part in Ivan Helgueras disputed winning header 13 minutes from time. For the Galacticos, whose planetary radiance has dimmed, another trial awaits: a home game against Barcelona, their other great tribal enemy. As he tries to quell the storm in his hacienda, Englands capitan has at least one thing in his favour. If Spain is distracted and therefore largely indifferent to his discomfort, it may be because there is a royal wedding on the way. Hes not the only monarch in town.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

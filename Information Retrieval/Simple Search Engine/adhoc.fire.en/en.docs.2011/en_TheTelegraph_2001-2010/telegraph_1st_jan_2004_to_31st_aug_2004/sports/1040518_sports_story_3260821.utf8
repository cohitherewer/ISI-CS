 Vaughan doubtful 
London, May 17 (Agencies): England captain Michael Vaughan twisted his right knee during practice on Monday, a spokesman for the team said, making him doubtful for the first Test against New Zealand at Lords starting Thursday. He slipped and fell while facing a delivery in the nets, the spokesman said. His knee was heavily strapped and he returned to the dressing room. Vaughan was waiting to have a scan in hospital but the spokesman said the full extent of the injury would probably not be known until Tuesday. If Vaughan does not recover, fellow-opener Marcus Trescothick would probably captain the England side. Vaughan, 29, batting in the practice nets on the Nursery ground behind the main playing area, stretched for a wide ball but slipped and fell, damaging his right knee. The Yorkshire batsman appeared to have recovered, getting up to his feet and throwing the ball back only to shout out in pain moments later. England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokesman Andrew Walpole told AFP: quot;Michael twisted his right knee batting against an MCC groundstaff bowler. Meanwhile, New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond has been ruled out of the first Test against England, coach John Bracewell confirmed on Sunday. The news comes as a double-blow for New Zealand who crashed to a nine-wicket defeat to Kent at Canterbury on Sunday when Bond did not feature after suffering the effects from bowling earlier in the game. In the first innings, Bond took one for 77 off 16 overs.  Copyright

		 Saturday, June 26, 2004 EURO DIGEST
 Rome: Marcello Lippi was named on Friday as Italys new coach, starting on July 16. The former Juventus coach will take over the day after Giovanni Trapattonis contract expires, Italian football federation president Franco Carraro said. Lippis contract will run until the end of the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany. Carraro said: As president of the football federation I must thank Trapattoni for his rectitude. I hope Lippi will be able to qualify Italy as quickly as possible for the 2006 World Cup finals. Lisbon: British bookmakers William Hill will pay out to punters who laid bets on Sol Campbell scoring the winning goal for England in the quarter final against Portugal. Even though the goal was disallowed by Swiss referee Urs Maier two minutes from the end of the match with the scores tied at 1-1. A lot of people put bets on Sol scoring the winner because he often goes for corners and set pieces. We will pay out on this, but Im afraid we cant do anything about the final result, a William Hill spokesman told Sky News TV. An England victory would have been the worst result for us, he said.  Lisbon: Portugals dramatic penalty shootout win over England kept the medical services busy at the Stadium of Light  and it was more than Wayne Rooneys broken foot that required attention. A total of 130 people needed treatment after fainting and suffering attacks of nerves during Thursdays quarter final. London: Top American tennis players Serena Williams and Andy Roddick said they had been gripped by Englands defeat to Portugal.				 																																	It was just a total robbery, said Serena, who earlier this week had declared herself a fan of the England team.				 																																	What am I doing now? Im not going to watch anymore. 				 																																	Roddick felt the controversial condition of the grass around the penalty spot would have better suited Baywatch star David Hasslehoff and that the Wimbledon groundstaff could have helped out.				 																																	It looked like a beach, said Roddick.David Hasselhoff would have made the penalty shot before Beckham.  Singapore: A Singaporean man was jailed for two weeks and fined $11,764 for taking illegal bets on the Euro 2004, a report said on Friday. Retail stall assistant Tai You Wah, 44, had pleaded guilty to taking bets totalling $6,500 on the Czech Republic against Latvia and Germany against Holland.

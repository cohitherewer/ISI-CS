 Mukti sniffs Olympic berth 
 - STATE ATHLETICS 
- Six records tumble on concluding day  BY A STAFF REPORTER  New meet record holders (from left) Sabina Khatun, Mukti Saha and Jhuma Khatun at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Six records were set on the final day of the state athletic championships at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. East Bengal retained the overall mens championship title with 110 points while Eastern Railway Sports Association (ERSA) retained the honours in the womens section with 112 points. The highlight of the day was the Mukti Saha-Soma Biswas clash in the 400m. Though the event is not included in heptathlon, Soma had participated to gauge her performance over 200m. Mukti won with a record timing of 52.5 seconds followed by Soma at 54.1. Both bettered the previous record of 55.5 set by Kumkum Mondal in 1989. Both were almost neck and neck till the 200m, Soma threatening to surge ahead at times, but it was after that stretch that Mukti broke through. It was after a long time that the Asian Games silver medallist was competing in the 400 and the difference showed. Muktis pace was good and the way she distributed her effort over the distance was impressive, said her coach Pradip Kumar Banerjee. With a little more competition she can break the 52 barrier, he added. Soma, too, was all praise for Mukti. I feel very happy for her, she has really worked hard. Muktis got the talent, the basic speed and the endurance needed for the event. She must feature in the 4x400 relay team for the Olympics, said coach Kuntal Roy. Tanka Roy stole the limelight in the boys under-18 110m hurdles with a record 14.9 seconds. He bettered Golok Mondals 15.0. In the girls under-18 Jhuma Khatun bettered Itika Halders 4:53.4 with a timing of 4:43.7 in the 1500m. In the 400m of the same age-group Sabina Khatun erased two seconds off Pinki Pramaniks 57.2 to set a new record. Among the boys, Sadhan Roy came up with a new record  13.72 m  in triple jump. He put to the shade Tapas Kalwars 13.68m. Sankar Biswas bettered his own mark in javelin, covering a distance of 70.08m. In many ways the meet served as a warm-up event for the Olympic hopefuls ahead of the circuit and inter-state meets in Chennai. The talk centred around if Mukti and Soma will make it to Athens. The qualifying set for an individual to make it to the 4x400 relay squad is 52.30. Punjabs Manjit Kaur and Rajbinder Kaur along with S. Geetha of AP have already qualified. K. Beenamol is sure to make it. The race for the two remaining berths in the squad will be between Nancy Philip, Chitra and Mukti. Mukti, though, sounded hopeful. My confidence has improved after todays timing. With more competition I hope to go beyond the qualifying timing in Chennai, she said. Todays performance has given hope to Soma as well. She covered 6.11 in long jump and hopes it better further. I have gone beyond the 6m mark after a long while. Even in the Asian Games I failed to cross the 6m, said Soma. Soma has made me feel confident, said Kuntal Roy. In the first jump today she crossed 6.25, though, it was ruled as a foul on the slightest pretext. She is gradually nearing her peak and that is encouraging.  Copyright

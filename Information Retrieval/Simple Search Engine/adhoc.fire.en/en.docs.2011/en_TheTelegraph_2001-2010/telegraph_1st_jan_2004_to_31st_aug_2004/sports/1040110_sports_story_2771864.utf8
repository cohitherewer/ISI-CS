 Real may fine Ronaldo for trip to London
Madrid: Real Madrid will fine Ronaldo for travelling to London this week without permission and arriving back late for training, news reports said on Friday. Ronaldo decided to fly to London after he and several team stars were rested for Reals midweek Spanish Cup match against Eibar, a daily newspaper said. But the player broke club regulations by leaving the Spanish capital without permission. Fog forced his return flight to land at Salamanca instead of Madrid and prevented him from turning up for training on time Thursday. Ronaldo claimed he made the trip to Britain to make an advertisement but the report said Real Madrid was peeved at British news reports that he had intended going to Wednesdays Chelsea-Liverpool game at Stamford Bridge. According to British papers, he was just minutes away from the ground when he received a call from Real Madrid ordering him to turn round and fly home. There were no details on the size of the fine. Ronaldo said he did not expect to be disciplined by Real for missing training on Thursday and dismissed speculation that he met representatives from Chelsea. I dont think I will be fined because I have done nothing wrong, he said. Its totally false I had dinner in London with anyone linked to Chelsea, the Brazilian striker was quoted as saying in a Spanish sports daily. Its true that it is the second time Ive been in London recently and I have to return in the future because I have publicity obligations with Nike and some other personal business to sort out. Ronaldo said there was no foundation to reports that claimed he was not happy in Madrid and insisted he had every intention of seeing out his contract at Real. Im very happy and am aiming to complete the remaining two years on my contract. At the moment I only have one target and that is to win the Champions League, the one title that has so far evaded me.

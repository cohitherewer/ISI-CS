The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Domenech is France coach 
	 - New man at helm on mission to restore flagging fortunes  New French coach Raymond Domenech at a press conference in Paris on Monday. (Reuters) Paris: Raymond Domenech was appointed Frances national soccer coach on Monday, his mission to restore the fortunes of a side who have lost their World Cup and European Championship crowns in the space of two years. The 52-year-old, formerly coach of the French under-21 team, succeeds Jacques Santini who left after Euro 2004 to take over at Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. We received 41 applications, six of them were really serious, French football federation (FFF) chairman Claude Simonet told a news conference. The shortlist was reduced to three names, Laurent Blanc, Jean Tigana and Raymond Domenech, before we reached a consensus and appointed Raymond Domenech. Simonet said he would recommend the Federations council to appoint Domenech for four years with yearly objectives. I think that we should write in the contract the obligation to qualify France for the 2006 World Cup and to reach at least the semi-finals in Germany, he said. If these two objectives were to be met, the contract would be renewed for two more years. Domenech admitted that France must qualify for the 2006 World Cup and, if possible, win. We also have to rebuild around our national team the special feeling that helped us to win the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, he added. The new French coach said he had been informed of his appointment late on Sunday after his partner had given birth to a baby girl and they decided to name her Victoire. As a hard-tackling defensive midfielder, Domenech won eight caps for his country. He started his coaching career at second division Mulhouse and moved on to Olympique Lyon before joining the French national coaching body (DTN) in 1993. He steered Frances under-21 team to the semi-finals of the European Championship in 1994 and 1996 and to the final in 2002, bringing through such players as Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet. One of the main arguments in favour of Domenech was that he knows all the players in the national team. I think we made the right choice, Simonet said. He also was supported by Aime Jacquet who is an expert as he coached France to victory in the 1998 World Cup.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

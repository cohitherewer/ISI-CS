				 																																	Moscow: Russias gum-chewing soccer team have been told to quit their habit and sing their national anthem, by president Vladimir Putin, officials said on Wednesday. Putin telephoned Russian Olympic chief Leonid Tyagachyov during Euro 2004 and asked him to tell the players to sing the words to the anthem when it was played, Olympic Committee spokesman Gennady Shvets said on Wednesday. Popular tabloid Zhizn said Tyagachyov passed on the message to soccer officials, saying Putin was incensed that players were chewing gum rather than singing as the anthem was played. I told the lads to take their national anthem more seriously, Russian soccer chief Vyacheslav Koloskov said. Other teams not only sing, they have expressions on their faces that straight away make it clear they are prepared to do everything to beat the opposition. And ours? They chew gum and smile.

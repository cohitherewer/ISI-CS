 MacGill back in squad
 MacGill is a proven Test performer Sydney: Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill has been called up to replace injured fast bowler Brad Williams in the squad for the upcoming two-Test series against Sri Lanka, Cricket Australia announced on Thursday. MacGill, holidaying in Venice, has been asked to return home immediately after Williams was ruled out of the series with a lower back problem. Its obvious that we havent gone for a like replacement for Brad Williams, chief selector Trevor Hohns said. But given we already have four fit fast bowlers in the squad, Stuart gives us some added flexibility, he said seeking to justify the replacement of the fast bowler with a spinner. He (MacGill) is a proven Test performer and is match fit having spent the last few months playing county cricket. With main spinner Shane Warne just recovering from a hand injury, MacGill will be the ideal replacement if his senior partner suffers a setback during the series, Hohns said. Although Stuart wasnt initially picked in the squad ... Hes the best bowler available to us at this point in time. His selection might challenge our original thinking when it comes to deciding the final make up of the team. In addition to that, if Shane Warne suffers a setback with his injured hand, Stuart is the ideal replacement. Warne last week announced he would be fit to play in the series, despite breaking his left hand earlier this month batting for the English county side Hampshire. The series kicks off in Darwin next week, while the second Test is in Cairns.  (PTI)  Copyright

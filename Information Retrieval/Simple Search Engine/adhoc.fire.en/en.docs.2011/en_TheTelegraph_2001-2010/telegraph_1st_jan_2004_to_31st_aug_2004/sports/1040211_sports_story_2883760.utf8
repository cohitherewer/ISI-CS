 Astle may be out for 8 weeks
 Nathan Astle Auckland: New Zealand batsman Nathan Astle could be out for eight weeks owing to a keyhole surgery on his right knee. Clearly this is disappointing for Nathan and New Zealand Cricket, team manager Lindsay Crocker said in a statement on Tuesday. However, we felt it was the prudent decision to make as it is better for Nathan in the long term if we address the problem now. Astle will undergo an operation on Thursday and has very little chance of playing in the three Tests against South Africa in March. He said he would target the England tour in May for his comeback. New Zealands most prolific one-day batsman had only recently returned to play club cricket in Christchurch following an operation on his left knee. Astle had surgery on his left knee after the World Cup a year ago. He toured India but returned home in October after the Test matches, missing the triangular one-day series which also involved Australia. (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Lewis void opens up race
Las Vegas: With Lennox Lewis gone, its suddenly a good time to be a heavyweight. Promoter Don Kings planned announcement on Tuesday of two title fights means all three major titles will be in play in April, along with most of the top heavyweight contenders and pretenders. The best of the fights may be the one saved for last, when Vitali Klitschko and Corrie Sanders meet April 24 for the WBC title that Lewis gave up when he retired last month rather than fight Klitschko in a rematch. Klitschkos brother, Wladimir, will fight two weeks earlier, and IBF champion Chris Byrd and WBA champion John Ruiz will defend their titles in between on a card at Madison Square Garden. About the only heavyweights not fighting are oldsters George Foreman and Larry Holmes, though both say they want back in the ring, too. The winner of the Klitschko-Sanders fight will likely be considered the true heavyweight champion, though those in the Ruiz and Byrd camps will argue that their fighters should be given proper due. King isnt doing Ruiz and Byrd any favours by matching them in what could be two ugly fights on an April 17 card at Madison Square Garden.  (AP)  Copyright

The 39-year-old has completed financial negotiations with the ruling body and further details are expected to be concluded in the next few days, the DFB said in a statement. Klinsmann, who has been living in the United States since ending his playing career in 1998, will take over from Rudi Voeller, who resigned as national coach after his side failed to survive the group stage of Euro 2004. My role should be one of team chief. This post is an honour for me, Klinsmann said at the weekend after arriving at Frankfurt airport from the United States.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. look for turnaround
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dipendu hopes things will fall in place Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting might be struggling to make a mark on the big stage. But they are still putting up a brave face on the eve of their crucial National Football League tie against the powerful Dempo at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. The feeling in the black-and-white brigade is that this match can just be the turning point for them in the league. We know they are a powerful side. But we are not intimidated, coach Jamshed Nassiri said. He felt theres no reason why they shouldnt put it across Dempo. Its not that we are playing badly, the only thing is we havent been scoring on a regular basis, Nassiri said. Mohammedan Sporting will depend on Dipendu Biswas to deliver the goods. The striker believes its just a matter of time before things fall into place. May be things will come good tomorrow, Dipendu said. Their second striker Chidi Edeh is nursing an injury, but the team management hopes to field him on the day. After making it to the Federation Cup final early in the season, Mohammedan Sportings performance graph has nosedived. Two coaches have been changed, but it seems to have had little effect. Club authorities feel this is the time to deliver. In a veiled warning of sorts, a top club official said, Weve done everything, now if the boys cant do the job This was also the message that came up during the team meeting on Friday. Technical adviser P.K. Banerjee has told the boys that if they can upset the league leaders, everyone will sit up and take notice. Dempo have hit a purple patch, winning five of their matches and drawing two. With 17 points, the Goan team is eyeing a top three finish and coach Armando Colaco will leave no stones unturned to carry on the good work. Two of their central defenders Majek Bolaji and Dominique Noronda have been ruled out owing to injuries.  Copyright

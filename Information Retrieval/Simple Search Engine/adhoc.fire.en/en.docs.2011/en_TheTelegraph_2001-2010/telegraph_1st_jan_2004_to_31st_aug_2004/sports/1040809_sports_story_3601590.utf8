 Button in licence fear
London: Jenson Button met BAR-Honda team chief David Richards on Sunday to explain his decision to leave the team at the end of the year and join rivals Williams. Button was holidaying in the Mediterranean when the controversial move was announced last Thursday and Richards contested that he had already exercised an option on the Britons services beyond this season. If Jenson Button is found to be in breach of contract with BAR and wants to move on illegally he could lose his super licence and that would mean he couldnt drive for Williams,said Bernie Ecclestone. Morally, Jenson has an obligation to stay but when agents, promises and big money come into it morals go out the window, Ecclestone said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

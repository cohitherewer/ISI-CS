 Harmison Englands leading light: Fleming
 Harmison is in the Brett Lee mould, feels Fleming Leeds: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has said that England fast bowler Stephen Harmison had been the key to the Black Caps Test series loss on Monday. England beat New Zealand by nine wickets at Headingley to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Harmison had match figures of eight for 131, his tally for the series now standing at an impressive 15 for 333 with his wickets coming at an economical cost of just over 22 runs each. Fleming said he could have the same impact for England as Brett Lee had for Australia. Asked if Harmison, 25, could be compared to Glenn McGrath, the rock of the Australian attack, Fleming compared him instead to the more explosive Lee instead. I dont think he wants to do what Glenn McGrath does. Im sure hed like the same statistics but he is a different bowler. Hes more the Brett Lee combination with a bit more height. He is a bit more dynamic than Glenn McGrath. Fleming said his pace attack at Headingley had failed to defend a healthy first innings total. After getting 409 in helpful bowling conditions, I stated we were in front and we were, in fact, in front. The penetration we had with the ball was pretty nil on a wicket that offered a lot throughout. Fleming contrasted the performance of his pacemen with that of Harmisons. The tall Durham quicks height (6feet 4inches, 1.93m) makes him a menacing prospect and Fleming said: it was the quicker bowlers, the Harmisons, who created the pressure. It was almost two different games. He (Harmison) is No.2 in the world rankings and in these conditions he was outstanding. His natural attributes of being tall and getting bounce magnify any inconsistencies in the wicket. I was very keen to get over here because I felt we had a good side, added Fleming, who led New Zealand to a 2-1 series win in England in 1999. But we have lacked a spearhead in our bowling. Harmison has been the leading light for England, I believe.  Harmison is in the Brett Lee mould, feels Fleming New Zealand, meanwhile, called up Ian Butler on Tuesday for the forthcoming triangular series in England also featuring the West Indies. Northern Districts fast bowler Butler, 22, comes in for fellow paceman Shane Bond who did not play in New Zealands seven-wicket first Test defeat against England at Lords and only featured in the nine-wicket second Test reverse at Headingley as a substitute fielder. Bond, who has been out of international cricket with a stress fracture of the back since May last year, has been sent home ahead of the third and final Test which gets underway at Trent Bridge on Thursday. Butler, who has played seven Tests and ten ODIs, has struggled with fitness problems of his own.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pillay not in squad
	 - OLYMPIC HOCKEY QUALIFIERS  FROM A CORRESPONDENT  Keeping Pillay out a major controversy As expected Dilip Tirkey was chosen as captainNew Delhi: The Indian squad for the Olympic hockey qualifiers contains a big shock: no Dhanraj Pillay. There was a good deal of intrigue lying around on the last day of trials to select the squad for the Madrid meet (March 2-13). Pillays omission sparked controversy. The official reason was that Pillay had not fully recovered from the knee-jerk he suffered in the match against Australia in mid-January in the Sultan Azlan Shah tournament in Kuala Lumpur. That was what IHF president K.P.S. Gill said (he was not fully fit, so he withdrew). However, Pillay later told the media: I am fit and all right, but withdrew myself as I did not feel right to go with the team when I had not played in the trials. Which version is true is anybodys guess. It seems, though, that the IHF persuaded Pillay to declare himself not fully fit, so that he could be spared the ignominy of being overlooked. Before the team announcement, after a trial match at the National Stadium, manager K. Krishnamurthy seemed to be coaxing Pillay to agree to saying he was withdrawing because he was unfit. This was needed, because Pillay, who joined the camp this morning, had submitted medical certificates from Dr Anant Joshi stating that he was fit to resume training. Pillay said: Fitness was not a problem. I have played for India at this level of fitness in 1994. I could have still been an asset and with my experience could have created or converted chances. He added that had he not been confident of his fitness he wouldnt have come for the last day of trials. There is a school of thought which points at the ego clash between coach Rajinder Singh and Pillay. After winning the Asia Cup in September 2003, Pillay had defied the coachs instructions of speaking to the media. This had sparked off a war of words. Rajinder said Monday: We have to learn how to play without key players who are injured. First it was Jugraj Singh and now Dhanraj Pillay. Ace striker Gagan Ajit Singh said,  We will miss his experience and I hope he will be back soon. Gill said: I saw everyone was playing well it wont make much difference. With Pillay absent, expectedly defender Dilip Tirkey, who has fully recovered from illness, was chosen as captain. Coach Rajinder said that drag flick specialist Len Ayappa would be used in midfield. Baljit Dhillon is also being trained as an alternative striker in penalty corners. Bharat Chhetri beat Kamaldeep Singh to the reserve keepers slot, while the highly rated William Xalco was preferred to Harpal Singh as the third defender. THE SQUAD Goalkeepers: Devesh Chauhan and Bharat Chetri. Defenders: Dilip Tirkey (Capt.), Kanwalpreet Singh and William Xalco.

 Kasimdzhanov emerges new champion
Tripoli: Grandmaster Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan recovered from a precarious position to beat Michael Adams of England 1.5-0.5 in the tie-breaker to win the world chess championship here on Tuesday. Kasimdzhanov won the first of the two rapid tie-break games and then played out a draw in the second to clinch the title. Earlier, the six-game final had ended in a 3-3 deadlock. The 24-year-old wins a purse of $100,000 and a match with Garri Kasparov as part of reunification process. Adams will bag $70,000. Living up to his reputation of being a tough player to beat in tie-breakers, Kasimdzhanov came back from the jaws of defeat in the first game of the rapid round but made excellent use of a series of errors by his rival to romp home. In the next game, Adams failed to deliver with black and settled for a draw that gave his rival the title. Prior to this triumph, Kasimdzhanovs sole claim to fame was his entry into the finals of the last World Cup where he was humbled by Viswanathan Anand. The Uzbek player deserved to win as he beat four top players  top-seed Veselin Toploav of Bulgaria, third-seed Alexander Grishchuk of Russia, fourth-seed Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and second-seed Adams. And all his victories against these players came in the rapid tie-break games. Kasimdzhanovs win left Adams rue the missed opportunities as he had spoiled a clear winning position in the sixth game on Monday that could have settled the issue in his favour. In the first game of the tie-breaker, Adams was cruising when disaster struck him. A Sicilian Rossolim almost spelled doom for Kasimdzhanov but he survived, thanks to some last minutes heroics well-aided by Adams blunders. Soon after the opening, the English player had an extra exchange and a passed pawn on the sixth rank but a series of bad moves saw him losing all his extra material and his confidence, as the ensuing endgame could also have been easily drawn. Capitalising on Adams mistakes, Kasimdzhanov came out with extra piece and had only to play a few correct moves thereafter to force resignation. In the second game, Kasimdzhanov stuck to the exchange variation of Ruy Lopez and had little difficulty in maintaining the balance. Quick exchanges led the game to a level bishop and pawns endgame and the drawn result was never in doubt. Adams agreed to the inevitable on his 48th turn.  (PTI)  Copyright

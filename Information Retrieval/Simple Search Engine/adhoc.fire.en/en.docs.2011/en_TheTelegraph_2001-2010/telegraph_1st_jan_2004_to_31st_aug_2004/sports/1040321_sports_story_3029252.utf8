The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Yuvraj may make cut
 - Test series squad - Second spinners berth wide open  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Yuvraj has influential backing Calcutta: Yuvraj Singh, who made his Test debut against New Zealand last October, may feature in the 15-strong squad for the three Tests in Pakistan. The squad will be picked in New Delhi on Monday morning, after the fourth ODI, in Lahore. According to The Telegraphs sources, at least one highly influential member of the thinktank is very keen that Yuvraj be selected as an extra middleorder bat  and, if the need arises, can even be made to open. Its to be seen how the selectors  chairman Syed Kirmani, Kirti Azad, Pranab Roy, Kiran More and Sanjay Jagdale  react to that line of thinking. However, they are unlikely to oppose if theres a collective request from the thinktank. In any case, theres going to be an interaction between the selectors and the captain-coach twosome before the squad is finalised. It couldnt be confirmed till late on Saturday, but one understands eight batsmen, one wicketkeeper, two spinners and four quicks will be picked. There should be no debate over most of the slots, but some heat could be generated if the selectors pitch for two wicketkeepers at the expense of abatsman. In that case, the going may get tough for Yuvraj and Sadagapon Ramesh, who is being talked of as the third opener (after Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra). In all probability, only Parthiv Patel is going to be there. If a second wicketkeeper is pushed through, the one favoured to make it is Bihars Mahender Singh Dhoni. Of course, much heat is bound to be generated over who will be the second spinner, after Anil Kumble  specially as Murali Kartik has thus far been a disaster. The names of Railways Kulamani Parida and the discarded Sunil Joshi are doing the rounds, as also Sarandeep Singh, but Ramesh Powar could eventually be asked to stay on. Kumble, one learns, has formally intimated the Board that he is fit. Ajit Agarkar, it seems, has done the same. While Kumble had a problem with his bowling shoulder, Agarkars troublesome left fibula ensured he wasnt available for the ongoing one-day series. The quicks, by the way, select themselves: Zaheer Khan, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Irfan Pathan and Agarkar. Its highly unlikely that Ashish Nehra is going to come into contention as he wont be fit before the second Test (Lahore, from April 5). Nehra, who injured himself fielding in the Rawalpindi one-dayer, returns home on Monday. Ironically, the latest injury  torn left webbing  comes at a time he was bowling beautifully. Destiny, as they say. Postscript: Incidentally, Kirmani and Co. will be watching the Lahore Test in person. Their trip, sponsored by the Board, is going to be precedent-setting.  Copyright

 Atwal fails to make cut
New Delhi: Arjun Atwal, the first and only Indian to have qualified to play in USPGA, failed to carry his good form into the second round and bowed out of the $5-million Houston Open on Sunday. The rain-marred USPGA-event saw Atwal fire a superb four-under 68 in the first round. But the rookie lost his way subsequently, producing a dismal seven-over-par 79 in the second round and missing the cut, according to information received here. (PTI)  Copyright

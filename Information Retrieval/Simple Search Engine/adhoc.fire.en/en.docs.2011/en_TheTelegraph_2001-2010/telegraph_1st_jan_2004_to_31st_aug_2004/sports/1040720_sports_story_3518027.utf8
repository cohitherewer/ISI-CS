 - BRITISH OPEN - Hamilton pips Els in play-off; Randhawa ties at 27  FROM LEWINE MAIR AT ROYAL TROON  Todd Hamilton with the Claret Jug after winning the play-off by one stroke against Ernie Els in Troon on Sunday. (AFP) Wow! called the 38-year-old Todd Hamilton as he holed the two-footer he needed to defeat Ernie Els in the play-off of what was a truly magnificent 133rd British Open championship (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). He had made a two to Els three at the third of the four play-off holes, the short 17th,and he had got down in two from short of the home green to secure the title. [Indias Jyoti Randhawa earned the best distinction of any Indian golfer ever, finishing a high of tied 27th spot. No Indian golfer has reached a higher spot in any Major. In the same bracket (270) as Jyoti finished Takashi Kamiyang and Rod Pampling. [Following up on his 73, 72 and 70 of the first three rounds, Jyoti actually slipped a bit in the final round Sunday, shooting a 72. That was mainly because of his fourth round inward nine (two bogeys for one over), which cancelled his fine two-birdie (sixth and seventh holes) out nine of one under 35. [In the meet Randhawa hit 11 birdies against 10 bogeys and two double bogeys. [Finishing below Randhawa were players like Nick Price and Mark OMeara, both tied at 30.] Hamiltons championship-winning approach would have alarmed the members of Royal Troon as much as any of Ian Poulters outfits. He used that relatively new-fangled shot, a chip and run with a species of three-wood, and it finished no more than a couple of feet away. There were tears from Hamilton and Els before the prize-giving. From Hamilton, because he had never in his life expected such a thing. All he had ever wanted was to become a regular player on the USPGA Tour. I hoped something like this would happen but I never really thought that it could, he said. The concurrent tears from Els were cumulative. He had played brilliantly on the last day at Augusta but lost to Phil Mickelson. He had been poised to win the US Open before posting a weary 80 in the last round. And now this. Three birdies in the last six holes had enabled him to finish on the same 274 mark as Hamilton but he had fallen short in the play-off. It was a play-off in which he should have had the edge. After all, he had gone through it all before in 2002. Then, he and Thomas Levet were still locked together after the four holes and he had beaten the Frenchman at the first hole of sudden death. Though he won this years Honda Classic on the US Tour and made an appropriate speech, Hamilton would not have had too much in the way of public speaking practice with his 11 wins in Japan. Yesterday, though, he spoke well and from the heart. He did not mention how, in a US Open, only the Americans get cheered. But he did talk of the British fans. How they were the fairest he had ever known, not just in golf but any sport. Having thanked them and everyone else, he went round shaking hands with as many of them as he could. Els, for one, had thought Hamilton was capable of winning. He said as much on Saturday night. It may have surprised you guys when he won the Honda but it didnt surprise us, he said. On Sunday, with the golfers having the beating of the tricky wind, Tiger Woods played his way into the picture at six-under on the outward half. And then there was Mickelson turning for home at nine-under to the eight-under of Hamilton and the seven-under of Els and Levet. Mickelson had to be the favourite at this point. After all, he had had that stroke of luck that comes to every champion  at the 15th in his third round when his tee shot had been hurtling out of bounds when it hit Alan Ward, a Kilmarnock man who had been stewarding at the fifth, full-toss on the back of the leg. Youd have been in the beer tent if it hadnt been for me, said Ward, as the player arrived on the scene. Mickelson thanked him warmly and, in the kind of gesture that is fast becoming typical of the player, handed across a signed glove. Where Woods started to fade at the 11th after failing to capitalise on a drive which landed on a grassy patch between gorse, Mickelson took a tumble at the 13th, missing for his par from five feet. With Levet moving neither forward nor back over the first few holes of the second nine, it rapidly became clear that the winner would come from one of Els, Mickelson or Hamilton who, far from taking fright amid the mounting pressure, was manufacturing one telling shot after another. At the start of Sunday, when he was 100 yards short of Els off the second tee, you had to wonder if his plan was going to prove too conservative against that of the big game hunters on the leaderboard. He duly dropped a shot at that hole before making birdies at the fourth and fifth to retrieve his lead. Coming home, he let a shot slip at the 10th to tumble to eight under, but was rather less distraught than he might have been leaving that green. After all, Els had driven half-way up a grassy bank and amassed a double-bogey. It was at the next that Els drove into a gorse bush. He whacked the ball to ground and ended up with the most improbable of pars. That done, no-one was surprised when he took off with birdies at the13th, the 16th and the 17th, where he holed a 10-footer. Yet, even at that, he was one behind playing the 72nd. He had the honour and bisected the fairway. Hamilton hit into the patchiest of the right rough before thumping his next close to the railings on the left. He was given a drop, which finished by no means badly considering he had dropped from far higher than necessary, and hit to12 feet. He missed and Els holed to be round in 68 to his 69. The day belonged to Hamilton, who had first captured the imagination of the Troon galleries on the sixth tee in his final round. A small boy with Hammy penned across his hat was looking from behind the railings. Is that your nickname? Hamilton had asked. When the child replied in the affirmative, Hamilton said it was his, too. He then plied the first of the many friends he would make over the week with a supply of tees, balls and gloves.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

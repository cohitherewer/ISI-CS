 Young caught doping again 
 Young tested positive for nandrolone in June 1999 Paris: World 400m champion Jerome Young of the United States failed a doping test after running in a meet here on July 23, lEquipe sports daily reported on Sunday. It was the second time that Young had tested positive for drugs following being caught for taking the anabolic steroid nandrolone in June 1999. The paper said that the 27-year-old tested positive for the banned blood booster EPO after the Golden League meet at the Stade de France in the build-up to the Athens Olympics. It said the Americans A sample tested in a Paris laboratory showed traces of the blood-boosting substance. The B sample was sent to another lab in Lausanne. Young finished sixth in the race in a slow time of 45.84 seconds. He is the first top sprinter to test positive for EPO, which has been a popular drug with endurance athletes and cyclists for over 15 years. It boosts performance by increasing the volume of oxygen-rich red blood cells in the blood. Compatriot Kelli White, however, told US athletics officials that she had taken EPO after testing positive for the stimulant modafinil during last years world championships in Paris where she won the 100m and 200m titles. Youngs 1999 doping case is still causing controversy because the following year he was part of the US 4x440m relay team that won the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics. The US athletics federation took no action against him and it was only three years later, just before the Paris World Championships that his failed drug test was revealed in newspaper reports.

 Heavy Kafelnikov amuses Safin
			Melbourne: Former world No.1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov has put on more than 20 kilograms and retired from tennis, Marat Safin said at the Australian Open on Monday. Safin teased reporters that his Russian Davis Cup teammate Kafelnikov, whose career has been in limbo since October, would not be returning. Guys, Kafelnikov quit, smiled Safin, who beat American Brian Vahaly 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the first round at Melbourne Park. Finished. You will not see him anymore. He is 105 kilos now. Its a lot of kilos, huh? Kafelnikov won the 1999 Australian Open and the 1996 French Open titles but the 29-year-old has been evasive about his future plans.  Paradorn, my mom loves you!  Paradorn Srichaphan finds there are both positive  and negative sides to his superstar status in his native  Thailand. On the plus side, he has been given a diplomatic  passport, making his travels around the worlds tennis circuit  easier to negotiate. But its not all easy for the No. 15-ranked  Paradorn, who last year became the first Asian-born player  to rank in the top 10, reaching a career-high No. 9 in May  and spending 10 weeks in the top 10. To live at home is still OK for me, but to go around a shopping centre is quite difficult, he says of the attention he receives from his countrymen. Paradorn says he has mobile telephones thrust at him, with people saying: Could you talk on the phone to my mother? She loves you.  Weighty issue  American Taylor Dent spent the off-season doing a  lot of off-court training. He says he needed to after having  packed on the weight after what was an injury-interrupted  2003. He has been working with fitness trainer Nick Anthony  on a full-time basis to make sure I dont get any more  injuries. Dent missed nearly two months after Wimbledon with a pinched nerve in his right wrist. He also had to pull out of his fourth round match against Andre Agassi at the US Open with a hamstring problem. He put on weight at the end of the year, getting up to 205 pounds (93 kg). He is now down to 195 pounds (88 kg). Doing the big damage is not getting my big butt off the couch, Dent said after advancing to the second round of the Australian Open when Fernando Verdasco of Spain retired with Dent leading 6-2, 6-1, 2-1 on Monday. I get a tendency where I could just sit down all day, very lazy, Dent added. But, you know, working hard makes it go away.  Copyright

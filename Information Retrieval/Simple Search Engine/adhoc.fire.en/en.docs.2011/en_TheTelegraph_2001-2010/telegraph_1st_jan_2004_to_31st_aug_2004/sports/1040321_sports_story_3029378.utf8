 Randhawa slips to 17th 
Singapore: Indias Jyoti Randhawa wasnt really shining after the third round at the European Tours Singapore Masters here Saturday. He was joint 17th with five others, on a total 210, bringing back a two over third round card. That, and the first round par card, have virtually negated his fine 64 in the second round. Britains Barry Lane, chasing his first European title in ten years, fired a flawless five-under-par 67 to share the third round lead with American Greg Hanrahan. Hanrahan also returned a 67 to finish at 13-under 203, level with the 43-year-old Lane, whose last success came at the 1994 Turespana Open de Baleares. Singapores Mardan Mamat, the overnight leader, ran up a double bogey at the penultimate hole for a 70 to slip back into third place at 11-under 205. Seven-time European number one Colin Montgomerie, who carded a blemish-free 67, was a further two shots back in a tie for fourth with Britains Jonathon Lomas (65), Frenchman Thomas Levet (65) and James Kingston of South Africa (70). It is nice to be sharing the lead and looking down on the rest of the field, but its also just nice to be playing well, the 43-year-old Lane told reporters. I have been playing well for the last year or so but nothings gone right for me. You never forget how to win and you never forget the feeling, but it is very difficult to win on tour these days. American Hanrahan celebrated his 46th birthday in style.  The Thailand-based Hanrahan is now in fine position in the $ 900,000 event, jointly sanctioned by the Asian and European Tours. Its a nice birthday gift! Ive got a nice tempo now. My swing relies on timing and my short game is working. (Agencies)  Copyright

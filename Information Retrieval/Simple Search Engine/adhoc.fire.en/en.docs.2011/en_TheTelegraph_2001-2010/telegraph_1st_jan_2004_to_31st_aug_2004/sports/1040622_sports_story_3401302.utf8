 John McEnroe throws sisters a challenge
l London: John McEnroe really is being serious  he firmly believes he could take on Serena and Venus Williams at the same time and beat them. I believe I could beat them playing them either individually or at the same time, said the Wimbledon champion turned TV tennis guru. In fact it would probably be easier playing them together because they would confuse each other, he argued in an e-mail exchange with readers of a London newspaper. Andys philosophy l Andy Roddick may boast the fastest serve in the world but to the sports top master blaster, it is the mind that rules on court. Its between the ears, said the young American whose motivational skills have been so effectively honed by Brad Gilbert, author of the coaching bible Winning Ugly. Tennis is a confidence game and I just seem to be building more and more inside with every day that passes on grass, Roddick said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

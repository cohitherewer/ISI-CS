The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Eleventh seed loses to Ashish
 A CORRESPONDENT  Payel Guha during her match at Gorky Sadan on Monday Calcutta: On an eventful day, 11th seed Suman Basu of Madhyamgram HS fell prey to Ashish Kumar in the fourth round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan on Monday. Ashish, the Jamshedpur leg champion, who grabbed a pawn offered by Suman in the queens gambit accepted, hung on to his advantage with precision. The loss of a pawn proved dear to Suman, who was forced to resign on the 29th move. Most seeds won their games with ease. Soumya Thakurta of St James, however, managed to scrape through against Payel Guha of Holy Child. In an upset of sorts, eighth seed Debaditta Sinha Biswas of Salt Lake Point School was held by Kh. Sanjoy Singh of Manipur in an irregular opening. At the end of the round, 12 players shared the lead with four points each. Top seed Debayan Majumdar of St James School showed his prowess in the middle-game with black pieces against Antarip Roy of St Paul Mission School. Opting for his favourite French defence, Debayans pieces were all over his opponents territory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Must-win for Tolly vs Salgaocar today
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata faces an uphill task Calcutta: Its a must-win situation for Tollygunge Agragami when they take on Salgaocar in their Round XX match of the eighth National Football League (NFL) here on Saturday. With 18 points from 19 matches, the city team is hovering the danger zone and any slip-up in the remaining three matches will only add up to their chances of facing the relegation. Coach Krishnendu Roy is aware of the reality and makes no bones about the danger he and his team is facing now. Its absolutely a do-or-die situation for us. My boys must realise even a draw against Salgaocar tomorrow will do nothing. A win is what my team will be aiming for, Roy maintained on the match-eve. Had we won against Indian Bank (in the last match), the situation would have been much better for us. But what happened in Chennai is past and we must look forward with a positive frame of mind, the Tollygunge coach added.  Goalkeeper Chinmoy Banerjee and midfielder Gouranga Dutta are ruled out through injury. But Roy did not want to brood over such setbacks. Whoever I have tomorrow must go for the kill right from the word go, he pointed out. Its likely Roy may adopt an attacking formation of 3-5-2 with Habib and Akeem Abolanle doing the much-needed job upfront. Salgaocar, with 22 points from 19 outings, however, are in a relatively comfort zone. Coach Savio Medeira, though, doesnt want it to be taken over by complacency. Its not that we are totally out of danger. Well play according to the need of the hour, he said on Friday. Medeira further pointed out that a point would be his primary aim but going for a win cant be ruled out either. Subratas dilemma Tollygunge have their task cut out on Saturday and so is it for Subrata Bhattacharya. The newly-appointed technical director of Mohun Bagan is sure to fix his eyes on Saturdays match as well since on it is depending a great deal about the fate of his own team. The three-time champions, just a point above Tollygunge, are also struggling to keep afloat in the NFL (along with another city outfit, Mohammedan Sporting, on 18). And Bhattacharyas dilemma has a lot to with the players sagging morale. It has reached such a low that the team, currently in practice, lost by a goal to an under-21 outfit in a practice match. Bhattacharya, however, made up with it by allowing the ball roll on for extra few minutes till Ashim Biswas equalised. The team is really in a bad shape because of continuous failures. The players seem to have forgotten the taste of winning. Its not a good sign particularly when we are preparing for the big match versus East Bengal (on Sunday), Bhattacharya observed. Meanwhile, East Bengal defender M. Suresh, who was admitted to a nursing home with high fever, remains weak and is unlikely to feature in the derby clash. Mahesh Gawli and Cristiano Junior are also doubtful starters on Sunday.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Late Akeem strike sinks Mohun Bagan
 - NFL - Tollygunge heap more misery on three-time champions  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Distraught Mohun Bagan captain Rennedy Singh after his teams 0-1 loss in the NFL match against Tollygunge Agragami at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The words  relegation and Mohun Bagan  do not always go hand in hand. But an Akeem Abolanle strike that led to a 0-1 loss for the green-and-maroon brigade in their 16th game of the National Football League against Tollygunge Agragami, might just have opened up a tricky corridor for the three-time champions. Nineteen points from 16 games are not the most comfortable tally, and with Tollygunge coming tantalisingly close on 17, things are not looking too rosy. The fact that Mohun Bagan have four away games in the last six (with two against Goa sides) may not help their cause either. Assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee agreed (coach Aloke Mukherjee skipped the press conference) that this is the worst Mohun Bagan side he has seen since his association with the club for over two decades. What else can he say when a team scores a total of five goals in eight matches! Jose Ramirez Barreto still remains Bagans top-scorer with five goals from eight games, while the others have struggled to match his tally in the remaining eight. Not the most exciting strike-rate, one must say! And it wasnt too different on Tuesday either as the Ashim Biswases and Sunil Chettris missed sitters galore that culminated in the back-to-back defeat for the glamour outfit. Mohun Bagan lost to Haywards Sporting in the previous match. Of course, the fact that such chances came their way doesnt mean the Bagan midfield was outstanding. Rennedy Singh was non-functional down the left and it was left to Mehtab Hossain to initiate the moves down the right. But Amitava Chandra kept a close eye on him, thus stopping his runs. Therefore, inroads had to be made down the middle, but this Mohun Bagan outfit does not have too many players who can do that on a consistent rate. It resulted in too many square passes in the middle-third, which was actually deterrent to forward movement. Mohun Bagan, however, got three free-kicks in the first session around the penalty area, but it seems Rennedy has lost the ability to curl them in. A host of flag-kicks also came about, but Ashim couldnt match Ebi Bar Bar and Isiaka Awoyemi in the air. Still, Ashim managed a couple of powerful shots, but the keeper Chinmoy Banerjee (who had to be replaced in the 51st minute with a muscle-strain) made excellent saves on both occasions. The cross-piece didnt help Mohun Bagans cause either. They managed a free-kick outside the penalty area in the 56th minute, but Noel Kasaks right-footer struck the woodwork. It seemed by then that the green-and-maroon brigade had resigned to fate and they failed miserably to penetrate the defensive wall of Tollygunge. The lower-ranked side was playing a counter-attack based game with Akeem as the single striker. He was there disturbing the Bagan defenders Leonardo Almeida and Harpreet Singh and it was a misunderstanding between the two that helped him clinch the winner in the 81st minute. The two faltered as an innocuous looking Amitava floater came in from the right and Akeem made space for himself to bang in the right-footer. I dont know whats going wrongI really do not have any explanation, Satyajit said after the match. Better they find out the problem soon, otherwise, things may just go out of hand. TEAMS Tollygunge Agragami: Chinmoy Banerjee (Samit Debnath 51), Kabijit Khotel, Isiaka Awoyemi, Ebi Bar Bar, Amitava Chanda, Napoleon Singh (Temzen Kaibang), Sujit Neogi, Sandip Das, Gautam Debnath (Sheikh Habeeb Ali, 56), Gouranga Dutta, Akeem Abolanle.

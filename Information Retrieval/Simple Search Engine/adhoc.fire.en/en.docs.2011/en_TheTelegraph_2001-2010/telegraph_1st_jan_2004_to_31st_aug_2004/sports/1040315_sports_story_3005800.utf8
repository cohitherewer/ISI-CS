Windies shot out for 47
- Harmison takes seven for 12 as England win by 10 wickets
 Tino Best celebrates his first-ever Test wicket in Kingston on Sunday. (Reuters) Kingston: Paceman Steve Harmison skittled out West Indies for their lowest-ever Test total to set up a 10-wicket victory for England in the first Test on Sunday. Harmison took seven for 12 in 12.3 overs as West Indies were bowled out for 47 in their second innings on the fourth day, leaving England needing just 20 to take a series lead. The visitors reached the victory target in just two overs, before lunch. The previous lowest Test total by West Indies was the 51 they made against Australia in Port of Spain in 1999. Resuming on eight for no wicket, West Indies were in disarray from the moment Graham Thorpe took a superb catch above his head in the slips off Harmison to remove opener Chris Gayle for nine. Ramnaresh Sarwan was unlucky to be adjudged leg-before for a duck and Shivnarine Chanderpaul played on, also for a duck, as the hosts slumped to 15 for three. Captain Brian Lara, with the little finger on his right hand heavily strapped after he dislocated it on Day II, failed to halt the slide. He also went for no score, easily caught by Andrew Flintoff at second slip off Matthew Hoggard. Devon Smith, who hit a century in the first innings, was next to go, brilliantly caught and bowled by Hoggard for 12 to leave Windies reeling on 21 for five. Ridley Jacobs hit a few lusty blows in a top-score of 15 but his cameo ended when he gloved a Harmison lifter to Nasser Hussain at short-leg. Harmison completed his second five-wicket haul in Tests by removing Tino Best for a duck, Simon Jones had Ryan Hinds caught behind for three and Harmison then quickly mopped up the last two wickets. It was hardly a target for the English batsmen as Marcus Trescothick (5 n.o.) and Michael Vaughan (11 n.o.) knocked off the runs in 2.3 overs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

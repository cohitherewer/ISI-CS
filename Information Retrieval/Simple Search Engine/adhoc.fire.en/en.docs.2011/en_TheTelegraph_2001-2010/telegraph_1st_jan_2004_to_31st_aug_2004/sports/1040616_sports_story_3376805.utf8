 Murali confirms pullout
	 - TOUR DOWN UNDER  Murali has cited personal reasons for his withdrawal Colombo: World record Test wicket-taker Muttiah Muralidharan confirmed his withdrawal from Sri Lankas tour of Australia on Tuesday following criticisms of his action. [That Murali was going to withdraw was indicated by a Sri Lanka board official on Monday night and was reported in Tuesdays Late City edition.] Muralidharan handed over a letter to the board president Mohan de Silva this morning, which said he would be unavailable for personal reasons, Sri Lanka Cricket media manager Ray Illangakoon said. The controversial and unorthodox off spinner had been considering whether to pull out of the two-Test trip starting this month after fresh doubts over his bowling culminated in Australian Prime Minister John Howard calling him a chucker. In a statement later, the Sri Lankan board said it was not surprised. Murali is undergoing tremendous pressure, the statement said. The executive committee, at its emergency meeting felt that it was their responsibility to safeguard Muralis career. The committee felt Murali needed a short break. Its obviously very disappointing, Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland said in Melbourne. In the last week we may have lost two of the main drawcards, with Shanes injury and now Murali making this announcement. Sutherland added: I dont know the personal reasons for which hes withdrawn. But hes made a decision and we respect that. He knows full well that Cricket Australia and the Australian players were very keen for him to come.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Sumathipala in hospital
Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala is in hospital and unable to appear in court to face charges of altering a passport for an alleged gangster, a lawyer said on Thursday. Sumathipala is accused of violating immigration rules in order to send Dammika Amarasinghe, who is wanted by police, to watch the 1999 World Cup in England. He is also accused of releasing 1,500 from the cricket boards accounts for Amarasinghes travel to England. He was to appear in court on Thursday to face charges. Sumathipalas lawyers submitted a medical certificate to a court here, saying he had been hospitalised on Tuesday after complaining of chest pain. On protest from state attorneys, Judge T.B. Boyagama ordered that Sumathipala be examined by a judicial medical officer and report to court on Monday.  (PTI)  Copyright

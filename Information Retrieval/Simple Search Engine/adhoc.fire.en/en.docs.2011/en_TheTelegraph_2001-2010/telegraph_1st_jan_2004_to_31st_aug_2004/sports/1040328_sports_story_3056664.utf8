The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jockey still critical
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Jockey Amjad Khans condition continues to be precarious after 24 hours since he had a fall from a horse at the RCTC races. A medical practitioner at the Woodlands nursing home, where he was rushed after the accident, informed that some tests have already been performed on the jockey. The CAT scan, that will be done Sunday afternoon, is likely to determine the gravity of his head injury and the future course of treatment. The jockey is on light sedation but still restless, said Boman Parakh, RCTC secretary.  Copyright

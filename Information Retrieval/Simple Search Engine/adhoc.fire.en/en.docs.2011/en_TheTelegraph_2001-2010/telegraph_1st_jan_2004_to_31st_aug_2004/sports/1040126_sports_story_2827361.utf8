The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachin to return in Perth
Canberra: Sachin Tendulkar, who missed Indias last four matches in the tri-series due to an ankle injury, said on Sunday he will return to the squad for the match against Australia in Perth on February 1. He ruled himself out of the exhibition match against the Presidents XI to be played here on Wednesday. I will not play that game but I should be fit for Perth, said Tendulkar. The little master has not been in action since January 19 when he made 86 against Australia despite hobbling on one leg after twisting his right ankle at the start of the innings. He has been gradually getting himself back to match fitness and even had an extended nets session on Saturday in Adelaide where his teammates were busy with the Zimbabwe match. Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh  the other two on the injured list  should also be fit for the final leg of the gruelling tour. The team was mobbed at its arrival at the Canberra airport and V.V.S. Laxman was the cynosure of all eyes. Security concerns The death of David Hookes has upset Australian players so much that they and are demanding extra security from Cricket Australia (CA). Players have expressed concern over their vulnerability to violent attacks while walking to and from nets. They have also demanded extra protection while walking back to the team bus after day-night matches. It has been learnt that the players recently met CA officials following which it was decided that players will no longer speak to the media at airports.  (PTI)  Copyright

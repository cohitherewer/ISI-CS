				 																																	n A Dutch rower at the Athens Olympics did what millions of people do every year, he left something in the back of a taxi. Diederik Simons case was more serious than most  he left behind his silver medal.				 																																	Thanks to an honest taxi driver, Simon will soon be reunited with the medal he won on Sunday as part of the Dutch mens eight. The driver found the medal in his cab after organisers put out an emergency call to track it down. The taxi driver deserves special praise for doing honour to his profession and his country, Games spokesman Serafim Kotrotsos said on Wednesday.				 																																	n Triple Olympic champion Catalina Ponor was hailed as the new gymnastics queen by Romanian media as the triumphant squad returned home on Wednesday. The Romanian women won four of the six golds up for grab in the competition, including the team event for the second successive Olympics. 				 																																	Ponor also won on the balance beam before tumbling her way to victory on the floor to become the most successful gymnast at the Athens Games with three gold medals. Her teammate Monica Rosu was the only other multiple gold medallist gymnast after somersaulting to victory from the vault. 				 																																	n Eric the Eel Moussambani dreamt of Olympic glory in Greece. Instead he watches the Athens action from a dingy bar in coup-prone Equatorial Guinea, his remote African home. I would much rather be over there, this makes me very sad, said Moussambani, 24, his eyes fixed on television images of athletes competing in the Olympic stadium as he munches a chunky sandwich and sips fruit juice. 				 																																	Moussambani, who shot to fame and earned his nickname by swimming extremely slowly at the Sydney Games four years ago, did not make it to Athens because officials in his country lost a photograph they needed to get him authorised to compete. This has discouraged me, it has broken me, the despondent swimmer said.				 																																	n The Athens Olympics will cost a total of almost 10 billion euros ($12.09 billion), more than double the original target, pushing Greeces budget gap well above EU limits, finance ministry sources said on Wednesday. The original Games budget was set at 4.6 billion euros, but a rising security bill and overruns in construction costs have prompted several upward revisions in recent months. quot;The estimate is that the total cost of the Olympic Games will be close to 10 billion euros, mainly due to overruns in spending, quot; the official, who declined to be named, said. quot;For example, the costs of security will exceed the 1 billion euro target, quot; he said.				 																																	n If you picture an Olympic team as athletes in track-suits with a few blazer-clad types in the background to look after them, it is time for a radical rethink. Forty-five national delegations at the Athens Games contain more officials than athletes, according to figures issued by the Olympic organisers. Some have sent two, three or more blazers for every competitor. 				 																																	Even in many teams where athletes outnumber officials, it is not by much. Only 61 of the 202 national delegations have two-thirds or more of their ranks filled with athletes. Team officials get free travel to Athens plus board and lodging in the Olympic Village, paid for by the IOC or the Greek Games organisers.				 																																	n To the Olympic victors go the spoils, the gold medals and the lucrative shoe contracts, but no one remembers who came in last. Until now. A Canadian writer, web designer, snake breeder and self confessed professional smart ass has dedicated himself to immortalising the gallant Athens loser in cyberspace, in a celebration of true Olympic spirit.				 																																	I worry that were adopting a patronising attitude towards last-place finishers, especially if theyre from little countries like Sco Tomi or Mongolia, said Jonathan Crowe. The world is guilty of patting them on the head for participating and not taking them seriously.				 																																	n Greece waited 108 years to host another Olympic Games. Unfortunately it came just as a boom in world metal prices has sent the cost of winners medals through the stadium roof. At approximately $400,000 for the metal content of the 3,000 Athens medals alone, it may be just a drop in the Aegean Sea compared to an estimated $8.6 billion total Games cost. But cost-conscious organisers can hardly have expected that the price of gold would increase approximately 45 per cent since the summer Games in Sydney four years ago, or that silver would go up 35 per cent and copper  the key metal in bronze  would cost 42 per cent higher than in 2000.				 																																	n American Misty May sprinkled her mothers ashes over the beach volleyball court on Tuesday after winning the gold medal at the Athens Olympics. Mays mother, her biggest fan, died two years ago and May had always wanted her there when she and teammate Kerri Walsh went for gold, beating Brazil in the final. 				 																																	Everybody elses family is here, why couldnt I bring my family? said May when asked why she sprinkled the ashes. May said her father brought the ashes with him to Athens. May returned to the game two weeks before the Olympics after being sidelined since June by an abdominal injury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gunners battle to the top
London: Arsenal returned to the top of the Premier League with a hard-fought 2-1 home win over Manchester City on Sunday (as reported in Mondays Late City edition) as Chelsea kept up the pressure on the leaders with a 3-2 victory at Blackburn Rovers. An own goal by City defender Michael Tarnat and a sumptuous late strike by Thierry Henry left Arsenal two points ahead of Manchester United, with Chelsea just four points further back in third place following Glen Johnsons spectacular winner. The Gunners dominated a rain-swept match at Highbury and broke the deadlock after 39 minutes when Henrys teasing cross was turned in from close range by Tarnat, under pressure from Freddie Ljungberg. City, without a victory in 12 Premier League games and lying 15th in the table, defended bravely but rarely threatened Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. Arsenals new Spanish striker Jose Antonio Reyes made his debut as a 70th-minute substitute following his 17 million transfer from Sevilla. He almost made an immediate impact but his goal-bound effort was well smothered by City keeper David James before Henry clinched victory five minutes from time with a curling a shot into the top corner of the net from the edge of the penalty area. Citys French striker Nicolas Anelka pulled a goal back in the dying seconds but was immediately sent off against his former club following an altercation with Ashley Cole as he tried to retrieve the ball from the Arsenal defender. It was a tough game because you dont expect Manchester City to play like that, very focussed on the defensive side of their game, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. I am very happy to win what was a very physical match, the Frenchman added. Chelsea looked to have been denied a deserved victory when Blackburn substitute Paul Gallagher equalised with three minutes remaining, only for Johnson to lash an unstoppable half-volley into the roof of the net from the edge of the penalty area. It was very important for us to win to keep up with Arsenal and Manchester United, Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri said. We worked very hard but we must learn to finish matches off.

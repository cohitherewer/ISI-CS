 Akram in legal mess
 Wasim Akram arrives for a court hearing in Karachi on Thursday. (AFP) Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has landed in a legal mess after a Karachi court Thursday withdrew the anticipatory bail granted to him in connection with a criminal case involving the ownership of a jeep, which he claimed to have been gifted by a friend. Akram was in Karachi shooting for a TV programme when the court withdrew the bail, his father-in-law, Mufti Humayun said. Akrams lawyer as well as his wife Huma, who resides in Lahore, have denied reports that the former fast bowler was arrested. They said the court has only withdrawn the bail. Efforts were on to get a bail from the high court. The bail order related to a criminal case filed by Akrams friend and admirer, Shahadat Khan, who claimed that Akram has taken his jeep and refused to give it back. Akrams family said the jeep was given as a gift in recognition of his bowling exploits. Akram renovated the jeep and was using it for the last several months.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Birthday-boy Safin stuns Roddick 
 - Russian sets up semis date with Agassi l Henin-Hardenne gets past sluggish Davenport  Marat Safin after  winning a point against Andy Roddick in Melbourne on  Tuesday. Safin won 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (0-7), 6-4 to  move into the semi-finals. (AFP) Melbourne: Russian Marat Safin stunned world No.1 Andy Roddick 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (0-7), 6-4 at the Australian Open on Tuesday to set up a semi-final showdown with defending champion Andre Agassi. Safin, who has slipped down the world rankings to 86 after missing most of last year with injury, pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament with a breathtaking display on his 24th birthday. I started to miss tennis actually, thats why Im playing so good, Safin said. Roddick, 21, made a flying start, snatching the first set in just 26 minutes, but Safin hit back to produce his finest performance since he beat Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final. The match was dominated by powerful serving and ferocious groundstrokes but both players also showed glimpses of their more subtle skills, volleying, lobbing and chipping for points. Roddick went into the match as strong favourite after cruising into the quarter finals without dropping a set, while Safin had played three four-setters and a five-setter. The American made a perfect start when he broke Safins first service game, then saved two break points against him in the fifth game. Roddick broke again in the sixth game as Safin struggled to find his rhythm. The Russian pulled one back in the seventh but dropped his next service game to concede the opening set. Unperturbed, Safin made a better start to the second set, breaking Roddick in the third game as the American started to lose his composure. Roddick began to venture away from the baseline in the third but still could not break Safins serve and threw the set away when he was broken in the 12th game. Games went with serve in the fourth set before Roddick won the tiebreak 7-0 to square the match at two sets all. Safin saved two break points in the final set before pouncing on a mistake by Roddick to break him for a 5-4 lead. He again to had to fend off two break points but regained his composure to serve out and seal a stupendous victory. Injuries wreak havoc Earlier, injuries wreaked havoc at the Australian Open on Tuesday, causing one quarter final to be scrapped and deciding another amid a flood of French tears. Womens fourth seed Amelie Mauresmo broke down and wept early in the morning when she realised she would not be able to play her match against Colombias Fabiola Zuluaga because of a back injury. Zuluaga got a walkover through to the semis  a first for any Colombian, man or woman  where she will meet top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne on Thursday. The Belgians superior fitness, patience and self-belief lifted her past a sluggish Lindsay Davenport. Having taken an early 4-0 lead, American Davenport wilted under the Melbourne sun, losing 7-5, 6-3. In the mens field, the injury jinx also struck Frances Sebastien Grosjean. The ninth seed was forced to limp out of his match with Andre Agassi after straining a groin muscle. Agassi had been leading 6-2, 2-0 when Grosjean informed the chair umpire that he could not continue. Frances Mauresmo was inconsolable after being forced to pull out. A finalist here in 1999, she practised early on Tuesday morning under the roof to test a back muscle injury. On Monday, the Australia Day fireworks fizzed and died as local favourites Lleyton Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis were brought to their knees in the fourth round. Hewitts dreams were shredded 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 by an inspired Roger Federer and Philippoussis game was cut to ribbons by the rapier-like groundstrokes of Moroccos Hicham Arazi. Federer, who is in the quarter finals here for the first time, will meet Argentine eighth seed David Nalbandian for a place in the semis. Nalbandian beat fellow-Argentine Guillermo Canas 6-4, 6-2, 6-1. Arazis 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 upset of the 10th seed was an unpalatable appetiser for an Australian crowd hoping to celebrate their annual national holiday in style. The Belgian second seed stayed on track for her first Grand Slam title, beating Italys Silvia Farina Elia 6-3, 6-3. She will next play Anastasia Myskina after the Russian beat ninth seed Chanda Rubin 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-2. French schoolgirl Tatiana Golovins amazing run at the first Grand Slam of the year came to an end. American Lisa Raymond thrashed the 16-year-old 6-2, 6-0.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

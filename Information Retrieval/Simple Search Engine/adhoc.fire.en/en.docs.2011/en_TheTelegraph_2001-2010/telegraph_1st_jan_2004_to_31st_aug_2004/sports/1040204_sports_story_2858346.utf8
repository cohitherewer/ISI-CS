 ICC refuses comment
London: The ICC Tuesday said it would not comment on either the authenticity or content of the letters allegedly written by its Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) chief Lord Paul Condon to the PCB. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said any correspondence between the ACU and member countries on corruption issues is private and confidential and hence the ICC would not make any comment on the letters quoted by Pakistan daily The News. It is not appropriate for the ICC to comment one way or the other on these letters or any other issue in relation to potential operational matters for the anti-corruption and security unit, Speed said in a press release. He, however, said the ICC would ensure that the game is never tainted again. What I can say is that the ICC is committed to ensuring that the game is never again tainted by corruption and that through the anti-corruption and security unit it now has in place a professional security and investigative team with the resources to deal with this threat. According to The News, Lord Condon had voiced his concern over the activities of some Pakistan cricketers in two letters he wrote to the PCB. The letters also suggested that the Pakistan team may have under-performed in two one-day tournaments in Morocco and Kenya in 2002.  (PTI)  Copyright

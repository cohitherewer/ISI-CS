The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India favourites, says Waqar
Hyderabad: Pakistani fast bowling great Waqar Younis on Thursday tagged India as favourites to win the Asia Cup, saying his team would have to struggle hard to wriggle out of poor form. Waqar, here for a promotional campaign for broadcasters ESPN-Star Sports, said India had performed well in Australia and Pakistan and if they carried the same form to Sri Lanka, the venue for Asia Cup competition beginning on July 16, they would be simply unstoppable. India are favourites to win the Asia Cup. They played well in Australia and Pakistan. If they play like that in Sri Lanka, there is no way to beat them, he said. On the prospects of Pakistan, he said: At present they are a relatively new side. I cant say about their prospects. They would have to struggle hard. Asked to name his favourite Indian cricketer, he said, All of them are good but Rahul Dravids defence is superb. Defence makes a big difference. Waqar agreed that one-day cricket is not helpful to bowlers. I did not get any help from the pitches in one-dayers for the 15 years that I played. Pitches are made for batsmen because people like to see fours and sixes.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pitch holds the key

(AFP) Hamilton: The desert-like look of the Hamilton pitch amid a sea of lush green grass has dominated talk leading up to the first Test between New Zealand and South Africa starting on Wednesday. Neither captain Stephen Fleming of New Zealand nor Graeme Smith of South Africa was sure how the pitch would play and may have to settle for the groundsman Karl Johnsons analysis, such as it is. With record rainfalls during February of 332 mm in Hamilton, compared with an average of 67mm, Johnson has had to move the pitch to the far western side of the block to ensure the Test stayed in Hamilton. Its never had a match on it so theres no history, Johnson said.It wont crack or break up either, so I dont expect it to take much spin. Smith said he hoped it was a good Test wicket, despite its appearance. You have to make a judgement call and you hope at the end of the day the judgement call is right. The Test has been ushered in with a war of words begun by Fleming and continued by South Africa vice-captain and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Meanwhile, New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns and South African rival Shaun Pollock will start on Wednesday knowing they could both make the elite 3000-run, 300-wicket double. Teams (from) New Zealand: Stephen Fleming (captain), Mark Richardson, Michael Papps, Scott Styris, Craig McMillan, Chris Cairns, Jacob Oram, Brendon McCullum, Daniel Vettori, Paul Wiseman, Michael Mason, Daryl Tuffey, Chris Martin. South Africa: Graeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Jacques Rudolph, Gary Kirsten, Neil McKenzie, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Nicky Boje, Paul Adams, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel, David Terbrugge.

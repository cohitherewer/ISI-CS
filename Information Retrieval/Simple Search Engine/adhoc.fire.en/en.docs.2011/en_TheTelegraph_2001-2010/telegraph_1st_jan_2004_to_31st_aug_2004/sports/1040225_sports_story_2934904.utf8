The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lanka edge out SA
Dhaka: Sri Lanka defeated South Africa by 29 runs in Dhaka on Tuesday to throw open the Super League group I in the ICC under-19 World Cup. Batting first after winning the toss, Sri Lankas Upul Tharanga dominated from the start to score 117. He was well-supported by Nadeera Nawala (56) and Gihan de Silva (42). South African bowlers were erratic in their line and length, a far cry from their performance against India. Chamith Kulasekara thumped 32 off 14 balls in the final overs and the Lankans posted an impressive 277 for the loss of five wickets in 50 overs. In their reply, South Africa made a bad start as Lankan skipper Farveez Mahroof and Manoj Chanaka picked up a wicket each in the first five overs. But Jaco Booysen led a spirited fightback and South Africa reached 200 in 39.4 overs, with Booysen closing in on the second century of the match. With his wicket though, the Proteas resistance ended in the 49th over. It was our batting that won the match today, Lanka coach D. S. de Silva said. We made a big score for the first time and we will now look to be positive in the group decider against India, he said. The superb allround display and spirit shown by the South African youngsters in their last game was absent today and that made the difference as the Lankans made full use of the opportunities that came their way. Lanka next meet India in a match to decide the semi-finalist from this group. India today beat West Indies. BRIEF SCORES Sri Lanka 277/5 in 50 ovs (U. Tharanga 117; Africa 3/49). South Africa 248 in 48.3 ovs (J. Booysen 120; 4/49). Sri Lanka won by 29 runs.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

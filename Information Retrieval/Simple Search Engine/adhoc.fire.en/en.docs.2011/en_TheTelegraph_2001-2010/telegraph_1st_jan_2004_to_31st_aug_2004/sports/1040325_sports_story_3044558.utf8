The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cunning, Hanrahan look strong
 - Mukesh and Digvijay lead Indian challenge  Defending champion Mike Cunning loves the course New Delhi: On the left of the entrance at the Delhi Golf Club, a billboard proudly informs the visitors of the variety of birds that can be spotted at one of the oldest golf courses in the country. The Indian griffon vulture, the drango, the common peafowl, the roseringed parakeet  you name it, you have it. But if the ad tells us about the richness of fauna, it also indicates how tough is the par-72 course. Which is why, the Royal Challenge-sponsored Indian Open, the flagship event of the Indian Golf Union starting here Thursday, is considered one of the toughest on the Asian tour. The narrow fairways surrounded by dense bushes severely punish the slightest of driving errors, meaning those relying on power are not guaranteed of a top finish. No wonder, Clay Devers, the 36-year old from the US with four Asian Tour titles under his belt, has not won once in his seven visits so far. I dont have a good driver, he says, with a chuckle. The greens here are also one of the toughest, I always struggle with my putting. This also explains why Mike Cunning, the defending champion, cherishes his last years title the most. I love the course, it suits my style and I am not a power golfer, says the 46-year old from America who has been playing at the tournament since 1981. Gaurav Ghei, who won in 1995 when the Open became an Asian PGA event for the first time, sums it up aptly: There is no home advantage here. It is how you play on the day that counts. The key here is to keep the ball in play. At other major tournaments, you can hit a lot of wild shots but not here, Ghei says. Yet, the beauty of the course has kept the international pros coming back year after year. This years edition, with a prize money of Rs 1.38 crore has attracted 156 participants, including 50 Indians. The home challenge will be led by Mukesh Kumar and Digvijay Singh who is in good form this season. The 37-year old Mukesh from Mhow has won two titles on the Indian tour in 2003-04 and will be aiming for top placing, which is also likely to give him the champion golfer of the year trophy for the fifth time straight. Diggy played in the World Cup in the US this year and then flew in straight to Kathmandu to pocket the Surya Nepal Masters. The major threat for the hosts will be from Greg Hanrahan of the US, Boonchu Ruangkit of Thailand and another American, Edward Michaels. Hanrahan, who will be teeing off with Digvijay, finished second at last weeks Caltex Masters in Singapore and is currently placed sixth on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. Ruangkit won the Thailand Open in February while Michaels annexed the Philippines Open and also has the experience of playing on the nation-wide tour. (PTI)  Copyright

 Kunte slips to fifth spot
Hastings: GM Abhijit Kunte was held to a draw by IM Daniel Gormally of England in the seventh round of the Hastings International Chess Congress on Sunday. With this, Kunte slipped to the fifth position on 3.5, half-a-point ahead of GM Mark Hebden of England and 14-year-old IM Kateryna Lahno of Ukraine. Russian GM Vladimir Epishin maintained his slender half point lead after settling for a hard fought draw with his main contender GM Vasilios Kotronias of Cyprus. The second position is shared by Kotronias and GM Jonathan Rowson of Scotland with 4.5 points each while defending champion GM Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark moved up to the fourth spot on four points. After two quick draws, Kunte appeared determined for a showdown with Gormally but the Englishman responded well against Kuntes Pet Sicilian. The middle game was fiercer and Kunte decided to part with his queen for two pieces, getting enough compensation in terms of piece-play in the bargain. Gormally tried to make some headway on the king side and looked threatening but Kunte warded off his threats in style, eventually sacrificing his bishop to get an impregnable position against the queen. The peace treaty was signed after 54 moves. Kotronias gave it everything even though Epishin was quite up to the task in tackling a dangerous looking attack. The middle game, arising out of a Sicilian Paulsen where the Russian played black, gave Kotronias some advantage but Epishin managed to exchange pieces in tandem, thereby keeping the balance. A level rook endgame was reached and the game ended in a draw after 44 moves. Rowson caught up with Kotronias after punishing a rather lacklustre attack by Hebden who played white. The opening was a shift from the normal variation in the Grunfeld by Hebden and his attack in the end only proved optical while Rowson picked up one pawn after another to reach a winning endgame. Hebden resigned after 45 moves.  (PTI)  Copyright

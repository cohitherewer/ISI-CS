The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real bow 2-3 to Zaragoza 
	 - Kings cup final  Luciano Galletti curls the ball past the Real Madrid wall for Real Zaragozas matchwinner in Barcelona on Thursday. (Reuters) Barcelona: Real Madrids wretched record in the Kings Cup was extended for yet another season when they were dealt a fifth defeat in six final appearances by Real Zaragoza. The unfancied Zaragoza left Reals dreams of a treble in tatters after they fought their way back from a goal behind and a man down to claim a thrilling 3-2 extra-time win in one of the most memorable finals in recent years on Wednesday. It seems that the Kings Cup just isnt for us, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez said on Wednesday. Weve lost too many finals now and this one really hurts especially because of the tremendous effort we made this time. When I saw the King (Juan Carlos) after the game he told me that wed just have to try again next year. Two years ago Deportivo Coruna stunned Real in the final by gate-crashing their 100th birthday party celebrations and making off with the silverware after a surprise 2-1 victory at the Bernabeu. This time Real were determined to set the record straight and claim their first victory in the domestic knock-out competition in 11 years, but they had not reckoned on an inspired performance from opponents Zaragoza. Despite falling behind to a superbly struck free kick from David Beckham, Victor Munozs team never wavered and battled their way into a 2-1 lead by the break thanks to a well taken strike from Dani and a penalty from fellow forward David Villa. A thundering free kick from Roberto Carlos allowed Real to draw level early in the second half, but despite the dismissal of defender Cani 23 minutes from the end of normal time, Zaragoza continued to match their opponents. Argentine midfielder Luciano Galletti sealed a famous upset with a pin-point strike from outside the area nine minutes from the end of extra time. We were devastated, said Beckham after the match. Once they went down to 10 men we thought we had the advantage, but we just couldnt make it tell. Its no consolation that it was a great game. For Zaragoza, victory was that much sweeter because of the difficult season they have had since their return to the Primera Liga. We can enjoy this trophy much more because it was a turn up for the books, said midfielder David Generelo. Everyone knew that Real were the overwhelming favourites, but we knew we had to play to our strengths and we did just that.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Big teams to miss top guns
Hong Kong: Injuries and the Athens Olympics are threatening to deprive the Asian Cup of star quality ahead of the prestigious tournaments kick-off in China next week. Several of the leading contenders for the 16-team tournament  Asias equivalent of the European Championships or Copa America  will head to China missing key players. Japans Italy-based former Asian Footballer of the Year Hidetoshi Nakata and Fulham midfielder Junichi Inamoto, who suffered a broken leg in a friendly against England last month, head the list of stars ruled out by injury. But while Nakata and Inamoto will miss the tournament for fitness reasons, many of the other absences are self-inflicted. Defending champions Japan and South Korea are both attaching equal importance to Augusts Olympic football tournament, poaching players from their Asian Cup squads to bolster their under-23 teams for Athens. The Japanese, who face Iran, Thailand and Oman in the first round of the Asian Cup, have weakened their squad by insisting that Feyenoords Shinji Ono and SV Hamburgs Naohiro Takahara play in Greece. South Korea have followed suit. Yoo Sang-chul and midfielder Song Chong-gug, both veterans of the Koreans 2002 World Cup campaign when they reached the semi-finals, will play in Athens instead of China. Uzbekistan, who face 2000 runners-up Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Turkmenistan in group C, are another side struggling with missing players. Russia-based players Victor Karpenko and Vladimir Maminov are both doubtful, with the former putting club commitments first and Maminov facing an operation on a heel injury. Meanwhile, star striker Maksim Shatskikh, who plays for Dynamo Kiev, is reportedly reluctant to travel to China and has remained in Ukraine. Thailand are faced with losing their inspirational skipper. Kiatisuk Zico Senamuang has reportedly withdrawn from the squad with fellow Vietnam-based internationals Dusit Chalersman and Tawan Sripan, all three citing tiredness after a long season.

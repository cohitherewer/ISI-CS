The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Back to my best, says Venus
 Venus hopes to put recent upsets behind her Stanford: Former world number one Venus Williams will be aiming to win her third Bank of West Classic title this week and insists she is back in peak condition. Top seed Venus will play her first match Wednesday against fellow American Lindsay Lee-Waters and the four-times Grand Slam champion is hoping to put the recent upsets behind her. The 24-year-old feels shes in peak condition for the first time in a year and is ready to challenge for the top again. I feel like I am at that level but I havent performed or havent had the opportunity to perform at my optimum ability, said the former world number one. I have to put myself in that position again. Venus suffered her earliest defeat at Wimbledon for seven years when she was stunned by Croatian teenager Karolina Sprem 6-7, 6-7 in the second round. Im used to winning and being in the finals, said Venus, who won Wimbledon in 2000 and 2001 before finishing runner-up to younger sister Serena the following two years. I feel like Im a better player than that and know that Im better than that result. I know that when it comes to the abilities I have, no one on tour can match that. Although Venus has won two titles this year, her performance at the Grand Slams has been under par. Venus blames part of her lacklustre form on a series of injuries. She missed the second half of last season with an abdominal strain while this year, she has sprained her ankle twice. At the French, I couldnt keep the ball in against Myskina and didnt play that well the whole time there, the world number 15 said. Against Sprem, I took my eye off the ball, which is a no-no. Its a simple thing that can hit you the hardest. Venus had reached the semi-finals of at least one Grand Slam since she started competing at the majors in 1997. Having failed to progress beyond the quarter finals at the three Grand Slams in 2004, Venus could end up suffering her worst season if she fails to live up to her own high expectations at next months US Open.

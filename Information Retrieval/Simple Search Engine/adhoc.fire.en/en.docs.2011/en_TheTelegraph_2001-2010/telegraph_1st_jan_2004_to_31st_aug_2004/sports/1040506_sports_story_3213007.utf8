The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. still in relegation scare
Margao: Mohammedan Sporting staged a superb rally in the second half to hold Haywards Sporting to a 2-2 draw in an eighth National Football League match on Wednesday. After Dipendu Biswas neutralised Haywards Abdulateef Serikis first half strike, Haywards skipper Dudu Omagemi, who missed an open chance in the first half, again put his team lead in the 56th minute. But Mohammedan, who were often caught in the off side trap in the first half, fought back and restored parity in the 69th minute through substitute Sheikh Sanjib. The draw took Mohammedan Sportings tally to just 19 points from 20 matches and the Calcutta team still has to win both their last two matches to avoid relegation. Haywards moved to sixth place with 27 points from 21 matches. The heavy downpour in the first half made things difficult for the players to adjust themselves. Haywards, who held the ball possession most of the time, had more scoring opportunities and drew the first blood in the 16th minute when a cross from Francis Andrade from the left into the box for Seriki who drove the ball into the net with an angular shot. Mohammedan played with more determination in the second half to restore parity in the 54th minute through a penalty. Syed Rahim Nabi, who was moving the ball inside the box, was brought down by Haywards defender Vincent Pires and referee Balu awarded the penalty which was converted by Dipendu. But two minutes later, Haywards again took the lead when referee Balu gave a penalty after Amjad Ali Khan brought down Dudu Omagbemi inside the box who himself converted it. Mohammedan Sporting, who knew that a win is must to avoid relegation, made all out efforts and restored parity. A move from the middle saw Bewan Joshi back heeling to seek Sanjib, who after seeing keeper Sarfaraz Ansari leaving his charge to thwart him, took a shot at the goal. Defender Louis Aniweta tried to put the ball out of danger but failed to prevent the ball going into the net instead banged himself on the post and got injured. (PTI)  Copyright

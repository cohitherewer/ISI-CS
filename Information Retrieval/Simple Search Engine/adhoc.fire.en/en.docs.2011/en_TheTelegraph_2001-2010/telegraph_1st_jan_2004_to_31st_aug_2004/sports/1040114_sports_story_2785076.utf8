 Anand draws, stays joint leader
Wijk aan Zee: Viswanthan Anand settled for another easy draw with local hope Loek van Wely and maintained joint lead at the end of Round III of the Corus chess championship here on Tuesday. Anand, GM Peter Leko of Hungary and Russian champion Peter Svidler share the lead with an identical score of two points from three games and are likely to be joined by GM Alexei Shirov of Spain in the lead. The day featured only one decisive game with Svidler striking it big against 2002 champion and compatriot Evgeny Bareev. Anand had no troubles yet again with black. In the Capablanca Variation of the Nimzo Indian, van Wely went for an extensively analysed endgame that apparently gives little trouble to the second player. Anand, an exponent of Nimzo, got the equality with effortless manoeuvres and settled for the truce in just 21 moves. Quite significantly, Svidler played the shortest game of the day. And still it yielded him the maximum. Bareev was at his wits end in tackling his national champ as he was crushed in no time. Svidlers play was exemplary. Up against a Rubenstein as white, Svidler had a new plan on hand where Bareev simply failed to produce the best defence. Opening up the centre at the right time, Svidler won in just 17 moves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ronaldo for another perfect year
 Ronaldo Madrid: After a near-perfect 2003, Brazilian ace Ronaldo says he hopes for more of the same in the New Year: lots of goals, trophies and no injuries. Ronaldo, who scored a stunning 42 goals in 56 matches over the last 12 months, leads Real Madrid in their first match of 2004 on Saturday against lowly Murcia. Madrid are top of the Primera Division standings with 39 points from 17 matches, two points ahead of their nearest challengers, Valencia. Besides being the leagues most prolific scorer with 14 goals in the current season, Ronaldo also helped Madrid win the league title and the Spanish Supercup. And, perhaps even more importantly for him, he only missed two matches through injury. 2003 has been magnificent, if only for the fact that I had no injuries, Ronaldo told the leading sports daily Marca. In 2004, I want the same again... As well as the Champions League. The Champions League, which Madrid has won nine times, is one of the few trophies that have so far eluded the striker. For Saturdays match, Madrid can count on recovered midfielders David Beckham and Jose Maria Guti Gutierrez, both of whom missed the teams last game of 2003 against Mallorca through injury. Ailing Murcia will be looking to the services of its new goalkeeper Roberto Bonano, who comes on loan from Barcelona after a disastrous six months with the Catalan club. Ive had a tough six months and Im taking this opportunity very eagerly, said the Argentine. Im sure we can stay in the first division. Second-place Valencia look to have a tough battle on their hands Sunday when they host regional rivals Villarreal, a provincial club that has stormed into fifth place with sparkling performances from two other Barcelona rejects, Argentine Juan Roman Riquelme and Brazilian Sonny Anderson. No. 3 Deportivo de la Coruna, who lie lies six points behind Madrid, face an equally tough match when they travel down the coast Saturday to meet Celta de Vigo, which is currently floundering at No. 17.

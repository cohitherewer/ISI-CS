 Tyson heads for July 31 comeback
 Tyson is still very popular despite mediocre shows in the recent past Las Vegas: Mike Tyson has a date, a trainer and an opponent of sorts for his first fight in more than a year. Unlike his last comeback, he also has a wide-open heavyweight division in front of him. Tysons manager, Shelly Finkel, said on Thursday that the former champion probably will return to the ring on July 31 against journeyman Kevin Mcbride. Finkel said negotiations were continuing over a site and possible pay-per-view broadcast. We should have something definite by next week, Finkel said. Theres a lot of anticipation for him to come back. The fight would be the first for Tyson since February 22, 2003, when he knocked out Clifford Etienne in 49 seconds in Memphis, Tennessee. That was supposed to be the first of a series of comeback bouts for Tyson, who was stopped by Lennox Lewis in the eighth round of his previous fight. But Tyson hasnt been in the ring since, and until recently said he wasnt sure if he wanted to fight again. With the heavyweight division lacking a big-name champion following the retirement of Lewis, however, the 37-year-old Tyson apparently has the itch. Im totally confident about that, Finkel said, referring to Tysons desire to fight. Tyson has been a fixture in recent months at boxing cards and drew more applause than the main event boxers when he showed up earlier this month at Madison Square Garden for heavyweight title fights involving Chris Byrd and John Ruiz. Byrd, Ruiz, Vitali Klitschko and Lamon Brewster all hold portions of the heavyweight title, though there is no dominant fighter in the division. That increases the attractiveness of Tyson, who still has a huge fan base despite his mediocre performances in recent years. Tyson seemed reluctant to come back when Lewis was still fighting, perhaps because he had a rematch clause with the former champion who gave him a beating in their June 2002 fight. With Lewis gone, though, the road to the top suddenly got a lot easier. I think he can beat any of the four guys out there that are champions, said Freddie Roach, who trained Tyson for the Etienne fight. He just needs to have discipline and get in shape. Roach said he will train Tyson again, beginning next month. Tyson quit training a week before the Etienne fight because of a dispute with TV broadcaster Showtime over the money he would be paid, though he said at the time he was ill. Roach said he didnt think he would have any problems over whether Tyson wants to train. After beating Corrie Sanders to win the WBC title last week, Klitschko said he wanted to fight Tyson. But it appears Tyson will take few chances in his latest comeback.  (AP)  Copyright

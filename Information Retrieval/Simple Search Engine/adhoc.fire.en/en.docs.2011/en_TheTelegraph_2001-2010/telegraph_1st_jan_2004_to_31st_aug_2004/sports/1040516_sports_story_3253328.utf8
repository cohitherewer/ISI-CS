The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A boy for Arjun Atwal 
 BY SUJIT BHAR Atwal has named his son KrishenCalcutta, May 15: When he started off in the USPGA, the only Indian ever to do so, he made the cut in four consecutive events. And if Arjun Atwal had missed the cut in six of the last six, there was good reason for it. He was preparing for the big news: a baby. At 12.57 in Orlandos (Florida) Friday afternoon, Arjuns wife Ritika gave birth to a very healthy boy who has immediately been named Krishen by the father. Arjun, surely the best golfer this country has produced, was preparing for this moment from the day he reached the US, having graduated from the qualifying school. His jet-setting lifestyle clashes pretty much with his family bondings. Even his mother Rupinder Kaur as well as his mother-in-law are in Orlando, helping the couple with their wisdom. Arjuns father, H.S. Atwal, is still in India, now in Hyderabad, taking on behalf of his son an award for one of the best sportspersons of the country. In New Delhi we came to know (about the baby) at 11.30pm yesterday, he said, it is great news to be a grandfather. Last few months I was mainly focussed on my baby and wife, Arjun told The Telegraph and its all come together now, my game, my family, kid. A great feeling. He takes next week off the tour. The week after Arjun travels to Memphis, playing in the FedEx St Jude Classic (May 24-30). That is before the big one, in Ohio, starting the week after next. This is simply called the Memorial Tournament, to be played in Muirfield Village, Dublin, Ohio. But you require an invitation from Jack Nicklaus to be able to take part in this, said Arjun. And I have an invitation to play there. He will be back only after the Tour gets over in November, and back home means Calcutta, he insists. Ive had enough of New Delhi.  Copyright

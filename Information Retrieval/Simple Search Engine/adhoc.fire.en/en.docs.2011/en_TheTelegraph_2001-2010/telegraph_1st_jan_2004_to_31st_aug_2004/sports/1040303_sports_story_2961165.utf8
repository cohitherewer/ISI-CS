 Ronaldo for Real till 2008
 - Were going to look into something to tie me for life to the Spanish club  Ronaldo is delighted with the deal Madrid: Ronaldo has agreed to extend his contract with Real Madrid by two years to the end of the 2007-2008 season, the Spanish club announced on Tuesday. Im delighted, Ronaldo told Reals website. There were grave doubts about my signing at first but little by little Ive demonstrated that Im worthy of a team like Real Madrid. The 27-year-old Brazilian forward moved to Real from Inter Milan for 45 million euros in 2002, signing a four-year deal with an option for one further season. Real announced on Tuesday that the two parties had agreed to prolong the contract for two further years. Ronaldo, who has been the subject of speculation linking him with future moves to England or back to Italy, offered a broad hint that he could extend his contract still further at Real. Were going to look into something to tie me for life with Real Madrid, a club that inspires passion throughout the world, he said. Ronaldo is the second of Reals world-renowned players, the so-called galacticos, to agree to a new longer-term deal following Zinedine Zidanes decision last month to extend his contract to 2007. Spanish players Raul, Guti and Michel Salgado have also signed new contracts recently as part of the clubs strategy to keep the first team squad as stable as possible. Were trying to maintain the nucleus of the side for years to come, Real director Emilio Butragueno told the club website. This is great news for Real Madrid fans. As a goalscoring centre-forward, Ronaldo is the best in the world, without a doubt. Ronaldo emerged from four years of career-threatening injury problems to help Brazil to victory in the World Cup in 2002, scoring two goals in the final to finish the tournament as top scorer with eight. After a protracted transfer battle, he secured his move to Real and enjoyed an outstanding first season, scoring 23 league goals to lead his side to the league title. He was named Fifas World Player of the Year for the third time in 2002. Ronaldo is comfortably the leading scorer in the Primera Liga this season, with his 22 goals helping Real build an eight-point lead at the top of the table.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

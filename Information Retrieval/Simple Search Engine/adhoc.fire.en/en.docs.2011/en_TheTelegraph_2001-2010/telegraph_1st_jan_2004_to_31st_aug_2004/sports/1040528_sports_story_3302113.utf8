 Justine vows to bounce back
 Justine will take a serious crack at Wimbledon Paris: Deposed French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne has vowed to bounce back from her shock second-round Roland Garros exit to make a full-blooded assault on the only Grand Slam title to have eluded her  Wimbledon. The 21-year-old top seed crashed out of the French Open on Wednesday losing 5-7, 4-6 to the 86th world-ranked player Tathiana Garbin of Italy. It was Henin-Hardennes second match in six weeks after being laid low by a virus. I dont know what to expect now but in the next few days I will take a little bit of rest and then start practice when I feel better, said the Belgian who suffered the worst exit of a defending champion at the tournament here, equalling the second-round defeat of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1989. But Wimbledon is in my calendar. What happened here doesnt change anything on my schedule. However, the Belgian woman knows that there are some hard hours ahead on the practice courts if she is to have any chance of adding the Wimbledon title to the US and Australian Open crowns she still holds. The health problems I have had are going to go away. It will be soon, but first I need a little time to feel rested, to feel 100 per cent, to feel prepared the best I can because I didnt have the greatest preparation coming here. Despite her desperate lack of match sharpness coming into Paris, Henin-Hardenne believes she made the right decision to play. I did it for me, nobody else. I have no regrets about it. Maybe I went too far. Maybe my goals were too high. Maybe that was a mistake. But I had to come back one day. I know what I have to do to get to 100 per cent. I have come through many situations in the past and I am sure I will do it again. Life continues. Its a bad day. Tomorrow will be better. Although she is optimistic about being fighting fit for Wimbledon, which starts in three weeks time, she will face lingering doubts over whether or not her comparatively slight frame will match up to the powers of the Williams sisters on a fast grasscourt. Its possible that I need more time to recover. To really make a difference, I have to be at 100 per cent physical fitness. If I have a health problem and I cant recover as quickly as some players, maybe I feel it more. I have done nothing here to be ashamed of, theres nothing to hide. Its happened to other players and its the sort of situation that will lead me to react in the near future.  (AFP)  Copyright

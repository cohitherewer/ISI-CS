 Intikhab Alam blames Woolmer
Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Intikhab Alam has said national coach Bob Woolmers failure to chalk out a strategy resulted in the teams ouster from the Asia Cup. Pakistans failure to protect the bonus point against India proved costly as the latter made it to the final after beating Sri Lanka in their last league match on Tuesday. Intikhab, also a former coach, lashed out at Woolmer, saying his criticism of the bonus point rule was unfair and illogical since it applied to all teams and that it was the coachs job to educate the players about its importance. The rule was same for all and it was up to the participating teams to work out their plans. Pakistan did not collect even a single bonus point which shows the coach could not prepare any strategy for it, Intikhab was quoted as saying in a local daily. Intikhab said studying the rules of the tournament was the coachs job, which Woolmer failed to do properly and he should accept the defeat instead of criticising the rules.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Tattoos make a statement in Athens
 - After losing the 100m, Greene now has a problem  NBA star Allen Iverson probably wishes he could slim down his tattoo collection Athens: If you want to a get a medal, get a tattoo. That is one of the messages to emerge from the Athens Olympics where competitors are stating their intentions in the most blatant way. If the graffiti-covered Berlin Wall had come to life, it would have looked less garish than Allen Iverson, the star guard of the United States basketball team. Far from having the answer, as he is known, multi-millionaire Iverson looks as if he is still searching for a solution. On his upper left arm alone is scrawled strong, survive, the answer and a picture of a drooling bulldog. For a man who has a professional hairdresser drive from New Jersey twice a week in order to do his hair, Iverson probably wishes he could slim down his tattoo collection  especially when unfancied Puerto Rico shocked the Dream Team in their first match. All the pre-Olympic hype was about reigning 100m champion Maurice Greenes goat, standing for greatest of all time and emblazoned on his right biceps. Everyone should have been looking at the far more discreet godspeed adorning Justin Gatlins left shoulder, its a statement, according to the 22-year-old. When Gatlin left Greene for dead in the 100 metres, the deposed champion was left with the delicate tattoo-induced problem  you cant scrub them off and they can come back to haunt you. What am I still the greatest of all time?, said Greene. And he mounted a strong defence despite seeing his dream of emulating Carl Lewis and winning two straight 100m titles go up in smoke. But the tattoos are not confined to athletes from the United States. Glamorous Bulgarian sprinter Ivet Lalova drew plenty of attention as one of a crop of new talent ushering in a fresh generation of speed queens. In contrast to Iversons mass of scribble, Lalova sports a flowery design around her navel, rather like ivy around the door of country house. So Ivet, is that a statement? we asked. No, I just thought it looked nice, said the 20-year-old who finished fourth in the 100m and fifth over 200m. Tattoed red and green flames lick up the back of Germanys much-bemedalled swimmer Franziska van Almsick, but the go faster stripes didnt work  she failed to win the gold medal that has eluded her through four Olympics.

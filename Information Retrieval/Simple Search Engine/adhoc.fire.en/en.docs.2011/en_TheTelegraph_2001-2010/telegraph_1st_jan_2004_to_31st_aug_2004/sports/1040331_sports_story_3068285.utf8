 - SAF GAMES - Indians hit bulls eye at shooting range; shuttlers enter final  Gairik Bardhan on his way to winning the 200m breaststroke gold at the SAF Games in Islamabad on Tuesday. Akbar Ali Mir (top) won the 200m backstroke. (PTI) Islamabad: The Indian dominance in the pool is established. Tuesday India won all the four golds on offer, including a record by Gairik Bardhan, on the opening day of the mens events at the ninth SAF Games at the Pakistan Sports Complex here. Bardhan, the 20-year-old schoolboy from Calcutta lagged far behind two Bangladeshis in the 200m breaststroke, but a fantastic burst in the last 50m saw him to the gold and record. Once ahead of Mohammad Niaz Ali of Bangladesh, Bardhan accelerated to beat the field. Bardhans effort of 2:28.95 erased Mizanur Rahmans 2.32.05, set at the Chennai Games in 1995. Indias second gold came from Rehan Poncha in the 200m individual medley. Mohammad Rubel Rana of Bangladesh was enjoying a slight advantage, but Poncha, the defending champion, pulled ahead to finish in 2:15.37 for gold. In the 200m backstroke and 400m freestyle events, Indian swimmers  Akbar Ali Mir and Mandar Divase  showed irrepressible form being runaway winners for gold. Mir, also a Calcutta boy, finished in 2:14.26 for gold, and Divases 4:14.11 was good for gold in the 400m freestyle. Interestingly, Pakistani organisers have barred photographers from taking pictures of women in swimming costumes, an official said. Games director of information Syed Mujtaba Tirmizi said the ban would remain in force while authorities debated how best to handle swimming coverage. From the shooting range India won the mens 10m air rifle team gold, helped by the brilliant performance of Sajeev Rajput and Salim Hanifa who won the individual silver and bronze medals, respectively. The Indian team, also comprising Sandeep Tarte, claimed the mens team gold with a total of 1763 points, ahead of Bangladesh and Pakistan. Bangladeshs Mohd Asif won the individual gold (103.6 points). Rajput (102.8) got silver. In badminton, Indian eves blanked Nepal 3-0 to enter the team event final. The Indians faced no challenge from the minnows and now await the winners of the Pakistan-Sri Lanka match Wednesday. B. R. Meenakshi gave India the lead with a facile 11-1, 11-1 win over Sara Devi Tamang and then Trupti Murgunde made it 2-0, beating Rajni Maiya Joshi 11-0, 11-2. The experienced Manjusha Kanwar settled the issue when she got past Sumina Shrestha 11-2, 11-2. In a mens preliminary match, Bangladesh got the better of Nepal 3-2 and will face India in their next league match Wednesday. The winners of this match will progress to the finals. In volleyball defending champions India began their title campaign with a confident 3-0 win over lowly Afghanistan. India took just 55 minutes for their 25-14, 25-10, 25-10 win in group A at the Liaquat Gymnasium. Meanwhile, Indian athletics coach Jagjit Singh Sani said his squad would surely improve on the last editions haul of 22 golds. India had won 12 out of 20 golds in mens events and 10 of the 15 in womens events at the eighth Games in Kathmandu in 1999. The wrestlers, too were confident, despite the emergence of Pakistan as a strong force. This discipline starts Wednesday. The Indian wrestlers recent success in the middle and heavy weight categories at various world meets has put them in good stead to clinch a number of medals here.  In table tennis Indias supremacy is unlikely to be challenged from Wednesday.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

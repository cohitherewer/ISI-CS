The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gangjee in joint 8th
 Rahil Gangjee Beijing: Dubai-based Scotsman Ross Bain cruised into the first-round lead in the inaugural $300,000 Volkswagen Masters China on Thursday, with home hero Zhang Lian-wei spearheading the chasing pack. Calcutta boy Rahil Gangjee hit a 69 to be tied at the eighth spot with seven others. Bain, trying to get rid of his under-achiever tag, enjoyed a spectacular front nine at Pine Valley Golf Club to turn in 31 before settling for six-under-par 66 in the Asian Tour event. Along with the morning session players, Bain enjoyed the better half of the weather as the skies opened up in the afternoon with continuous rain. Australian duo Adam Groom and Richard Moir produced matching 67s for tied second place with Zhang, Scotsman Simon Yates, Welsh star Phillip Price and South African Keith Horne bunched a shot further back. Playing in benign conditions in the morning, Bain rolled in a 30-foot birdie on his first hole of the day, at the 10th. (AFP)  Copyright

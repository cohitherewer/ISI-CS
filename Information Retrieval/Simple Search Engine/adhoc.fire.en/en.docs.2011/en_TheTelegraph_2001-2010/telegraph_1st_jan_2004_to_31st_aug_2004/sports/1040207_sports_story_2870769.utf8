The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal on a low-key start
		 Atwal is joint 45th after  Round IPebble Beach (California): Matt Kuchar and J.J. Henry shot seven-under-par rounds of 65 to gain a share of the first-round lead at the AT amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on Thursday, even as Calcuttas Arjun Atwal had a tentative par 72 opening round to be joint 45th. Just a stroke ahead Atwal was his friend, India-born Swede Daniel Chopra, at joint 39th with a one-under 71 opening round card. Atwal is the first Indian to have ever earned a full card for the rarified atmosphere of the US PGA Tour. Atwal is good company, though, alongside Australian Steve Elkington and Canadian Brian Watts. Chopra will also have a couple of luminaries around in his second round group Greg Chalmers, John Senden and Scott Hend (all Australia), Jose Maria Olazabal (Spain) and Ian Leggatt (Canada). Kuchar, who won his only PGA Tour title in the Honda Classic two seasons ago, carded his score at Poppy Hills Golf Course, while Henry played at the host Pebble Beach Golf Links. The third layout being used in the event is the Spyglass Hill Golf Course. Players will complete one round each at Spyglass and Poppy Hills and two, including the final 18 holes, at Pebble Beach. The cut will be made after the third round. Tommy Tolles stands alone in third place after firing a six-under-par 66. Fijis Vijai Singh continued his run of good form to join a group of eight players on 67. The other men in the group are Kent Jones, Ken Duke, South Koreas K.J. Choi, Britains Phillip Price, Robert Gamez, Tom Pernice Jr and Craig Barlow.  Title for Vandana Meanwhile, Calcuttas Vandana Agarwal lifted the Navision 87th All India ladies amateur golf championship, beating 15-year-old Delhi girl Meghna Bal in the final on Friday. Finding her touch on the last 18 of the 36-hole title round, Vandana defeated Meghna 3 and 2 to win on the 16th hole and regained the all India title she last won in 1997.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

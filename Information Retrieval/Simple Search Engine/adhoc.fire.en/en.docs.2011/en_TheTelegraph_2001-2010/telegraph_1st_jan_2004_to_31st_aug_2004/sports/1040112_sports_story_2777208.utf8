No one in the 14-strong group was injured after the pilot made an emergency landing at Farnborough Airport in Surrey just 10 minutes into the flight.				 																																	It was terrifying. I was frightened to death. We all consider ourselves lucky to be alive, club chairman John Wardle was quoted as saying by the Manchester Evening News. I dont drink that much but Im having a double whisky now.				 																																	Wardle and his fellow board members flew back to Manchester later on Saturday on a different plane. City lost their match to Portsmouth 4-2 and are 15th in the standings.				 																																	Zurich: Fifas emergency committee has suspended the Guatemalan football federation, citing governmental interference.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two rookie pacers added to Pak camp
Karachi: Pakistan have drafted two up-and-coming pace bowlers into their training camp ahead of next months historic Test series with India, an official said Tuesday. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman Samiul Hasan said Mohammad Khalil and Zahid Saeed had been invited to train with the national side in order to benefit from coaching clinics given by former Test stars Imran Khan and Wasim Akram. Khalil and Saeed have shown good form in the domestic season and since Imran Khan and Wasim Akram have agreed to give tips to fast bowlers it would be ideal for these two to get the needed guidance, Hasan said. Imran last week said he would give a one-day pep talk to fast bowlers on how to handle the mental pressure of a series against India while Wasim said he was willing to help out at a moments notice. Khalil was among the Pakistan probables for most of the season last year but was not given a chance to feature in any international match. Former captain Waqar Younis, also bidding to regain his place after being dumped following Pakistans first round exit in the World Cup last year, will have to perform extraordinarily in the domestic tournament to get a recall. The tune-up camp involving 24 players starts in Lahore from February 24.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Argentina decimate Ecuador 6-1
 - COPA AMERICA 
- Javier Saviola scores hattrick in 15-minute blitz; Uruguay, Mexico draw 2-2  Argentinas Javier Saviola after scoring his third goal against Ecuador during a group B match in Chiclayo on Wednesday. (AFP) Chiclayo (Peru), July 8 (Reuters): Javier Saviola scored a 15-minute hattrick as Argentina crushed Ecuador 6-1 in the Copa America on Thursday as two Group B matches produced 11 goals on the second day of the tournament. In the days early game, Uruguay defender Paolo Montero celebrated his return to international football with a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Mexico. However, Uruguayan substitute Richard Morales provided the low point of the double bill in Chiclayo when he was sent off just two minutes after coming on for an ugly challenge on Pavel Pardo. Saviolas performance was a huge boost to Marcelo Bielsa, the Argentina coach who has often left him on the bench and who many believe could be fired if his side do not perform well at the Copa. Yet the win apparently failed to impress Bielsa, who could not raise a smile at the post-match media conference. Instead, the famously introverted coach answered questions in his usual manner, staring at the floor and remaining totally expressionless. I didnt expect such a big score. All the aspects of our game were satisfactory, he said with typical understatement. On the other hand, Bielsas opposite number Hernan Dario Gomez, a national hero in Ecuador after leading the country to their first World Cup in 2002, pondered quitting. This was a coach-devouring result, said the Colombian. With a result like this, one has a foot out the door. Bielsa survived Argentinas first-round exit at the 2002 World Cup but has become increasingly unpopular for a number of reasons since then. His refusal to give Saviola a regular place is one of them. Saviola sprang into action just as the going got tough, Agustin Delgado having struck in the 62nd minute for Ecuador to cancel out Cristian Gonzalezs fifth minute penalty.  Uruguays Paolo Montero celebrates his equaliser against Mexico in Chiclayo on WednesdayThe Barcelona player, known as The Rabbit, finished off a delightful move in the 64th minute, headed another in the 75th and fired in from close range in the 79th. There was still time for Andres DAlessandro and Luis Gonzalez to add two more. The capacity 25,000 crowd at the newly-renovated Elias Aguirre stadium had already enjoyed four goals in the previous match. Carlos Bueno put Uruguay ahead in the 43rd minute but Mexico replied almost immediately when Ricardo Osorios intended cross appeared to be blown into the net by the wind. Pardo put Mexico ahead with a dipping 30-metre drive in the 69th minute before Juventus defender Montero popped up to head an 88th minute equaliser. It was Monteros first international since he faced Senegal in the 2002 World Cup, where he announced his international retirement but later backtracked. Montero, who has smashed records for red cards and suspensions in Italys Serie A, was duly booked after just 28 minutes of his comeback. But the real villain was Morales, a fiery player who once spent eight days in jail for his part in a brawl at the end of an Uruguayan domestic match. He came on in the 78th minute and was given the red card in the 80th  having nearly scored in between.  Copyright

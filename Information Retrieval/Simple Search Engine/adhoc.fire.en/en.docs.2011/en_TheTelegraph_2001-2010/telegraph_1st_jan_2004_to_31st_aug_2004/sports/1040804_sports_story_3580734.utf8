The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paul Scholes calls it a day
	 - One of the best, says Eriksson  Scholes will not play for England London: Manchester Uniteds England midfielder Paul Scholes has quit international football, the Premier League club said on Tuesday. Scholes, 29, who has spent his entire career at United, has 66 England caps, scoring 14 goals. This is a decision I have not taken lightly, I have been considering retiring from international football for a while now, Scholes told Uniteds official website in a shock announcement. I started my England career in 1997 and have enjoyed seven years of great football, playing in the best competitions, with some of the best players, under the best managers. England coach Sven Goran-Eriksson has always hailed Scholes as one of Englands world class players alongside David Beckham and Michael Owen. Paul and I have been speaking about this since Euro 2004 and, while he remained a key part of my plans for the England team, I fully respect his decision, Eriksson told the FA website. He has a very special talent and it has been a privilege working so closely with him. Scholes, who suffers from asthma, made his England debut under Glenn Hoddle in a 2-1 friendly win over South Africa in May 1997. He scored a hattrick against Poland in Kevin Keegans first match in charge of England in 1999 and also netted in Euro 2000. He subsequently went over three years without an international goal, finally breaking the jinx in Englands 4-2 Euro 2004 group stage win over Croatia. Euro 2004 was fantastic but afterwards I felt the time was right for myself and my family to make it my last England appearance, Scholes said. I would like to thank everyone at England for the wonderful years I had playing for the team and all the experience I gained. I wish them all the best and good luck for the future.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3 stars quit EB 
 - Okoro asked to show cause  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Louis Aniweta, who joined East Bengal, at the club on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Even as East Bengal slapped a chow-cause notice on Mike Okoro for refusing to take the field in the final AFC Cup group E league match against Negeri Sembilan on Tuesday, the club here lost three of their star players to Mahindra United. The players who switched allegiance were Surkumar Singh, Mahesh Gawli and K. Kulothungan. Mahindra, incidentally, also picked up striker Dipendu Biswas from the sinking Mohammedan Sporting. In the AFC Cup, East Bengal had lost 0-1, finishing group runners-up to Geylang United of Singapore. Nigerian striker Okoro sent his explanatory letter to club secretary Kalyan Majumdar in the evening. I didnt go to the club today, so the letter would be opened tomorrow and then well decide what action, if any, to take, said Majumdar. According to an East Bengal official, Okoro and Dipankar Roy had gone out of the team hotel the night before the Negeri game to buy SIM-cards for their cellphones. It was past 10 pm A policeman intercepted them and wanted to see Okoros visa. It was shown and the official was satisfied. On returning to the hotel, the coach (Subhas Bhowmick) gave them a piece of his mind for venturing out so late Okoro didnt like it and said he was in no mood to play the next day. The player himself, who came to the club in the evening, refused to say anything on the matter. Bhowmick refused to open his mouth too, although he did say it was one of the worst performances by his wards this season. On the team-building front, East Bengal on Thursday managed to convince Debjit Ghosh and Dipak Mondal to stay on for one more season. They also finalised a deal with Haywards Sporting defender Louis Aniweta, who had negotiated with Mohun Bagan too. Meanwhile, Tollygunge Agragami have decided to appoint Aloke Mukherjee coach for the ensuing season. He is meeting two of our officials Friday evening to discuss terms and conditions unless he demands a sum well beyond our means, he should be coaching our team, said club secretary Mantoo Ghosh.

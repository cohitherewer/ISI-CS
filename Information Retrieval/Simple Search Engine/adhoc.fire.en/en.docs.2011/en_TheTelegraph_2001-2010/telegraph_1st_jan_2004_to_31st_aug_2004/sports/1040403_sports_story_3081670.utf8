		 Saturday, April 03, 2004  18-month penalty for apprentice 
Melbourne: Australian apprentice jockey Craig Newitt was provisionally suspended from riding for 18 months on Friday after stewards found the teenager guilty of giving false and misleading evidence, local media reported. Newitt was granted a stay of proceedings pending an appeal and will be allowed to ride on Saturday.				 										The ban followed an inquiry by Racing Victoria into a race at Sandown in Melbourne on November 15 last year when 2-1 favourite Leone Chiara, ridden by 19-year-old Newitt, finished eighth. The focus of the inquiry later shifted to Newitts relationship with bookmaker Anthony Cullen. Cullen was also found guilty of giving false evidence and disqualified for two years.Newitt, Melbournes leading apprentice jockey last year, was found guilty of 16 charges relating to giving false evidence while Cullen was found guilty on 14 counts of the same charge, Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported. Newitts father, registered stablehand Guy Newitt, was disqualified for nine months as was Newitts friend, jockey Daniel Schmitt, both on four charges of giving false evidence, AAP said. (REUTERS)

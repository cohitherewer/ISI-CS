The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We shouldnt chase records, says Buchanan
 Our job is to play the best cricket, feels Buchanan Sydney, May 13 (Reuters): Australia coach John Buchanan has said Ricky Pontings side must be careful to avoid the temptation of chasing world records against an under-strength Zimbabwe later this month. I think theres a danger in all of that talk that they are a weak side and we are going to finish off the games early and players are going to fuel their statistics, Buchanan said at the Sydney airport on Thursday. I think if any side goes on tour with that state of mind, they are vulnerable. Our job is just to go there, get ourselves prepared to play the best cricket we can and then the results should always look after themselves. Zimbabwes former captain Heath Streak and 14 other players were sacked on Monday in a dispute over Streaks removal as skipper and the composition of the selection panel. Ponting said on Wednesday that his top-ranked side would look to finish their two tests against the Africans as quickly as possible and added he hoped Streak and the other leading players would be reinstated. Australia departed for Africa on Thursday and will play a three-day match against Zimbabwe A in Harare on Monday. The first Test starts there on May 22. Opening batsman Matthew Hayden scored a then world record 380 against Zimbabwe in the first Test in Perth last October. West Indian skipper Brian Lara regained the record with an unbeaten 400 in the fourth Test against England at St Johns in Antigua last month. Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne is four wickets short of Sri Lanka offie Muttiah Muralidharans world leading 521. Buchanan said the tour wasnt a waste of time and stressed it was important partly because it would help the development of younger players, like 20-year-old leg-spinner Cameron White, and give pace spearhead Glenn Mcgrath the chance to return to international cricket from a long-term ankle injury.

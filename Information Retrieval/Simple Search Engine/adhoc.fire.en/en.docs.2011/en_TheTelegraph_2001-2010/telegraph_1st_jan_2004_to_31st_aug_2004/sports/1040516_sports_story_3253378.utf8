(Reuters)Jakarta, May 15 (AFP): Chinese women overcame stubborn resistance from Korea to claim their fourth successive Uber Cup title 3-1 on Saturday. The Chinese, all ranked in the top three, dropped their first point of the tournament with Lee Hyo-Jung and Hwang Yu-Mi surprising number one doubles pairing Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen 15-7, 15-10. Top-ranked singles player Gong Ruina had earlier battled back from a game and four points down in the second to beat Asian champion Jun Jae-Youn, sinking to her knees with relief as she completed the 7-11, 11-5, 11-7 victory. Zhang Ning soon restored Chinas lead, coming through a tough second game to beat Seo Yoon-Hee 11-1, 13-10. Gao Ling and Huang Sui then wrapped up the countrys ninth Uber Cup with Lee Yun-Hwa and Lee Kyung-Won unable to stop them running out 15-6, 15-2 winners.  Copyright

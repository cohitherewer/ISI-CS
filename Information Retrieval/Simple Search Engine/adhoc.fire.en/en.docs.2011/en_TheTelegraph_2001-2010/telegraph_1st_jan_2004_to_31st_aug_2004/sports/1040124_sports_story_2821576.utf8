 Pak wary of tips being passed on

 - Akram's presence in Australia

 Akram has been spending time with Irfan Pathan 
Islamabad: Pakistan are wary of Wasim Akram moulding Indian rookie Irfan Pathan into a potent left-arm speedster and are also worried that the former captain may let out other trade secrets to the arch-rivals ahead of their historic tour in March-April. 
While asserting that Akram, currently in Australia as a TV commentator, has every right to coach any cricketer of his choice, the Pakistan cricket establishment wants the legendary allrounder to draw a line on working with Indian players. 
Akram on Sunday spent over an hour coaching Pathan who has emerged as the find of the tour Down Under and reports of Akram and his virtual clone bonding together have been doing the rounds in cricketing circles here. 
Coach Javed Miandad felt Akram was within his rights to offer tips but was worried that his former teammate might also go to the extent of teaching Indian batsmen how to counter reverse-swing  the traditional secret weapon of Pakistani pacers. 
Look, what I am only worried about are tips on how to play reverse-swing our team has developed a special batting strategy to counter it. If he is giving their bowlers tips on how to reverse-swing the ball, there is nothing wrong because a bowler must have the ability to pick up the art. 
But telling another team trade secrets like how to play reverse-swing, I dont think he would do it and I hope he is not doing it, Miandad was quoted as saying by a local daily after his return from New Zealand. 
Miandad left the moral and ethical issues of coaching to Akram, saying the former Pakistan captain was mature enough to realise the sensitivities involved. As a former player I know that in international cricket players do help out each other. Lots of people have approached me for advice if they have been going through a rough time. Similarly, I have also sought advice at times, he said. Miandad also insisted that there is nothing wrong if Akram is being paid to assist Indian bowlers. If someone wants to pay him for his expertise, fine, what is wrong with it? 
PCB chief executive Rameez Raja tried to defend Akrams unofficial coaching of Indian bowlers by stating that he could not help doing it as he was an international celebrity. 
Miandad rubbished reports of a tiff between Shoaib Akhtar and captain Inzamam-ul Haq and praised the speedster for being a good team man despite his antics during the tour of New Zealand. Shoaib had reportedly told teammates in New Zealand that they should be prepared to accept him as the new captain once they returned home. 
But both Miandad and team manager Haroon Rashid were unanimous in their view that Shoaib was well behaved on the tour where Pakistan enjoyed mixed success, winning the Test series 1-0 before going down 1-4 in the ODI series. 
Even when Mohammed Sami was struggling, he was out there encouraging him and overall was a good team man, Rashid was quoted as saying in an interview. Otherwise his minor abrasions were there but he played with commitment and sincerity and supported others all the way, he said. 
 Inzamam retained 
Meanwhile, the PCB extended the tenure of skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq by another year on Friday. Inzamam will be captain for the 2004 calendar, PCB chief Shaharyar Khan said. 
It is a well thought decision taken in consultation with Raja and chairman of selectors Wasim Bari.

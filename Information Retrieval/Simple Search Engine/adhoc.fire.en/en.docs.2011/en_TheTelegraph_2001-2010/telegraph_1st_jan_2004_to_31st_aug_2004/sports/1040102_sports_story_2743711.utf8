 Saudi club close in on Rivaldo
Jeddah: Saudi champions Al-Ittihad said they were close to beating a handful of Brazilian and Portuguese clubs to the signature of former World Player of the Year Rivaldo. The Brazilian playmaker has had offers from Brazilian clubs Sao Paulo and Botafogo while Portuguese sides FC Porto and Benfica are interested, but Al-Ittihad president Mansur Al-Balawi said Wednesday negotiations were at an advanced stage. We have contacted Rivaldo and negotiations with him are progressing, Al-Balawi said. We have almost secured his agreement and we expect him to sign in the next few days or hours. The president gave no further details of the offer. Rivaldo was released by AC Milan after an unsuccessful 17-month spell. The 31-year-old joined Milan on a free contract, a month after winning the 2002 World Cup with Brazil. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti limited him to just 16 Serie A matches, and eight Champions League games.  (AFP)  Copyright

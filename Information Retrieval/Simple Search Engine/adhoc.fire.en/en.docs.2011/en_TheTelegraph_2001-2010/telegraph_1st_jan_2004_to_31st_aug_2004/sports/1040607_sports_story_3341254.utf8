				 																																	Seoul: Former Senegal coach Bruno Metsu could be left jobless after pay negotiations with the Korea Football Association (KFA) stalled last week.				 																																	The Frenchman, manager of Asian champions Al Ain, has been told to stay away by the UAE clubs president after Metsu made it known he wanted to coach South Korea.				 																																	Al Ain president Mohamed bin-Zayed Al-Nahyan told Arab media over the weekend that Metsu was no longer welcome, even if talks with the KFA broke down completely.				 																																	Metsu had also been linked to Qatars Al Ithihad but that move fell through after the club refused to pay the $1.8 million Al Ain demanded in compensation.				 																																	The 50-year-old led Senegal to the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup and guided Al Ain to the Asian Champions League title last year.				 																																	But after heading the KFAs short-list of candidates to replace Humberto Coelho, Metsu suddenly appears stuck for options.				 																																	Bangkok: A Thai brewer has signed a three-year deal worth $2.7 million to be the shirt sponsor for Premier League side Everton, one of the negotiators of the agreement said on Sunday.				 																																	Thawatchai Satchakul, business manager for Thailands national team, said Thai Beverages would pay $900,000 per year to Everton, whose shirts were previously emblazoned with the logo of Chinese mobile phone company Kejian.				 																																	They have signed the deal and will start displaying their logo on Evertons shirts in the coming season, Thawatchai said.				 																																	Berlin: Two goals from Parma striker Alberto Gilardino helped Italy book a place at the Olympic soccer tournament by beating Portugal 3-1 in the semi-finals of the European under-21 championship on Saturday.				 																																	Italy will play the final on Tuesday against Serbia amp; Montenegro, who also won a ticket to the Olympics by beating Sweden on penalties in the other semi-final.				 																																	The two finalists and the winners of the third-place playoff, also being played on Tuesday, qualify for the Olympics in August in Athens.				 																																	Gilardino scored a goal in each half for Italy in the game in Bochum. Midfielder Gianpiero Pinzi also contributed to the victory of the winners of four of the last six editions of the tournament.				 																																	Mugello (Italy): MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi shrugged off a rain delay to win the Italian Grand Prix in front of his home fans here on Sunday. 				 																																	Rossi, who switched to Yamaha at the start of the season, was chased home by two Honda riders  Spaniard Sete Gibernau who had set out from pole, and Max Biaggi. 				 																																	The race was stopped and then restarted after 19 of the 23 laps due to rain with Rossi ahead of Gibernau at the time. 				 																																	This was the flamboyant Italians second win of the season after taking the honours in the opening South African GP. 				 																																	Gibernau retains the lead in the drivers championship after this fourth leg of the 16-race season.

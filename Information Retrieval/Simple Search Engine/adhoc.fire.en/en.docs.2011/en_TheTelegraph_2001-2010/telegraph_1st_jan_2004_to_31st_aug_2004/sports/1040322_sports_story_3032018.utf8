(AFP) New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa made a remarkable comeback to finish tied-third at the Singapore Masters at the Laguna National Golf and Country Club in Singapore on Sunday. Britains Colin Montgomerie won his first European Tour title in 16 months with a three-shot victory. The seven-time European No. 1, four strokes off the lead at the start of the day, fired a flawless seven-under-par 65 at Laguna National Golf and Country Club for a winning total of 16-under 272. Thailand-based American Greg Hanrahan, co-leader overnight with Britains Barry Lane, secured second place at 13-under after closing with a level-par 72. Australian left-hander Nick OHern (67) finished a further shot back to tie with Randhawa while Lane, who had been chasing his first European title in ten years, slipped back into a share of fifth with 75. Randhawa fired a 6-under 66 in the final round for a tournament aggregate of 12-under 276 and got to take home euros 41,563. Earlier, Randhawa, who was tied-second at the mid-way stage, had shot a 74 on day three to slip down the leaderboard, according to information received here. Arjun Singh, the other Indian in the fray finished 73rd with a tally of 6-over 294 for the week. Randhawas golfing career has been on an upswing for the past two years. The Indian, won the order of merit title on the Asian PGA Tour in 2002. He followed up with a win at the Suntory Open on his rookie season on the Japanese PGA tour in 2003. Earlier, this year, Randhawa finished tied-second at the Johnny Walker Classic. Montgomerie, who had not won in Europe since he shared the season-ending Volvo Masters with Bernhard Langer in 2002, sealed his place in next weeks Players Championship (TPC) at Ponte Vedra, Florida with his 28th European Tour triumph. I had a challenge here to finish in the top two or three to get into the TPC and the challenge was on, the 40-year-old Scot said. This win means an awful lot to me. It has given me confidence, and I didnt have any confidence last year really at all. After I bogeyed the last on Thursday to lie one-under par and about 30th place, it wasnt looking good. But then I put three good rounds together and no bogeys in the last three days and I am very proud of that. Not to drop a shot in three days is very good on a demanding golf course and to have 15 birdies in that and no dropped shots was good, even for me, Montgomerie added. I know I am good enough to perform and its always nice when you can prove that to yourself. Hanrahans cheque for $100,000 was the biggest in his 20-year professional career.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

(Reuters) Madrid: Real Madrid beat Valencia 3-0 on Wednesday in a Kings Cup quarter final first-leg victory in Madrid, spoiled only by the late sending-off of England captain David Beckham. Sevilla scored an even more emphatic victory in the nights other quarter final first-leg, as they cruised to a 4-0 win at home to a weakened Atletico Madrid side. Goals from Raul, Ronaldo and Luis Figo had already put Real in charge of the heavyweight clash at the Bernabeu when Beckham picked up a second booking in the 87th minute for a challenge from behind on Pablo Aimar. League leaders Valencia made a dazzling start against their chief rivals for the league title, fizzing passes in front of the Real defence and twice going close in the opening few minutes. Real took the lead when Raul met a Santiago Solari cross with a glancing header in the 32nd minute. Valencia pressed for an equaliser in the second half but Ronaldo blasted in Reals second in the 81st minute and Luis Figo made it 3-0 from the penalty spot after Carlos Marchena had brought down Raul. Two minutes later Beckham was sent off for the first time since joining the Spanish champions and was given a rousing ovation as he left the field. Valencia midfielder David Albelda, who was also booked for a second time in a separate incident, swiftly followed him.  Okocha fashions win Jay-Jay Okocha gave Bolton Wanderers the perfect farewell present on Wednesday when he scored twice en route to a 5-2 victory over Aston Villa in a pulsating League Cup semi-final, first-leg at The Reebok, says a report from London. The Bolton captain opted to delay his departure to Tunisia where he is to play for Nigeria in the African Nations Cup and his decision paid dividends with the first and last goals of a breathless, action-packed encounter. Meanwhile, Italian champions Juventus will meet Inter Milan in the semi-finals of the Italian Cup after the pair cruised into the last four with wins on Wednesday, adds another report from Rome. Inter beat Udinese 3-1 in front of just 2,700 fans at the San Siro after their first leg had ended goalless while Juventus striker Fabrizio Miccoli gave his team a 1-0 win over Perugia to ensure a 3-1 aggregate victory.

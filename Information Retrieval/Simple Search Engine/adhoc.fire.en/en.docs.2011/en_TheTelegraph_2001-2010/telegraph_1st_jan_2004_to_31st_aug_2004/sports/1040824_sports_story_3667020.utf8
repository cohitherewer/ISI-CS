The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saraswatis quick exit
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  All hopes now rest on Anju Bobby George Athens: The Indian adventure isnt ever too long and colourful. A black and white mini documentary it has been, short and bitter. Saraswati Saha came all the way from Bengal to run the 200m. She is a specialist in that. In heat No. 3 of Round 1, she slipped out quietly, failing to even qualify for the second round. She clocked 23.43 seconds, not good enough for any further progress. End of story. Anju Bobby George, the only hope left for India in any discipline now, takes to the womens long jump on Wednesday. She has been training here and feels confident of doing well. At the athletics venue on Sunday, the mens hammer throw was won by Adrian Annus of Hungary with a huge heave of 83.19, achieved in the third attempt. And with the retirement of Jonathan Edwards, the mantle of triple jump champion passes to Christian Olsson of Sweden who leaped a distance of 17.79m on third try, way behind Edwards world record of 18.29 and behind Kenny Harrisons Olympic mark of 18.09. On Tuesday Indian matmen take to the, well... mat. Seven wrestlers have come here, a heavy luggage for the contingent, and not one is a medal prospect. Starting Tuesday will be Greco-Roman (55kg) wrestler Mukesh Khatri. The other six are all freestyle wrestlers.  Copyright

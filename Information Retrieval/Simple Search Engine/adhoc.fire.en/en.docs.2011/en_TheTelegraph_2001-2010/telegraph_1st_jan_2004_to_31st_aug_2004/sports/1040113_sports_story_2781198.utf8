The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Clijsters may need surgery 
Sydney: Kim Clijsters says the ankle injury which forced her out of last weeks Hopman Cup will never heal and may eventually require surgery. The world No.2 told a news conference on Monday that while the injury had already shown signs of improvement, it was likely to trouble her throughout the rest of her career. I had some other doctors look at the scans and theyre all very positive so thats the good news. But its something I have to keep in mind for the future, its something thats not going to go away. I might have to have some surgery or something. Clijsters said her ankle would need protective strapping every time she played to prevent any further damage but she was taking a philosophical approach. Ill have to play with tape, thats something Ill probably have to do for the rest of my career, she said. Meanwhile, Greg Rusedski said on Monday he only decided to go public about his failed drugs test after rumours began circulating in the British media. I was called by many journalists. It was circulating in the UK, Rusedski said. Obviously I had no choice, I was put on the spot, if you like. But the British number two maintained his innocence and has vowed to continue to play while defending the charges.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

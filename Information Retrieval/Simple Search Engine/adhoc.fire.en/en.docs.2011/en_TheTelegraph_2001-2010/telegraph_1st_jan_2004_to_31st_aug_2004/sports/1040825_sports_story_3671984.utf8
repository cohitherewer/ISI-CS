The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004  Elistano for Trial Stakes 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Elistano is the horse to beat in the six-horse line-up for the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes at the RCTC ground on Wednesday. Bollywood Dreams, one of the top rated horse of last season, would have been an automatic choice but all does not seem to be well with the Bharath Singh-trainee. 				 										Elistano, on the other hand, is going great guns in his morning trials. Moreover, last winter, the Vijay Singh-ward had also placed close to Bollywood Dreams in two of his three career starts  the Champagne Stakes and the Nanoli Stud Million. S. Shanker partners the Metal Precieux-Pot Of Gold Son.				 										Read as Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

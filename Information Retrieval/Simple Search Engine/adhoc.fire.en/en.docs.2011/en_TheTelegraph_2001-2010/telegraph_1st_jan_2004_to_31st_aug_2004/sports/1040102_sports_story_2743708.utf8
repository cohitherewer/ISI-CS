The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, January 02, 2004  Evangeline outsmarts opposition 
 BY STAR RACER R. Marshall on Evangeline  A 15,000- strong  crowd packed the stands at the RCTC, cheering every  winner on New Years Day. Pictures by Kishor Roychowdhury C. Alford Calcutta: Displaying controlled  aggression, the four-year-old filly Evangeline outsmarted  her seven rivals on her way to lifting the 1,200m Eveready  Recharge Sprinters Trophy at the RCTC ground on New Years  Day. Ryan Marshall partnered the Excaliburs Lake-Glowing  Tribute filly, from trainer Bharath Singhs yard, to a three-length  victory over a strongly fancied Network from trainer Vijay  Singhs stable. 				 										Allowing Beneficent to dictate terms till 300m from home, Evangeline slipped into a four-length lead and never appeared to be in danger of being caught.				 										Bharath went on to lead-in Gypsy King, also an easy winner of the Burning Fire Cup.				 										Vijay, however, had his share of races, including the Eveready Indian Proeduce Stakes which was claimed by his three-year-old colt Alaskan, a Tecorno-Loud Water son who made every post of the 1,200m trip a winning one.

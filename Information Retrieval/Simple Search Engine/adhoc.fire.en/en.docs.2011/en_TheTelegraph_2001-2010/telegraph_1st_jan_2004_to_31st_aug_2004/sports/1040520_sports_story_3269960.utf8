The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ill play even if 85% fit: Bhupathi
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Mahesh BhupathiCalcutta: His groin injury has not fully healed, but Mahesh Bhupathi is very keen to play next weeks French Open championships. I will go to Paris even if I am 85 per cent fit, Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Wednesday. The Bangalorean doubles ace checked into the city late Tuesday night and flew to Siliguri on Wednesday to attend the opening of Jaidip Mukerjeas Himalayan Tennis Academy. I went for some light jogging on Tuesday and felt some pain. I will try and hit a few balls on Saturday and then take a decision on the French. Unless its really bad, Ill make the trip to Paris, Bhupathi said. He pulled his right groin and hurt a calf muscle on the left foot in last weeks Hamburg Masters Series match against Leander Paes and David Rikl. Specialists there had said, after going through the investigation reports, that the Indian should be fit to play in about 10 days. The doubles event doesnt normally start before Wednesday, so Ill be getting two extra days to be match-fit, argued Bhupathi. The two-time French Open champion (both time with Paes) is all the more eager to play at Roland Garros as he and Max Mirnyi reached the semi-finals last year and have got to defend those points to prevent a sharp fall in rankings.

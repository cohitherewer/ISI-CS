The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla beat Australia
Fatullah: In a big boost for Bangladesh cricket, the countrys under-19 team edged out Australia by eight runs to win the Plate Championship in the U-19 World Cup here Thursday. Winning the toss and batting first, Bangladesh put up 257 for nine with the top-three Nafis Iqbal, Naeem Islam and Aftab Ahmed scoring half-centuries. The lower-order couldnt quite build on the start, but it proved to be sufficient as Enamul Haque sliced through Australias batting with five for 31, including two wickets in the decisive final over. The batting has let Bangladesh down throughout the tournament, but it clicked when it mattered most. Nafis (59) and Naeem (66) got Bangladesh off to a dream start, putting on 124 for the first wicket before the former was caught and bowled by Stephen OKeefe. Tim Paine removed Naeem, but Aftab maintained the tempo with 57 from 58 balls. With 10 overs to go, Bangladesh were 204 for two. But inevitably, Australia fought back in the closing overs. But the Bangladesh total looked ample as no team has successfully chased more than 250 in the tournament. At 108 for five in the 27th over, Australia looked dead and buried. But then Ahillen Beadle and Stephen OKeefe rallied Australia, as the nerves set in for Bangladeshs bowlers. Both men crossed fifty to tilt the balance in Australias favour, but then three run-outs in four balls changed the match. It plunged Australia from 233 for five to 235 for eight, and suddenly needed 23 runs from 15 balls. But Enamul held his nerve to wrap up a sensational victory. BRIEF SCORES Bangladesh 257/9 (Nafis Iqbal 59, Naeel Islam 66, Aftab Ahmed 57). Australia 249 (Enamul Haque 5/31). Bangladesh won by 8 runs.  Pak meet Windies Pakistan will take on West Indies in the final at the Bangabandhu Stadium on Friday. While Pakistan will be on a high after their win against India in the semis, West Indies will look to carry on the momentum they gathered after beating England.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

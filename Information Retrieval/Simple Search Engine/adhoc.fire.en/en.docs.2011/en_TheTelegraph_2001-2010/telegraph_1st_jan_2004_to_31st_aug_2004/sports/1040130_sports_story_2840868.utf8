 New committee in Iraq
Dukan: Iraq elected a new National Olympic Committee (NOC) on Thursday, promising to open a new chapter for a sports community once controlled by Saddam Husseins brutal son Uday. In front of us is a long and difficult path, but we will work together, despite the limited opportunities and difficult conditions in Iraq, said Ahmed al-Samarrai, the head of the 11-member committee. We have turned a new leaf, just as the country of Iraq is turning a new page in its history. The previous committee was dissolved by the US authorities in April. Iraqs membership of the IOC was also suspended. The IOC will now consider whether to lift that suspension when it meets in Athens at the end of February. US officials, keen to see Iraq participate in the Athens Olympics to show the country is getting back on its feet, said that even if the suspension was not lifted some Iraqi athletes would participate although not under an Iraqi flag. The Olympic Committee was run by Uday Hussein, who was killed with his brother Qusay by US soldiers in July last year. He was infamous for his brutality towards athletes who he accused of underperforming. I think we were the only country in the world where when the team lost, they were punished with prison or being hit, Karim al-Basri, head of the newly establish ed Athletics Rights Association of Iraq said. The main thing to do now is get Iraqi sport to take decisions itself, independently.   (REUTERS)  Copyright

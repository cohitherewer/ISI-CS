 Angry Greeks hit back 
	 - THG SCANDAL Athens: Greek sports officials reacted angrily to reports that Olympic hopefuls had been dragged into the THG doping scandal stirred up by Californian nutritionist Victor Conte. So far five athletes, including Britains European 100m champion Dwain Chambers, have been named in the doping scandal. Chambers has a hearing into his positive test for THG on Thursday. Conte, the founder of the Bay Area laboratory, is one of four men along with Chambers coach Remi Korchemny, coach Greg Anderson and Balco vice-president Jim Valente who have pleaded not guilty to being involved in a conspiracy to provide elite athletes with the designer steroid Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG). US law enforcement officials have released an e-mail from Conte which mentions two unidentified athletes and a coach from Greece who had been allegedly using illegal products he supplied. THG was not mentioned. In the e-mail made public by the authorities, Conte warns about a newly-developed test, although the names of the Greek athletes have been removed by officials. We might also want to somehow get this information to the coach for the Greek athletes (name deleted) and (name deleted) so that nobody tests positive, wrote Conte. Vassilis Sevastis, the president of the Greek athletics federation, denied any involvement. Greek deputy minister Yiorgos Lianis on Tuesday asked Greek prosecutors to launch an inquiry into whether Greek citizens were involved in the Bay Area Laboratory affair, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported. Christos Tzekos, coach of Olympic 200 metres champion Konstadinos Kederis and womens 100m silver medallist Ekaterini Thanou, denied he was the coach mentioned in Contes e-mail and slammed the allegations as cowardly and immoral. Sports minister Georges Lianis said elite Greek athletes were systematically controlled and had never failed a test. Last year however the Greece team was forced to issue a statement in protest at allegations about Kederis, following his withdrawal from the Paris world championships. No charges were brought against Kederis. In November 2002, the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) general secretary Istvan Gyulai called the Greeks to order after drug testers were unable to find athletes for random controls using information supplied by Greek authorities. Last year Tzekos took his athletes to Qatar to train without approval of the Greek federation who thought they were in Crete. Tzekos denied allegations he was training his athletes in secret to avoid random tests but the sports minister ordered him to train his athletes in Greece in the future.  (AFP)  Copyright

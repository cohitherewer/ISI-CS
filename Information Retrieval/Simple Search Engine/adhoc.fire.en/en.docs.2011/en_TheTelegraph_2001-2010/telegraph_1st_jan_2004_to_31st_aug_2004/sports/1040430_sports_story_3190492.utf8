The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Big changes on F1 horizon
 - The sport is crying out for more battles on the track and fewer in the paddock  The Schumachers and the Ferraris arent enough London: Formula One is facing momentous change, however much Ferrari and Michael Schumacher keep on serving up the same old dominance. The sense of inevitability that accompanied Schumachers fourth win in four races on Sunday contrasted with the uncertainty hanging over the sport. Proposals by the governing international automobile federation (FIA) to take motor racing back to basics from 2008 caused far more of a stir than anything seen on the racetrack at Imola. There were more ripples when the GPWC group of five major carmakers announced that they were ending an agreement to secure the sports future with Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone. What the two statements meant was that while the FIA had served notice of a future revolution, to be imposed if necessary, the manufacturers were again threatening to introduce their own series. A split is not impossible but some in the sport believe the carmakers to be on the backfoot, more likely to buckle than commit themselves and their shareholders to such a major financial undertaking. I dont think theres going to be another championship. There will be one championship, the FIA Formula One world championship, said Minardi boss Paul Stoddart. Meantime, the door is still open to negotiation and there will be many meetings to come. In 2008, Formula Ones guiding Concorde Agreement between the teams, Ecclestone and FIA expires. Without a new one, the FIA can lay down the law to the teams providing it gives sufficient notice  which it did with the proposals issued at Imola. But if they all agree, the changes could be introduced sooner. The main questions now are how the teams align themselves, with the non-GPWC ones already backing the FIA, and what Ferrari decides to do. While the FIA proposals would put the emphasis back on the driver and eliminate much of the hi-tech wizardry that has taken costs into the stratosphere, the major carmakers are unlikely to accept restrictions on electronics. Some could leave or scale down their involvement. Another cloud  of fundamental concern to the carmakers  is the question of who will run the show when Ecclestone, now 73, is no longer around and how the money will be shared. There is also the question of what will happen when tobacco sponsorship, a mainstay of the sport, is outlawed in the European Union from the middle of 2005. Then there is the matter of entertainment. Ferrari fans will have been delighted to see Schumacher winning on Sunday but Formula One is crying out for more battles on the track and fewer in the paddock. The big problem is that they all worry about their own politics, ego struggles, and forget this sport is made, or was made, for the public, said Niki Lauda on Sunday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England rout WI
 Chris Gayle celebrates his century on Saturday London: England hammered the West Indies by 10 wickets inside three days to win the fourth Test at The Oval on Saturday, claiming a 4-0 series whitewash and a record-equalling seventh consecutive Test win. Following on, the touring side were dismissed for 318 with pace bowler James Anderson taking four for 52. England had to bat again but Marcus Trescothick knocked off the single run needed to win with a four. The Michael Vaughan-led side has now equalled the England record of seven successive Test wins set in 1928/29. England completed 10 wins out of 11 this year, including the 3-0 victory in the Caribbean in April. That betters the nine out of 10 wins recorded by Mike Brearleys side in 1978-79. Dwayne Bravo and Shivnarine Chanderpaul had earlier frustrated England with an 82-run fifth wicket stand to slow their quest for a second series clean sweep after the 3-0 rout of New Zealand in May and June. Gayle raced to his sixth Test century and first against England off just 80 balls. Producing several flourishing strokes, he smashed 17 fours and a six before celebrating his hundred by punching the air. (Reuters)  Copyright

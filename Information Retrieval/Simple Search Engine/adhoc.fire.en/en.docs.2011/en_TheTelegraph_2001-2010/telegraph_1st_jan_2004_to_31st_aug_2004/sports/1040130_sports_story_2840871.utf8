 Jugraj happy with recovery 
New Delhi: Jugraj Singh said on Thursday that he was recovering fast after undergoing treatment in the US and was hopeful of resuming light training within three to four months. I am recovering well. According to the doctors I can start light training within three to four months from now, Jugraj said on the sidelines of All India DDA Invitational hockey tournament on Thursday. Jugraj, who came to the ground to meet his Punjab Police teammates before their semi-final against IOC, said he would undergo physiotherapy for the next two months and then gradually start with other exercises before beginning to train. Asserting that he was very keen to return to the field at the earliest, Jugraj said he was overwhelmed by the support he got from his teammates in the national squad after the accident.

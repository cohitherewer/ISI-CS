The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB not short on motivation
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas BhowmickBhaichung BhutiaCalcutta, May 17: A successful season for East Bengal will come to an end on Tuesday, thousands of miles away from home fans  in Kuala Lumpur, where they take on Negeri Sembilan in the AFC Cup group E match. It will also mark the end of league matches in the second tier of the Asian club championship with the India champions needing just a draw to top the group. It will be a commendable showing indeed if they achieve it. Probably that is why, with a host of players out injured or not available for other reasons, coach Subhas Bhowmick is sure his players will not be short on motivation despite the fact that they have already made it to the quarter finals. Motivation can never be a problem for professional players. They are naturally motivated, whatever be the degree of the challenge. Plus, we have a great chance to top the group. That will inspire us too, the East Bengal coach told The Telegraph from the team hotel on Monday. Negeri Sembilan, who play in the Malaysian second division and qualified for this tournament by virtue of winning the FA Cup, had lost 2-4 to East Bengal in the first-leg match here in February. They had appeared to be a speedy and energetic lot in that game, though a bit rusty and inexperienced in certain areas. Things have not gone well for them in this tournament and they stand no chance of making the quarters, with just three points from five games. East Bengal have 13 from five. With just a draw required to accomplish mission, East Bengal will certainly be a bit cautious, without important players like M. Suresh, Douglas da Silva and Suley Musah. All three played crucial roles in the ASEAN triumph in Jakarta last July. Added to it, even Alvito DCunha is a doubtful starter because of a hamstring trouble and promising medio Subhas is out with injury. Rarely in the season have we got everybody together. Its become a part of the game. And what are the others here for if they dont do the job when some others are not available, was what the coach and some other players had to say about the problem. They informed Kuala Lumpur witnessed mild drizzle in the evening during the teams evening practice at the main stadium. Its cooler than Calcutta, said a player. They had trained at the Malaysian federation ground in the morning. It will be a big match for Bhaichung Bhutia. Not just because he played for the Malaysian club Perak FC for a brief while last year but also because the star striker had a forgettable outing in the previous game against Geylang United of Singapore. Impressing clubs outside India has always topped his agenda, and here is another chance for the India captain to draw more attention.  Copyright

 Murali to abide by ICC on doosra
 Murali will quit after 2007 World Cup Colombo: Test crickets world record-holder for wickets Muttiah Muralidharan of Sri Lanka on Wednesday hinted he will drop the controversial doosra delivery from his armoury after it was deemed illegal by the sports world governing body (reported briefly in Wednesdays Late City edition). The doosra has always been at the back of my mind, Muralidharan was quoted as saying in the Colombo-based Daily News in perhaps his first public statement on the controversial delivery. People have questioned me about it. I have done all the tests that are required and the reports have gone to the International Cricket Council (ICC). At the end of the day what matters is what the report, the expert, my cricket board and the ICC says. Sri Lankan cricket authorities on Wednesday confirmed they had asked the off-spinner not to bowl the doosra, a delivery which spins away from the right-handers instead of coming into them like a normal off-break. Muralidharan, with 521 wickets in 89 Tests, is unlikely to continue with the controversial delivery in Fridays second Test in Bulawayo following a ICC statement on Tuesday that it supported the SLCs decision to tell the bowler not to bowl the doosra delivery. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed on Tuesday warned that Muralidharan could face a 12-month ban if he persisted with the doosra. Muralidharan is currently within the six-week Stage-I phase of the ICCs bowling review process after being reported by Broad. Meanwhile Muralidharan said Wednesday he would quit international cricket after trying to win the 2007 World Cup for his country. The controversial off-spinner is also the third-highest wicket-taker in one-dayers with 360 victims, behind only the retired Pakistani pace duo of Wasim Akram (502) and Waqar Younis (416). Muralidharan could finish with more than 700 Test wickets before retiring if he maintains his current strike-rate of almost six wickets a match. The Sri Lankan, however, believes his Test record would not stay long.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Seven in lead after Round 3
Kozhikode: Defending champion Bhagyashree Thipsay of IDBI and six others were leading the table after three rounds in the National Womens B chess championship here on Sunday. While Bhagyashree had the measure of Amruta Mokul of Maharashtra, Mary Ann Gomes (GNCA) beat H. Nilavoli (TN) convincingly to take their tally to three points. Sowmya Swaminathan (Venus), N. Sandhya (Kerala), P. Sivasankari, J. E. Kavitha and H. Soumya (all TN) were the others in top spot. In a major upset, reigning under-16 Asian champion N. Vinudhna of Andhra Pradesh messed up her Sicilian defence game against Soumya. After losing a piece in the 12th, Vinudhna, in an attempt to regain lost ground, forced queen and rook exchanges in the 42nd and 43rd only to eventually lose in 50 moves. In second place with 2.5 points apiece were 10 players, including Swati Mohota.  Copyright

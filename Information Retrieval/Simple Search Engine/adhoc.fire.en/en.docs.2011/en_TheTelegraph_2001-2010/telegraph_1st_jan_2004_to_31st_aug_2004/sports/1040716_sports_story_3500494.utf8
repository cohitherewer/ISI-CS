The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunainas B sample also positive
New Delhi: Sunainas fate remained unchanged after her B sample also tested positive almost two months after the woman lifter was found guilty of doping in the senior Asian championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan in April. The International Weightlifting Federation had sent Sunainas B sample to Athens, where she was again declared positive for using banned drugs, Indian Weightlifting Federation general secretary Balbir Singh Bhatia said. Sunaina, who had won two bronze medals in the 58-kg category at the competition, has already been stripped of the medals and banned for two years from all the national and international events, according to the rules of the International Weightlifting Federation. The 24-year-old had requested for her B sample test after she had returned a positive test for banned drugs for her A sample two months ago. Sunaina knew that she was a strong contender for the Olympics team and it is very unfortunate that she got mired in doping controversy, Bhatia said. (PTI)  Copyright

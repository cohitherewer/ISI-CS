The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Just once more at Big W for Martina
 Martina Navratilova after losing to Gisela Dulko at Roland Garros on Tuesday Paris: Martina Navratilova is aiming at one more emotional appearance at Wimbledon this summer before she finally brings down the curtain on her four-decade long career. This is my last year playing, not because I dont think I could do it for a few more years. But its enough, said the 47-year-old Czech-born naturalised American legend after her controversial wildcard appearance at the French Open ended in predictable defeat on Tuesday at the hands of Argentinas Gisela Dulko, 28 years her junior. However, after collecting seven of her 18 career Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon, she wants to bow out only after one more appearance on the grass of the All England Club. The problem is, she needs a little help to get to south-west London in June. I need to see how the body holds up. I need to win a few matches at Eastbourne before I would put myself on the line at Wimbledon, said Navratilova who has yet to ask for a wildcard at the third Grand Slam of the season. She is still waiting to hear from the warm-up event at Eastbourne about an invitation. I was asking for a wildcard for the main draw but they said they dont do that until ten days before the tournament. Theres no doubt that Navratilova, with 167 singles titles and 173 doubles crowns, is still a draw card and can still play on fast courts  at Eastbourne two years ago, she played her first singles for eight years and embarrassed Tatiana Panova, the world No. 22. Furthermore, last year she teamed up with Leander Paes to win the mixed doubles at Wimbledon and the Australian Open. The reason I wanted to play singles again was to improve my doubles, to be a better player. I thought that if I could go out there and hold my own on a singles court, then it will help me in doubles. She had already played and lost two singles in Charleston and at Amelia Island earlier this year, again as a wildcard. That caused a stir. If I didnt feel I deserved a place in the tournament, then I would not have asked for a wildcard. I dont want a handout. I dont think I diminished the tournament by playing. If I didnt think I was one of the best 128 players in the world, I wouldnt have asked for it. I made $ 400,000 last year. Thats a pretty good living. Could I make a living out of singles still? Absolutely, I could. Her opinion on the current state of the womens Tour, a favourite topic, was re-ignited before the start of Tuesdays match when she was ordered by the umpire to remove a banned sponsors logo from her cap. She had to remove it with scissors before the tie could get underway. There are different rules for different logos. Were making it difficult for sponsors to get visibility so we dont get as much money in the sport as we could. Navratilova hopes that her legacy to the sport will be a lasting one when she does finally walk away at the end of the year. Times have changed, she said. (AFP)  Copyright

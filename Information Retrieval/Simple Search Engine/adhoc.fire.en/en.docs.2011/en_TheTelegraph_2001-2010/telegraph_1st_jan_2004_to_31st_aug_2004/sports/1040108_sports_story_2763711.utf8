(AFP) Milan: European champions AC Milan ended Serie A leaders AS Romas unbeaten run on Tuesday, Andriy Shevchenko scoring both goals in an impressive 2-1 victory in the capital. A thundering 25-metre strike from European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved gave Italian champions Juventus a 1-0 win over Perugia moving them within three points of AS Roma. Roma, who were unbeaten in their previous 14 games this season, still lead Serie A on 36 points from Juventus and Milan on 33, although Milan have a game in hand. Fourth-placed Inter Milan came from behind to beat Lecce 3-1 at the San Siro with second-half goals from Julio Ricardo Cruz, Ivan Cordoba and Christian Vieris 100th strike for the club. But Lazio, who had won their last three games, suffered a setback, losing 2-1 to Reggina after taking a first-half lead through Fabio Liverani. Former European Player of the Year Roberto Baggio scored twice for Brescia in their 4-2 win over Siena. Milan delivered a commanding display at the Olympic Stadium with a performance and result that indicated the race for the honours could well remain tight until the end. Milan took the lead in the 25th minute with a beautifully constructed goal. Clarence Seedorf picked out Shevchenko with a perfect cross-field pass which the Ukrainian chested down and expertly lofted over Roma keeper Ivan Pelizzoli. Fabio Capellos Roma fought back to level just before the break when Antonio Cassano tapped in at the back post. But Serie As top scorer Shevchenko was in devastating form and he grabbed the winner with his 14th goal of the season, latching on to a fine pass from Rui Costa and rifling it past Pelizzoli. I am delighted above all for the team, Shevchenko said. We were missing some key players and we showed great character here. We have nothing to prove to anyone. (Reuters)  Copyright

 New coach says India can win
 - Like Brazil in soccer, India are No. 1 in hockey: Rach  Tirkey and Co. look confident Athens: Indian hockey teams coach Gerhard Rach on Monday said the team has the wherewithal to emerge as one of the top teams in the world by regaining Olympic glory. Like Brazil in soccer, Indias place is at No. 1 in hockey, Rach said after the teams arrival here from Germany, where it attended a training-cum-competition programme. The players, led by Dilip Tirkey, looked confident after completing the 21-day final phase training camp at the RTHC Sports Complex at Leverkusen, near Dusseldorf. During this camp India played practice games with various German clubs, besides winning a three-match series against Ireland. Rach, the new coach following the sacking of Rajinder Singh, said he was getting good support from all the players and the support staff. He said India is capable of winning the Olympic title. I have had wholehearted support from all the players and the coaching staff. This is a fine blend, capable of reaching the pinnacle, the 56-year-old Munich-born coach said. Rachs assistant Oliver Kurtz, member of the gold medal winning team at the Barcelona Olympics, warned the opposition camps against taking the side lightly. Dont underestimate these fellows, he said. Kurtz, who has been with the team since the training stint in Arizona, added that the team hoped to peak in the competition after their final fine-tuning. Goalkeeping Frank Leictre, who is also here but will not be part of the team, said he had given intense training to Devesh Chauhan and Adrian DSouza. The focus was on technical aspects emphasising on body movements and corner rebounds apart from ample practice with the ball machines, he said. India are in pool B which also includes holders Holland, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa. Meanwhile, the Indian flag will be ceremonially hoisted at the Olympic Games village on Tuesday, marking a special moment for the Indian contingent in Athens. Most members of the Indian contingent have checked into the Games village and will take part in the flag-hoisting ceremony to be held late in the evening in the presence of some top members of the organising committee, according to information received here. The ceremony has been kept for the evening. It will be a special moment for the Indian contingent, one of the IOA officials said from Athens.  (PTI)  Copyright

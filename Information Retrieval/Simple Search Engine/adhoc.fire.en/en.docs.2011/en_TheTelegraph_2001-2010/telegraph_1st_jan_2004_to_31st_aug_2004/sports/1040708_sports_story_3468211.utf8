 Chelsea draw up wish list of defenders
 - Four classy stoppers in contention for Desaillys spot  BY HENRY WINTER  Ricardo Carvalho enjoyed a superb Euro 2004 Jose Mourinho admitted on Tuesday that Chelsea are chasing a new, high-class centre half to replace Marcel Desailly, who has called time on his six-year spell at Stamford Bridge. This means the club will consider the merits of Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, Alessandro Nesta and Ricardo Carvalho. Drawing up such a wish list is easily done; actually enticing one of these classy international stoppers to west London will be far trickier. Ferdinands attraction to Chelsea is obvious: good in possession, he has improved markedly as a defender under David OLeary at Leeds United and now Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. Now 25, the former West Ham United player has London roots and is close to many of the English players at Chelsea such as Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and John Terry. He also has an agent, Pini Zahavi, who works closely with Chelsea. Yet it is difficult to imagine United being willing to offload a record signing who they have backed throughout his suspension for failing to take a drugs test at a stipulated time. Ferdinands form was outstanding for United in the months before his ban began. Campbell, 29, impressed everyone at Euro 2004, a tournament attended enthusiastically by Chelseas billionaire patron, Roman Abramovich. Campbells pace, strength and tackling qualities led to him being named in the squad of the tournament by Uefas technical gurus. Yet Arsenal are hardly likely to countenance selling Campbell, the rock on which so many opponents moves foundered last season. Nesta, 28, went home early from Euro 2004 but his reputation as one of the worlds top centre backs was undamaged despite Italys failure. Mobile, swift and a brilliant interceptor, Nesta would be a revelation in the Premiership. Whether the Italian international would be willing to leave a successful AC Milan side remains debatable, although Abramovich can offer greater wages than anyone. Carvalho enjoyed a superb Euro 2004, barring the final disappointment. The Porto defenders unflustered style and careful distribution appeal to many coaches, not least Mourinho, who coached Carvalho to last seasons Champions League triumph. Having paid Porto a hefty 13 million for right back Paulo Ferreira, Mourinho may be less willing to send out another excessive fee to his old employers. Real Madrid are also believed to be interested in Carvalho, 26. So far, Chelsea have failed to recruit any world-class talents, although this might be because Mourinho wants players he can mould to fit his grand design. He likes players who are young and ambitious like him. Mourinho could do worse than look at the athletic Greek centre half, Traianos Dellas, comfortably the most effective central defender of Euro 2004. Desailly, who has ended his contract with Chelsea by mutual consent, will return to France to consider his future. The 36-year-old French World Cup winner also retired from international football last week after a disappointing Euro 2004 and a record 116 appearances for his country. Desailly was signed by Gianluca Vialli for 4.6 million from AC Milan in 1998 and proved to be worth every penny as he went on to make 222 appearances for Chelsea, captaining the side on 94 occasions. He was a key performer in one of the most successful periods in the clubs history.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

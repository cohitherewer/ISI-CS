The Telegraph - Calcutta
 North hold the edge
 - DULEEP FINAL - Nehra-Yuvraj out to prove fitness; Dhoni likely to keep in place of Deep  Yuvraj will bolster the North batting Mohali: North Zone and East Zone meet here in the Duleep Trophy final from Thursday under the eyes of national selectors who will be scrutinising performances before selecting the Test squad for the Pakistan tour. The focus will be on North duo Yuvraj Singh and Ashish Nehra who have been asked to show they have completely recovered from injuries in what could be termed a live fitness test. Both have been named in the 15-man squad for the one-day International series in Pakistan. Yuvraj had cited a sore shoulder for skipping the league stage of the tournament while Nehra has not bowled a ball in a competitive game since returning from Australia. The focus will also be on Bihars wicketkeeper-batsman Mahender Singh Dhoni, whose name was discussed prominently before picking the ODI squad for Pakistan. Dhoni wasnt in the XI for Easts first match and played as a batsman in the previous match where Deep Dasgupta kept wickets. It has been learnt that Deep is being troubled with a back pain and his chances of playing are slim. He sprained his back during practice in the morning and if he doesnt recover, Dhoni will be handed the big gloves. He doesnt seem to be in good shape and his chances of recovering before the match are slim, said a source. If Deep doesnt recover in time, his place will go to Rohan Gavaskar. Had Deep not bee injured, Gavaskar would have replaced Arindam Das in the XI. Deodhar Trophy champions East should be no pushovers. Skipper Devang Gandhi, though, has been short of runs and will be hoping to lead from the front against a varied attack. The wicket is quite green and the toss will be crucial, he said. But we are not worried about the big names in the opposition camp. We have beaten them in the recent past and play them quite frequently these days, which means our boys have learnt that there is nothing to be afraid of, said the East skipper. There are several players who would want to grab this opportunity to impress the five wise men of Indian cricket. They will no doubt take heart from Ramesh Powars case. The Mumbai allrounder, who bowls off-spin, has been rewarded for his consistent performance at the domestic cricket with a place in the Pakistan-bound one-day squad. The pitches thus far in this competition have not been conducive to good cricket, with the dice loaded heavily in favour of either bowlers or batsmen. In Gurgaon, Central and West failed to complete the first innings after four days of toil. In Dharamshala, West floundered in their chase of a modest 199 against North. South, on the other hand, chased an incredible 500-plus target set by England A. The PCA Stadium pitch here is expected to be a sporting one, keeping both batters and bowlers interested. North are on a high after notching up two wins in as many matches en route to the final. They will start the final as favourites, no doubt banking on a strong bowling attack which has been the strongest in the tournament. For East, Shiv Sundar Das, sidelined for poor form after a decent run as India opener, has scored consistently in this competition and could be the main thorn in Norths path. East have a useful attack comprising pacemen Shib Shankar Paul and Debashish Mohanty, off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri and left-arm spinner Utpal Chatterjee. Paul forced his way into the India A team with a bagful of wickets for Bengal. A big haul here could make him a contender for the Pakistan trip. Containing the strong North batting wont be easy but theres enough motivation for some East players to throw a substantial challenge.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

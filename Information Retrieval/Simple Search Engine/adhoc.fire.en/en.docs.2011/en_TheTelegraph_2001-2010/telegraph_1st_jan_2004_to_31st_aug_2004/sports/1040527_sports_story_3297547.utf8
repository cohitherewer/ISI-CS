 Humpy leads in pre-quarters
Elista (Kalmykia): Top-seeded Grandmaster Koneru Humpy scored a win over Tatiana Kosintseva of Russia in the third round of womens world chess championship and got the well deserved lead in the two-game pre-quarterfinals at the city chess complex here on Wednesday. The day produced as many as five decisive games. The winners were Georgias world junior girls champion Nana Dzagnidze and former world womens champion Maia Chiburdanidze, Russian Ekaterina Kovalevskaya, Ketino Kachianig of Germany and Humpy. Interestingly, four of these five victories were scored by players who played black including Humpy and this should make their task a little easier in the return game on Thursday as all of them will need just draws to proceed to the quarter finals. The lone player to prove that white indeed was the better colour was Kovalevskaya who grounded high profile 14-year-old Ukrainian Ketryna Lahno. Humpy played risky chess right from the start. Hardly anyone expected her to play an age-old variation of the modern defence that failed to give her the dynamic balance she was looking for. Kosintseva held her position together for a long time and when opportunity arose, went for the decisive breakthrough on the queen side that yielded an excellent position. With her back to the wall, Humpy struck back first with a gritty defence and later with a brilliant counterattack that left Kosintseva gasping for breath. Losing a pawn after a disastrous 31st move, Kosintseva knew her chances had dissipitated.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Coaches being made soft targets: Sandhu
New Delhi: Sacked national weightlifting coach Pal Singh Sandhu on Saturday alleged that coaches were being made soft targets in the doping scandal but added that he was ready to face any punishment if found guilty. The coaches are being made the soft targets. They are always targeted by the officials and the media, Sandhu said after returning from Athens this morning. The former coach said that the government did not even bother to wait for coaches to return home and listen to their version. They (government) didnt even take our views before taking such severe action. We had gone to Athens under IOA. We did not go to any fair. They think we ignored the lifters or played with our countrys image. But they should know that IOA had set up a committee under K P Singh Deo, chairman of its sports commission, then and there which is still to complete its probe, said the Dronacharya awardee coach. Sandhu alongwith Belarussian coach Leonid Taranenko got the axe from the government last week after two Indian women lifters, Pratima Kumari (63kg) and Sanamacha Chanu (53kg) tested positive in the dope tests in Athens. Reacting to Pratimas outburst against him and Taranenko, Sandhu claimed, I have not given my lifters a pill even for headache. He also argued against the professed naivete of the two tainted lifters saying they are smart enough to speak out when in trouble. Dont they understand what to take and what not to? Sandhu said it was possible that pratima was influenced by her personal advisor which landed her in a soup. She has a personal advisor about whom i will tell you only after the inquiry is over, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India ready for Pak challenge
 - JR ASIA CUP FINAL - Well take inspiration from cricket wins, says Michael  Skipper Sandeep Michael says Indians are determined to clinch their maiden title Karachi: Having sealed a berth in the junior World Cup, the Indians are keyed up to clinch their maiden Asia Cup hockey crown when they meet arch-rivals Pakistan in the final here on Thursday. The first task was to qualify for next years junior World Cup in Holland Thats been achieved, our next aim is to win our maiden Asian title, captain Sandeep Michael said on Wednesday. We have been waiting for this moment for the last one and a half years, and the boys are ready for the Pakistan challenge We are determined to take home the Asia Cup. The high-voltage clash between the neighbours across the border, the first one in hockey on Pakistan soil for five years, follows the much-hyped ODI and Test series both of which India won. Well take inspiration from the cricket teams success here and also from the fact that we have won the two of the last three matches at junior level, said the 21-year-old Michael. India downed Pakistan 2-0 in the four-nation meet in Malaysia, drew 1-1 in Cairo and triumphed 5-0 in Poland in junior-level clashes over the last two years. Penalty corner expert Sandeep Singh, who scored all five goals in Poland, is again the main weapon for the reigning world junior champions. Yes, well bank on Sandeep again after a tough game against Korea in the semis we expect a more open game with Pakistan, said Michael. Singh, the tournaments top-scorer with 14 goals, failed to convert any of the four penalty corners and also missed a penalty stroke in the 4-3 win against Korea on Tuesday. Korea blocked us and we had no clue what to do. We played defensive hockey which could have cost us dear, Michael said. Pakistan is a tough side and are playing in their own den, so its a 50-50 match. Pakistan coach Asif Bajwa said the pressure had lessened considerably after both teams ensured World Cup qualification. The performance by the two junior teams proves that the future of hockey in both these countries is safe, the former Olympian said. Pakistan will look to their schemer and captain Shakil Abbasi and penalty corner expert Imran Warsi to shine in the final. In Wednesdays classification matches, China beat Singapore 2-0 to clinch seventh spot while Chinese Taipei won 3-2 against Sri Lanka to finish 11th. Defending Asian junior champions Korea take on Malaysia in the third place play-off match before Thursdays final.  (PTI)  Copyright

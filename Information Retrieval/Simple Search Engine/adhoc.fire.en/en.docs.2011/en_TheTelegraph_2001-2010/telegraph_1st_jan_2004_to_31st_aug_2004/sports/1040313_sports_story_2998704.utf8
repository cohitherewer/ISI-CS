 Agassi raps ATP
Indian Wells: Andre Agassi said on Thursday the ATP should apologise to Greg Rusedski if it is discovered mens tennis governing body gave the Briton a supplement that was contaminated. The ATP has put this in the hands of the IOC and WADA to make sure that the appropriate things are done, Agassi said. I believe you should go above and beyond in supporting your players. Assuming there was a cross-contamination, there should definitely be an apology.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

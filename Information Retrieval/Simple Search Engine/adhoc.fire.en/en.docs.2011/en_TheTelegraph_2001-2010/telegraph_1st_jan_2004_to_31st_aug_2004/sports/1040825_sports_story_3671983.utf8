The Telegraph - Calcutta
 11-year-old holds top seed 
 A CORRESPONDENT  Bitan Banerjee at Gorky Sadan on Tuesday Calcutta: Eleven-year-old Bitan Banerjee of Baruipur HS held top seed Debayan Majumdar to a draw in the fifth round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship in Gorky Sadan on Tuesday. Playing with aggression, Bitan won a pawn early in the game but failed to convert his advantage into a win in a double rook ending. At the end of the fifth round, five players  Rajib Dhar, Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar, Soumya Thakurta, Jain Shrenik Daklia and Ashish Kumar  jointly share the lead with five points each. On the second board, Rajib Dhar of Guwahati had to struggle against Sourav Chakraborti of St James School. Mihazuddin Ahmed Sagar of Bangladesh, though, outwitted Sandipan Chatterjee of Shree Jain Vidyalaya for Boys in 59 moves. Unlike his last two games, Sagar for once was in total control of the game, which arose from a Sicilian defence. Soumya Thakurta of St James School obtained positional advantage in the Ruy Lopez opening against the Bhubaneswar leg champion, Swayms Mishra, and went on to win the game in 50 moves.

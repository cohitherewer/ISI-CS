The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anju fourth in Osaka
Osaka, May 8 (AFP): Anju Bobby George missed out on a podium finish at the IAAF Japan Grand Prix as she came fourth in womens long jump on Saturday. The Indian, who had hoped to kick-start her Olympic tune-up with a medal in Osaka, managed a below-par 6.46 metres. Japans Kumiko Ikeda emerged the surprise winner with a leap of 6.65. American Upshaw, the world No. 6, won the silver with 6.58 while another Japanese Maho Hanaoka took the bronze clearing 6.57. The next stop for Anju, the first Indian to win a medal at the world athletics meet, will be Doha for the Super Grand Prix on Friday. Sydney Olympics champion Maurice Greene was just two hundredths of a second off his fastest time of the season in winning the mens 100m.  Copyright

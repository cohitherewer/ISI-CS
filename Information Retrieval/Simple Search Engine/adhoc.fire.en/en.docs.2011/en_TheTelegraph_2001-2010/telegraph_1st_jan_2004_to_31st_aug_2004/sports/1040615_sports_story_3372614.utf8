The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Czechs guarding against complacency
 Were pleased to be playing Latvia first but thats no good unless we win, says Nedved Lisbon: Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech, the 22-year-old who is joining Chelsea after Euro 2004, knows they must avoid complacency against outsiders Latvia in their opening Group D clash in Aveiro on Tuesday. Once one of the most consistently skillful nations in European soccer, the Czechs want to make up for their flop in the finals four years ago by emerging successfully from a tough group. Now, with several of the older generation from the Team of the 90s heading for retirement, they hope to realise their great potential with a trophy. A flying start against surprise Baltic qualifiers Latvia, in the first official competitive meeting between the two nations, is expected. But Cech, like captain and key forward Pavel Nedved, has warned against taking the Latvians lightly. Cech, who has risen up the ranks since playing superbly at the European under-21 finals in Switzerland in 2002, has earned a reputation as a penalty-saving expert. He hopes he will not have to rely on this specialist ability against Latvia. Weve had a good two weeks preparation and are ready to go, he said.Its vital we get off to a good start, especially with Germany and the Dutch to come. Complacency, a familiar enemy to teams filled with skilful players like the Czechs, has also been identified as a real danger by Nedved.Just because Latvia are not so famous does not mean we can concentrate any less, he said. Were a good team but certainly not favourites (to win the tournament), added the European Footballer of the Year, who has hinted he will retire from internationals after Euro 2004. You only have to look at the result of Portugal against Greece (a 2-1 defeat for the hosts) to realise that there are no bad teams in this tournament. Were pleased to be playing Latvia first but thats no good unless we go and win the game. The heat has also been a problem for the Czechs. Nedved has complained of dehydration and headaches after training but should be fit to take his place in a wide attacking midfield role in 64-year-old coach Karel Brueckners flexible 4-4-2 system, revived after his experiment with three at the back failed during their defeat by Japan in a warm-up game. He expects defender Marek Jankulovski to recover from a groin strain, while playmaker Tomas Rosicky has shaken off a similar problem. If Jankulovski fails to make it, Zdenek Grygera could switch flanks to accommodate Martin Jiranek. Latvia coach Aleksandrs Starkovs may bring in defensive midfielder Juris Laizans, if he shakes off a slight leg injury, but will rely on Marian Pahars to provide the chances in attack for Maris Verpakovskis. While realistic about his teams chances of progressing to the last eight, Verpakovskis believes his side will show they deserve to be in Portugal and are not just there to make up the numbers. Latvia hasnt got much of a chance to qualify for the quarter finals, said the slightly-built Verpakovskis. It is the first time that we are competing in a finals and it is an opportunity to show what we can do. I dream of getting a move to Serie A, he confessed.

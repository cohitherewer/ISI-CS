 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rupesh Roy, who beat Chris Eaton 6-3, 7-5 to reach the semi-finals, at DKS on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Girls top seed Madura Ranganathan crashed out of the ONGC-ITF junior tennis championship at the DKS courts on Thursday. She lost to sixth seed Yana Nemerovski from Israel 7-5, 0-6, 1-6 in a match lasting 104 minutes. Yana hit six aces during the match with three of them coming in the first set. Yana broke Madura in the fourth and tenth games and failed to keep her serve in the fifth, seventh and 11th games. Having lost the first set, Yana never looked back and dominated the proceedings. The Indian hardly got an opportunity to bounce back. Sixth-seeded Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan was defeated by unseeded Xiao-Peng Lai of Hong Kong in straight sets 6-4, 6-4. In girls doubles, the top-seeded pair of Kartiki Bhat and S. Punam Reddy were ousted by the Thai-Belgian pair of Pichittra Thongdach and Yanina Wickmayer 6-2, 7-5. Rupesh Roy advanced to the semi-finals in boys singles by beating Britains Chris Eaton 6-3, 7-5. In the doubles, the Rupesh-Anshuman Dutta pair beat Liran Levy and Guy Koby of Israel 6-1, 6-2.

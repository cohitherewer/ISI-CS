 Humpy in pre-quarters
Humpy played fine defensive chessElista (Kalmykia): Top seed Koneru Humpy marched her way into the pre-quarterfinals while Alexandra Kosteniuk and Alisa Galliamova of Russia were knocked out on a disastrous day for the seasoned campaigners at the world womens chess championship on Tuesday. In the second game of Round II, Humpy advanced with an easy draw with IM Peng Zhaoqin of the Netherlands at the city chess complex. But last world championship finalist Kosteniuk was shown the door by Viktorija Cmilyte of Lithuania. Second seed Galliamova suffered a similar fate as she bowed out of the championship following her back-to-back defeats at the hands of Maia Lomineishvili of Georgia. Humpy played some fine defensive chess. Winning the first game made all the difference, she said after the game. She was under pressure to win and I just had to keep my position intact. The middle arising out of a Queens Gambit gave only a minuscule advantage to Peng who played white and the Dutch maintained it right till the very end. However, as is often the case, a slight advantage is hardly ever decisive in games between strong players. The exchanges at regular intervals kept Humpy in the game and eventually an end game with bishops of opposite colour was reached that just required precise pawn exchanges. Peng delayed the inevitable till the 49th move before signing her ouster papers. I am going to take one game at a time and the aim is to reach the finals, said Humpy. Kosteniuk blitzed out the opening moves of the Semi-Slav Defence with her black pieces. Cmilyte however gained control in the middle game but did not press too hard as a draw was all she required. In the end the perpetual checks dealt the knockout blow to Kosteniuk. Playing black in the second game, Lomineishvili was positive right through against Galliamova. The Russian, on the other hand, went for a desperate attack after sacrificing a pawn but could not claim any desirable compensation. Lomineishvili clinched the issue in just 33 moves.

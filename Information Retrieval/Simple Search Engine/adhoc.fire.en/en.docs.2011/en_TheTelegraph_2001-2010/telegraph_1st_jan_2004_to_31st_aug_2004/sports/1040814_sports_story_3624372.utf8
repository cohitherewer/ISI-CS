The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Windfall in store
Athens: The age-old Olympic ethos dictates that its not the winning but the taking part that counts. Yet the prospect of earning millions and being set for life will be a powerful motivating force for athletes in Athens. The founder of the modern Olympic movement Baron Pierre de Coubertin might not have liked it, but a gold medal is seen by many as a passport to riches. Not only is Michael Phelps on a $1 million bonus for a seven gold medal haul in the Athens pool, but others will come away from Athens with the livelihoods secured. The 19-year-old Phelps is aiming for US icon Mark Spitzs record of seven swimming golds at one Games, a feat Spitz accomplished in Munich in 1972. An American bank is offering a $5,00,000 bonus to any US athlete who wins the gold medal in the mens and womens marathon in Athens. Even Communist China is getting into the act with their gold medallists in line for a cash bonus of 2,00,000 yuan ($24,000)Russias gold medal winners in Athens could receive the biggest bonuses the country has paid to their Olympic champions. We havent come up with the exact sum yet but it should be at least $60,000 and could go as high as $1,00,000 in addition to what the government had already promised our gold medallists, Russian Olympic committee president Leonid Tyagachyov said. Russia estimate they could win at least 30 gold medals in Athens. Even athletes from tiny Baltic state of Lithuania will get into the act with each gold medal fetching a cash bonus of more than $1,00,000 and paid for by the Lithuanian government. Indonesias mens badminton champions at the 1996 Atlanta Games, Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, split $4,22,000 between them, while Filipino light flyweight boxer Mansueto Velasco took home nearly $1,00,000, a car and a $300/month lifetime pension.

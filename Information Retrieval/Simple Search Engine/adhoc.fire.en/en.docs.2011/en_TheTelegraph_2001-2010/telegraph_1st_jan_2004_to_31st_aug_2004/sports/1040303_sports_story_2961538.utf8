The Telegraph - Calcutta
 5-wkt win for NZ 
 - Sixth ODI - SA bite the dust yet again to lose series 1- 5  Stephen Fleming holds the trophy after beating South Africa by five wickets at McLean Park in Napier on Tuesday. (AP) Napier: Opener Michael Papps made a painstaking 92 to steer New Zealand to a five-wicket win over South Africa in the sixth ODI on Tuesday. The hosts thus completed a 5-1 series win. Papps carried his bat through the New Zealand innings, for 201 minutes, hitting his tenth boundary from the last ball of the 46th over to take the home side past South Africas 186 for nine. New Zealand finished at 190 for five, capping their first series win over South Africa in Tests or ODIs, with a dominating performance. The win lifted New Zealand to third behind Australia and South Africa in world ODI rankings. Its a pretty rapid climb but we knew theres a group of about three or four teams that were pretty close, said New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming. We knew what was on offer today, probably didnt play as polished as we would have liked but it was still a good win. The unlikely hero for South Africa was Makhaya Ntini, who made a career-beat 42 not out and shared a record tenth wicket partnership of 67 with Albie Morkel. This unbroken stand followed a record seventh wicket partnership of 63 between Lance Klusener and Ashwell Prince which began the South African recovery from 40 for six. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum took five catches as Daryl Tuffey, Michael Mason and Jacob Oram scythed through the South African top order. Prince, playing in only his third ODI, was the first batsman to meet the bowlers with any real defiance. He lacked support until the veteran Klusener joined him. Prince made 47 before being brilliantly caught and bowled by Jacob Oram. Klusener was run out for 35, leaving South Africas innings precariously balanced and it seemed they would be dismissed inside their previous lowest of 147 against New Zealand. But from 119 for nine, Morkel and Ntini took the attack to the New Zealand bowlers. Ntini blasted two sixes off Chris Harris to signal his intentions and added three fours in a fierce rearguard action. Morkel was happy to rotate the strike. New Zealand built their innings around man of the match Papps, who gave the chase a solid platform as the junior partner in a 58-run opening stand with Fleming, who batted elegantly before being run out for 32. Its a confidence booster, and great to contribute to the team, Papps said. Its a great environment and were playing good cricket. There were brief signs of weakness in the New Zealand middle-order, when Chris Cairns was bowled around his legs by Peterson for ten and when Scott Styris was caught behind for the same score. Styris was out in bizarre circumstances, charging down the wicket at Shaun Pollock and deflecting the ball off an inside edge to Mark Boucher behind the stumps. South African captain Graeme Smith admitted later he had made a mistake in choosing to bat.  I didnt think the pitch would have any movement in it and it did, he said. It was a two-game wicket.

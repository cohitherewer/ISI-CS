The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal closer to record
London: Arsenal are one game away from a place in the history books after a 1-0 win over London rivals Fulham on Sunday. If the champions avoid defeat against relegated Leicester on Saturday they will become the first side to go through an entire league campaign unbeaten since Preston North Ends Invincibles achieved the feat in 1888-89.  Newcastles hopes of ending the campaign with something to celebrate took a knock when as they were held 1-1 by Wolves. The significance of the result is simple: Newcastle must beat Southampton on Wednesday and Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday to claim fourth place and the final qualifying spot for next seasons Champions League. Newcastle dropped two crucial points as captain Alan Shearer having a late penalty saved by Wolves goalkeeper Paul Jones. At St James Park Newcastle thought the three points were in the bag when a Paul Ince push on Gary Speed gave them an 83rd-minute penalty. But Jones threw himself to his right to deny Shearer. Jones save capped a comeback from the visitors, for whom Viorel Ganea scored a 70th-minute equaliser to cancel out Lee Bowyers first half strike. (AFP)  Copyright

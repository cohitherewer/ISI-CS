The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sweden hold Italy 1-1
Porto: A spectacular late equaliser by striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave Sweden a 1-1 draw with Italy at Euro 2004 on Friday and put his team firmly in the driving seat for a place in the quarter finals. Ibrahimovic scored in a goalmouth scramble in the 85th minute, hooking the ball over his shoulder with the outside of his right foot. Antonio Cassano, standing in for the suspended Francesco Totti, had opened the scoring for Italy in the 37th minute when he headed home a Christian Panucci cross. Tiotti, suspended for three matches for spitting and unable to play again unless they reach the semi-finals, was barely missed in the first half as Italy played some of the best soccer at the tournament so far. But Sweden, 5-0 conquerors of Bulgaria in their opening match, came back strongly in the second and deserved their goal. They and Denmark lead group C on four points with Italy on two. Italy deservedly led Sweden 1-0 at halftime Antonio Cassano headed them in front in the 37th minute following almost endless pressure on the Swedish defence. Cassano deftly headed a Panucci cross wide of goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson, who had blocked everything else Italy had thrown at him almost from the first whistle. The goal came after Christian Vieri and Alessandro Del Piero had failed with five good scoring chances between them.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

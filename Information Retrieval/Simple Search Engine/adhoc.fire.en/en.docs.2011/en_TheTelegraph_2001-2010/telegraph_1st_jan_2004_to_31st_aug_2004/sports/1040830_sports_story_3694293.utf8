 Athens samples to be frozen, says Rogge
Athens: Thousands of samples from drug tests on athletes in Athens will be stored in deep freeze and re-examined at a later date as new anti-doping technology develops, olympic chief Jacques Rogge said on Sunday. Vowing no let-up in the war on doping, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Rogge said the record number of drug cheats unmasked at the Athens Games was proof that the hard-line approach was working. So far a total of 23 athletes  including two gold medal winners  have been excluded from the Olympics for doping offences. And Rogge warned on Sunday that that figure could rise as more sophisticated tests were developed to detect the latest designer drugs concocted by the cheaters laboratories. There is that possibility, Rogge admitted when asked if the number of doping cases from the 2004 Games could rise in the coming months. We will take the samples from the games and put them in deep freeze. If new tests emerge we will re-test those samples. We can do that for up to eight years after the Games. And if the new tests reveal anything, the results will be changed. Rogge said drug-testing at the Olympics had increased by 20 per cent since the Sydney Games in an effort to rid the sport of the problem. Rogge, a surgeon who has made the war on drugs the centre-piece of his reign since he took over as IOC chief in 2001, said there would be no let-up in the anti-doping blitz.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

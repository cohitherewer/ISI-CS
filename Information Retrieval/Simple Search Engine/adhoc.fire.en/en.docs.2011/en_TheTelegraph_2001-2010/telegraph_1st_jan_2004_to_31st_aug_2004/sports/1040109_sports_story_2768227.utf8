 Silly Billy says hes not a clown
 Bowden defends showing emotions after Steve farewell Wellington: New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden has denied claims that his exuberant behaviour at the end of Steve Waughs farewell Test in Sydney was unprofessional. Bowden, who stood in the fourth and final Test between India and Australia  the last of Waughs distinguished career  hugged the Australian captain, took photographs and grabbed stumps as souvenirs as the emotionally charged match ended on Tuesday. He admitted on Thursday that he had been affected by the occasion as Waugh left the Sydney Cricket Ground to a standing ovation after scoring 80 that went a long way in ensuring a respectable draw for his team. But the flamboyant umpire denied that his behaviour had been improper for a match official. I dont think I was being unprofessional, Bowden told a Wellington newspaper. It was after the game. I was exhausted after all the pressure involved. It was time to relax and do what you like. Steves going was a special moment for me and I wanted to capture it with my camera. Bowden said he hugged Waugh and told him thanks for the memories and all the best. Bowden also gave one of his two souvenir stumps to Waugh on learning the Australian captain did not have one. It was a way of saying thank you for all the support he had given in the last two weeks, he said. Bowdens behaviour has been widely remarked upon in Australia but he stoutly defended his flamboyance. I am not a clown. My first priority is to get the decisions right but I want to enjoy it and entertain the crowd. Bowden is due to officiate in three One-day Internationals between New Zealand and Pakistan in New Zealand over the next 10 days. (AP)  Copyright

 Cubas bare hands and sweat ready to take on US
Havana: At Cubas National Boxing School, rigorous training, a dose of ideology and the desire to beat the US make up for the lack of equipment. Muscles shine with sweat as boxers beat truck tyres with rudimentary metal bars and punch a sand bag in a spartan gym. The headquarters of the Cuban boxing team on the outskirts of Havana has been turned into a boot camp for the countrys best fighters heading for next months Athens Olympics. For inspiration, pictures on the wall include three-time Olympic heavyweight champion Teofilo Stevenson and a young Fidel Castro in military fatigues raising his gloved fists in the air. A slogan above the ring declares: In Cuba we only love those who resist and the rest we tolerate. Boxing is well suited to the Cuban character: we are brave, resolute, selfless. We have strong convictions and clear definition. We are pugnacious and we like to fight, said coach Alcides Sagarra, the father of Cubas Olympic successes. Some people fight and lose. We fight to win. We are training to take all 11 gold medals in Athens. Thinking small doesnt give results, he said. Cuba has consistently produced some of the worlds best amateur boxers, most notably since Castros 1959 revolution got rid of the scourge of professional boxing, the worst exploitation of man by man that made some rich and left many boxers battered and poor, Sagarra said.

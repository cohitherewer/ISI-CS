 Lippi to turn to youth 
 - My vision is of a true expression of Italian football, says new coach  Vieri was one of the biggest culprits Rome: Italy are to put their faith in youth as they look to bounce back from their bitter disappointment at Euro 2004. The Azzurri, who last won a trophy 22 years ago when they were crowned world champions in Spain, finished third behind Denmark and Sweden in group C and failed to reach the knockout stages. Their early exit came two years after their shock second-round defeat to South Korea at the World Cup and new coach Marcello Lippi wants to rejuvenate his squad to ensure they fare better in Germany in 2006. I dont want to revolutionise the squad, said Lippi, who replaced Giovanni Trapattoni in the Italy hot seat 10 days ago. The main structure will remain the same with the addition of several young players. I want a blend of experience and enthusiasm. My vision is of a true expression of Italian football, mixing under-21 internationals who need experience and the kind of great players we saw at Euro 2004. Lippi, of course, was being diplomatic as the truth is most of Italys more experienced players badly underperformed in Portugal. The biggest culprits were strikers Alessandro Del Piero and Christian Vieri, who both failed to score, while fellow forward Francesco Totti hardly set a glowing example to the younger players in the squad when he picked up a three-match ban for spitting at a Danish opponent in Italys first match. While Del Piero and Vieri floundered, Roma striker Antonio Cassano shone and was Italys most effective forward, scoring twice and putting in the kind of performances his older peers did four years ago. Trapattoni unwisely stuck by Del Piero and Vieri even though they had poor seasons in Serie A, but Lippi is unlikely to be so accommodating just because of past glories. Trapattoni did not have the courage of his convictions to take Alberto Gilardino to Portugal and the Parma hot shot instead went to play for the Azzurrini in the under-21 championships in Germany. Gilardinos goals inspired Italy to success, a 2-1 victory over Serbia and Montenegro in the final booking them a place in this summers Olympic Games in Athens. Lippi, who won five league titles and one Champions League trophy during two spells with Juventus, has hinted Gilardino will be given the chance to show what he can do and his under-21 teammates Daniele Bonera (Parma) and Daniele De Rossi (Roma) are also expected to receive call-ups in the near future. In fairness to Trapattoni, Italys former coach was often unable to call up the players he wanted for games due to their club commitments. But Italian Football League chief Adriano Galliani has insisted Lippi will receive all the help he needs to make Italy a team to be feared. We will work with him. After failing in the past two tournaments we must become a force again by the time of the next World Cup. Lippis first match in charge is against Iceland on August 18.  (AFP)  Copyright

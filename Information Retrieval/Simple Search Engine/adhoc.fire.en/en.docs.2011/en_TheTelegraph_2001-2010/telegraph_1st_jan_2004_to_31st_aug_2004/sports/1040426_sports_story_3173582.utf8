The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3rd ODI rained off
Port-of-Spain: The third one-day International between West Indies and England was abandoned without a ball being bowled on Sunday due to intermittent rain and a soaked outfield at the Queens Park Oval.  Umpires Aleem Dar of Pakistan and Billy Doctrove of Dominica were to inspect the Queens Park Oval outfield for a second time at 16.30 GMT, but the rain started again just prior to their inspection. Torrential rain at the same venue also caused the abandonment of Saturdays second one-dayer in the seven-match series when just 16 overs were possible. England lead the series 1-0 after winning the first match in Guyana last Sunday in a game also reduced to 30 overs per side because of rain. The fourth match is to take place in Grenada on Wednesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

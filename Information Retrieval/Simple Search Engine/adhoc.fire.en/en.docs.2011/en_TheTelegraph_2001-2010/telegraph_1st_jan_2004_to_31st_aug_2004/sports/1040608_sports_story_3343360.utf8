				 																																	Islamabad: Disgraced former Pakistan captain Salim Malik plans to open a private coaching centre for young players later this year. Malik said he had already found a site for his academy in Lahore. I want to start a new career as coach because everyone I meet asks me why I dont start coaching the budding players and I would want the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to avail my services, Malik said.				 																																	I have selected the site in Lahore and hopefully will start coaching later this year because I realise my duty as a former player to overcome the shortage of good batsmen in the country, he said. I have not played since the ban but follow cricket with the same interest of my playing days.				 																																	Why cant our board give me a chance to clear my image like that given to Hansie Cronje. I am also keen on coaching in regional and national academies in Pakistan, he said.				 																																	Seoul: South Korean football officials said on Monday they have abandoned negotiations with former Senegal coach Bruno Metsu to take over the national team after the Frenchman failed to respond to a final deadline. 				 																																	We have decided to terminate negotiations with Metsu, said Huh Jung-Moo, vice chairman of the Korea Football Associations technical committee. Metsu, named earlier as the strongest candidate for the job, had not responded to the associations final offer by a Sunday deadline, Huh said. 				 																																	Metsu, who led Senegal to the last eight of the World Cup in 2002 had earlier turned down the associations offer of $1 million in annual salary plus performance-based bonuses, Yonhap news agency said. Madrid: Former Real Madrid coach Vicente del Bosque said on Monday that he has agreed a two-year deal to take charge of Turkish side Besiktas. It was a good and attractive option, Del Bosque told a Spanish daily. I am keen to get to know the Besiktas squad and see if the team needs strengthening or not.

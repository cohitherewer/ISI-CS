The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Asian women are ruling the world

(AFP) Hong Kong: Another golf tournament, another victory for an Asian woman. Jennifer Rosales added her name last week to the ever-lengthening list of female golfers from Asia to make a mark in the United States. But the 25-year-old Filipinos victory in the $ 1.6 million Chick-Fil-A championship did more than just highlight the growing dominance of Asian players in the ladies game. It raised the question of when their male counterparts will catch up. The statistics tell a story. Of the top 10 money-earners in womens golf five are from Asia. And in the past decade, Asian women have won a clutch of majors and a series of LPGA tour events. Led by a trailblazing contingent of South Koreans that includes Grace Park and Pak Se-ri, who became eligible for entry to the sports hall of fame Sunday, Asian women are enjoying an unprecedented reign of success. The contrast with Asias men is stark  only one Asian male player is in the world top 20, and Asia is still awaiting its first major winner after decades of fruitless attempts. But Asian men and officials are adamant the gap is closing, and that it will not be too long before they are regularly competing among the elite. Evidence to support that position came in the shape of a third place finish at last months US Masters for South Koreas Choi Kyung-ju, just three shots behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. One man well qualified to comment on the different challenges facing male and female Asian golfers is Rosales elder brother, Gerald, a professional on the less glamorous but no less competitive Asian Tour. Rosales, who turned pro in the same year as his sister four years ago, says Asian men find it hard to break into the elite because competition is tougher. There is more strength in depth in the mens game, said Rosales. The quality of players goes very deep and that makes it more difficult, he added. But we are on the right track. If we keep on making the same improvements that we have done in the last 10 years then Im sure Asian men will start winning more. Rosales words were echoed by Asian Tour chairman Kyi Hla Han of Myanmar, a veteran of the Asian golfing scene who has played professionally since the 1980s when no proper tour existed. Its a question of exposure and getting to play in more competitions, said Han. The standard is improving steadily and its just a matter of time. Han believes a breakthrough Asian victory in a major would work wonders. If one player were to win, that would create a confidence factor and everyone would believe they can do it, he said. For Irish world number eight Padraig Harrington, the success of Asian women on the international golfing stage has been born out of necessity. In the absence of a ladies circuit in Asia, Harrington said, the regions women have been forced to compete at a higher level. Its interesting that theyre dominating isnt it? said Harrington. I looked at the leaderboard of a ladies event in the states the other week and the top five or six were all Asians. I think its because theyve been forced out of their comfort zone. Asian women have to go and play in the United States because there isnt anywhere else for them to go. Now theyre comfortable with it and the results speak for themselves, because theyre winning tournaments regularly and dominating the sport, said Harrington, who believes Asias men might not be far behind. The Irishman has been a regular participant in Asian tournaments in recent years and has been impressed by the talent on display. The challenge for Asian men now is learning to export their game successfully. Theres an awful lot of good players out here, but ultimately they need to find the confidence to product their best stuff outside of Asia. I see golfers here who are fine players but who have not necessarily done anything on the world stage. Asian players have to learn how to travel and to take their A game when they do.

 CJ Hunter testifies 
 C.J. HunterLondon: Triple Olympic champion Marion Jones ex-husband C.J. Hunter has testified to the grand jury investigating BALCO, the firm at the centre of a federal doping probe, the San Jose Mercury News said on Friday. Hunter, a former world shot put champion, tested positive for steroids before the 2000 Olympic Games. At the time he was married to Jones who has been investigated by anti-doping officials. Hunter entered a San Francisco courtroom on Thursday morning, the newspaper said. Asked why he was there, his lawyer Angela DeMent was quoted as telling the paper: Its not for pleasure. Federal prosecutors had assured Hunter he was not a target of their investigation and he travelled to California as part of his co-operation with authorities, DeMent added.  (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004  RCTC to go live today 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: RCTC is all set for the inaugural live telecast of the city racing on Wednesday. There is not much to write home about the eight events on the cards but the city racing is known to produce exciting results even with poor fields.				 										For instance, LAvenir, in the four-horse field of the 1,800m Prince Blossom Handicap, is sitting pretty at the weights but the form favours Indian Gold. However, it is Javed Khans Compassionate who may surprise both. The filly had found one better in each of her last five starts. Again, the Independence Cup may be hotly contested among Arapahoe  a runway winner of the maiden three-year-old race  Amicable and Mythical Star, the proven Class III horses. But Arapahoe has come on a lot since his easy win and may strike.Read as: Sl nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

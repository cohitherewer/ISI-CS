 Lanka stick to dual captaincy
Colombo: Hashan Tillekeratne will continue as Sri Lankas Test captain and Marvan Atapattu will remain ODI skipper for the series against Australia starting next month. Australia will play five ODIs and three Tests in their six-week Sri Lankan tour. The minister of youth affairs and sports has approved the appointment of Hashan Tillekeratne as captain of the Test team and Marvan Atapattu as skipper of the ODI team for the forthcoming Australia tour, the Sri Lankan cricket board said in a statement. Meanwhile, former captain Duleep Mendis was appointed chief executive of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) on Thursday. The 51-year-old succeeds former teammate Anura Tennekoon, who resigned last month.

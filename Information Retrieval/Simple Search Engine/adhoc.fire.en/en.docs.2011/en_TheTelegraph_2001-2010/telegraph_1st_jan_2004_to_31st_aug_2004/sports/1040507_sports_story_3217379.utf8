 Majestic Morientes ends Chelseas dream
	 - Monaco make Champions League final with 2-2 draw in away tie  BY HENRY WINTER  Chelseas John Terry (left) and Mario Melchiot try to prevent Monacos Fernando Morientes from reaching the ball in London on Wednesday. (AFP) Ultimately, Claudio Ranieris suicidal first-leg tinkering caused Chelseas exit from Europe last night, a verdict of death by managerial misadventure handed down as surely as the P45 that will land with a thump on the Italians desk shortly. Portos coach, Jose Mourinho, was at the Bridge last night, checking his European Cup final opposition and surely examining next seasons working environment. His future players worked hard, Frank Lampard inevitably to the fore, but the handicap imposed by Ranieri in the Riviera a fortnight ago was too insurmountable. Ranieri will doubtless reflect that Chelsea could have progressed, such were the number of chances they created in the first half here, but the 3-1 advantage Monaco brought to the Bridge meant Didier Deschamps clever side could thrive on the counter. At the final whistle, as goals for Jesper Gronkjaer and Lampard had been cancelled out by Hugo Ibarra and the majestic Fernando Morientes, Ranieri stood alone, lost in his thoughts, knowing he was not the winning coach Roman Abramovich demands. For an hour, though, last night, he had dared to dream of leaving Chelsea a winner. What drama. For an hour. This should have been staged in the West End of London let alone West London. Sadly, the curtain then fell on Chelsea with Monacos second goal, leaving the tireless, magnificent Lampard and his teammates needing three goals and a miracle. Led by Lampard, a midfielder giving notice that he must now start for England, Chelsea initially responded vibrantly to the fervour of their fans, the noise unrelenting as it rolled down from the stands. The action was mesmerising, the ball mainly in Chelseas determined sway but occasionally, increasingly in the threatening control of Deschamps neat counter-attackers. Just when it seemed the first half had ended completely to Chelseas liking with a 2-0 lead secured through Gronkjaer and Lampard, controversy ensued with Ibarras handled goal. Contact appeared accidental but Chelsea were incensed, Carlo Cudicini even making two runs to debate the goal with the linesman. Like the linesman, Chelseas efforts all night were unflagging. They just got hit on the break, felled by quick combinations involving the heavyweight talent that is Morientes. Until Ibarra had stolen in at the far-post, Ranieris men had controlled the half, inspired inevitably by the all-action Lampard, the fast-raiding Wayne Bridge, the lively strikers Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and, remarkably, by Gronkjaer. Sceptics of the Danes crossing ability will have watched in amazement as he checked inside when Mario Melchiot found him on the right. Space opened up because MonacosPatrice Evra, was still running back into play after medical attention. Gronkjaer seized the moment. His left foot sent the ball curling from just outside the box, moving in a glorious arc over Monacos keeper, Flavio Roma, and in. Intentional or not, Gronkjaers goal sent an electric charge of excitement through the home fans, whose support throughout never dipped below fever pitch even when the tide turned through an Argentine arm. Before the second-half slide, Chelseas players had sensed a vulnerability in Roma, explaining the stream of crosses and diagonal passes drilled into his box. Monacos keeper had displayed his shot-stopping prowess, saving well from Hasselbaink at close-range but relieved to see Joe Cole sliced horribly wide. Yet danger always lurked in Monacos ranks; only a wonderful diving block by John Terry diverted Morientes goal-bound volley onto a post. Immediately the attention was dragged down the other end as Chelsea, playing with real conviction, shaking the bar through Gudjohnsen and then testing Romas reflexes. Just after the half-hour, Bridge and Gronkjaer set up Lampard, who chested the ball down and drew a wonderful one-handed save from Roma. Back came Monaco, Morientes somehow lacing his shot wide, hinting at the kind of punishment he would later inflict. Ebb and flow, end to end, this compelling entertainment intensified when Lampard charged through, exploiting fine build-up work by Melchiot and Gudjohnsen to shoot past Monacos keeper. Arrive derci Roma? Monacos keeper was staring down the barrel of ignominy. His teammates, who clearly believed implicitly in their managers counter-attacking game-plan, immediately rallied. On the cusp of half-time, Evras quick throw sent the impressive Jerome Rothen down the left, beating Melchiot for skill and speed, before lifting the ball back in from the byline. Morientes rose well, sending a looping header on the bar where it hit Ibarra and bounced in. Chelsea needed to score again simply to force extra time. Space inevitably opened up. Worse befell them just before the hour when Morientes, such a masterful centre-forward who would excel in the Premiership, exchanged accurate passes with Lucas Bernardi before firing the ball below Cudicini, leaving Chelsea heading out of Europe and Ranieri out of the Bridge.

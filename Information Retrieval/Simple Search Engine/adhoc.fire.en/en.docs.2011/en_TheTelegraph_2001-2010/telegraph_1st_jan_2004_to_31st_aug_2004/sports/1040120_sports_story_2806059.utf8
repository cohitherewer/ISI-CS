 Shoaib rubbed Inzy the wrong way: Report
Islamabad: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar could find himself in trouble again following reports of clashes with his skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq. According to a report in the media here, Shoaib rubbed Inzamam the wrong way by going around and telling some players in the team in New Zealand that they should be prepared for him to take over as captain when they returned home. Pakistan had mixed success in New Zealand where they won the Test series 1-0 but lost the one-day series 1-4. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Sunday that they had not yet received any report on problems between the captain and the controversy-prone speedster. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said he had spoken to team manager Haroon Rashid to find out if there was any problem between the two senior players and he denied any such development. Still, when the team returns we will look into the matter in detail. But I have been assured by the manager that nothing is wrong in the team, Khan was quoted as saying by The News. Shaharyar also insisted that right now there were no plans for any change in the captaincy. I have said before, I am satisfied with the way Inzamam has handled the team and produced results from the team and he should, in all probability, be retained for the series against India. If at all, I will take a decision on the captaincy after consulting the other officials involved in cricketing matters in the board, he said. The Pakistan team is scheduled to return home on Wednesday.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Sunday, April 04, 2004  Amberleigh wins Grand National 
Liverpool: Donald Ginger McCain, the trainer steeped in Grand National folklore thanks to Red Rums three triumphs in the 1970s, won the race for the fourth time with Amberleigh House on Saturday.				 										Given a perfectly timed ride by jockey Graham Lee, the 16-1 shot came late after the final fence to collar 10-1 co-favourite Clan Royal, who finished second under Liam Cooper.				 										Lord Atterbury, a 40-1 outsider and the mount of Mark Bradburne, was third with last years winner Montys Pass (20-1) fourth under a big weight.				 										Amberleigh Houses triumph raised the roof at Aintree racecourse where the statue of Red Rum stands proudly near the paddock. The winning distances were three lengths and two lengths.

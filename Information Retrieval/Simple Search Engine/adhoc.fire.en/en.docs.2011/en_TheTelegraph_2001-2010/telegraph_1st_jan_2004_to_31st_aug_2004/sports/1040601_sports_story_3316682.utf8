 Japan ready for Beckham test
London: David Beckham dominated Japanese thoughts ahead of Tuesdays meeting with England, after the Asian champions 3-2 victory over Iceland threw wide open the triangular international meet at the City of Manchester Stadium. Both Icelandic goals, scored by Heidar Helguson, came from set-pieces and with England renowned for their free-kick specialists such as captain Beckham, Japanese coach Zico is determined to eliminate that weakness. Were going to have to improve in that area, said Zico, who blamed poor communication for the goals conceded in Sundays game against Iceland. Against Hungary, we conceded three goals from set-pieces, and two here today (Sunday) as well. But Im not worried about this one game. Ive been in Japan for 12 years and I know it is not normal for players to talk to each other and call attention when an opponent is nearby. I want the players to communicate among themselves to avoid these mistakes which could be costly for us. We just have to avoid committing so many fouls outside the area because they have players like David Beckham who could kill us. But Japan, who are preparing for an important World Cup qualifier with India on June 9, showed they have few problems in attack, with two first half goals from Tatsuhiko Kato followed by the winning 56th-minute penalty converted by Alessandro Santos. Japanese captain Tsuneyasu Miyamoto added: There is nothing really special about playing England, the only thing we have to worry about are set pieces, with someone like Beckham, we have to worry about him.

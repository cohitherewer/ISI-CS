 Aussies cruise to another win

(Reuters) Harare: Darren Lehmann scored a half-century and took four wickets to play the major hand in Australias victory over Zimbabwe in the second one-day International on Thursday. Australia scored 323 for eight and dismissed Zimbabwe for 184 in 44.3 overs to win by 139 runs and claim the three-match series 2-0. Lehmann scored a brisk 67 off 69 balls with seven fours and a six, and took four for seven with his nagging left-arm spin. Matthew Hayden faced 101 balls and hit 12 fours for his 87 and shared a third-wicket stand of 137 with Lehmann that saw the Zimbabwean attack travel to all parts of the ground. Brendan Taylor top scored for Zimbabwe with a dogged 65, but his dismissal in the 36th over started a collapse that claimed the last seven wickets for 21 runs in nine overs. Earlier, the weakened home side showed fight to take five wickets and concede a respectable 114 runs in the last 20 overs of the innings. Zimbabwe have been forced to pick a second-string team since last month when 15 white players made themselves unavailable in protest at the selection policy for the team. Hayden and Lehmann shared 137 in a crunching partnership for the third wicket. Adam Gilchrist and Michael Clarke were dismissed cheaply as Australia slipped to 43 for two in the eighth over. Hayden and Lehmann then pulverised the bowling until the 31st over when off-spinner Stuart Matsikenyeri beat Lehmann with flight and bowled him. Hayden went in the 38th over, heaving a ball from medium pacer Tawanda Mupariwa to deep midwicket where Mark Vermeulen took the catch. Medium-pacer Douglas Hondo left the field after bowling 9.3 overs when Ricky Ponting, who came in at number eight, crashed a fullblooded drive into the side of the bowlers head. Ponting, who scored 10, was smartly stumped by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu off medium pacer Waddington Mwayenga with five balls left in the innings. Jason Gillespie clipped an unbeaten 33 off 16 balls with one four and three sixes. The three-match series was brought forward after the two-match Test series was called off because of the weak side Zimbabwe would have fielded.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

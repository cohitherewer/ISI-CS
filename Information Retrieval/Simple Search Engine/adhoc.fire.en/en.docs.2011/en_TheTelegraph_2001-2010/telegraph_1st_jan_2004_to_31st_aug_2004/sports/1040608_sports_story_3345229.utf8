 McEnroe tips did the trick: Gaudio
 Gaston Gaudio with the French Open trophy near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Monday Paris: French Open miracle man Gaston Gaudio believes last-minute advice from American legend John McEnroe helped him conquer his demons and achieve an unlikely Grand Slam triumph at Roland Garros. The unheralded 25-year-old Argentinian, who had never got beyond the fourth round of any Grand Slam before and had won just two titles in a steady and unspectacular career, came back from two sets down to defeat Argentinian compatriot Guillermo Coria 0-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 8-6 here on Sunday. He had been such a nervous wreck, winning just one of the opening 12 games of the final, that he even thought of calling it a day until he remembered what McEnroe told him just before he went on court. Its like touching heaven. I was really suffering before the match and I asked John for some advice, said Gaudio, the first Argentinian man to win here since his hero Guillermo Vilas in 1977. He told me to relax and enjoy being in the final because in a few years time you will ask yourself why you didnt enjoy being in a Grand Slam final when you had the chance, said Gaudio. During the match I thought about that. Gaudio, the fourth lowest-ranked player ever to win a Grand Slam and only the seventh man to win after recovering from a two-set deficit, also believes that his decision to employ a psychologist has proved to be an inspired decision. I was playing so bad and I wasnt doing anything on clay but then this year I reached the final in Barcelona and from that moment I started to get into my tennis again, said Gaudio. He has helped me in the way that I have to enjoy things more, like trying not to suffer on the court and trying to be happy, trying to fight all the time, Gaudio said. Until the French Open, Gaudio had been considered a foot soldier in Argentinas impressive battalion of clay court specialists and even he admitted that winning a Grand Slam was probably out of his reach. Until now I never thought I could do it and I played up until the last point today. From now on I will believe in myself a lot more. The turning point in the final came when Coria started to suffer from cramps in the third set and needed treatment at 1-1 in the fourth set. That gave Gaudio the opportunity to level the match at two sets each before Coria rallied and even carved out two match points which his opponent valiantly saved. Gaudio did not need a second invitation and took the match with a winning backhand after three hours 31 minutes on court. Now he also hopes that his performances here will be a perfect riposte to his army of critics at home who have been only too happy to target him when Argentina have lost crucial Davis Cup matches. It is 100-per cent satisfaction. When I returned to Buenos Aires after playing Davis Cup in Moscow and Malaga, you had the impression it was my fault and that hurt me, he said. Thats why I have enjoyed this moment twice as much because there are many people who have helped me through my difficult moments. Now its like a revenge. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara touched by Hayden gesture
 - From record to compliments, a tale of reciprocation  Lara celebrates after breaking Haydens record on Monday. (AP) Hayden after breaking Laras record in October last year St Johns/Sydney: The West Indies captain Brian Lara said he received a congratulatory phone call from Matthew Hayden after breaking the Australians world record in the fourth Test against England on Monday. Lara became the first man to score 400 runs in a Test innings, regaining the record that Hayden had snatched from him with his 380 against Zimbabwe in Perth six months ago. He expressed that he had been listening (to the match) and was very happy for me and my family, Lara said at the end of the third days play. I really do appreciate that he took the time out to call. Lara said he believed the record was a possibility from the time he reached 200 for the seventh time in Tests. At the end of the first day, I felt that the pitch was good and that if any batsman applied himself he could make a big score. I realised that the rate I was scoring at, there was a lot of time left in the game and it was possible. With England holding a winning 3-0 lead in the four-match series, Lara reiterated that he would have liked to have scored more runs in the previous Tests but hoped his innings would be a spur for West Indies to go on to better things. I am proud, definitely. I didnt miss having the record but its great to have it again. Hopefully we can go on to win this and we can begin to get West Indies back on top again. The reaction has been great. I had a call from my Prime Minister (Patrick Manning) and also one from the golfer who has just finished second in the US Masters, Ernie Els, who is a good friend of mine. I spoke to Brian over the phone and passed on my congratulations for what was a truly amazing effort, Hayden said, adds a report from Sydney. I wanted to let him know how appreciative I was when he contacted me in Perth, and I thought it was only appropriate that I pass on my own best wishes to him and his family. Breaking Brians record against Zimbabwe was one of the most memorable days of my cricketing life, but records are made to be broken, and as a batsman, I guess they can fall at any time. I have been fortunate enough to be part of an incredibly successful Australian team and I see my role as not a record breaker, but as a valuable contributor to a winning team, Hayden added. While Lara said he expected someone to break the record before too long, England captain Michael Vaughan was not as certain. It could be a while before anyone else scores 400. It is an amazing achievement, to bat for two days and give only a half-chance is incredible. We gave him everything we had and he just threw it back at us. He is a true great of the game.

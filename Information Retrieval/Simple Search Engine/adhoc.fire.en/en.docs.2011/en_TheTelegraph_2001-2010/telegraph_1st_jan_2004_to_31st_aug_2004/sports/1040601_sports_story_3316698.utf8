Glasgow: Brazilian World Cup star Rivaldo has been insulted by the offer from Celtic manager Martin ONeill of having a trial run at Parkhead.				 																																	The 32-year-old midfielder has been in talks with the Scottish champions as well as Bolton over the last two weeks and had been leaning towards a spell in Scotland. But Rivaldos agent Carlos Arime said that ONeills offer of a trial on the clubs tour of the US was an insult to a player who had proved his value over the last decade.				 																																	How dare Martin ONeill ask Rivaldo to go for a trial in America. That is an insult to my client and to football, he said. 				 																																	Sao Paulo: A Brazilian hospital is preparing a drug rehabilitation programme for Diego Maradona, officials said.				 																																	Mastermind Hospital spokesman Fernando de Souza Miguel on Sunday said that a person close to the Argentine soccer great had contacted the facility 20 days ago. The person asked us to be on standby, with all the necessary infrastructure ready for the possible continuation of Maradonas treatment here, De Souza Miguel said, without revealing who made the request.				 																																	London: Chelsea have dismissed manager Claudio Ranieri, the BBC reported on Monday. Ranieris job has been under threat since Chelsea were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in July. The Italian is expected to be replaced by Porto coach Jose Mourinho.				 																																	Abramovich spent more than 100 million on new players and Ranieri piloted his new-look squad to the semi-finals of the Champions League and second place in the Premier League. Ranieri replaced Gianluca Vialli at Chelsea in September 2000. He has also coached Valencia, Fiorentina and Atletico Madrid. 				 																																	Madrid: Cesar Ferrando will be coach of Atletico Madrid next season, the club confirmed on Monday. The former Albacete coach, who has been given a one-year contract, replaces Gregorio Manzano who left Atletico last week.				 																																	Although Atletico spent much of last season in the upper reaches of the table, they failed to qualify for the Uefa Cup and had to settle for a place in the lesser Intertoto competition after finishing seventh.				 																																	Tokyo: Japan forward Takahara has been diagnosed with the same lung infection that kept him out of the 2002 World Cup, Japanese officials said on Monday.				 																																	The German-based striker was hospitalised late last week after complaining of chest pains as Japan prepared for Sundays friendly against Iceland in Manchester. We are all worried, the Japan Football Association media officer said.Sport on Screen Soccer, European Championship: The Story of the Uefa European Championship, from 6.30 pm on ESPN

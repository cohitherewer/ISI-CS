 Pak players barred from ad-shoot in India
Islamabad, Feb. 28 (PTI): In a bid to save a conflict of interest with the team sponsors ahead of the series against India, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has refused permission to four players, including captain Inzamam-ul Haq, to travel to India for a commercial shoot this week.  Apart from the captain, Shoaib Akhtar, Yousuf Youhana and Moin Khan were scheduled to travel to India for shooting an advertisement for Pepsi India, but were prevented from going by the PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan. Basically, Shaharyar has not given them permission for the visit to India because they were shooting the advertisement for Pepsi India which is a totally independent company from Pepsi Pakistan with whom the PCB has a long-term contract, a PCB official was quoted by The News. Pak IB screening As part of its efforts to provide and ensure foolproof security all travellers from India will be cleared by Pakistans intelligence bureau so that no suspect character travels in the guise of a fan. This was informed by a PCB spokesman today. As reported in The Telegraph on Friday, SSP Sohail Khan has been appointed in charge of security operations during the 40-day tour. He is a top notch expert in the field and has been appointed by the interior ministry, a PCB spokesman said. The official will travel with the Indian team and will liaise with other security personnel, said the spokesman. PCB is also thinking on the lines of either hiring a security expert or appoint one for the series. A control room would be set up at PCB headquarters in Lahore, he said. Another top SSP or an Army major would head the control room. Meanwhile, one third of the PCBs earnings of $ 21 million from contracts will come from Indian companies.  Copyright

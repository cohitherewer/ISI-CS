 ZCU chief fires cash salvo
London: In what may be construed as an attempt to put pressure on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to honour its commitments, Zimbabwe have warned the counties that they will be left with a multi-million pound bill if England pull out of Zimbabwe tour. In an e-mail addressed to the chief executives of the counties affiliated with the ECB, the Zimbabwean Cricket Union (ZCU) chairman, Peter Chingoka, has warned that English cricket would face damage claims of several millions of pounds, if the ECB cancels the tour. The ECB, on Monday, put off until the end of next month a decision on whether the tour will go ahead, although a meeting of its management board is due t on Thursday. (AFP)  Copyright

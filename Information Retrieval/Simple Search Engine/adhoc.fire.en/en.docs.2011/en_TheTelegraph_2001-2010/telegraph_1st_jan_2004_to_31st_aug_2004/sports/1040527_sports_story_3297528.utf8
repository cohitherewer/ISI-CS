 Injury forces Williams to return home 
	 - TOUR OF ZIMBABWE  Williams is suffering from a back injury Sydney: Fast bowler Brad Williams has been forced out of Australias shortened tour of Zimbabwe with a back injury and will return home immediately, Cricket Australia said on Wednesday. Williams was forced from the field during Tuesdays one-day International win over Zimbabwe in Harare when he aggravated his lower back while bowling. He will return to Australia for diagnostic scans on the advice of team physiotherapist Alex Kontouri. Brad is experiencing significant pain in his lower back and there simply isnt enough time remaining on this tour to investigate the problem fully, Kontouri said in a Cricket Australia statement. With his history of back problems we felt it would be wise to send him back to Australia rather than stay in Zimbabwe when there are just a few days of the tour remaining. With just four days of the tour and two one-day Internationals remaining, Williams will not be replaced in the 14-man squad, Cricket Australia said. Its disappointing because we have been waiting so long to begin this tour, Williams said in the statement. Basically, Ive been here for two weeks, bowled just five overs in match conditions, and now this happens. Its a real let down. By going home early hopefully I can get the problem solved making sure that Im fit and available for selection for the home series against Sri Lanka in July, he said.  (AFP)  Copyright

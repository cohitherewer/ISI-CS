The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer sure of Pak tour
Mumbai: Indias pace spearhead Zaheer Khan said on Sunday he is confident of being fully fit for the Pakistan tour starting next month. The left-arm seamer, who missed most of the series Down Under due to hamstring injury, said he is well on his way to regaining full fitness. It was very disappointing to be sidelined especially after a five-wicket haul in Brisbane and getting into a very good rhythm. But these things happen to sportsmen and it is not in my hands to stop them. However, I am very confident of being fit for the Pakistan tour as I am meeting Dr Anant Joshi every morning and doing my daily workouts every evening, Zaheer said. It will take another two weeks for me to recover completely and I am very happy with the progress I have made so far. I feel much fitter than what I was feeling four weeks ago, he added.

(AP) Wellington: Gary Kirsten found the stage set for the dramatic last act of his career as the third Test between South Africa and New Zealand moved towards an exhilarating finish here. Kirsten was batting on 19 and his captain Graeme Smith on 46 as South Africa reached 82 for three by stumps on Day IV on Monday. The visitor are chasing 234 for a win which will tie the three-Test series. They need another 152 for the victory. New Zealand were dismissed for 252 in their second innings after resuming at 128 for five and after trailing South Africa by 19 runs on the first innings. New Zealands rediscovered hero Chris Martin claimed two of the three wickets which fell before stumps. Martin removed Hershcelle Gibbs for 16 when South Africa were 29 and Jacques Rudolph for nought to leave it 31 for two. Jacob Oram chipped in with the vital wicket of Jacques Kallis for one at 36 for three and the balance of the match, always tenuous, was again with New Zealand. Smith and Kirsten guided South Africa safely to stumps, drawn 45 minutes early because of bad light, and balanced the match even more delicately. The middle session of the fourth day belonged to the South African bowlers, particularly spinner Nicky Boje, who took four for 69, as they summarily claimed New Zealands last five wickets to end their innings. Smith, Nel fined Smith and medium fast bowler Andre Nel, meanwhile, were found guilty of dissent on on Monday. Match Referee Clive Lloyd fined Nel 75 per cent of his match fee, while Smith was fined 50 per cent after disagreeing with a wide decision by umpire Asoka de Silva. The umpire had ruled a ball by Nel to Oram to be wide. Smith remonstrated with De Silva over the decision while Nel snatched his jersey from the umpire at the end of the over. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

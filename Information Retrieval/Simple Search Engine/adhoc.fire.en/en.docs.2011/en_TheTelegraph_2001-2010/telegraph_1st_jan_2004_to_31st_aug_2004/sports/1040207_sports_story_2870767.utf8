The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt makes up for Scud loss
 Lleyton Hewitt reacts after winning a rally in Adelaide on Friday. (AFP) Adelaide: Lleyton Hewitt beat rookie Robin Soderling as defending champions Australia levelled the first round Davis Cup match at 1-1 Friday after Swedens Thomas Enqvist upset Mark Philippoussis in the opener. Enqvist didnt lose a point on serve in the second set and didnt face a break point in a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over Philippoussis to give Sweden a surprise 1-0 lead. Former No. 1 Hewitt equalled Adrian Quists Australian record with his 24th Davis Cup singles win, a 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 disposal of 19-year-old Soderling. He improved to 24-5 in singles. Soderling had the misfortune of playing his debut match in the international team tennis competition on Hewitts home court at Memorial Drive. The national record was at the back of my mind. But the main priority was to get us back at one-all, said Hewitt. I just had to come out and be strong. Wimbledon finalist Philippoussis was the hero of Australias win over Spain in the 2003 final, overcoming shoulder pain to beat Juan Carlos Ferrero in five sets to give the hosts an unbeatable 3-1 lead in Melbourne on December 1. But he was never on top against Enqvist. Enqvists win broke Swedens losing streak against Australia, who had a 5-0 whitewash in Sweden in the second round last season. Meanwhile, in Metz, Arnaud Clement beat Mario Ancic 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 to give hosts France a 1-0 lead over Croatia in their Davis Cup World Group tie on Friday. Clement, ranked 30th in the world, outplayed 19-year-old Ancic in two hours six minutes. The French number two saved a break point in the eighth game of the first set and then won four games in a row to ease into a 6-4, 2-0 lead. In Bucharest, Andrei Pavel beat Michel Kratochvil 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 to give Romania a 1-0 lead over Switzerland. Pavel dominated the first two sets but lost the third against the Swiss number two, who mixed some miraculous shots with several unforced errors. Dutchman Sjeng Schalken beat Canadas Frank Dancevic 6-3 5-7 6-2 6-1 to hand the home side a 1-0 lead in Maastricht. Schalken needed almost three hours to overcome the Canadian youngster on the clay court.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

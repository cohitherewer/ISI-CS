The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Three records on Day II
 - Sushmita makes her mark with 1.67 in womens high jump  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sushmita at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday Calcutta: Three meet records were set and one equalled on the second day of the 54th state athletic championships at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Star heptathlete Soma Bisw as of Eastern Railway won the 100m hurdles in 14.0 seconds to improve her existing mark of 14.3. Sushmita Singha Roy (Eastern Railway) cleared 1.67m in womens high jump to rewrite Madhumita Pal Chowdhurys mark by .01m and Mallika Mondal of City AC with a jump of 1.62 set the record in the girls under-18 section. Mondal erased Sushmitas record of 1.58. In the under-18 girls event, Sabina Khatun of City AC equalled Pinky Pramaniks 100m record of 12.4 seconds. The talking point of the day was Somas performance. Coach Kuntal Roy was satisfied with her showing and felt she was peaking at the right time. I am hopeful of Soma qualifying for the Olympics, said Roy. Soma, though, is taking this meet lightly, participating in only three events. For Sushmita high jump has been her pet event. She has recently switched to heptathlon and will make her debut in the senior event at the circuit and inter-state meets this time. The performance could have been better. I tried to reserve energy for heptathlon, said Sushmita. There was a faux pas in the 5000m. National School Games gold winner China Bhattacharya of Burdwan was to participate in the U-20 girls event, but she could not because her name was missing from the list. Later, she turned out in the womens event and finished second. The organisers will now have to decide whether she will be awarded the silver in case there is protest from other participants.

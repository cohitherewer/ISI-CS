 Kapil asks players to trust govt decision
New Delhi, Feb. 14 (PTI): Legendary allrounder Kapil Dev today said the Indian cricketers should not worry too much about their security in Pakistan since the government must have taken all aspects into consideration before giving the all-clear signal to the team to tour that country next month. The government is the best judge to decide on the security of the players. They must have taken into consideration everything before allowing the team to tour Pakistan, Kapil said. He said it was natural that the players and their families would be a little concerned, but no one should doubt the governments intention. No government would risk its players for a series and I will not even doubt that the tour will not be safe for the cricketers, said the former Indian coach and captain. Madanlal said after the governments decision that security should not be a worry at all for the players. Pakistan has assured adequate security measures. It is a good decision by the government since it would mean revival of the cricket series between the two countries. It is a very good news for the cricket-loving people of both the countries, he said. Madanlal, who was coach when the Indians last toured Pakistan for a one-day series in 1997, said the series would be a test of mental strength for the cricketers. It would be a great exposure to young members of the side. This tour will also test the players to the hilt, he said. Meanwhile, Harbhajan Singh regretted that he could not be the part of the squad due to his injury. I will miss the tour, as it will be a historic movement of playing with Pakistan in their homeland, he said.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md.Sp. held by Goa outfit
 - National League - Black-and-white brigade misses countless sitters  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Abdulateef Seriki is challenged by Hussain Mustafi during Haywards Sportings National League encounter with Mohammedan Sporting at Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Inset: Chidi Edeh, who scored for Mohammedan Sporting. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: A team good enough to convert just one out of 10 clear openings doesnt deserve to win a match. A team capable of creating no more than a couple of goal-scoring opportunities doesnt deserve full points either. Viewed from that perspective, the 1-1 scoreline in Mondays Mohammedan Sporting versus Haywards SC National Football League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium was a just result. The local side paid for its profligacy, the Goans will consider themselves lucky to have salvaged a point. After nine games each, Haywards have 12 points and Mohammedan Sporting six. The black-and-white brigade played magnanimous hosts by gifting an early goal five minutes into the match. Syed Rahim Nabi inexplicably lost possession inside his own half, and Dudu Omabgemi quickly set up a through ball for fellow-Nigerian Abdulateef Seriki. The ex-Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting striker was up in a flash and rocketed a right-footer past Gumpe Rime. The next 70 minutes saw Mohammedan Sporting display an exhibition of misses before Chidi Edeh compensated partially. Making good use of a Dipendu Biswas sortie, the wiry marksman bluffed his way past Akshay Das and bulged the netting. The game was littered with some incredible misses. Nabi, who looked to be working hard without getting the desired results, was at the right place at the right time to receive a gem of a pass from Chidi. Goalkeeper Luis Barreto, who otherwise had a satisfying day in office, was at his mercy and yet Nabi managed to send the ball way off target. Half an hour into the second session, Mohammedan Sporting squandered three chances at one go. Dipendu, surprisingly introduced 13 minutes after half-time, charged forward on an Okoli Odafa Onyeka prompt and pushed the ball into the keepers body. Nabi picked up the rebound and did no better. The deflection came to Dipendu and, this time, his shot came to grief at the base of the sidepost. In another moment of madness, Nabi and Chidi both went for the kill and let custodian Barreto slip in to kick the ball out of danger. There were four more occasions when Barretos hands denied Mohammedan Sporting. It wasnt that Mohammedan Sporting were playing champagne football, but the chances kept coming  simply because Haywards yielded too much space in the middle of the park. With principal striker Dudu Omabgemi  among the leading NFL scorers with five goals  being frustrated by the home teams tough-tackling methods  Seriki was left with too much work up front. The goal apart, the only other time Haywards came close to breaching the Mohammedan Sporting defence was late in the first half. A swift counter saw Dudu in possession after two touches, but his casual flick was palmed away by Rime. The Mohammedan Sporting forays had a sharper sting in the second half, especially after Dipendu came on for Khalid Siddique. A curled free-kick was diverted from harms way by a full-stretched Barreto. Bungo Singh, too, made his presence felt after a quiet first 45 minutes. A pile-driver from 30 yards out was kept out by Barreto. Another Bungo attempt crashed into the side-netting. Referee Walter Perreira seemed unwilling to use the yellow card and he came close to losing control on a couple of occasions towards the end. It was left to Mohammedan Sporting coach Jamshed Nassiri to rush in and cool players tempers.

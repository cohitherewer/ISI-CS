The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greece eye last eight
 Demis NikolaidisFaro, June 19 (Reuters): Greece will have to reshape their midfield against Russia on Sunday as they seek the point they need to clinch a surprise Euro 2004 quarter final place. Stelios Giannakopoulos, who has a pulled muscle, and the suspended Giorgos Karagounis will miss out, although coach Otto Rehhagel seems more concerned about complacency than the absence of the midfield duo. Nothing has been won. Everyone thinks that we are already in the next round but this is not true, Rehhagel said. A point against the already eliminated Russians will book a spot in the last eight and end the dreams of either Spain or Portugal, who meet in Lisbon in Sundays other group A game. We are going for the victory in this game despite needing only one point. We cannot think about anything else, said striker Demis Nikolaidis. Russia, who have lost to Spain and Portugal and are yet to score a goal at Euro 2004, are determined to put up a good performance. PROBABLE TEAMS Russia (4-4-2); 12-Vyacheslav Malafeyev; 14-Alexander Anyukov, 13-Roman Sharonov, 21-Alexei Bugayev, 16-Vadim Yevseyev; 19-Vladimir Bystrov, 20-Dmitry Loskov, 15-Dmitry Alenichev, 5-Andrei Karyaka; 11-Alexander Kerzhakov, 3-Dmitry Sychev. Greece (4-4-2): 1-Antonis Nikopolidis; 2-Yourkas Seitaridis, 19-Michalis Kapsis, 5-Traianos Dellas, 14-Takis Fyssas; 17-Giorgos Georgiadis, 21-Costas Katsouranis, 7-Theodoros Zagorakis (captain), 10-Vassilis Tsartas; 15-Zisis Vryzas, 9-Angelos Haristeas.

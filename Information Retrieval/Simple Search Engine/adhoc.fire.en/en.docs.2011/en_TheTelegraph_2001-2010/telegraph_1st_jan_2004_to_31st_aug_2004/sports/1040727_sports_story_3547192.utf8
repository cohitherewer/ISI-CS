				 																																	Madrid: Dutch international Marc Overmars announced his retirement from football on Monday, blaming the decision on persistent injuries. My footballing future ends now, the 31-year-old winger said. My knee is causing too many problems and I cant play at the level I would wish.				 																																	Overmars became the most expensive Dutch player of all time and the most expensive player in Barcelona history when he signed from Arsenal in July 2000 for a fee of around 36 million euros  a deal which also included his Arsenal teammate Emmanuel Petit.				 																																	London: Manchester United striker Alan Smith missed a spot kick in the shoot-out as Bayern Munich beat the Premier League side 4-2 on penalties in the second match of the Champions World Series in Chicago on Sunday.				 																																	A crowd of 58,121 packed into Soldier Field to watch a disappointing friendly end in a scoreless draw before the contest was decided by a shoot-out.				 																																	Smith, making his debut after a  7 million move from Leeds United in May, and Republic of Ireland defender John OShea failed from the spot as a more experienced Bayern side converted all of their penalties. 				 																																	Gothenburg (Sweden): The second football World Cup for the homeless got underway here with teams from 28 countries competing for the prize.				 																																	At the first competition, held in Graz, Austria last year, 14 countries participated. Countries participating this year include Brazil, Japan, Namibia and the United States. About 300 players are to take part , including the homeless, recovering addicts, asylum-seekers and sellers of street newspapers.				 																																	The World Cup should cast light on the problems of the homeless and their misery, organiser Bernhard Wolf of Austria said on Sunday at the opening ceremony .				 																																	Umag (Croatia): Argentine Guillermo Canas won a second consecutive title when he beat Italian Filippo Volandri 7-5, 6-3 to win the Croatia Open on Sunday.				 																																	Sixth seed Canas also won the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart last week, when he beat compatriot Gaston Gaudio.				 																																	Canas had been 5-2 down in the first set as Volandri powered ahead, but the Argentine stormed back following a 10-minute break for medical assistance after suffering pains in his back.				 																																	The 26-year-old won five games on the trot to seal the first set, with Volandri taking only four points in that time.				 																																	Canas, ranked 42nd in the world, broke Volandri three times in the second set to take a 5-1 lead. Volandri fought back to 5-3 but Canas broke his opponent again in the next game to seal the match.				 																																	It was Volandris second consecutive defeat in an Umag final after he lost last year to Carlos Moya of Spain. 				 																																	Athens: Athens Olympics officials were angered on Monday by a British newspaper report claiming to reveal details of the opening ceremony on August 13.				 																																	The Sunday Mirror reported that the renovated Olympic stadium would be flooded with millions of gallons of waters to set the stage for a three-hour extravaganza including 400 drummers making the sound of a heart beat.Games organisers refused to comment on the report. You will have to wait and see, an official said. Sport on Screen Cycling: Tour de France highlights from 9.30 am on ESPN

 McGrath targets 600 in Tests 
 - Rejuvenated pacer wants to play 2007 World Cup  Glenn McGrath feels being off for a long time has added a couple of years to his career Sydney, May 17 (AFP): Australias premier pace bowler Glenn McGrath is aiming for 600 Test wickets and beyond and wants to play international cricket until he is at least 37. McGrath, 34, said he believed the healed ankle injury, which sidelined him for 10 months, could now help him play on till the next World Cup in the West Indies in 2007. Australia have 41 Tests scheduled for that period, allowing McGrath the opportunity to greatly extend fast bowling records. He returns from a lengthy lay-off in Saturdays first Test against Zimbabwe in Harare. My goal now is the 2007 World Cup, McGrath told a Sydney daily on Monday. Before I thought I wouldnt play that long but now I think its a realistic goal. I feel so fresh and Ive had such a good off-season that I feel its probably added another couple of years to my career. With the preparations Ive done and the adjustments Ive made, if all goes well hopefully Ill even be better than I was in the past. McGraths news is a boost for new Test captain Ricky Ponting, who would not have expected to have the worlds top fast bowler for more than 18 months when he took over from Steve Waugh earlier this year. McGrath has taken 430 wickets in 95 Tests and should he bowl on until 2007 it places him on track to become the first fast bowler to take 600 wickets  more than the existing leading pacer Courtney Walsh (519). McGrath is expected to pass other great fast bowlers  Richard Hadlee (431) and Kapil Dev (434)  in Zimbabwe to become the fourth-highest Test wicket-taker of all time. Meanwhile, Darren Lehmann says the grind of travelling to play international cricket is taking its toll and that the next southern hemisphere summer may be his last season. Australia, in Zimbabwe for a two-Test and three one-day International series, tour England (Champions Trophy) and India (Tests) this year after hosting Sri Lanka in a two-Test series in July. Lehmann, the father of young twins, said time away from his family was difficult to endure. Im enjoying the cricket, especially now, Lehmann said an Australian news agency in Harare on Monday. But Im not so much enjoying the travelling any more and being away from the family, so thats something Ill have to weigh up over the next six to 12 months and see where Im at after that. Hopefully, I can get through this winter (with Yorkshire) and this summer and weigh it up then. Lehmann, 34, will have to decide between spending more time at home with his family and extending his late-blooming Test career, which included two hundreds in the 3-0 series win in Sri Lanka in March.

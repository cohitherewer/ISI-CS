 Clean sweep by Indians
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: India A comprising Manav Das of Ambala and Chandigarhs Harinder Gupta combined brilliantly for the second day running as the hosts made a clean sweep of the international Team event at the all-India amateur golf championship at RCGC on Wednesday. Defending champions Das and Gupta shot one-under 71 and par 72, respectively, for the second straight day for a team total of two-under 286 to emerge best. The big performers on Day II were the India B team. The duo of Vikrant Chopra (Delhi) and Simarjeet Singh (Noida) began the day at sixth place among the 12 teams and nine shots off the pace. Young Chopra shot a three-under 69, the best round of the tournament, and Simarjeet a one-under 71 to leap frog to second place at 292. India C, comprising Jaideep Patwardhan (Pune) and Anitya Chand (Delhi), finished third with a total of 299, one ahead of the promising South African team of Matthew Kent and Norman Beggs.  Copyright

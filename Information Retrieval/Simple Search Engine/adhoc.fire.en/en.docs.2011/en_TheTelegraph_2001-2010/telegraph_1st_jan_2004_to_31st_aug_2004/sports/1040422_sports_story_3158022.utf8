The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anju can get us Olympic medal
 - Usha seeks Sourav-Sachins help to raise funds for her athletics school  BY A STAFF REPORTER  P.T. Usha with her husband and son at a felicitation in the city on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Missing out on an Olympic medal by a whisker still hurts P.T. Usha, but the Golden Girl of Indian athletics feels the drought may come to an end this time around. Predictably, she is putting her money on ace long-jumper Anju Bobby George. She is clearly a medal hope for us. She has talent, determination, a very good height as well, was the Padmashrees explanation on why she is banking on the World Championship bronze-medallist to fetch India an athletics medal from Athens. Usha was speaking to newsmen after receiving the P.C. Chandra award on Wednesday. Husband Srinivasan and their 11-year old son accompanied Usha to the function held at Science City. There were a few words of advice for Anju. She has to cross the 7-metre barrier consistently. That way, she will not only gain in confidence, but more importantly, send a strong message to her Athens opponents as well, Usha remarked. Anju must also compete in European circuits frequently to get more exposure before hitting the Olympic tracks, added Usha. Apart from Anju, Usha picked shooters Anjali Bhagwat and Abhinav Bindra as the ones capable of striking it rich in Athens. She isnt willing to bet on Bengal duo Soma Biswas and Saraswati Saha (neither has yet qualified for Athens). Soma and Saraswati are good at Asian levels. But in order to throw a challenge in the world stage, you have to perform better. To me consistency is the key to get right up there, remarked Usha. She has similar feelings on Neelam J. Singh, saying that the discus-thrower has not been able to translate her superb domestic performances into notable levels at the international level. While the Anjus and the Anjalis are shaping the nations dream for an Olympic medal, the Golden Girl has embarked on her own mission to help the future generation achieve what she could not do two decades ago in Los Angeles. The seed of such a dream was sown two years ago in Calicut  in the form of the P.T. Usha School of Athletics. And she has targeted the 2012 Olympics to fulfil her ambition. We have a 12-member batch currently undergoing training there. We recruit young prospects through a tough selection process. But once they get admitted, they have everything free of cost. Its really my dream project. Ive won everything but an Olympic medal. And my schools aim is to win it (through my students) in 2012 and each Games thereafter, Usha said. The legendary sprinter is seeking financial help from all corners to fulfil her dream. She has even approached the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar. It (the school) is a huge Rs 20-crore project and I need everybodys help. Ive already sent a brochure (about the project) to Sourav, though I couldnt personally meet him, Usha revealed. For the record, Ushas son loves to watch Sourav and Rahul Dravid in action. He is a big fan of both, the mother pointed out.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali will tour, to promote cricket
 - Warne and offie to sign special photographs  Muralidharan adds a new spin Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan will travel to Sydney next month to promote cricket during Sri Lankas tour of Australia, despite refusing to play in the Test series. The record-breaking off-spinner named in the Sri Lankan squad but elected to not play in the two Tests in Darwin and Cairns citing personal reasons. Muralidharans decision to pull out of the tour was prompted by Australian Prime Minister John Howards statement describing him as a chucker. The Daily News on Monday quoted Muralidharans manager, Kushil Gunasekara, as saying that the bowler will join his Australian rival Shane Warne in Sydney to sign 350 special photographs marking the tour. Muralidharan and Warne have both surpassed the milestone of 500 Test wickets, although the Sri Lankan holds the world record with 527. He has to go there before July 10 and sign a photograph projecting him and Warne as the spin twins in the 500-wicket club. It is a promotional thing which is normally done in Australia during a Test series, Gunasekara said. Muralidharan achieved the world record in 90 Tests. Warne who has played 20 Tests more trails him by ten wickets.  (AP)  Copyright

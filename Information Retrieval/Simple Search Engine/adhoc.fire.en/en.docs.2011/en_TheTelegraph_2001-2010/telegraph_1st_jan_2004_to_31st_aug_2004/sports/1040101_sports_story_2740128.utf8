				 																																	Dubai: European No. 1 Ernie Els on Wednesday said he would go head-to-head with Tiger Woods at the Dubai Desert Classic at the Emirates Golf Club from March 4-7.				 																																	With Els and Woods in the line-up I think its safe to say that the tournament will be the biggest and best in its 15-year history, Mohammed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the organising committee, said on Wednesday.				 																																	For world No. 3 Els, it is a return to familiar territory. He is the only man to have won two Desert Classic titles (1994 and 2002) and holds the course record with a 61. I think everyone knows I love playing in Dubai, Els said. I like the lines off the tees and the greens are quite soft so if you get your ball up, you can shoot some good scores.				 																																	Madrid: Argentine goalkeeper Roberto Bonano has joined Primera Liga strugglers Murcia for the rest of the season after agreeing to rescind his contract with Barcelona.				 																																	The 33yearold former international, who joined Barcelona from River Plate three seasons ago, had fallen out of favour at the Catalan club since the arrival of new coach Frank Rijkaard and had not been included in the teams official squad list for the present campaign.				 																																	I have been training on my own for the last six months and it has been a very tough experience, Bonano said on Tuesday night. But I will now be giving everything for my new team because they have shown that they want me.				 																																	London: Frustrated Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd has warned manager Bobby Robson and his players that they must start to perform or face the consequences.				 																																	The club are a disappointing seventh in the Premier League, 20 points adrift of leaders Manchester United after 19 matches, despite having spent around 68 million ($120.7 million) on players since Robson was appointed in 1999.				 																																	London: Tim Henman has expressed delight at being awarded the OBE in the new years honours list, but says that finally winning Wimbledon is still his big ambition.				 																																	The British No. 1 said he was extremely honoured with the award and he would receive it with a massive amount of pride.				 																																	Henman, with some help from Greg Rusedski, has single-handedly carried British tennis for the last decade both in ATP tournament play and in the Davis Cup. Injuries hampered his year in 2003, but he finished in style by winning his first Masters series event in Paris in November.				 																																	London: Tottenham Hotspurs top-scorer Frederic Kanoute is set to put country before club and play for Mali in the African Nations Cup, according to a leading Mali soccer official.				 																																	Haidara Mamadou, assistant secretary of the Malian football federation, said that the French-born player would join a training camp in Morocco in the second week of January.				 																																	He said it is his decision, said Mamadou. 				 																																	London: Premier League Fulham have signed Dutch midfielder Bobby Petta until the end of the season, the clubs official website said on Wednesday. The Rotterdam-born player started his career with Feyenoord, before switching to Ipswich in 1996. He signed for Scottish Premier League Celtic on a free transfer in July 1999 and helped the side to a domestic treble in 2001.

 Maradona improving
Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona, who has been in intensive care for eight days with heart and breathing problems, is improving and has had an intravenous drip removed, according to a hospital statement on Monday. The 43-year-old Argentine can tolerate liquids, is breathing without the aid of an artificial respirator and will start a diet soon, added the statement released by the Suizo-Argentina clinic here. However, Maradona remains in intensive care and still requires another drip for a lung infection. Although there has been an evident improvement, the outlook is still cautious, read the statement. He is breathing on his own, with good ventilatory mechanics. He is stable hemodynamically, even after the suspension of intravenous drugs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

		 Tuesday, July 06, 2004 EURO DIGEST
 London: England youngster Wayne Rooney has defended David Beckham and backed him to continue as England captain for years to come. The Real Madrid midfielder has had his position as international skipper questioned following his lacklustre performances in Englands run to the quarter finals of Euro 2004. Becks is a really good captain. He certainly knows what he is talking about and deserves to be England captain for years, Rooney told The Sun. Ive learned so much just being around people like him and Michael Owen, Rooney said. If Ive got a role model its David. Hes a lovely man and has really supported me. Lisbon: Portugal skipper Luis Figo has said he was unsure if his countrys defeat in the Euro 2004 final would bring down the curtains on his international career. Now is not the moment to talk about that. I will make a decision but for now I just want to rest, said the 31-year-old Real Madrid midfielder who won a record 111th cap for Portugal. With five minutes remaining and Portugal needing a goal to take the match into extra-time a spectator ran onto the pitch and as he passed Figo threw a Barcelona shirt in his face. Panaji: Soccer fans in the former Portuguese colony of Goa slumped in dejection after the hosts lost 0-1 to Greece in the Euro 2004 final in Lisbon on Sunday. Thousands of people across the Indias western coastal state, who began partying hours before the match began just past midnight local time, melted away into a mild drizzle from many venues where they had assembled to watch the game on big TV screens. Hundreds of soccer clubs in the tiny state, under Portuguese rule from the early 16th century until 1961, and many beach resorts in the tourist paradise had arranged celebrations after their favourite side made it to the final. Herzogenaurach (Germany): Greece jerseys have sold out in Greece after the sides unexpected victory at Euro 2004, the manufacturers Adidas said on Monday. The 15,000 shirts available for sale in Greece have been sold, said a company spokesman. He said Adidas-Salomon were working flat out to produce more jerseys. Rank outsiders Greece beat Portugal 1-0 in the final of Euro 2004 in Lisbon on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal still 9 points clear
 - Chelsea remain second after 2-0 win at Bolton Wanderers  Bolton Wanderers Bruno NGotty (right) challenges Hernan Crespo of Chelsea in Bolton on Saturday. (Reuters)London: Thierry Henrys sweetly-struck free-kick and a late Robert Pires strike gave treble-chasing Arsenal a 2-0 Premier League win at Blackburn Rovers on Saturday, maintaining their nine-point lead over Chelsea. The victory took unbeaten Arsenal to 70 points, with Chelsea second on 61 after they won 2-0 at Bolton Wanderers earlier in the day. Champions Manchester United, third on 58 points, visit neighbours Manchester City on Sunday. Charlton moved up to fourth with a 1-0 home victory over Middlesbrough while Leicester City, playing their first game since nine players were arrested on March 4 following an incident at a Spanish resort, gained a 1-0 success at Birmingham City to move out of the bottom three. Leeds United remain bottom after a 2-0 defeat at Fulham while Portsmouth slipped into the relegation places after going down 1-0 at Everton. Arsenal, still on course for success in the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup, showed only occasional glimpses of their fluent best in the first half against a hard-working Blackburn side who did the double over them last season. Frenchman Henry thought he had poached a cheeky first-half goal when he nicked the ball away from Brad Friedel, only to be penalised for lifting his foot as the American goalkeeper prepared to take a drop kick. Blackburn had one effort cleared off the line and Jens Lehmann saved well from Andy Cole in a warning to the Londoners. Normal service, though, was resumed after 57 minutes when Henry curled a free kick over the wall and beyond Friedel. The second goal came three minutes from time when France midfielder Pires knocked in a rebound after Gilbertos shot hit a post. Chelsea were second-best throughout the first half at the Reebok where Henrik Pedersen hit a post and third-choice Chelsea goalkeeper Marco Ambrosio had to make a couple of good saves. Chelsea were much better after the break and took control with two goals in three minutes. Centre back John Terry got the first in the 71st minute when he carried the ball out of his own half and continued his run eventually to volley in Damien Duffs cross, while the Irish midfielder got the second from close range. Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri blamed the mental strain of his teams midweek Champions League game against VfB Stuttgart for the poor start but opposite number Sam Allardyce targeted the referee.

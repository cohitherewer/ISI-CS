The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Brazil, France fail to produce fireworks
	 - FIFA CENTENARY MATCH  Ronaldo gets past Marcel Desailly at the Stade de France in Saint Denis on Thursday. (Reuters) Paris: Some of the worlds greatest players proved themselves to be mere mortals as France and Brazil failed to produce a goal in their prestigious Fifa Centenary friendly which ended in a 0-0 draw on Thursday. For the die-hard statisticians, France maintained their unbeaten run against Brazil since their 0-2 defeat at the Parc Des Princes in 1992 and Bernard Mendy became the 800th France international when he came on after the break. The Brazilian team were brandishing a banner which said Senna, our eternal champion as they marched out on to the field in homage to the Brazil Formula One legend who was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix over a decade ago. The closest either side came to scoring was when Brazils Roberto Carlos wrapped a shot against Gregory Coupets left-hand post after 66 minutes. In reality, most of the fireworks on the pitch came after the match ended when a spectacular pyrotechnic display  accompanied by Stevie Wonders anthem Happy Birthday heralded the 100th anniversary of Fifas formation in Paris on May 21, 1904. For despite a largely competitive friendly between the reigning European and world champions, usually-lethal finishers like Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Sylvain Wiltord of France and Ronaldo and Ronaldinho of Brazil fluffed the sort of opportunities they score week in and week out with ease. At least the game was played in superb spirit, evocative of an earlier age, and although there was some robust tackling there were no bookings and an air of festivity surrounded the game played on a perfect, still, warm spring night. The ultra-modern setting, the venue for Frances historic 3-0 World Cup final win over Brazil in 1998, also witnessed the novelty of the two teams and the officials wearing replica kit from the early part of the twentieth century in the first half before changing back to modern kit after the break. There were plenty of 21st century skills in evidence, however, and even though there were no goals both sides put together some great approach work. But there was also the ugly modern phenomenon of home fans booing some of their own players with Claude Makelele and captain Marcel Desailly  whom France coach Jacques Santini said had incurred a knee injury without adding details on the severity of the problem  jeered every time they touched the ball. The crowd had not forgotten their antics when Chelsea played Monaco in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final when Desailly was sent off and Makeleles theatrical dive resulted in a red card for Monacos Andrea Zikos. Apart from that, the match was notable for another sublime display by Zinedine Zidane who twisted and turned at every opportunity and set up his forwards regularly but to no avail before going off to a standing ovation after 68 minutes. Henry was guilty of a dire miss in the first half when he blasted over the bar from close range after 24 minutes and Wiltord, who replaced Robert Pires at halftime, hung his head in shame after 63 when he should have done better after a brilliant run by substitute Bernard Mendy. Ronaldo played the match as if he was determined to forget forever the worst day of his career in 1998. Taken ill before the World Cup final, he still played for Brazil and had an awful, anonymous game. But the Real Madrid forward wasted at least six good scoring chances. Meanwhile, Santini hit out at Fifa on Friday, saying it showed a lack of respect towards the Brazilian and French coaches when it was celebrating its centenary. (Agencies)  Copyright

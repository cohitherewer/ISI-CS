 India start with 2-0 win over Britain 
Dusseldorf: India missed chances galore before prevailing over Britain 2-0 in their opening match of the four nation mens hockey tournament on Friday. Sandeep Singh and Adam Sinclair struck the goals in either half to give the Indians something to cheer about at the Deutscher Sporsklub after a string of disappointing performances in recent times. A 30th minute penalty corner goal by the 18-year old Sandeep put India ahead. India earned three penalty corners in the first session but could convert only one, the British having no answers to Sandeeps fierce drag flick. They should have increased the scoreline in the 39th minute but for a gutsy stop by goalkeeper Ebworth, who foiled Deepak Thakurs rasping shot from the edge of the circle. Ebworth was to be the hero for his team coming into action many times to blunt the Indian onslaughts from Gagan Ajit Singh, Dhanraj Pillay and Prabhjot Singh. In the 52nd minute, Sinclair made it 2-0 after grabbing an opportunity at the goalmouth set up by Gagan Ajit Singh. This was Britains first defeat against India in 12 years. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Coach says Euro team wont suffer
 - French take Santini bombshell in stride  Santini says he still wants to go very far in the tournament Paris: French football officials were putting on a brave face after national coach Jacques Santinis bombshell announcement that he was leaving after Euro 2004 to take over as Tottenham Hotspur manager. The news came just 10 days before France faced England in their opening match of the championship in Lisbon. Theres no panic, said French federation president Claude Simonet, whose refusal to extend Santinis contract before the European championship led to Santini looking for a new job. He obviously felt his conditions, which I cannot reveal, were not satisfactory but in professional sport every man is free to leave. Mr Santini has obviously forgotten the clause in his contract which stipulated we would extend his contract to 2006 if we had a good Euro 2004. Former manager Michel Platini said Santini had phoned him to seek his advice. After what happened with Roger Lemerre we couldnt afford to take another risk, said the French federation vice-president. But I wish him good luck. And he was not worried the news would affect the players. Theyre professionals with big clubs. They know what they have to do. Santini himself assured fans that his decision to quit would not derail his team at the tournament. Despite the situation, everything will go on as planned, Santini told a news conference at the teams Clairefontaine training base. Its what I told my staff and what I told to the players yesterday. My personal situation is not going to change anything. Its not going to undermine our ambition to go very far in the tournament. Lemerre had to be paid off after the disastrous 2002 World Cup when France became the first defending champions to fail to score a goal and went home after two defeats and a draw. Lemerre, who took over from 1998 World Cup-winning coach Aime Jacquet, had won Euro 2000 and his contract had been extended before the 2002 meet. Santini, who had coached Lyon to their first league title, took over and revived French fortunes. They qualified for Euro 2004 by winning every match. Bayern Munich right-back Willy Sagnol said Santini had told the players on Thursday before announcing his move. We werent surprised. His negotiations with the federation never seemed to end and he likes everyone to know where they stand, which wasnt the case with Lemerre. It was better to find out now than in the middle of the Euro. The successor issue The focus inevitably shifted to the successor issue. Four names are doing the rounds  Didier Deschamps, Frances 1998 World Cup winning-captain and coach of Champions League finalists Monaco, former Fulham manager Jean Tigana, France U-21 coach Raymond Domenech and Japans 2002 World Cup coach Philippe Troussier.(Agencies)  Copyright

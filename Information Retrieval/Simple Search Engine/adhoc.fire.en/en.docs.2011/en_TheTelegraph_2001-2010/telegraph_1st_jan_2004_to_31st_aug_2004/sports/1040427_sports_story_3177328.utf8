 Bordering on the awesome
 - Arsenals football points to an achievement that may never be bettered BY ALAN SMITH Thierry Henry with the PFA player of the year award on sunday. (AFP)Arsene knows, proclaimed the banner high up in one corner of White Hart Lane. And indeed he does. Who could argue with that after the Frenchman delivered his third Premiership title Sunday. No previous Arsenal manager has ever done that. That exact same message, actually, has been expressed once before, the only difference being that George Grahams name was on the flag back in 1991. My Arsenal team had just won our second title in three years. Move over Liverpool, the newspapers screamed. Get ready for a new era when Arsenal will dominate English football. As it turned out, nobody noticed Manchester United coming up on the rails. Then, when the same sentiment emerged followin Arsenal s comprehensive victory two years ago, Wengers galloping thoroughbred turned into Devon Loch on the home straight last term to let United pass and pinch the spoils. And so we come to another point in history when that so-called shift in power is supposed to see Arsenal overtake United as the team to beat.  Not only that, their spectacular exploits this season  tearing teams apart with an unprecedented concoction of breathtaking flair and frightening power  have earned a tag of the most accomplished football team to ever grace these shores. Certainly, watching those red-and-white shirts race out from their own penalty area at breakneck speed against Tottenham, seeing them exchange swift passes with destructive penetration to let Patrick Vieiras outstretched leg poke home an early goal, brought a shiver to the spine. There was an almost tangible sense of something very special happening before our eyes. Something, whats more, that has been happening all season. But the best English team ever? That is quite a bold statement. Maybe the Liverpool players with four European Cup winners medals at home would strongly disagree. Likewise, those lads who represented Nottingham Forest to two European triumphs. Manchester United, no doubt, with the ultimate Treble as evidence, would argue that you have to gain solid silverware, no matter how impressive the lily gets gilded. As yet, Arsenal havent done that, at least in terms of winning the Champions League. Neither have they won back-to-back domestic titles, to weld gritty staying power on to their unquestionable majesty. Any real shift in power has got to include that. And if you want to get pedantic, there is even a strong case to say that Wengers two Double-winning sides from 1998 and 2002 were, by the very nature of their achievements, more accomplished units. For all that, however, this present lot, though they will have only one trophy to show for a magnificent effort, have taken the game of football onto an entirely new level. To remain unbeaten in the League with only four games to go is impressive enough. But to do it by producing consistently spellbinding football points to an achievement that may never be bettered. Having come up against Liverpool in their heyday, I would always hesitate to nominate something superior. Anfield in the 70s and 80s verge don the unplayable. But even those great sides could not go through an entire season undefeated; you could sometimes catch them cold. Arsenal, somehow, seem to have removed that particular weakness and done it with a panache bordering on the awesome. Assuming they dont slip up now, their place in history is rightfully assured.

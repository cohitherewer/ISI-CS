The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its an enormous relief, says Advocaat
 Dick Advocaat Faro: Dutch coach Dick Advocaat said it was an enormous relief finally to win a penalty shoot-out and reach the semi-finals of Euro 2004 on Saturday. The Dutch beat Sweden 5-4 to end a run of four consecutive losses in penalty shoot-outs at major tournaments after the match ended 0-0 after extra time. Its an enormous relief. It was very difficult match on both sides, he said. Its always a lottery and you have to be lucky. The atmosphere in the squad is absolutely great, everybody wants to do everything for each other. We came from far and now were in the semi-finals. It wasnt our best match but through hard work we got there. Advocaat, well aware of the previous problems, had prepared for the moment. I think we can do our job in the regular 90 minutes, but if necessary there is list of five players for the shoot-out, he said before the game. The list has existed since the second leg (of the qualifying play-off) against Scotland. Goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar who had been between the posts the last three times the Dutch had lost a penalty shoot-out  at the 1996 and 2000 European championships and at the 1998 World Cup  said he learned from the painful experience. I knew I had to change something because the way I used to do it never worked out, he said. You know that we lost three times but this time I was really well concentrated.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

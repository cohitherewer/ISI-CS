The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CFC rout Tolly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Chukuwama Paul at the Mohun Bagan ground on Monday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami lost 0-3 to Calcutta Football Club (CFC) in a Super Division match at the East Bengal ground on Monday. CFC, who played with 10 men for almost two-third of the match, shot into the lead in the eighth minute via Niladri Chakraborty and enhanced the margin in the 79th and 80th minutes through Nigerians Cheema Oku Felix and Chukuwama Paul, respectively. Tollygunge forwards wasted four goal-scoring opportunities during the entire match. Apart from that, it was all CFC, who literally toyed with their favoured opponents defence. Dipankar Chatterjee, who got his second yellow card of the match for deliberately handling the ball in the 31st minute, was instrumental for CFCs first goal. His forward pass was intercepted by advancing Felix from the right, who set it up for Niladri to complete the rest. Niladri made no mistake in placing the ball into the net. CFC had to wait till the 79th minute for their second goal, when a Raja Guha Thakurta free-kick from the right was brilliantly headed home by Felix. In the next minute, Paul sealed the fate of the match. Felix, after dodging two Tollygunge defenders cut inside and pushed the ball towards the goal. An Advancing Paul had just to jab it in. Tollygunge were resigned to their fate by then and made no further attempt to reduce the margin. Meanwhile, in another Super Division tie, Peerless SC beat George Telegraph by a Manoj Das strike at the Mohun Bagan ground. The Calcutta Port Trust-Wari match ended goalless.

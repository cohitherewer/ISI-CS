The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004  Proposal for Shiseido Cup 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: The race that bears the most competitive look in Tuesdays seven-event card is the main event, the 2,000m Shiseido Cup for horses in Class II and Class III. There are eight horses in the running and almost each one has a chance to land the spoils. However, going by his recent victory, that was very fluent in a mile race, Thrilling Proposal is fancied to win over the extended trip in the hands of C. Alford.				 										The 1,400m Ich Dien Cup may be an easy pick for Shining Jewel. Also from Vijays yard, the Jewel had placed a decent third, in his last start despite his year-long lay-off from the track. He is known to be comfortable over middle distances.				 										Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

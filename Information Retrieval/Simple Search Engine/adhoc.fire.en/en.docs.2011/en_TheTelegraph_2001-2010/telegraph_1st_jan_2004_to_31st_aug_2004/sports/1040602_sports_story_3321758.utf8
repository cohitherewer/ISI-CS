 Muralis tour chances 50-50: Mendis
Colombo: Sri Lankas cricket board said on Tuesday that off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharans chances of touring Australia in the upcoming two-Test series were 50-50. Sri Lankan cricket officials will decide later this week whether Muralidharan would join the tour after Australian Prime Minister John Howard reportedly offended the bowler by calling him a chucker  a term used to describe bowling with a bent arm. The Test series begins July 1. We are still discussing the issue and no final decision has been taken, Sri Lankan Cricket chief Duleep Mendis, said after a board meeting late on Monday. I would say it is 50-50 right now, but we are talking. Mendis said Sri Lankan board was also consulting with the ICC over the issue. He did not elaborate. Other cricket officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday that the chances of Muralidharan going to Australia were good. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting on Monday said he hoped Muralidharan would join the tour. Muralidharan became the most prolific wicket-taker in Test cricket when he snared 14 in two Tests against Zimbabwe last month, moving his haul to 527 to overtake the mark of 519 held by retired West Indies paceman Courtney Walsh. If Murali does travel to Australia, there will be an intersting tussle between him and Shane Warne. (AP)  Copyright

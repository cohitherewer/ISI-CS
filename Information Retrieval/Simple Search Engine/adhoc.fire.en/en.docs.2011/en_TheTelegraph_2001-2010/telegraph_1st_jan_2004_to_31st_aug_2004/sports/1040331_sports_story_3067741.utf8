 Subhas clarifies stand to IFA
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick during his deposition before the IFA governing body on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick, given a second chance, made an appearance at the IFA governing body meeting on Tuesday, explaining what exactly he had meant by certain derogatory remarks about the state association and also why he had not been present when called on December 13. The members heard the East Bengal coachs defence but reserved judgement till their next meeting, likely to be held in-camera within the next fortnight. The IFA disciplinary committee, at its January 29 meeting, had decided to debar Bhowmick from sitting in the technical area, reserve bench or inside-fence of any IFA-organised or approved meet for a period of two years beginning May 16. He had appealed against the harsh punishment and was asked to appear before the governing body members on Tuesday. I never wanted to belittle the IFA or avoid its governing body, Bhowmick deposed on Tuesday. No one has ever been involved with the IFA as me I have been captain of the state team, coach, manager and also been a member of the governing body. I know the importance of IFA only too well. He admitted criticising the IFA on certain issues, like the concept of the league championship play-off and organising a one-day tournament just to raise money. I genuinely feel these are not good for the game and players, and thats why I said the association is ignorant of modern football. The word ignorant was misinterpreted in the vernacular press It was wrongly reported that I had dubbed the IFA as fools, that was certainly not the case. Bhowmick saluted and thanked the IFA for implementing some of the suggestions subsequently  his way of justifying the criticism against the parent body. The coach reiterated the circumstances which forced him to skip the first governing body hearing in December. I had just come back from a miserable NFL campaign in Goa and Ludhiana when I received the letter. My job was at stake, I was in no position to attend that meeting thats why I sought three weeks time. He didnt even report to the disciplinary committee, on January 17. By that time, things had gone too far, the coach explained. Thats all I have to say. Whatever decision you take, Ill accept without any question, was Bhowmicks parting thought. His fate is now in the hands of governing body members, not all of whom were overly impressed with Bhowmicks deposition. As a few of them observed later, the coach was apologetic at times but hadnt been able to camouflage his arrogant attitude well enough.  Copyright

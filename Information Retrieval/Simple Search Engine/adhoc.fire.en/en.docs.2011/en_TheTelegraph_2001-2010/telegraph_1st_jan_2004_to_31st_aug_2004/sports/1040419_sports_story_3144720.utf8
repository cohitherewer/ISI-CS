 Lanka board reports Broad to ICC
Colombo: The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has raised concerns over the conduct of Match Referee Chris Broad, who reported off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan for a suspect bowling action. SLC chairman Mohan de Silva said on Sunday that they had informally informed the ICC about Broads behaviour during Australias tour last month. We have brought to the notice of the ICC his general conduct, De Silva said. It is not a formal protest or a complaint, but a letter to keep the ICC informed as part of our responsibility. Former England batsman Broad felt Muralidharans wrong one  that turns away from right-handers, was not above suspicion. The SLC raised concerns at that time, pointing out that Broad had acted unilaterally, without any of the umpires raising the issue. Muralidharan was then sent to Australia to work on his action with a bio-mechanical expert. De Silva said they believe the bowler would be cleared.  (AFP)  Copyright

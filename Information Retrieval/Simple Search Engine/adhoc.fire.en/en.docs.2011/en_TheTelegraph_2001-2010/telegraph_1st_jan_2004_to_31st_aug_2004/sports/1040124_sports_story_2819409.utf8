 Ferguson wants Leeds Milner

 BY SAM WALLACE 
Manchester United are planning a move for the Leeds teenager James Milner, it emerged Thursday, after the embattled Yorkshire club rejected a  5 million offer from Tottenham for the 17-year-old and his team-mate, goalkeeper Paul Robinson. 
Milner was watched by Alex Ferguson in one of the United managers rare trips to Manchester Citys new stadium before Christmas, and the striker has recently signed a deal with the Scots son, Jason, to look after his commercial rights. 
United are understood to be confident that they can get Milner at the right price before the transfer window closes next week, in keeping with their recent policy of investing in the best young talent from Europe and beyond. 
Although the club acknowledge that a move across the Pennines would invite heavy criticism from the Leeds fans upon a player so young, there is a feeling that Milner is not yet as symbolic a player at Elland Road as his teammate, Alan Smith. 
United paid 12 million for Louis Saha (who formally joined on Friday) but believe that Jason Fergusons contact with Milner should be enough to reassure the player that United would be his best option in a move that could cost as little as  4 million. Leeds are understood to be more confident of keeping Smith until the end of the season, at least.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Errant Owen left in tight spot
 BY WILLIAM JOHNSON Michael Owen has been left to make his own decision on whether to continue taking penalties for Liverpool after missing from the spot for the 10th time in his career at Southampton last Sunday. Gerard Houllier has held discussions with Owen on the penalties issue as Liverpool prepare for a crucial Premiership game against Portsmouth and the manager said: If Michael is happy to take the next one, thats ok by me. Owen, who is due to open talks about a new contract later this month, spoke of his anguish about penalty misses in a recent magazine interview. He said: In the week leading up to every game I take dozens and dozens of penalties in front of the gaffer. I was on a high before the FA Cup replay at Portsmouth. I thought I couldnt miss a penalty that week. Then the game comes round and you miss your first out of 100. You then think hows that happened? I am always disappointed to miss a chance from 12 yards. Houllier continues to show faith in his leading goal-scorer. He said: Michaels record in terms of what he has done for the club and what can still do for us deserves all the support we can give him. Im sure his confidence and sharpness will soon return and maybe he can win us a Champions League spot.  If Liverpool are serious about qualifying for the Europes elite competition they must win a run of three Premiership fixtures against opponents in danger of relegation. Houllier, fighting for his own position as well as that of his team, is convinced that crucial ground surrendered at Southampton can be recovered over what he sees as the potentially decisive second half of March. After Portsmouth, who have beaten Liverpool twice at Fratton Park since winning promotion last summer, Liverpool have a home match against Wolves on Saturday and a trip to Leicester eight days later.  Houllier said: We know what we have to do to finish fourth and Im convinced we will get there.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

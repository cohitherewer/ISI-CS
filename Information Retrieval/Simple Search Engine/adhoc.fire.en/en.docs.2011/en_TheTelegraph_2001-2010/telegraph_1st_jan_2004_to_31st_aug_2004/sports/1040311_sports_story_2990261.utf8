The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla stun Zimbabwe
 Rajin Saleh, who scored a valuable 57, in Harare on Wednesday. (AFP) Harare: Bangladesh ended a five-year victory drought when they beat Zimbabwe by eight runs in the third one-day International on Wednesday. The visitors scored 238 for seven after being put into bat before restricting Zimbabwe to 230 for nine to seal their first win since beating Pakistan by 62 runs in the 1999 World Cup. It was only their fourth victory in 83 one-day Internationals and captain Habib-ul Bashar left the field at the end of the game wiping tears of joy from his eyes. Bashar earlier scored 61, his eighth one-day half-century, off 80 balls to lay a solid foundation for his team, adding 114 for the third wicket with Rajin Saleh who contributed a cautious 57. Mohammed Ashraful ended unbeaten on 51 off just 32 balls, including five fours. Zimbabwes reply began shakily when seamer Tareq Aziz trapped Flower leg before for two in the fourth over. Barney Rogers and Stuart Carlisle wrested back the advantage with an aggressive second-wicket stand of 109 off 116 balls. But Zimbabwes spiral to defeat began in the 22nd over when Rogers drove a ball from medium pacer Mushfiqur Rahman to Alok Kapali at point. Rogers dismissal, for 51 scored off 63 balls with seven fours and a six, marked the beginning of a slide that claimed eight wickets for 109 runs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

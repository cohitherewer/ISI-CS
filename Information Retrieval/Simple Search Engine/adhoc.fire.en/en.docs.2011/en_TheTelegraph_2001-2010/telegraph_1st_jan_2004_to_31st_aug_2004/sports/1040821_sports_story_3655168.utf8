The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI face whitewash
 Matthew Hoggard, who scored a career-best 38, at The Oval on Friday. (AFP) London: West Indies face yet another defeat at close on the second day of the fourth Test. Following on, they were 84 for two in their second innings when stumps were drawn. The visitors first innings ended at 152. Earlier, Englands tail wagged merrily to post 470 all out. Geraint Jones took an excellent diving catch after Chris Gayle nicked Harmison down the leg. Nine balls later, Sylvester Joseph was caught by Ashley Giles at gully fending off a sharp delivery. Ramnaresh Sarwan quickly followed, edging Andrew Flintoff to Andrew Strauss in the slips with England sniffing the chance to home in on a record-equalling seventh consecutive Test win, having already wrapped up the four-match series 3-0. Brian Lara, who escaped a decent leg-before appeal from Flintoff, was batting on 17 at the tea with Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Giles had earlier led Englands tail, striking eight fours to equal his highest Test score of 52. Matthew Hoggard, dropped by Lara and Carlton Baugh, also made his best Test knock of 38.

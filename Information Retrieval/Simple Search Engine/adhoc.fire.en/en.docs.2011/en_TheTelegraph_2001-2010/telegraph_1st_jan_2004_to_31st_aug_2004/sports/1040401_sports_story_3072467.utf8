Big clubs spoiling core values: Platini 
- Killing local talent by bringing in foreigners will affect soccer globally
 European clubs poaching African talent, says PlatiniZurich: Michel Platini is urging soccer to return to its core values, with young players nurtured locally to avoid the game losing its global popularity. The former France great says the game is being spoiled by big clubs fielding too many foreign players. If football fails to return to its core values, over the next few years its popularity will fade. Regulations are being lifted everywhere...We need to restore order and begin by opening up the debate to include the largest number of people, Platini, 48, said in an interview with Fifa.com to be published on Thursday. Is it okay that some sides dont even field two players from their own country? And then what about those clubs that buy their players abroad. Is it okay that there are a dozen Africans playing for Beveren, in Belgium? I mean, why do they still call themselves Beveren? Why do they still play in Belgium? These are questions I often ask myself... said Platini, Frances greatest-ever player, and now a member of both the Fifa and Uefa executive committees. He has also accused European clubs of poaching African talent. The European clubs who open training centres in Africa do it to further their own interests, not to help with the development of African football. It should be Africans themselves who take charge of their own development by investing the money they receive from Fifa for example. Otherwise, whos going to train up the kids in Europe? Why should a young kid in Beveren bother working hard at his football if he has no chance of pulling on his local club shirt? Platini said that if he had not been given the opportunity to play for his local town when he was young, he would never have turned professional and suggested the soccer authorities should talk again to the European Commission about the rules concerning freedom of movement in employment. We may have forgotten to prepare the football of tomorrow, both from an economic perspective and as regards the movement of players. He argued: Football clubs play a vital social role in Europe. It is thanks to the work of associations, often staffed by volunteers, that children have ended up playing football rather than hanging around on street corners. But now that clubs are investing elsewhere, what will happen to these kids? Platini is also unhappy about the evolution of the old European Cup into todays elite Champions League competition. I just think its a pity that Europes top sides only play against each other these days. When I was at Juventus, we played in Gdansk and in Reykjavik in the first round, in the so called small nations, where the grounds were full and where there was a tremendous atmosphere.  Now the big clubs dont want to play against the little clubs any more. By playing one another they think they can solve their financial problems. But that isnt what football should be about. I mean, is it right that the champions of each nation dont all play in the same tournament together? However, he does not think that too much football will actually kill off interest in the sport. We have more and more TV channels. If there are more games, the TV viewer has more choice in the games he wants to see. The real problem lies in quality of a given competition: the more interesting the game, the more people watch it, and the greater the value. (Reuters)  Copyright

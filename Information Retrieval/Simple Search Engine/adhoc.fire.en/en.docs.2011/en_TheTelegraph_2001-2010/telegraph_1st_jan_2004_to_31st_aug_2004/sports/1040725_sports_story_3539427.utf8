The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sluggish EB overcome Md. Sp.
 - SUPER DIVISION - Players have reached 55-60 per cent fitness level: Bhowmick  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia attempts to score during East Bengals Super Division match against Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta, July 24: East Bengal overcame a sluggish and insipid first half to a solitary goal victory over Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Douglas da Silva scored the winner in the 68th minute. This was Subhas Bhowmicks last chance to test the fitness and condition of his players prior to the Leicester City tournament and the coach did not waste the opportunity. Syed Rahim Nabi was tried out as a left back in a bid to utilise the strikers speed during counterattacks and he did not disappoint. Many a times he moved down the flanks opening up the rival defence, though, his defensive qualities will remain suspect. He was also guilty of missing a couple of sitters early in the second session. I am not satisfied with the fitness of the players, Bhowmick said later. Were still in the process of achieving satisfactory levels and have only reached 55-60 per cent now. Last year during this time at the ASEAN meet we were close to 110 per cent having trained for four weeks. Weve hardly worked together for two weeks this time around. Mohammedan Sporting tied East Bengal to knots, crowding the penalty box at times with nine men, and the favourites found it tough to break the deadlock. Aga Abdul Wahid gave Bhaichung Bhutia very little opportunity to move freely and it was only after the stopper-back was forced to retire with an injury that the star striker managed to make his presence felt. An acrobatic header off a Shylo Malsawmtluanga cross was narrowly saved by the goalie. The arrival of Dipankar Roy and Bijen Singh in the second half changed things for East Bengal. Bijens arrival on the right brought about a whiff of fresh air as he stretched the rival defence and thus opened up spaces in the middle. The goal came off a Dipankar corner. Climax Lawrence back headed the ball for Douglas to react positively in the nick of time. Dipankar could have turned a hero after stepping on to the ground. His shot off a Bhaichung backpass inside the box was saved by Chinmoy Banerjee. As the ball ricocheted back to play, Nabi fumbled from close. In the 72 minute, Bhaichung missed another sitter when his push of a Bijen minus was saved on the goalline by Palash Ghosh. TEAMS East Bengal: Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Syed Rahim Nabi (Bijen Singh 64), Madhab Das (Chandan Das 36), Louis Aniweta, Deepak Mondal, Sasthi Duley, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Climax Lawrence, Douglas da Silva, Alvito DCunha (Dipankar Roy 49), Bhaichung Bhutia. Mohammedan Sporting: Chinmoy Banerjee (Gopal Ghosh 64), Temjem Kibang, Naushad Moosa, Aga Abdul Wahid (Palash Ghosh 70), Ratan Singh, Amjad Hussain, Md Bin Hasan, Anit Ghosh, Jiten Rai, Abdul Rauf Khan (Sandip Saha, 42), Siddharth Thapa. Referee: Benjanim DSilva. Surkumar issue Bhowmick today claimed that he had found a replacement for Surkumar Singh. He, though, declined to take any names. Bhowmicks comments, thus, may carry a connotation that the club is actually contemplating on releasing the right-back. East Bengal had earlier demanded a stay on the Mahindra-bound Surkumar, alleging he owes the club Rs 1 lakh. His case has been refereed to the AIFFs disciplinary committee.  Copyright

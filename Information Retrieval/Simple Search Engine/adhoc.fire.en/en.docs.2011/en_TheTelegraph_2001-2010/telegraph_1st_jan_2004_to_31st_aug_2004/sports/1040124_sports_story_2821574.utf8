The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We wanted to do it for Hookes: Lee

 Melbourne: Brett Lee, who smashed a six in 
 the final over to lead Australia to victory over India in 
 the tri-series ODI on Thursday night, has dedicated the 
 win to David Hookes, who died on Monday. 
 The guys really wanted to do it for Hookes, Lee 
 told a Sydney radio station. Its been a tragic week not 
 only for his family but the whole cricketing world. There 
 was a fair bit of emotion out there and we really wanted 
 to walk away with a win. 
I think deep down somebody was watching and helping us last night when we were out there for those last couple of balls. 
The ball came and I shut my eyes and swung as hard as I could... it sailed over the fence  happy days, said Lee, who also took two for 46 in a return to form with the ball. 
Eight wickets down and requiring 11 runs to win off the 34th and final over in a rain-interrupted match, Australia achieved victory with one ball to spare after Lee and Andy Bichel took four runs from the first three balls then Lee hit a six and a single. 
Hookes, 48, died after suffering serious head injuries and a heart attack in an assault outside a Melbourne hotel on Sunday night. 
He was resuscitated at the scene and rushed to hospital in a coma but never regained consciousness. 
 Hookes was one of Australias most popular and charismatic 
 players. He played 23 Tests from 1976-77 to 1985-86 and 
 worked as a radio-TV commentator and coach of Victoria after 
 his retirement.

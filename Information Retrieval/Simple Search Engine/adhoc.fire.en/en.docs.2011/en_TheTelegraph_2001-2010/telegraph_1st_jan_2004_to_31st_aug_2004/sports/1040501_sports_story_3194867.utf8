The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bedi doesnt mind sharing his art
 - If invited by the Pakistan Cricket Board, former India captain would like Prasanna to be involved too  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  A file picture of Bedi and Prasanna Calcutta: Bishan Singh Bedi has no qualms hopping across the border and sharing his expertise with the emerging spinners in Pakistan. However, when a formal invitation does come, the former India captain will suggest that the other spin twin, Erapalli Prasanna, also be invited. Pras is a great teacher and, believe me, the finest off-spinner Todays generation, therefore, should learn from Pras as well, Bedi, an iconic left-arm spinner and the Indian teams first coach (1990  then designated cricket manager), told The Telegraph on Friday. Bedi (266 Test wickets) and Prasanna (189) have worked together at the spinners clinics hosted by the MRF facility in Chennai. It was at one such arrangement, not many years ago, that Matthew Hayden honed his skills  in fact, that exposure altered the direction his career was taking. Pakistans chief selector Wasim Bari, it may be recalled, has recommended to his Board that Bedis experience be utilised at a special camp for seven-eight upcoming spinners. I havent heard from Lahore (where the Pakistan Cricket Board is headquartered), but I dont have a problem in sharing my art If Wasim Akram can have a session with the Indian quicks (in Australia), there cant be anything wrong about my interacting with Pakistani spinners, Bedi, who was contacted on his cellphone, remarked. Bedi, of course, acknowledged he was pleasantly surprised to read about Baris suggestion. Must confess I wasnt expecting it But, as the just-ended Revival Tour showed, cricketers are best suited to spread harmony Bari isnt a politician and, so, didnt have to weigh the pros and cons before going public with his thoughts Its the politicians who Bedi, not particularly known for being diplomatic with words, added. While he did watch every ball during the recent ODIs and Tests, sitting in Dubai as an expert for a premier channel there, Bedi didnt talk at length about Pakistans spinners. Yet, Bedi did say: Theres no dearth of talent there, its only that the cricket sense is lacking That acumen isnt there More than anything else, one-day cricket is responsible for the current state of affairs The spinners (and even quicks) have forgotten how to think-out batsmen Asked if he is disappointed that nobody associated with Team India has ever thought of drawing on his expertise, Bedi responded: Oh, no Its their prerogative Why must I be disappointed? From my side, it has always been good luck to the boys. Incidentally, its customary for every England side to request Bedi for tips before/during engagements in India. The maestro, by the way, has never failed to oblige  I wont take the art of left-arm spin with me when I die Why not share it with those who wish to learn? In this age and time, its an exceptional sentiment.  Copyright

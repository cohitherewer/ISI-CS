The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wilander volte-face
 Amelie Mauresmo celebrates her win over Alicia Molik in Melbourne on Sunday Melbourne: Seven-time Grand Slam titlist Mats Wilander said he first remembered Andre Agassi as a skinny kid from Las Vegas who could hit the ball hard but not very accurately. On Sunday, Wilander, a former No. 1, wrote in Melbournes Sunday Age that he first met Agassi in 1986 when he was the top-seed at a La Quinta, California, tournament. We went onto the court and in the warm-up, after the first four or five shots, Im thinking, Oh my god, this guy can really hit the ball, Wilander wrote. But Agassi was also hitting them well out. Wilander wrote that when he was asked what he thought about Agassis game, he said Agassi doesnt know how to play the game. He understands how to hit a lot of shots, but he doesnt understand how to win points or construct points. Wilander now says Agassi has honed his tennis brain and knows his game better than any other player. Amelie not surprised n Frances Amelie Mauresmo was one of the most vocal critics of the Australian Opens decision to give Venus Williams the third seeding at Melbourne. Venus was No. 11 in the world rankings but was given the improved seeding due to her play at Grand Slams before she began a six-month layoff. Mauresmo, seeded fourth because of that decision, wasnt surprised to see Venus lose to Lisa Raymond. I wasnt surprised, said Mauresmo. Lisa crowded her all the time and put the pressure on. Venus hadnt played in six months, she needs a bit of time to get all her tennis back. Rising star n Lleyton Hewitt,who in 2001 became the youngest mens No. 1 in the history of the ATP rankings, came face-to-face with another rising phenom  Spanish 17-year-old Rafael Nadal in the third round. Hewitt won but not before Nadal showed why hes been so highly rated. Hes a great player, Hewitt said. Hes going to be very good in a couple of years. (AP)  Copyright

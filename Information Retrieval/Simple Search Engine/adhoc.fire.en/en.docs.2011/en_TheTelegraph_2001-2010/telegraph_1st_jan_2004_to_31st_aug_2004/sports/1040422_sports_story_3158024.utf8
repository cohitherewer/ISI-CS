The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United close in on Chelsea

(Reuters) London: Manchester United moved within a point of Chelsea in the battle for second place in the Premier League after a 2-0 home win over Charlton Athletic on Tuesday. While Chelsea were engaged in European action, a role Alex Fergusons side usually expects to fulfil at this time of the year, United got on with domestic issues and secured a solid win. They remain third on 71 points from 34 games, one behind Chelsea, who have also played 34. Arsenal look certain to win the league as they are clear on 81 points from 33 games. United took the lead after 28 minutes when French striker Louis Saha fired in from ten metres after a clever pass from compatriot David Bellion. United, with Paul Scholes suspended and Roy Keane and Ryan Giggs on the bench ahead of next weekends big game against Liverpool, continued to look the more positive side without creating too many clear chances. Charlton had a strong penalty claim waved away when Paul Konchesky went down in the box early in the second half and the game was settled in the 65th minute when Saha set up Gary Neville. The England defender, who scored his first Premier League goal for United in more than three years to beat Leicester City last week, had started the move deep in his own half and finished it calmly for his second of the campaign. I was amazed that one went in, said the 29-year-old Neville. It just went across the keeper. It gave us an easier 20 minutes at the end though. Both sides hit the woodwork late on, Ruud van Nistelrooy for United and Shaun Bartlett for Charlton, but United were comfortable winners. The defeat leaves Charlton Athletic seventh on 48 points and severely dents their hopes of snatching fourth place, currently occupied by Liverpool on 50 points.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Directors play spoilsport
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, May 18: Even as the International Cricket Council (ICC) plots its next move on Zimbabwe, The Telegraph learns that a small number of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) directors played the lead role in embarrassing ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. Actually, they snubbed the sports governing body itself. Look, a small number of the directors, who behaved very aggressively during yesterdays explosive ZCU board meeting (in Harare), emphasised that no purpose would be served by interacting with Speed. What followed (today), from the ZCU, is a direct result of that, a well-placed source revealed late this evening. Whatever, the (Peter Chingoka-controlled) ZCUs behaviour can hardly be termed appropriate.  Copyright

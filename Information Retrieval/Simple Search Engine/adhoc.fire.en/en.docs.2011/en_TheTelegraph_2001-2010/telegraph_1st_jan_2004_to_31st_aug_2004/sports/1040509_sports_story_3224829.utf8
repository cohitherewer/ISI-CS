 Dravid, Rameez in Dubai debate
Islamabad, May 8 (PTI): Rahul Dravid will take part in a day-long televised debate on Indo-Pak relations vis-a-vis cricket, alongside PCBs CEO Rameez Raja in Dubai next week. The duo would arrive in Dubai on May 12 for the debate, scheduled for the following day and organised by a sports channel. Rameez said he had given his consent to the debate because it is an excellent forum to present the Pakistan point of view on relations with India.  Copyright

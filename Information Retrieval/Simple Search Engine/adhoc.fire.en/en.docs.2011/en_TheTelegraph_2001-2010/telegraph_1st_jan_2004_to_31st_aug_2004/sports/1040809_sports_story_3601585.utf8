The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Huge positive step, says Smith
Galle: South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes his team will take a psychological advantage over Sri Lanka into this weeks second Test after escaping with a draw in the series opener on Sunday. Sri Lanka had been widely expected to go 1-0 up in the two-match series by bowling on a crumbling fifth-day pitch, but South Africas top order defied the home spinners, batting out the day to finish on 203 for three. Two months ago, people must have been questioning whether the match was going to last five days, or whether we would be able to bat out the final day, Smith said. This is a huge, positive step for us, he added. We played some serious cricket and go to Colombo with more confidence than Sri Lanka. We have got a few things we can improve on but, at the moment, they (Sri Lanka) are asking more questions than we are. I am really proud, though, of the way the guys have performed. Smith led from the front on the last day, shrugging aside ill-health to make his teams top score of 74. Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu gave credit to the discipline shown by South Africas batsmen. I thought they worked to a plan and they achieved that, he said. We did not see anything jumping out of the footmarks, which is unusual in Galle, he said. People thought we would go one-nil up here but it didnt happen. We now have to go to Colombo and do our best there. The second Test starts in Colombo on Wednesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

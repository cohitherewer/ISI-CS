The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan to show-cause Barreto
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: There has been no dramatic change in the script, but the Jose Ramirez Barretro saga may not be over yet. The Brazilian ball-charmer is bent on leaving and the club decided to slap a show-cause notice on him on Monday. It is a case of breach of contract He cant leave us at the halfway stage (of the National League) purely on sentimental grounds. We have decided to seek an explanation from him and will proceed accordingly if he doesnt come with a satisfactory answer, said Justice G.N. Roy, one of the three court-appointed Special Officers. Barreto is contractually obligated with Mohun Bagan till March 31, according to the clubs assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury. Club sources didnt rule out approaching higher authorities like the Fifa or the AFC if Barreto does stick to his stand. At this stage, such a possibility cant be ruled out. The player concerned, however, didnt give any hint that he will backtrack on his drastic stand. There is no question of going back on my words. I wont change my mind, Barreto told The Telegraph. Barreto decided that he wont continue for Mohun Bagan alleging that a few officials had insulted him during their Goa tour. In spite of a number of requests, he stuck to his stance and skipped Mohun Bagans game against JCT on Sunday. Barreto is likely to leave the city on Friday.  Copyright

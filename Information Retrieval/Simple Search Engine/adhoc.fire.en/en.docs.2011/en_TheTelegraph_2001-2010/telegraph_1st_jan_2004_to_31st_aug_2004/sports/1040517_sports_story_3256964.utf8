 Indian veterans for faster process
 Borde amp; Co. say umpires should rule on bowling actions Mumbai: The ICCs method of dealing with bowlers with suspect actions is time consuming, feel three former India captains. Polly Umrigar, Nari Contractor and Chandu Borde all said the existing process of the ICC is very long. They also want the umpires to call a bowler for chucking. In such cases a decision should be taken quickly. I am not very much in favour of the current process. If someone chucks, he chucks. There are no two ways about it, said Umrigar. The umpire should call when a bowler chucks. He should warn the bowler and tell the captain that he has to correct his action in order to bowl again in the innings, Umrigar said. On the rule of the degree of flexion for different types of bowlers, which has been accepted by the lawmakers, Umrigar said he was not sure how accurate it was. How do you judge these things in naked eye. Its full of loopholes. Its better to leave it to the judgement of the umpires whether a bowler throws or not. They would know. Former opener Contractor supported Umrigar. However dumb a cricketer may be, he will not chuck when hes under scrutiny in a non-match situation. There, his action is cleared by the authorities and he goes back and starts chucking again when he bowls in matches, Contractor said. The current process is too long and not ideal. Instead, it would be better if hes called by the umpires if they feel his action is not proper. The bowler should be told by the umpire that his action is not legal and if he repeats it, he can be banished from bowling in the same innings. Borde also felt the current process is too long. It takes a lot of time. Its so long that by the time a decision is taken, the tour gets over and the series is decided. The bowler wont bowl the same way when he is inspected off-field. The best way to judge the legality of his action is only during matches, Borde added.  (PTI)  Copyright

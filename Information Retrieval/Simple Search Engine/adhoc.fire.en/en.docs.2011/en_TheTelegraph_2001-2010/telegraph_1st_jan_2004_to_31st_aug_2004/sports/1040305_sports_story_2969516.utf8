 Bagan battle back 
 - Eduardo strike lifts city giants after listless first half  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Salgaocar keeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar foils an Eduardo attempt on goal at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohun Bagan lifted their game by several notches after a dismal first half to beat Salgaocar 1-0 in Thursdays National League match at Salt Lake Stadium. The win handed Mohun Bagan a lifeline of sorts, lifting them to 18 points after 13 outings, a position from where they can seriously think of a decent finish. Salgaocar, whose title hopes suffered a body blow, stay on 17 from 13. The way things were in the opening session, a Mohun Bagan win seemed unlikely. They found an even more surprising hero in Eduardo Ribeiro  the Brazilian who had done little of note since joining the club in the initial stages of the marathon league. Salgaocar were severely handicapped by the absence of two of their foreign recruits  Bello Rassaq and Felix Ibrebu  who received red cards in Sundays match against East Bengal. The Goans still dominated the first half because the Mohun Bagan midfielders put up a pathetic display. There was no link between them and the strikers and the home team survived because its much-criticised defence stood firm. Things changed dramatically in the second half, as Mohun Bagan suddenly found some life down the right flank. Mehtab Hussain worked hard as did Ashim Biswas. The striker was often falling back to initiate moves and taking a fair amount of load. The goal came from one such move down the right, which was not exactly a threatening one. Mehtabs cross bounced inside the box and almost everybody thought it was a harmless ball. Eduardo jumped and nodded in a feeble header that was just too far from the goalkeeper. Mohun Bagan came close on a few occasions after this and goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar must be credited for making three good saves. Captain Rennedy Singh missed a sitter after being set up inside the box by Ashim in the 63rd minute. Salgaocar wasted a simple chance of salvaging a point in injury time, when Samson Singh slipped inside the box following a lapse in marking, but the substitute drove his shot well above the bar with the goalkeeper at his mercy. TEAMS Mohun Bagan: Prasanta Dora; Manitombi Singh, Leonardo de Almeida, Sanjiv Maria, Rishi Kapoor; Mehtab Hussain, Rocus Lamare, Noel Kasak, Rennedy Singh; Akum Ao (Eduardo Ribeiro, 33), Ashim Biswas.

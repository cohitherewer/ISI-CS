The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB a hit in Leicester
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Bhaichung Bhutia in a tussle with Maritimos Fernando during their match at the Walker Stadium, Leicester on Sunday Calcutta: Delighted by the response from the Asian community during their 120th anniversary celebration tournament, Leicester City FC intends to invite East Bengal to England again. The club demoted from Premier League last season won the four-team tournament on Sunday, having beaten East Bengal 1-0 in the semi-finals a day earlier. The Indian champions lost 0-3 to Maritimo of Portugal in Sundays third-fourth place game, thereby losing both their matches, but their trip to England has been hailed as a hit by the English club. The official website of Leicester City FC dubbed the tournament as a major step forward in the clubs Asian community development programme. With Indian champions East Bengal making their first-ever appearance in Europe, the Foxes were delighted with the response of the Asian community, it said. The clubs Chief Operating Officer Paul Mace said: We estimate that 30 per cent of Saturdays crowd came from the Asian community, most of them visiting us for the first time  not just from Leicester, but from throughout the country. We have had a lot of very positive feedback and look forward to welcoming them (East Bengal) to the Walkers Stadium again in the future. There was a fantastic carnival atmosphere. East Bengals gallant showing against the host club, who won via a 69th-minute penalty, drew applause from former Leicester City star Matt Jones as well. This team has great potential. Unfortunately, the game turned on the two penalty decisions, and some might think that the referee got them both wrong. We could easily have been looking at 1-0 to your boys, he said of an appeal for penalty by East Bengal which was turned down by the referee. East Bengal star Bhaichung Bhutia too was critical of the referee, saying he should have won a penalty. I was disappointed not to get the decision as I know there was definitely contact. As for their penalty, I thought it was very harsh. It was a good match, I think that the team made India proud.  Copyright

 Safin hits out at ATP
Hamburg, May 13 (AFP): Former world No. 1 Marat Safin launched a blistering attack on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the governing body which runs the mens tour, after crashing to a surprise defeat in the third round of the Hamburg Masters Series here on Thursday. The Russian was angry about the balls being used, alleging that the ATP did not care and that it was ignoring complaints. The temperamental 24-year-old also suggested he might pull out of the French Open, starting in ten days time. The courts are soft which give a lot of bad bounces (in Hamburg), but its also the balls we are playing with. They are ridiculous, claimed Safin who was beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Jurgen Melzer, the world No. 68 from Austria. Everyone is complaining and the ATP doesnt do anything. I spoke to many players who think the same and it seems ATP doesnt care. For players who have a big serve, you cant play. All of a sudden the ball is going straight to the fence and you have no confidence in your shots. You start to play slower. Everything goes out and you dont enjoy it.  Copyright

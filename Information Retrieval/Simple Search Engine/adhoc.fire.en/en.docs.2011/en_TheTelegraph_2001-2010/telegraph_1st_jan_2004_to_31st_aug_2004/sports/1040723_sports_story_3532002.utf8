 Sasi shares third spot
 Sasi let Morozevich off the hook Biel: Krishnan Sasikiran let top seed Alexander Morozevich of Russia off the hook in the third round of the Grandmasters section at the Biel international chess festival here on Thursday. The Indian GM posed a serious threat but the Morozevich held on for a draw and maintained his slender half point lead with 2.5 from three games. Second seed Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine remained on the heels of the leader with two points in his kitty. Sasikiran, Eienne Bacrot of France and local star Yannick Pelletier shared the third spot with 1.5 points while Luke Mcshane of England was yet to open his account. The category-18 event is being played on a double round-robin basis between six players and there are ten games in all. Sasikiran played a double-edged game with white pieces. Up against the main variation of the Slav defence by Morozevich, the Indian apparently had an advantage in the middle game after his opponent tried too hard in an approximately equal position. Sasikiran offered a draw after the 26th move that was refused by Morozevich but thereon only the former could boast of any winning chances. In the Masters section, Indian GM norm aspirants had a bad day as both Asian junior champion P Magesh Chandran and former national champion P Konguvel tasted defeats. While Chandran went down to GM Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine, Konguvel failed to impress Alexander Rustemov of Russia. Young Parimarjan Negi scored his first victory of the meet, beating Ronald Arbonger of Germany, and took his tally to 1.5 points and R.R. Vasudevan drew with William Wright of the US.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Holland escape with draw vs Spain 
Madrid: Olympic champions The Netherlands escaped with a 2-2 draw with Spain in a crucial pool A game of the mens Olympic hockey qualifying tournament here on Friday. The Spaniards looked the gift horse in the mouth, wasting a penalty stroke apart from a couple of sitters while the Dutch, leading 2-0 by the 23rd minute, must surely thank their stars to come out with one point. In a game that provided plenty of spills and thrills to the packed gathering, the Dutch scored through Rob Reckers (7th) and Nick Meijer (21st). But Spain retaliated in style and Santiago Freixa found the net twice, in the 35th and 52nd minutes. Both Spain and Holland share the top spot in the pool with seven points apiece with two wins and a draw. The Dutch appeared tactically superior in the initial stages when they kept possession and controlled the flow. Their crisp passing and positional play gave little chance for Spain to get into the game. Reckers put the Dutch in front following a terrible goalkeeping error by Bernardino Herrera who failed to clear an innocuous hit from outside the circle. Reckers pounced on the clearance to score. A little later, Meijer put home a long hit from Rob Drikx and the Dutch were up and flying. However, the Spaniards gradually came into the game with a series of their patented counter-attacks. Meanwhile, in another pool A match, a 35th minute penalty corner goal by Tom Bertram carried Great Britain to a 1-0 win against Japan. Britain, who had lost both their games, thus, opened their points tally while Japan have just one point from the 4-4 draw with Poland.  (PTI)  Copyright

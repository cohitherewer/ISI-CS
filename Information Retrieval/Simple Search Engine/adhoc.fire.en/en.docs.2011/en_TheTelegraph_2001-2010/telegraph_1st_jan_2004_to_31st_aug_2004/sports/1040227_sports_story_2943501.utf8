				 																																	Milan: Italy defender Alessandro Nesta was interviewed by financial police in Rome on Wednesday as part of an investigation into the collapse of Italian food company Cirio. They said Nesta was interviewed as part of a probe into transfers of Lazio players, formerly owned by Cirio. Nesta was captain of Lazio and a former board member before joining AC Milan last season.				 																																	Pavel Nedved of Juventus and Chievo Verona goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani, both former Lazio players, have also been interviewed, investigators said. They are looking into whether money was moved from Cirio into Lazio and if transfer fees for Lazio players were inflated. All three were interviewed as part of the information gathering process and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on their part. Cirio owner and former Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti was arrested on February 11.				 																																	Bucharest: Gabriela Szabos participation in the world indoor championships next week is in doubt because of a mystery fitness problem, the Romanian Athletics Federation (FRA) president said. Szabo, the Olympic 5,000m champion, failed to finish a 3,000m race at an indoor meeting in Birmingham last week. Szabo will be investigated, she will undergo detailed medical tests, FRA president Iolanda Balas said. We have to know why Szabo stopped six laps before finishing the race (in Birmingham), even though her training seemed to be perfect.				 																																	Madrid: Celta Vigo goalkeeper Pablo Cavallero has been operated on after fracturing his nose during his sides 2-3 defeat against Arsenal in the first leg of the Champions League knockout tie on Tuesday. The Argentinean collided with Arsenal midfielder Edu as the Brazilian scored the opening goal but, after receiving treatment, he was able to complete the game. Cavallero will miss his sides match against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu this Sunday and remains doubtful for the return leg against Arsenal at Highbury on March 10. He certainly cant play on Sunday and we will have to wait and see what happens for the next match after that. It will take around 12 days for him to be ready to play again, club doctor Mario Galan said.				 																																	London: Two extra-time goals from substitute striker Tommy Smith gave Sunderland a 2-0 upset victory over Premier League Birmingham City in their FA Cup fifth round replay on Wednesday. Victory for Mick McCarthys side lined up a Cup quarter final at home to first division rivals Sheffield United on March 7. Deadlocked at 0-0 after 90 minutes, Smith poached his first goal from point-blank range in the ninth minute of extra time after a Kevin Kyle effort came back off the woodwork. Smith followed up in the 115th minute with a superb solo effort.				 																																	Athens: Iraqi athletes will compete in the Olympic Games even if they do not qualify, an official said. We are not expecting medals, but at least to have the adequate level to take part in the Games, Pere Miro, Director of Olympic Solidarity, said. Olympic Solidarity provides economic assistance and organisational support to national Olympic committees.				 																																	Demonstrators protesting against the holding of the Games here clashed with police. About 20 hooded persons hurled stones at policemen guarding the labour ministry, as some 500 marched against the decision to hold the Games here. 				 																																	Athens: The tiny Pacific island nation of Kiribati, a newcomer at this years Athens Olympics, will push for membership of Fifa after the Games, an official said on Thursday. 				 																																	Our national sport is soccer, everyone plays it and we want to start procedures after the Olympics to become a member of Fifa, thats our next move, Inatio Tanentoa, Kiribati National Olympic Committee vice-president, said.

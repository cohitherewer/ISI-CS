 Ranieri goes with golden handshake, but no silver
 BY JOHN LEY  Ranieri is negotiating terms of his departure Footballs equivalent of Chinese torture came to an end at Stamford Bridge on Monday when Chelsea confirmed the departure of Claudio Ranieri, after more than eight months of speculation. Ranieri is now negotiating the terms of his departure and it is believed he could leave with more than 6 million, after agreeing to go with three years of his contract still remaining. The Italian, who took Chelsea to second place in the Premiership and the semi-finals of the Champions League, was earning around 2 million a year, but with extra payments for achievements in various competitions. It is understood his negotiators believe that by terminating his contract now, he is being deprived the opportunity to earn such bonuses, though Chelsea, given their extravagant spending on players, will not be too concerned to see Ranieri depart with what will surely be the largest golden handshake in English football. A 62-word statement on Chelseas website confirmed Ranieris fate and a spokesman said: Claudio has done a first-class job for the club and paved the way for future success. We would like to wish Claudio all the best for the future. We are discussing the exact terms of his departure with him and his representatives. Ranieris departure paves the way for the appointment of Jose Mourinho on a four-year contract worth 16 million. Given the achievements of Ranieri, the conclusion will be that the man who won the Uefa Cup and Champions League in successive seasons with FC Porto will have to at least deliver the Premiership title to London SW6 in his first season. The board of Porto was in discussions over the future of Mourinho, and while there are other high-profile clubs around Europe interested in his doubtless ability, he is expected to be confirmed as Ranieris successor. [According to a late agency report from Lisbon, Porto have agreed terms with Chelsea for the annulment of Jose Mourinhos contract.] While there are those who will have sympathy for Ranieri and the dignity with which he conducted himself under continued speculation over his position, it should be pointed out that in four years at Stamford Bridge he failed to win a trophy, despite being offered, towards the end of his career there, massive finances. That he will leave with a substantial sum will also limit the amount of sympathy he receives. Ranieri spent 130 million in signing some of the worlds most expensive players even if, possibly, they were not all to his liking. He also confused with his tactics and his love for changing teams. The self-professed Tinkerman raised eyebrows on more than the odd occasion, no more so than in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final when, with the scores level at half-time he introduced the unfit Juan Sebastian Veron, moved Hernan Crespo, the goalscorer, to midfield, and replaced a full-back with a striker. The result was that ten-man Monaco won 3-1. His future, if already uncertain, was clear after Chelsea were held to a 2-2 draw in the second leg. However, the way in which Chelsea have conducted their negotiations, firstly with England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson and, latterly, with Mourinho, even with Ranieri still in their employ, leaves a bitter taste. As long ago as September, when Chelsea won 5-0 at Wolverhampton Wanderers to move briefly to the top of the Premiership after enjoying the clubs best start to a League season for 75 years, Ranieris position was considered less than comfortable. Chelsea continued to insist that Ranieri would remain in charge at least until the end of the season, but the links with Eriksson refused to go away, particularly after he was pictured entering a meeting with Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner. And when the Swede finally agreed a new contract to extend his stay with England, at the end of March, it was confirmed that he had held discussions over the possibility of moving back into club management at Stamford Bridge. Ranieri, a former Valencia and Atletico Madrid coach, who may now be considered for the vacancy at Tottenham Hotspur, won friends with his quirky statements and humour. On the day he signed Veron and Joe Cole, for more than 20 million, he was immediately on the defensive, saying: It needs time. Rome wasnt built in a day, as you say in England. Ranieri was brought to the club by Ken Bates, who replaced one Italian with another following the sacking of Gianluca Vialli. When Abramovich arrived last summer and Bates hold weakened, Ranieri lost possibly his closest ally at the club.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

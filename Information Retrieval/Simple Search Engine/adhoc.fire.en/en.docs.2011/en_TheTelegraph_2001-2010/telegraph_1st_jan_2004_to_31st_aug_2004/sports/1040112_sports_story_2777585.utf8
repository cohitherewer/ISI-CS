The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand takes sole lead
Wijk aan Zee: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand was brilliance personified as he crashed through the defences of overnight leader Vladimir Akopian of Armenia to emerge as leader in the Corus chess tournament here. After a rather disastrous first round loss against Akopian, world No. 2 Vladimir Kramnik of Russia bounced back into reckoning after outclassing local hope GM Loek Van Wely on another day where caution prevailed over the grit. As things stand now in this category-19 14-player event, Anand is in sole lead on 1.5 points from his two games and has done what might effectively be useful.A victory against someone who beats Kramnik can be really handy in a tournament like this. Akopian might have been flying high after his rather satisfying triumph over Kramnik but his hopes of even making it a grand fight against the Indian stalwart were dashed in spectacular fashion. The battle started with a Sicilian Nazdorf after Akopian employed the Sicilian defence. Anand looked in some temporary problems as his attack on the king took a back seat in the middle game stage and he resorted to the defence of his apparently vulnerable king on the other flank after netting himself a pawn amidst complexities. Just the right kind of manoeuvres frustrated Akopian into going for an exchange sacrifice that yielded nothing as Anand defended with precision. The final position was picturesque as Anand threatened to push his passed king pawn to glory, leaving his king in an optical danger and his rook en prise. The game lasted 45 moves. Kramnik was at his attacking best in beating Van Wely from the white side of a Sicilian dragon game. Van Wely, who impressed last year finishing joint fourth could not really pose a challenge in Kramniks quest who struck back. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zidane worlds best, says Tigana 
Lisbon: Zinedine Zidanes match-winning heroics for France in their last-gasp win over England at Euro 2004 have confirmed his status as the worlds best player, the countrys former great Jean Tigana said on Wednesday. Tigana, tipped as the next France coach, also praised English teenage striker Wayne Rooney and Englands unloved fans after Frances dramatic 2-1 win in their opener on Sunday. I think Zidane is the best in the world. He plays at Real Madrid where his teammates say he is the best, Tigana said. Tigana would not be drawn on speculation linking him with the France job. The post will be vacant when Jacques Santini joins English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur after the tournament. Tigana, speaking at an event sponsored by Carlsberg, just smiled and shrugged when asked about his future. A key member of the great French team that won the 1984 tournament, Tigana said he planned to attend all the France games in Portugal. Turning to Rooney, who plays for Everton, Tigana said the youngster has the kind of raw talent shown by French strikers Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet early in their careers. He (Rooney) is a real diamond. He needs a bit of polishing, but its a real pleasure for a coach to work with a player like that, he added.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI tighten grip over England
 - FINAL TEST - Flintoff rides his luck to keep on fighting  Ridley Jacobs, who scored an unbeaten 107 St Johns: The West Indies tightened their grip on the fourth and final Test as they reduced England to 231 for the loss of eight wickets at lunch on day four, still 321 runs short of avoiding the follow-on. The touring side resumed on Tuesday at 171 for five and all-rounder Andrew Flintoff rode his luck to an unbeaten 68, but Pedro Collins took two wickets and Fidel Edwards one to give Brian Laras team hope of a morale-boosting victory. After the excitement of Laras record-breaking unbeaten 400 in the West Indies innings of 751 for five, the two sides emerged to a much more subdued atmosphere in the ground. The home side struck early as wicketkeeper Geraint Jones was bowled through the gate by Edwards for 38. Gareth Batty hit two fours in his eight but then fell to a superb delivery from Collins which swung and swayed off the pitch, Chris Gayle taking a sharp catch at first slip. That left England in trouble on 205 for seven and things almost got worse for the tourists when Flintoff, on 56, edged Collins to gully but Ricardo Powell spilled a difficult chance to his left. Flintoff, also dropped by Lara at first slip late on day three, then received another reprieve when Collins spilled a routine caught-and-bowled with the England all-rounder on 67. Collins took his second wicket of the day and his fourth of the innings when Matthew Hoggard, after scoring one run in 51 minutes, edged him to Ridley Jacobs. Simon Jones was unbeaten on one at lunch. Earlier, Lara reclaimed the world record for the highest individual Test innings from Australian Matthew Hayden and was undefeated on an unprecedented quadruple century to lead West Indies to a formidable first innings total of 751 for five on the third day. England lost captain Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick cheaply and were 48 for two at tea. Vaughan went to a dubious umpiring decision, caught behind off Collins. Just when it appeared Trescothick might be settling down, he too, was caught behind off Best flashing at a short, wide ball just before tea. After the break, Best had early success when Nasser Hussain was beaten for pace and bowled between bat and pad for three to leave England 54 for three. But Best twisted his ankle and left the field. Mark Butcher started to blossom with a few delightful strokes either side of the wicket. He raced to his half-century and took England to the verge of the 100-mark, before Collins had him. More success came the home teams way when Graham Thorpe top-edged a hook to be caught at fine-leg off Fidel Edwards. Chanderpaul back The Windies have picked Shivnarine Chanderpaul for the first three ODIs against England beginning on Sunday. Chanderpaul was dropped from the final Test after showing signs of fatigue. (Reuters)  Copyright

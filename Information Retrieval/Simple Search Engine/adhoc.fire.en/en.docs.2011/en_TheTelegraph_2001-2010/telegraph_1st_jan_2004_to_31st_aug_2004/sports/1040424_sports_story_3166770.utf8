The Telegraph - Calcutta
 New mission for Shoaib
 - Ajit Wadekar all praise for the fast bowlers social work  Shoaib Akhtar plays with physically handicapped boys in Mumbai on Friday. (Reuters) Mumbai: Pakistans fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar Friday played a match of a different kind  with physically handicapped players at the Shivaji Park Gymkhana here. Shoaib, who is here to shoot a commercial for a motorcycle company, has been a big hit with children as hundreds of them mobbed him during the function organised by the All India Cricket Association for Disabled (AICAD). AICAD president and former Indian captain Ajit Wadekar praised Shoaib for taking time out for social work despite a heavy schedule. We are honoured to have Shoaib with us. In fact, when I contacted him Friday he immediately agreed to come and speak to the boys despite being all set to fly back home today. The children really enjoyed the game with him and are grateful for his valuable tips, Wadekar added. Shoaib batted quite competently and also hit a six before getting out. He also entertained the children with his bowling, which was a shade more than medium pace, keeping in mind the safety of the children. In Lahore, though, adds an AFP report, things werent so hunky dory for Shoaib, with a disgruntled Pakistani cricket fan serving a legal notice on him, accusing him of faking an injury in the recent Test series against India. My client Babar Ali has served a legal notice on Shoaib over pretending injury in the decisive Test against India and over his reported nightclub bashes in India, Babars lawyer Ansar Mahmood Bajwa said. The fan demanded 100 million rupees (around $ 1.7 million) in damages within 15 days, and threatened to take the case to court if damages were not paid. Akhtar, the 28-year-old spearhead of Pakistans attack, did not take part on the third day of the final Test in Rawalpindi against India on account of injuries. India won the Test and clinched their first-ever series victory on Pakistani soil. Cricket authorities are questioning the authenticity of his injuries. Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan said the board had formed a four-member medical commission, headed by an orthopaedic surgeon Dr Abdul Wajid, to look into the matter. Shoaib, however, has informed the PCB that he will not appear on Sunday because of prior commitments. Shoaib is among five players who have been asked to appear before the panel. The others summoned are Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul.  (PTI)  Copyright

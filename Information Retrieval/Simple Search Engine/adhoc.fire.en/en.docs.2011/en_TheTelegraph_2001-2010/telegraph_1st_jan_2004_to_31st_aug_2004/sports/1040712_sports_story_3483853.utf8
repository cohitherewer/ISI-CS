The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kotla will be ready in time, says Chauhan 
New Delhi: Contrary to speculation, New Delhi might just manage to host one of the Test matches against world champions Australia in October this year. The BCCI grounds and wickets committee chairman Venkat Sundaram observed last week that the Ferozshah Kotla ground would not be ready in time to host the match. But with the possibility of the city having to forfeit its turn to host the match to Calcutta, the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) officials look determined to prove everyone wrong. DDCA vice-president Chetan Chauhan said if everything went according to plan, the ground in all probability should be ready by end of October. We will take care that the ground is in good condition before the match, Chauhan said, adding that a final decision would be taken during the DDCA executive committee meeting, to be held on either on July 15 or 16. We will meet before the BCCI working committee meeting (on July 18-19) and take a final decision on the matter, he said. The former India opener and manager also revealed that plans were afoot to name the four main gates of the ground after Virender Sehwag, Bishan Singh Bedi, Mohinder Amarnath and Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi.

 Anil Kumar qualifies in discus
New Delhi, June 5 (PTI): Discus thrower Anil Kumar has qualified for the Athens Olympics after making the grade in the international IAAF meeting, held in Szombathely, Hungary recently. Anil finished third in his event with a throw of 63.29 m which was enough to earn him a berth in the August Games. Athletics Federation of India secretary Lalit Bhanot confirmed this here Saturday and said: Anils record is better than the existing national record. But the federation will ratify the record later as another athlete Vikas Gowda has also performed better in this event, but his official result of the particular meet is being awaited, he revealed. The first two places in the contest went to Hungarians  Fazekas Robert (67.32m) and Mate Gabor (63.36m).  Copyright

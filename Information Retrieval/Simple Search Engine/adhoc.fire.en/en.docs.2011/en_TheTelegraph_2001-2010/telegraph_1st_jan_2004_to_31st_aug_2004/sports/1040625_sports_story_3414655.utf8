The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Montgomery charged
 - USADA resorting to McCarthy-like tactics: Tims lawyer  Montgomery can now be banned from competing at Athens New York: Tim Montgomery, the worlds fastest man, was officially charged by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of committing a doping offence on Wednesday and could now be banned from competing at the Athens Olympics. The USADA letter does not allege that Tim Montgomery took any banned substances, the athletes attorney Howard Jacobs said in a statement. However, the conclusion by USADAS review board  whose members were all chosen by USADAs CEO, Terry Madden, and is hardly an independent body  to proceed with the adjudication process based on some vague assertion of Tims alleged involvement with BALCO further underscores the basic lack of fairness in this entire process. USADAs leap to judgement on the flimsiest of so-called evidence confirms our worst suspicions  that it is resorting to McCarthy-like tactics in its efforts to ruin Tims reputation. Earlier, the lawyer for Michelle Collins also confirmed that the former world indoor 200 metre champion had received a letter from the USADA charging her with a doping violation. Under USADA rules, the 100 metre world record holder and Collins have the option of accepting a suspension or appealing either to an American Arbitration Association (AAA) panel or the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). I have just received a letter from the USADA that states a review panel has determined there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the adjudication process, attorney Brian H. Getz said in a telephone interview from his San Francisco office. They are making it a formal charge. They are charging her with violating the anti-doping rules. The so-called evidence the USADA is relying on is woefully thin and I think before any fair arbitration panel we will win, Montgomery and Collins were two of four US sprinters sent letters last week by the USADA alleging doping violations in connection with the BALCO doping scandal.

 Harikrishna leads with win over Chanda
 Surya Sekhar is in second spot Gibraltar: Former Commonwealth champion GM P. Harikrishna continued his demolition act and outclassed GM Sandipan Chanda in the seventh round of the Gibraltar chess meet here. Registering his sixth straight victory after losing in the first round, Harikrishna emerged the sole leader with six points and is now half a point adrift of his nearest rivals  top seed Nigel Short of England and Indian national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly. A pack of five  British champion Abhijit Kunte, Tejas Bakre, Chanda and Russian duo of Vladimir Epishin and second seed Alexei Dreev  follow these three with five points from seven games. Just three more rounds remain in this euro 12,000 tournament. Overall, the Indian men had yet another day to remember. The only loser was Chanda who went down after an intense battle against Harikrishna, while Bakre moved within striking distance of his final GM norm after beating GM Ernesto Inarkiev of Russia with black pieces. Surya was back in form as he crushed highly rated GM Jonathan Speelman of England. Settling for draws were GM Kunte, who quickly drew with GM Nigel Davies of England, and Dibyendu Barua who failed do much against the solid play of German Till Wipperman. Amongst the Indian women, S. Vijayalakshmi got back to winning ways by beating Abdela Felloussi of Morroco, while Swati Ghate lost to GM Ruslan Pogorelov of Russia. Nisha Mohota suffered another reversal at the hands of Oystein Fossum of Norway and S. Meenakshi went down to Angelis Del Rio of Spain. Kruttika Nadig gathered a half point against Scot Helen Miligen. It was Harikrishnas day yet again as he crushed Chanda in all departments of the game. The young Indian has now set up a clash with Short in the eighth round in a crucial game with black pieces. The Englishman goes into the match as favourite after scoring an easy victory over Harikrishna in the recent Commonwealth championships in Mumbai to win the title. Playing white against Chanda, Harikrishna employed the Fianchetto Variation against the Kings Indian and the game took a tactical course in the middle game. Sandipan, however, erred calculating a long variation and ended up losing an exchange. Soon Harikrishna returned the extra material to move to a favourable rook and knight endgame before delivering the decisive blow on the 43rd move. After losing to Short in the previous round, Surya got into the groove again and emerged as the better player against Speelman with black.  (PTI)  Copyright

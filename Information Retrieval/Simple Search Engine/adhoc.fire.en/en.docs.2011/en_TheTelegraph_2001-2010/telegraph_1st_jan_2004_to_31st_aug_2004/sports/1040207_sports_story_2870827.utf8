 - Hosts thrash defending champions Korea 5-0  Jasjeet Kaur drives the ball past a South Korean defender during their Asia Cup semi-final in New Delhi on Friday. (AFP) New Delhi: India put to rest the ghost of the last editions summit-clash with a thumping 5-0 victory over defending champions South Korea to enter the final of the 5th womens Asia Cup hockey tournament on Friday. The Commonwealth Games champions, who had lost to the Koreans on a golden goal after leading the match 2-1 till the last five minutes in the final of the previous edition, dominated their opponents like never before to keep alive their hopes of winning their maiden Asia Cup title. The hosts face Japan in the final on Sunday, who thrashed world championship bronze medallist China 6-2 in the other lop-sided semi-final. Sanggai Chanu (15th, 39th) and Suman Bala (56th, 64th) scored a brace each while Jasjeet Kaur (47th) chipped in with one. It was a cautious start for both India and Korea but as the hosts began to get the measure of their opponents they opened up from both flanks with Mamata Kharab and Jasjeet Kaur making some probing runs. Masira Surin got a great opportunity to put India ahead in the 14th minute when she intercepted a back pass from Korean defender Eun Sil-kim in their striking circle but failed to beat the lone goalkeeper. But one minute later, Chanu deflected a free hit from Subhadra Pradhan to give India the lead, which they maintained till the half time. The second half was an all Indian affair with the young Korean side having no answers to the aggressive hosts. Chanu made it 2-0 with yet another deflection off Pradhans free hit in the 39th minute as the handful of spectators and school children began to cheer the Indian team. Jasjeet scored Indias third on a penalty stroke which was awarded by the Malaysian referee Nor Piza Hassan after consultation with her counterpart. Hassan had earlier whistled for a penalty corner as Jasjeet was obstructed by Sun Soon Oh in the circle but changed her decision to a stroke after the players protested.Suman Bala then got into the act converting the third and fourth penalty corners that came Indias way to ensure a emphatic victory for the host. For Japan, centre forward Sakae Morimoto (49th, 51st) scored a brace while Miura Keiko (4th), Rika Komazawa (17th), Tomomi Komori (55th) and Naoka Saito (63rd) scored one each for the winners while penalty corner specialist Ma Yibo (42nd, 52nd) sounded the board for the Chinese.

 Santini urges team to wake up
Leiria: Coach Jacques Santini ordered France to wake up after their 2-2 draw against Croatia at Euro 2004 on Thursday. He blamed the result on his defence whose frailty was exposed again by two Croatian goals in four minutes just after the interval. The champions had to dig deep and equalised through a controversial David Trezeguet goal after 64 minutes. I hope this result will help the team wake up, Santini said at the post-match press conference. We took things too lightly after we opened the scoring. I dont think we underestimated our opponents. We just failed to respect basic principles when defending. If we had, Croatia would have found it hard to score goals. I must admit we suffered a lot during the first 20 minutes of the second half. When you let your opponents play to their strengths, you cant be surprised if youre in trouble. And its what we did for a while tonight. Apart from the two points we dropped in this match, its qualifying we missed tonight and that is a disappointment, he said. Now qualification depends on playing a good match against Switzerland. French keeper Fabien Barthez labelled the result a miracle. Everything had started well but I had the feeling things could change as there was a dull rhythm (to the game) and they were very quick. It was a miracle to grab one point, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

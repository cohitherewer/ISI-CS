The Telegraph - Calcutta
 10-man United in quarters
London, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Manchester United overcame the sending-off of Gary Neville to beat Manchester City 4-2 in an action-packed FA Cup fifth-round match on Saturday. Two goals by Ruud van Nistelrooy and one each for Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo put United, who played with ten men for nearly an hour, into the quarter finals for the first time since 1999. United dominated the first half and went ahead after 34 minutes when Scholes tapped the ball in from close range. But the champions were reduced to ten men within minutes, Neville appearing to head-butt Citys Steve McManaman after the United defender had fallen over in the penalty area. Van Nistelrooy pounced at the far post to tap in a teasing cross by Ronaldo and the Portuguese winger then turned the ball in from a tight angle. City defender Michael Tarnat pulled one back 12 minutes from time but Van Nistelrooy settled the match with a simple tap-in after Keane headed back a deep cross. Robbie Fowler then scored a late consolation goal.  Copyright

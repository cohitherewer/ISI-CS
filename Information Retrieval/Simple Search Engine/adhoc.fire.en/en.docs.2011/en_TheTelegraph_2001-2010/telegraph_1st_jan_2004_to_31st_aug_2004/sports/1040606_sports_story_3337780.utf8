		 Sunday, June 06, 2004  Annapolis wins thriller 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 	 Suraj Narredu				 										In a thrilling finish, jockey Suraj Narredu notched up the verdict in favour of the L. DSilva-trained four-year-old filly Annapolis to lift the 1,800m Dharmaprakasha L.S.Venkaji Rao Memorial Cup, the main attraction at the Bangalore races on Saturday.				 										Hopelessly crowded for galloping room, Suraj managed to get out of the messy situation in the final 150m of the race.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick not at all optimistic
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick started off the season with aplomb. The ASEAN Cup success buyoyed his hopes of setting a new trend, but with the season nearing completion, he looks a beaten man. Though his team has recovered from a dismal phase in the National Football League, the coach ruled out chances of a decent showing in the forthcoming AFC Champions League. East Bengal kick off their campaign against Geyland United with an away match on February 10. See the condition of the team with so many injuries, how can you expect us to do well in a tournament of this stature, Bhowmick quipped. What disappoints him more is the fact that he will be unable to hold a conditioning camp in a five-star hotel before the meet. East Bengal officials did discuss the issue, but the idea had to be dropped because of fund constraints. On the injury-problems, Bhowmick said: A player can only get fit if he sincerely desires Maybe he was hinting at Suley Musah, who in spite of several requests, decided not to undergo a knee surgery and resorted to orthopaedic treatment.

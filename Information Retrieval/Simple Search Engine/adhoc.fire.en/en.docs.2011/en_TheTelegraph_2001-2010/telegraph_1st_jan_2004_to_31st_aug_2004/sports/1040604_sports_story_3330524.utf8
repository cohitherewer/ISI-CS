The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI now talks of Tests too
Mumbai: The Indian cricket board is trying to squeeze in Test matches along with seven one-day Internationals during the home series against South Africa this winter. But India wont be able to accommodate the full series in October owing to prior commitments with Australia, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said. We have suggested to the South African board (UCBSA) that the series should comprise Tests as well as ODIs and are awaiting a reply, he said. Because of the tight schedule, the best option is to try and play Tests and ODIs in November, Nair said from Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday. The BCCI secretary was reacting to news reports from South Africa which said the UCBSA had rejected the Indian proposal to split the tour into two  one involving ODIs and the second featuring only Tests at a later date. Nothing is finalised yet. We are awaiting a reply before our tour programmes and fixtures committee can chalk out the calendar for the season. It should be ready by the end of this month, he said. Nair said the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) could not schedule the South Africa tour in October when they are free from international commitments as Indias four-Test series against Australia is slated at that time. The series against the African nation can start only after November 4 or 5, but the problem is they may not be able to stay on till the first week of December, Nair said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sydney encore a distant dream for Jones
	 - Once-invincible track queen uncertain of Athens fate  Marion Jones is a woman under duress Sacramento: Once nearly invincible, Marion Jones is becoming more beatable with each event at the US Olympic trials. Jones, who won an unprecedented five medals at the 2000 Sydney Games and had talked of trying to match that haul in Athens, could return home empty-handed  if she goes to the summer Games at all. She won the 100 four years ago. This time she didnt qualify. She won the 200 four years ago. Shell try to qualify in that event starting Friday, but her stamina is in question after she seemed to fade towards the end of the 100. She was a bronze-medallist in long jump in 2000. On Monday, Jones could do no better than seventh in the trials qualifying round  in an event in which only one other American has reached the Olympic qualifying standard this year. The adulation that used to surround her is gone, while suspicions of doping have clouded her career. In what should be her prime years as an athlete, the 28-year-old Jones now seems to receive as much sympathy as awe. Jones strode across the field after her jumps, hiding under a white cap as she was escorted by a meet official. She ducked under a tent and disappeared under the stands, avoiding the mixed zone where reporters awaited her. She looked like a woman under duress, and theres ample reason for that. Four years after emerging the golden girl of the Sydney Games and a year after triumphantly announcing she was returning to the sport just weeks after giving birth, she is being probed for possible drug use and her performances have plummeted. I dont know what shes going through right now. I dont envy her at all with all the distractions that she has out there, said Grace Upshaw, the only other US long-jumper who has met the qualifying standard this season. I think shes a great athlete, and shes a mom. Thats what blows my mind. She had a baby and shes out here being competitive, and I think thats awesome. Jones troubles began in the winter of 2003, when she was a few months pregnant. She and her boyfriend, 100 world record-holder Tim Montgomery, had an acrimonious split with coach Trevor Graham and for a short time worked with disgraced coach Charlie Francis  who supplied steroids to Ben Johnson in the 1980s. Pressure from world track officials forced Jones and Montgomery severe ties with Francis. Her reputation seemed intact, especially in the glow of her new motherhood last summer. But then the BALCO steroid scandal unfolded. Jones and Montgomery both testified before a grand jury probing the laboratory co-operative. Montgomery, who failed to qualify for the Olympics in the 100 on Sunday, has been charged by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) with steroid use and faces a lifetime ban if found guilty. Jones has not been charged by USADA, but remains under investigation. Jones and Montgomery have both repeatedly denied using banned drugs. But Jones reputation is in tatters and her career is threatened. Her ex-husband and ex-coach both are talking to federal agents in the BALCO case. In early June, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge said although Jones was technically innocent, she showed poor judgement in becoming involved with people linked to doping scandals. US hurdler Allen Johnson came to Jones defence on Tuesday. I feel its an unfortunate situation that a lot of people find themselves in, he said. Its not fair to drag somebody through the mud because of who they fall in love with. Jones troubles have continued on the track  and the field  at the Olympic trials. Though Jones was one of 12 competitors who advanced to Thursdays long jump final and remains likely to make the US team, she failed to reach the automatic qualifying mark. She has the numbers on her side in long jump. Under qualifying rules, Jones provisionally can make the Olympic team even if she fails to place among the top three. Thats because only she and Upshaw have Olympic qualifying marks this season.  (AP)  Copyright

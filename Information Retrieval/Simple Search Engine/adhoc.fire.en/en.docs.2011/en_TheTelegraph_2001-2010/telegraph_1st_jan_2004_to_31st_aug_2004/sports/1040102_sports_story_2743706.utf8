 Kunte beats Nielsen
 Kunte notched up his first win in spectacular fashion  Hastings: Indian Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte ended the year 2003 on a high defeating GM Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark in the fourth round of Hastings International Chess Congress here on Wednesday. Top seed GM Vladimir Epishin of Russia joined overnight leader Vasilios Kotronias in the lead on three points after beating GM Stuart Conquest of England. Following the two leaders are GMs Mark Hebden of England and Jonathan Rowson of Scotland on 2.5 points while Kunte is on joint fifth spot alongside International Master Alexander Cherniaev of Russia and Nielsen with two points apiece. Conquest, IM Daniel Gormally of England and Ukrainian youngster Kateryna Lahno jointly hold the eighth place on one point from four games. Five more rounds remain to be played in this 79th edition of the meet. Wednesdays victory was the first for Kunte in the championship and was achieved in spectacular fashion as he squeezed and bruised the highly-rated Nielsen en route to a checkmating net. The opening featured standard manoeuvres of a Catalan where Kunte, black, secured the dynamic balance by threatening to launch a king-side offence. Nielsen exchanged the queens to get slightly better placed pieces but the Indian was quite up to the task in keeping his position intact. In order to keep trying for more Nielsen erred and apparently underestimated Kuntes counter play in the rooks and minor piece. Epishin was yet again brilliant with white pieces and scored easily over Conquest who employed the Kings Indian defence as black. Getting the game to less-trodden paths very early in the opening itself, Epishin conducted an attack on the queen-side to win a pawn. Conquest could not avoid the routine exchange of pieces after that and lost on move 36. Rowson was at his technical best in beating Daniel Gormally in the Ruy Lopez exchange variation. The Englishman could not really make a match of it and succumbed to a series of piece trade that transformed into a bishop endgame for his opponent. The game lasted 52 moves.  (PTI)  Copyright

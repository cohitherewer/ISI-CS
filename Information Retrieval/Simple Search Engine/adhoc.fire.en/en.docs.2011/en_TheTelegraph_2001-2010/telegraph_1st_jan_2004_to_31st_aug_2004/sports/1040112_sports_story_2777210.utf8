(Reuters) Kuala Lumpur: India and Malaysia collected a point apiece from a 2-2 draw in the Sultan Azlan Shah Gold Cup hockey tournament on Sunday. In one of the better matches of the tournament so far, both sides played with passion. Len Aiyappa (21st minute) and Arjun Halappa (62nd) scored for India and the Malaysians replied through G. Krishnamurthy (32nd) and Ismail Abu (64th). India picked up their first point after two defeats, while Malaysia moved to two with two draws and a loss. Pakistan and Germany have nine points each, but the former are ahead on better goal difference. There was little to separate the two in terms of quality and the crowd was treated to some fast, attacking and exciting hockey. The draw, perhaps, was only fair to the teams as neither deserved to lose. The Indians were under pressure at the start as the hosts employed the scoop to good effect to surprise their midfield. However, their attacks became predictable and it made the task of the Indians that much easier. The Indian attacks were incisive despite some needless individual play, notably by Baljeet Singh Dhillon. They had a good opening in the 12th minute when Vikram Pillay failed with just the goalkeeper to beat. Five minutes later, Kuhan Shanmuganathan foiled Aiyappas penalty corner attempt with a goalline save before the Indian hit the board with his next try. The reverse pumped up the Malaysians and they applied tremendous pressure on the Indian defence. Krishnamurthy converted Malaysias second penalty corner to restore parity. The game became faster in the second half. Both teams wasted a few chances and goalkeepers Kamaldeep Singh and Kumar Subramaniam were kept busy. Two of Indias most experienced players, Dhanraj Pillay and Dhillon, left the ground for a while. The former was substituted and the latter left with an injury to the nose. Ironically, thereafter the Indian forwardline started functioning better. In the midfield, Vikram caught the eye by his aggressive play and joined the attack frequently. But like the Malaysians, the Indian forwards were error-prone inside the circle. The Indians knocked one in after many attempts as Halappa deflected a hard centre from the right by Prabhdeep Singh who was set up by Dhillon, back in action with a face mask. The Malaysians equalised two minutes later following a right-wing move. Azlan Misron took a hit that came off the upright and Abu was around to slam home the rebound. India will meet Australia on Tuesday.  Germany, Pak win World champions Germany beat Korea 2-1 to and register their third win on the trot in an earlier match.

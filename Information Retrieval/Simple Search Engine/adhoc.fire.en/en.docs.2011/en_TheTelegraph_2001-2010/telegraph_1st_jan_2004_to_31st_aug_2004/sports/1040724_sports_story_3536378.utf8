 Anand in tame draw
Dortmund: World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand was held to a draw by rising German star Arkadij Naiditsch in the first round of the preliminaries of the Dortmund Sparkassen chess meet on Friday. On what turned out to be a dull first day, all games were drawn leaving all eight players on half a point. The event is being played on a new format wherein the players have been divided into two groups of four, and the top two from each group will advance to the semi-final stage, while the rest will battle it out for 5-8 place. Anand could not do much against Naiditsch. In the last years event the Indian stalwart played a spectacular game to win with black but this time even the white pieces failed to yield the desirable result. Playing his pet Ruy Lopez, an opening in which he is feared by the best, Anand went for the anti Marshall set up and allowed 18-year old Naidtsch to get an easy game once the middle game surfaced. Naiditsh was able to hold his position together almost effortlessly. Quite interestingly, out of the first eighteen moves, Anand made seven moves with his light square bishop and Naiditsh already had a happy position on board by then. The game was abruptly drawn after 25 moves when still there was lot of life left in the position. While Naiditsch pulled out a half point against world number two, youngest ever Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin was not far behind in achievement. The 14-year old Ukrainian held Braingames champion and world number three Vladimir Kramnik of Russia to an easy draw and started his Dortmund debut in style. Playing white, Kramnik went for the Ruy Lopez and was surprised by Karjakin as early as on the seventh move in one of the lesser played variations. Karjakin showcased his immense potential and went for the queenside breakthrough just at right time to thwart Kramniks attack on the other flank and following exchanges of a few pawns the position opened up. The draw was agreed to in 30 moves when many thought that the teenager might have had a minuscule advantage. Also ending in a draw with lots of play left was the game between Russians Peter Svidler and 2004 Aeroflot champion Sergei Rublevski. From the white side of a Sicilian Paulsen, Svidler failed to impress his opponent and agreed to the draw in a very complicated position after 25 moves. The only game to go full distance in the first round was between Peter Leko of Hungary and defending champion Viktor Bologan of Moldova. The two fought on bravely till the last nail and agreed to sign peace when only a knight and two pawns remained for each of them.  (PTI)  Copyright

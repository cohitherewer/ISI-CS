 Reid spends time with Pathan, Balaji
Trent Bridge: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly hopes the second training stint with former Australian seamer Bruce Reid would help his young bunch of fast bowlers click together as a unit. We are not bowling well as a team. Someday one or two bowl well and others dont, and on other days, it is someone else who is bowling well and not the others, Sourav said on the sidelines of teams practice session on Monday. Reid, who had assisted the Indians on their tour of Australia last season, joined the team on Sunday and would be working with them on Tuesday also. He will rejoin them for a brief during the ICC Champions Trophy between Indias two group matches against Kenya and Pakistan on September 11 and 19, respectively. No sooner than he arrived, Reid turned his attention to the two young pacers Laxmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan and asked them to bowl in a certain manner. For Pathan, he also put three pegs in his follow- through to ensure he doesnt run on to the pitch.  (PTI)  Copyright

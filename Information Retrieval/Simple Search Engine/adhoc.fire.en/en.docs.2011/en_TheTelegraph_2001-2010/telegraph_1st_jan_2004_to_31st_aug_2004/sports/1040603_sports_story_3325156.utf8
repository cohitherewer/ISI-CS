(Reuters) Tokyo: Japan midfielder Junichi Inamoto will be sidelined for up to three months after breaking a bone in his left leg while playing against England, the Japan Football Association (JFA) said on Wednesday. The 24-year-old was hurt in a tackle late in Tuesdays 1-1 draw against England. Inamoto, who plays for English Premier League club Fulham, was diagnosed with a fracture just above the ankle. Japan were already missing captain Hidetoshi Nakata (groin strain) and striker Naohiro Takahara (lung infection) for the three-way tournament, also involving Iceland. Japan take on India at home next Wednesday in an Asian 2006 World Cup qualifier. Inamoto will also miss the Asian Cup in China, which begins on July 17. In Manchester, however, a lacklustre England had to settle for a 1-1 draw with Japan on Tuesday after being outshone in a pre-Euro 2004 friendly. Striker Michael Owen scored his 25th goal for England in the 22nd minute, but midfielder Shinji Ono deservedly levelled in the 53rd as part of a convincing second-half display by the Japanese. England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson ended doubts over who would be his first choice for the defensive role in midfield at Euro 2004 by selecting Frank Lampard ahead of Nicky Butt. In the 22nd minute Narazaki spilled Steven Gerrards fierce low drive and Owen followed through for a simple tap-in. Zicos side got their reward eight minutes into the second half when Alessandro Santos cut-back was drilled home by Ono. Meanwhile in Seoul, a first-half goal from Hakan Sukur gave Turkey a 1-0 win over South Korea.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

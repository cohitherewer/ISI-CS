 Carlos brace in Real victory
 - Owen scores 2 as Liverpool crush Rovers  Luis Figo fights for the ball with Albacetes Mikel Buafdes during a Spanish League match on Saturday. (AFP) Madrid: Brazilian free kick expert Roberto Carlos struck twice to help Real Madrid secure a 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. The Brazilian gave Real the lead with a deflected 20-metre pile-driver in the 19th minute and had a slice of luck to put them 2-0 up midway through the second half when another powerful free kick ricocheted off teammate Luis Figo into the net. But their modest opponents refused to fold and pulled a goal back with a superb long distance effort from midfielder Libero Parri eight minutes from time to set up an exciting finish. The result leaves Real top with 67 points from 31 matches. In the Premier League on Sunday, England striker Michael Owen grabbed a first-half double as Liverpool crushed Blackburn Rovers 4-0 at Anfield to reclaim fourth place. In Sundays other game, Aston Villas hopes of qualifying for Europe suffered a blow when they were held 1-1 at home by struggling Manchester City. Meanwhile, on Saturday, Chelsea closed the gap on leaders Arsenal to four points with a 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur. Chelseas Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink followed his hattrick against Wolverhampton Wanderers last week with the goal from a Damien Duff pass in the 38th minute. It also extended Chelseas unbeaten league run against Spurs to 28 games, the longest between two clubs in the top flight. Wolves dropped further into the mire at the bottom of the table after losing 4-1 at home to Southampton. Newcastle defeated Everton 4-2 with the help of two goals from captain Alan Shearer. In Berlin, Champions Bayern Munich closed the gap on leaders Werder Bremen to six points with a 2-0 away victory over Kaiserslautern on Saturday. VfB Stuttgart held on to third place with a spectacular 5-1 win at VfL Wolfsburg that left Wolfsburg coach Juergen Roeber facing an uncertain future. In Ligue 1 action, a second-half goal by Camel Meriem handed Olympique Marseille a 2-1 victory at Olympique Lyon and denied the defending champions the chance to return to the top of Ligue 1. Lyon have 63 points from 31 matches and trail leaders Monaco by a point with seven games left after the principality side fought back from 3-0 down at halftime against struggling AC Ajaccio on Friday to salvage a point in a 3-3 home draw.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, January 11, 2004  Vijay strikes 5 
 BY STAR RACER		 Vijay SinghCalcutta, Jan. 10: Making a clean sweep of the four trophy events on the cards, trainer Vijay Singh saddled five winners in total at the RCTC ground on Saturday. Jockeys C. Alford and S. Shanker helped his cause with the former scoring an odd one extra in the tally. 				 										Vijays start was on a wrong foot when his hot-favourite Twothousandfour failed narrowly in the hands of Alford. However, the duo was back in action in the Alokananda Stakes that was won by the two-time winner Reminiscent, albeit in a close finish involving a rank outsider Candela.				 										It was easy going for the champion, thereafter, as his Announcer lifted the Bangalore Turf Club Cup in a facile manner while Assailer walked away with the BSF Trophy, sponsored by Bharat Petroleum. Vijays Crimson Rage completed the trophy-rout with a shade under four-length victory in the Aloritz Cup before the stables lesser fancied Juneau accounted for the topweight Great Ambition and the even-money stable-favourite Amaryllis in a close-finish to win the concluding event of the afternoon, the Red Bay Handicap.

 Tense Portugal do just enough
 - Ten-man Russia eliminated after ninth successive winless European Championship game  FROM SAM WALLACE IN LISBON  Portugals Luis Figo (right) and Russias Dmitry Sennikov in an aerial battle for the ball during their Euro 2004 group A clash at the Luz Stadium in Lisbon on Wednesday. (AFP) The hosts of Euro 2004 have given themselves a chance of reaching the knockout stages, but if the tension of Portugals victory on Wednesday night is any indicator, then the atmosphere in their decisive match against Spain will be unbearable. They scored an early goal and were blessed with the questionable dismissal of Russias goalkeeper, but Luis Figos nervous side never looked truly comfortable. It was only when substitute Rui Costa fired from close range on the 88th minute that the home fans allowed themselves to twirl their scarves in celebration. Up until then it had been a single strike from Jose Mourinhos Porto midfield prodigy Maniche that separated the sides. Russias qualification hopes disappeared on the back of their ninth successive winless European Championship game  an unwelcome tournament record reaching back to the 1988 final. The task ahead is far from simple: Portugal must beat Spain to reach the second round. Luiz Felipe Scolari must have known that he had one last chance to rescue Portugal from the most unceremonious of elimination and when he made the changes to his team, he did so without regard for reputation or caps. Out went Paulo Ferreira, the right-back for whom Chelsea paid Porto 16 million, and Rui Jorge too. Also cut were Fernando Couto and Rui Costa, two of the old lions of Portuguese football the latter to make way for Portos playmaker Deco. Watching from the stands, Roman Abramovich will have noticed that Jose Mourinho, his new manager at Chelsea, could count no fewer than six of his all-conquering Porto side on the pitch, with Dmitri Alenichev among the Russians. One more trick from Scolari too, he switched Luis Figo to the left wing  how that would have made life easier for David Beckham when he arrived at Real Madrid. Figo had swapped back with Simao before the end of the first half but by then he had already given the 21-year-old Russian Marat Izmailov a lesson in the fine arts of touchline dribbling. It was Figos free-kick from the right, headed clear to Deco, that produced the first goal on seven minutes. The No. 10 wriggled clear of the advancing tide of white shirts and fed his Porto club-mate Maniche who turned and fired home. What relief in the Estadio do Luz! Dragged everywhere by the running of Pauleta, a Russian defence led by Chelseas Alexei Smertin looked overawed. Without Alexander Mostovoi, their captain who has been sent home in disgrace, they looked in disarray. There was one Russian break forward through Alenitchev which unsettled Jorge Andrade, the only defender from four who survived the cull from the defeat to Greece but otherwise it was Deco who set the games rhythms. Back on the right wing after half an hour, Figo crossed out of Sergei Ovchinnikovs reach only for Pauleta to fail to connect with the header. The real disaster for Russia came with half-time just seconds away when a back pass as ill-judged as Steven Gerrards against France from Dmitri Sennikov, fell into Pauletas stride. Ovchinnikov raced out of his box to stop the striker and, as he went to ground, appeared to take the ball with his feet rather than his hands. Wilting under the roar of the home crowd, the Norwegian referee Terje Hauge dismissed the Russian goalkeeper for handball. As Ovchinnikov made his way to the touchline,, a Russian fan made it all the way from the away end to the tunnel to console his goalkeeper with a souvenir scarf. Once a small army of security staff had removed him, and Ovchinnikov, there were only 10 Russians left. With Figo wandering back out left again, the Russians found the Portuguese attack hard to contain. Nuno Valentes thundering effort was tipped away by Viacheslav Malafeev. Portugal survived the challenge of Nuno Valente on substitute Vladimir Bystrov when the Russian substitute raced into the box on 81 minutes although it was interesting to see him accused of diving by a Porto contingent, who have proved less than innocent of that crime themselves.

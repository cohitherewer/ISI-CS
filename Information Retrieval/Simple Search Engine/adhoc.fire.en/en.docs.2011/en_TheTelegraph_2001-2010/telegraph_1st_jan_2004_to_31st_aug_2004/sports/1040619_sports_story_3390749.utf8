The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Focus on giant strikers
 - Czechs aim to seal last-8 berth with a win versus Dutch  Ruud van Nistelrooy will lead the Dutch attack alone Porto: Two big strikers with large reputations are likely to have a major impact on the heavyweight Euro 2004 group D clash between The Netherlands and the Czech Republic on Saturday. In the Dutch corner stands Ruud van Nistelrooy, whose dramatic and brilliantly executed equaliser earned his side a 1-1 draw with Germany in their opening match. Standing in the opposite corner is the tallest professional player in Europe, the 2.02-metre (six-foot-eight-inch) Jan Koller. Van Nistelrooy will lead the Dutch attack alone, while Koller, supported by Milan Baros, will use his great height and under-rated skills on the ground to rattle the Dutch defenders who struggled to cope with Germanys physical approach. Victory for Koller and the Czechs would guarantee them a place in the quarter finals, while a Dutch win would provide a release from the intense pressure surrounding their camp. It would also give them a good chance of a place in the last eight, although much will depend on how Germany fare against outsiders Latvia. Group D, comprising three former European champions, was always going to be the toughest and although the Czechs have the slight advantage following their 2-1 win over Latvia, anything is still possible. The Czechs have slight injury worries over defenders Rene Bolf (knee) and Zdenek Grygera, who went to hospital with swollen glands on Thursday, but both are expected to play. The hot weather has also taken its toll, with playmaker Pavel Nedved and fellow-midfielder Tomas Rosicky suffering from headaches, while Koller needed an intravenous drip after losing five kilograms in the win over Latvia. Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf has returned to full training.

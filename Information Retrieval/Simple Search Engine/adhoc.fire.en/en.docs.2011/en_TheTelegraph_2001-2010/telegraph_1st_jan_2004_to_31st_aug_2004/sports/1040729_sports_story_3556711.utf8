 Pakistan want to sign off on winning note
Colombo: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer promised that his team would set aside its disappointment, at not having qualified for the Asia Cup final, and finish the meet on a positive note on Thursday. Pakistan take on Bangladesh in the inconsequential final Super Four match at the Premadasa Stadium. Even if Woolmers team wins with a bonus point, they will finish with a tally of 11  less than Sri Lanka and India. We want to win this game (against Bangladesh) and have a 4-1 win-loss record in the tournament, he said at nets on Wednesday. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore faces a tough task in motivating his players to one last hurrah before leaving Lankan shores. Bangladesh have lost both their Super Four matches  versus India and Sri Lanka. And quite convincingly. Its the batting which is former Lanka coach Whatmores principal worry. Except for young Mohammad Ashraful, none of the others has delivered in the big games in this tournament. Much was expected of captain Habibul Bashar, but he is yet to deliver. Whatmores team had put up a much improved show in the Caribbean, drawing the first Test and nearly winning one of the three ODIs. But that spirit has been missing in Sri Lanka so far. Jayasuriya forced to change style Meanwhile, Sanath Jayasuriya has admitted that rivals ploy to cramp his strokeplay has forced him to change his batting style. In the last four-five years, bowlers have tried to cramp me. I have realised that I need to get the singles and then lay in wait for strokes in my strong areas. (PTI)  Copyright

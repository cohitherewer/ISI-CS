The Telegraph - Calcutta
 New row in Bagan 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: It seems the Mohun Bagan officials have made it a habit of misbehaving with their top performer. After playing a controversial role in Jose Ramirez Barretos sudden decision to cut his long association with the club, the officials have now turned to another Brazilian.  As Leonardo, who had been in good nick in the Mohun Bagan rearguard of late, was talking to the scribes after the teams morning practice on Thursday, one club official rushed towards him warning that his salary would be deducted for his conduct. When Leonardo asked for the reason, the official said: Youre not supposed to talk to the scribes. Its the job of the captain and the coach. When the defender said he didnt know about it, the official replied: We dont care. Leonardo, who was maintaining his composure till then, lost his cool and shot back: Do whatever you wish, Im not bothered. The assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee tried to bring things under control and went up to assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury to sort out the issue. Pat came Chowdhurys reply: Thats none of your business, do your assigned work.  Copyright

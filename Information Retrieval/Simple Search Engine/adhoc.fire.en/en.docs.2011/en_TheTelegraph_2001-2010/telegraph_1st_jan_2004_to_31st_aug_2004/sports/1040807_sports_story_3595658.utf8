The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Draw for Anand
 - Former world champion off to safe start Mainz: Dortmund champion Viswanathan Anand started off with an exciting draw as black against GM Alexei Shirov in the first game of the main event of the Chess Classic dubbed as the Duel of the World Champions (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). The draw is a good result to start of the proceedings for Anand in this years edition of this event, even though he had to fight hard for the result and was almost pushed to the wall at one point. A winner here in three previous outings, Anand will play the next game with white. The match is being played with 25 minutes to each player with a 10-second edition after every move is made. There will be eight games in all to determine the winner and in case of a tied score, blitz tie-break games will come in to effect. Anand almost survived by the skin of his teeth in the opinion of many experts here. In all his three previous victories in Mainz, Anand had been trailing at some point of time and quite a few believed the trend would continue. However, with his natural ability to play quick and correct in difficult situations, Anand got the draw in the end against the world championship runner up of 2001 who is referred to as vice-world champion 2001 in this contest. It was Rubenstein French and given the treatment, it is unlikely to get repeated in the match by Anand with black pieces. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Saturday, July 10, 2004  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Calcutta Sports Association (CSA) reached the final of all-Bengal Arnika Plus senior waterpolo meet, beating Central Calcutta Swimming Club 6-5 at the YMCA course. Dipankar Koley scored thrice for the winners. 				 																																																	CSA will meet Indian Life Saving Society (ILSS) in final, who beat College Square Swimming Club by identical margin.				 																																																	 Since the dates of both KSCA and Buchi Babu cricket tournaments are clashing, CAB is likely to send two separate teams for the meets. The KSCA (limited overs meet) will begin on August 11 while Buchi Babu meet will start from August 16.				 																																																	As we are the defending champions in the KSCA, we will surely take part in that. Buchi Babu is the only three-dayer meet before the Ranji Trophy and it also has a special importance, a CAB official said on Friday.				 																																																	 The first inter-school football tournament, organised by Uttarpara Sporting Club, will begin from Monday at the Uttarpara Manmohan Uddyan. A total of eight schools from Howrah, Hooghly, Calcutta, South 24 parganas and North 24 parganas will take part.				 																																																	FOOTBALL: Super Division  East Bengal vs Railway FC (East Bengal, 3.30 pm). First Division group B matches at various venues from 3.30 pm.				 																																																	WATERPOLO: Final of all-Bengal Arnika Plus senior meet: ILSS vs CSA, 3.15 pm (YMCA course).

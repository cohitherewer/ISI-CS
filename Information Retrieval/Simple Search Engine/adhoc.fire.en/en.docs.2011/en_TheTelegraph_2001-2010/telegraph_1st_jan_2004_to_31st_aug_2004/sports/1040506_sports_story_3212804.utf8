The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tough task for Newcastle
 Newcastles hopes rest on Alan Shearer Marseille: Newcastle will be seeking to keep alive their quest to end a 35-year wait for a major trophy when they enter Marseilles Velodrome Stadium for the second leg of the Uefa Cup semi-final here on Thursday. With the tie finely poised after a goalless draw at St James Park, injury-hit Newcastle have a tough task against a Marseille side which is playing to save their season. While Marseille were European champions in 1993, Newcastles last trophy of any description was the 1969 Fairs Cup, the predecessor to the Uefa Cup. The English sides hopes of ending their drought could rest on veteran centre-forward Alan Shearer going one better than his opposite number Didier Drogba, who was voted the French player of the season by his fellow professionals at the weekend. Both sides crashed to defeats in their domestic leagues at the weekend, and Marseilles defeat to modest Metz ruled them out of contention for a Uefa Cup place next season. Their only hope is to qualify by winning the competition, as coach Jose Anigo stressed. The players are playing to save our season on Thursday, Anigo said. You can feel it in the dressing room. There is the same atmosphere that I remember from each of our matches in the European Cup. Newcastle slipped to a 0-1 defeat at Manchester City which damaged their chances of finishing fourth in the Premiership and securing the final Champions League spot. Club chairman Freddy Shepherd was rallying the troops on Tuesday. If you think like a winner you will be a winner. And if you think like a loser you will be a loser. And Geordies are winners, Shepherd told the Newcastle Chronicle. We still have everything to play for this season and now is the time for everyone to get behind Sir Bobby Robson and his squad. Everything is not only in our own hands but also within our grasp - and we can still do it. The Magpies will sorely miss injured quartet Craig Bellamy, Kieron Dyer, Jonathan Woodgate and Jermaine Jenas, but Woodgates absence is perhaps the most damaging as he would have been given the role of shackling the lightning quick Drogba. Newcastle are also hoping French winger Laurent Roberts injured thigh will respond quickly to treatment. Marseille, meanwhile, are confident that French international striker Steve Marlet will recover from a back injury to play. Defender Habib Beye, however, is having intensive treatment on a twisted ankle. Newcastle midfielder Lee Bowyer, meanwhile has been passed fit to play. Bowyer, who has not played in Europe since December 2002 because of suspension and injury, shook off a hamstring injury to take his place in the 21-man party which jetted out from Newcastle International Airport early Wednesday. Spanish league leaders Valencia, meanwhile, continue their quest for a domestic and continental double when they play host to local rivals Villarreal in the second leg of their Uefa Cup semi-final on Thursday, adds a report from Valencia. The two teams, based only 60 kilometres apart, fought out an entertaining 0-0 draw in the first leg, in which goals were the only missing ingredient. (AFP)  Copyright

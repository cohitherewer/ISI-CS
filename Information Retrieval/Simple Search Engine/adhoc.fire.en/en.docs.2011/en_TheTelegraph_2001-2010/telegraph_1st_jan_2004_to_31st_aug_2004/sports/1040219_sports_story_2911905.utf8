The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Coach hails fighting spirit
Margao: India coach Stephen Constantine praised the brilliant fighting spirit showed by his boys and thanked the crowd for the overwhelming support after beating Singapore in Wednesdays pre-World Cup match. It is a pretty good start and our boys should get prepared against Oman, who are tough opponents, for the home match on March 31 in Kochi, Constantine said. Singapore coach Radojko Avramovic blamed the referee for awarding the penalty but said he was hoping the team to put up a better show in the next match. We have to face the reality and hope the team does better in the home match against Japan, he said. He praised the Indian team for coming up with a good performance.  Copyright

		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 EURO DIGEST
Lisbon: England skipper David Beckham insisted on Tuesday that he would continue to take penalties for England despite having a crucial spot-kick saved in Sundays 1-2 defeat to France. When I have missed penalties in the past, whether it be for Manchester United or England, Ive always said that I will carry on, he said. I am confident enough to do it and I will carry on. Beckham has now missed his last two penalties for England. Fabien Barthez brilliantly saved his effort on Sunday, but the previous one against Turkey in Englands final qualifier flew over the bar after Beckham slipped in his run-up.Copenhagen: Forward Jesper Gronkjaer landed in Lisbon on Tuesday to join Denmarks Euro 2004 squad following the death of his mother, Danish TV reported.The Chelsea player did not travel to Portugal with his teammates last week. His mother died on Thursday and he has spent the last few days at home in Denmark. The winger may play in Denmarks second Group C match against Bulgaria on Friday. Denmark drew 0-0 against group favourites Italy on Monday. Denmark, European champions in 1992, also play Sweden in the first phase of the tournament. Berlin: Germany were given Zinedine Zidane-style haircuts and bald spots in a page one photo-montage on Tuesday, ahead of the Euro 2004 match against the Dutch. We need 11 Zidanes, read the headline in the top-selling Bild newspaper beneath the 11 mug shots of the team. Zidane scored two goals in injury time against England to lead France to a 2-1 win on Sunday.

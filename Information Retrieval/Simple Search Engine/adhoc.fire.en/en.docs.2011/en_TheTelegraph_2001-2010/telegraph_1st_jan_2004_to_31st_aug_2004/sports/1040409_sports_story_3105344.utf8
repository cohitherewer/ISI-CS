The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deportivo stun champions in greatest 2nd-leg comeback
 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - Spanish side erases away-tie deficit with 4-0 thrashing of Milan  Deportivo La Corunas Juan Valeron celebrates after scoring against AC Milan during their Champions League match at the Riazor Stadium in La Coruna on Wednesday. (Reuters) La Coruna: Deportivo La Coruna staged an incredible second-leg fight back to knock holders AC Milan out of the Champions League with a stunning 4-0 win at the Riazor on Wednesday. The Spaniards, trailing 1-4 from the first leg of the quarter final, rocked the Serie A side with a whirlwind first-half performance that saw them take a 3-0 lead at the break. A smart strike from centre-forward Walter Pandiani, a header from Juan Carlos Valeron and a fierce drive from Albert Luque a minute from halftime allowed Depor to wipe out Milans first-leg advantage in the space of just 45 minutes and leave them on course to progress on the away goals rule. But substitute and club captain Fran then provided the icing on the cake when he smashed in a fourth 14 minutes from time to give the Galicians a 5-4 aggregate victory. Depor now face Porto in their first Champions League semi-final appearance. It was the first time a team has ever recovered from a three-goal first leg deficit to win a Champions League knockout tie and was all the more impressive as it came against the hugely experienced Milan side who had not previously conceded a European away goal all season. Depor got off to a dream start when they scored from their very first attack. Pandiani, who scored Depors goal in the first leg and also knocked out Juventus in the previous round, received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the area, turned sharply to leave Paolo Maldini trailing and drilled a left-foot shot low past Dida and inside the post. Depor put the Serie A side on the rack for the next 20 minutes, although Milan did threaten when midfielder Kaka raced clear on he break only to be denied by a sharp save from Molina. The Galicians continued to have the better of the play and had a string of further chances to go further in front in the next few minutes. Valeron and Victor were both denied by Dida but the Brazilian goalkeeper was at fault for the second goal when he flapped at a superb cross from the left by Luque and leaving the unmarked Valeron to head in from five metres. With Milan still reeling from the blow it was Luque who hit them again with a third before the break. Latching on to the long clearance from Molina, he raced past Milan defenders Maldini and Cafu, sped into the area and unleashed an unstoppable drive into the roof of the net. Depor, who did not manage to score against the Italians on the previous two occasions they had met at the Riazor  losing 0-4 in one of the games  were now ahead on the away goals rule. Javier Iruretas side played some brilliant possession football after the break to leave Milan chasing shadows in the midfield and living off scraps up front and completed a near-perfect performance when Fran scored made it 4-0. The Depor winger controlled a cross-field pass with his shoulder, stepped into the area and then saw his left-foot shot take a deflection off Cafu and fly into the net to the joy of the delirious home fans. Milan could have taken the tie into extra time with a single goal but never looked capable of getting it as Depor, who have now won eight successive home games in Europe without conceding a goal, continued to combine a furious work rate with controlled passing to complete a wonderful victory. It was almost mission impossible, coach Irureta told Spanish TV. I had some hopes of us making a comeback because I know we are the sort of the team that is capable of doing some great things as well as making some dreadful mistakes. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Italian TV: Its difficult to explain. We were up against a very good team, who played very well and there were some errors on our part but it really is hard to explain this defeat.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

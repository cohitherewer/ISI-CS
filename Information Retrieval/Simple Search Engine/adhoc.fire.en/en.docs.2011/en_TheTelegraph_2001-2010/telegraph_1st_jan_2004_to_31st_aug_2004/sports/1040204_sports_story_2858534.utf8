The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hosts have to convert better
 - Asia Cup Hockey - Indian women take on Kazakhstan today  The Indian women need a big win to top pool A New Delhi: India would have to find a quick solution to their finishing woes in their last league encounter against Kazakhstan Wednesday if they want to entertain any hopes of topping their pool in the fifth womens Asia Cup hockey tournament. The Indians, virtually assured of a berth in the semi-finals with one win and a draw (the same as China), from their two league encounters so far, need to score at least two goals more than the world championship bronze medallists to top Pool A on goal difference. Both India and China have scored five goals in the two encounters but China conceded only one goal to the hosts two. China will face Malaysia in their last league match Wednesday, after Tuesdays rest day. The Indian eves have been playing a brilliant possession hockey in the tournament so far but their star studded forward line has failed to convert the plethora of chances. In fact, the Commonwealth champions would have been sitting pretty with full points had they converted even 10 per cent of their chances against China with whom they drew 1-1. To add to that, the hosts have been found wanting in the penalty corner conversion as well, barely converting two of the 21 that have come their way in the two matches. It is essential that the forward line starts converting more and more chances quickly and tomorrows match will be very important before the semi-finals, coach M. K. Kaushik said. Kaushik, however, expressed satisfaction with the way his midfield and defence were playing. We have been solid in the defence and midfield and that has been a big positive from the two matches. In Pool B, defending champions South Korea and Japan will face off Tuesday to decide the winners of the group. Japan created a championship record Monday, scoring 21 goals against Sri Lanka after thrashing Singapore 15-0 in their opening league match. Korea have also comprehensively won their two matches, 15-0 against Sri Lanka and 9-1 against Singapore. The three-time champions would be looking to remain on the psychological high by maintaining their cent per cent record before the semi-finals while Japan will only need a draw to take the top spot on better goal difference. Meanwhile, the two minnows, Sri Lanka and Singapore, would also get a chance to regain some pride as they face off with each other. None of the teams were ever expected to challenge the might of their superior opponents in the group and hence must be looking forward to at least win this last league match and open their account on the points table. While Singapore have scored one goal, the island nation is yet to register their name on the scoresheet.  (PTI)  Copyright

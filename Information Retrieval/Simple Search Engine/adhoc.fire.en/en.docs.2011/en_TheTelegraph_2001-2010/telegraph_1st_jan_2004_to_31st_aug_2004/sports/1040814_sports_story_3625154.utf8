The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No play on Day Two
Manchester: Play was abandoned without a ball being bowled on the second day of the third test between England and the West Indies on Friday after heavy rain fell at Old Trafford. Play had been due to start at 2.45 pm (GMT), more than five hours late, but further rain began to fall in Manchester after clearing briefly. The West Indies made 275 for six on Thursday, with wicketkeeper Carlton Baugh on nine and Dave Mohammed yet to score. England are 2-0 up in the four-match series.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhaichung uncertain
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia is uncertain to play for East Bengal in the Leicester City FC-organised four-nation tournament. The India captain is yet to sign for the red-and-gold brigade and about to try his luck in Cyprus. He is expected to arrive in the city on Friday, when the club officials will hold a meeting with him in this regard. East Bengal, incidentally, have thought of a provisional list of 20 to tour England, which does not include Bhaichung. The provisional list is subject to changes. And though its quite unlikely, the possibility of Bhaichungs availability (for the tournament in Leicester City) is not ruled out either, said a club official. He, however, confirmed that Douglas da Silva, who will also reach the city on Friday from Brazil via Mumbai, will figure in the Leicester City-bound squad. East Bengal will leave for England on July 28 and the next day they will have a special rendezvous with the House of Commons. The National Football League champions kick off the tournament  christened as Pepsi Max Challenge and which is part of Leicester Citys 120th anniversary celebrations  against the hosts at Walker Stadium on July 31. Spanish La Liga outfit Real Mallorca and Maritimo of Portugal will clash in the other match on the same day. The respective winners of the two games will cross swords with each other in the final on August 1. The final will be preceded by the clash between the two losing teams. Ten Sports will beam all the matches live. Meanwhile, the official website of East Bengal was launched on Thursday. Inaugurating it, the club president Dr. Pranab Dasgupta said, the site  having two URLs www.eastbengalfootballclub.com and www.kingfishereastbengal.com  traces the past, present and future of the club. Subrata keen to win Super Division Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said on Thursday his team needs a good beginning to the new season and for that matter, winning the CFL Super Division is high on his agenda. This league is very important to me. The boys must have a winning taste so that they can look forward on a confident note, Bhattacharya said, ahead of Sundays big clash with city rivals East Bengal.

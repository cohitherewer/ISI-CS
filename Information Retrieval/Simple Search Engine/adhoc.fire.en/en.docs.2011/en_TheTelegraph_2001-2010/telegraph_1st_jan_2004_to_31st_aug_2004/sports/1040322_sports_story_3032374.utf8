The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA in tight spot
 Jacques Rudolph after completing his century in Auckland on Sunday. (AFP) Auckland: New Zealands Chris Martin captured his first ten-wicket haul as South Africa suffered a late second innings collapse in their bid to save the second Test on Sunday. At the close of the fourth day, South Africa were 277 for six, still 22 runs adrift of New Zealands first innings total with Jacques Rudolph (121) and Shaun Pollock the not out batsmen going into the final day. After dismissing New Zealand for 595 in the morning, the Proteas set about the tough task of erasing a 299-run first innings deficit in the worse possible fashion, losing skipper Graeme Smith off the first delivery of their second innings. The Proteas battled back in the afternoon and were cruising at 249 for two after Herschelle Gibbs and Rudolph had put on 103 for the second wicket and the latter had been joined by Jacques Kallis to add 146 for the third. But Martin, who took six wickets in the first innings, had other ideas and captured three of the four wickets to fall in the last 12 overs of the day. The initial breakthrough was made by part-time bowler Craig McMillan who trapped Kallis leg-before for 71, putting an end to the burly allrounders bid to emulate Sir Donald Bradman with six centuries in consecutive Test matches. Playing his first Test for two years, Martin built on the shift in momentum to dismiss Gary Kirsten for one and Neil McKenzie for a duck off the next delivery. When the new ball was taken, Martin got Mark Boucher to edge a catch to Brendon McCullum as New Zealand pressed for victory. Martins match figures to date are ten for 147, the best for a Black Cap against South Africa. At the other end watching the carnage was Rudolph, who reached his third century during the partnership with Kallis and will need to stay at the crease for as long as possible if the tourists are to retain any hope of saving the match. Rudolph said he had to work much harder for this century than for his other two, including the 222 not out he scored against Bangladesh at Chittagong last April. It isnt easy but you have to be really careful, he said. Resuming on 584 for eight, Daryl Tuffey hit two handsome drives for four before he was bowled in Pollocks second over for 13 and last man Martin fell in similar fashion three balls later. Martins wicket, an international record ninth consecutive Test duck, left South Africa with an almost impossible task of preventing the home side from taking a 1-0 lead in the series.

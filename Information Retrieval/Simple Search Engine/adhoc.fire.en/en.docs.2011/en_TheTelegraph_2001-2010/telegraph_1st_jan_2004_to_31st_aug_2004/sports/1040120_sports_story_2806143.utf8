The Telegraph - Calcutta
 One who threw light on the dark side
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: Most have probably forgotten Shane Warne and Mark Waughs links with an Indian bookie (codenamed John) in the mid Nineties. Even fewer, perhaps, recall the late David Hookes role in exposing that. However, it will be unfortunate if Hookes is remembered only as a flamboyant left-hander, inspirational coach and blunt commentator with a weakness for copter rides. Clearly, his unearthing that scandal shouldnt be ignored in the manner anything uncomfortable to the Establishment is. It was back in December 1998 that Hookes exposed the two top guns on his phone-in programme (Melbournes Radio 3 AW). Predictably, it caused an uproar and saw Hookes circle of friends shrink. Not that it affected him. Personally, I was dismayed to learn Mark and Shane were actually paid by an Indian bookie I saw it as a story worth breaking and, honestly, didnt look at possible long-term effects, Hookes told The Telegraph a couple of days after forcing many to take cover. Incidentally, before going on air, Hookes had a word or two with Malcolm Speed, currently the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive. Then, of course, he held that position in the Australian Cricket Board (now Cricket Australia). While Hookes didnt himself say so in as many words, its possible that he was strongly discouraged from taking the lid off a sensational cover-up. The Australian officials, it may be recalled, had brushed the duos dubious ties under the carpet. Worse, the ICC didnt act either. In fact, during our interaction, an exasperated Hookes made the point about the ICC being a pretty useless body. So, what did he expect to emerge? Hookes response was measured: It will be a bonus if anything good comes out of it The sooner those in authority get to the bottom of it, the better Neither Warne nor Mark got indicted as the Establishment accepted their explanation of just providing tips on the pitch and weather! In more recent years, the ICC has definitely taken steps to prevent contacts of the undesirable kind, but hardly anybody cares to recall the contribution of Hookes and the Rashid Latifs. Quite a shame, really. Meanwhile, each Team India member will sign a condolence letter being forwarded to Hookes family. Also, its possible the Indians are going to wear black armbands during Tuesdays tri-series game against Zimbabwe. That will be well received and erase memories of a somewhat unpleasant exchange (over a declaration) between Hookes and Sourav Ganguly after the tour-opener, in late November. Given his disposition, Hookes would have quickly forgotten that. Yet, nothing stops us from making a gesture.  Copyright

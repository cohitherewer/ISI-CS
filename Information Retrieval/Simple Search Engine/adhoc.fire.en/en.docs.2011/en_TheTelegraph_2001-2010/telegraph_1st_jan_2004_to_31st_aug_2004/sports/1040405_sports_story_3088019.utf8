The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The woods are safe these days
 - Augusta Masters will invite a fresh approach and a new superstar  BY MARK REASON  Tiger seems too deep into the woods today to be a title-contender Biscuits and cheese, Rogers and Astaire, ham n eggs, Augusta and Woods. Some things in life are meant to go together. But then along comes a time when the cheese always seems to be mouldy, or the eggs are bad, or Fred is dead. The last 21 months have been like that for the world No 1. Woods is winless in the previous six majors and is without a victory in even a full-field regular tour stroke play tournament since last July. The facts provoke questions. Has the capped crusader peaked or is this just a temporary slump? This years Masters should go some way towards providing some answers, because Augusta National could have been designed for Tiger Woods. Off the tee it has traditionally put a premium on distance over accuracy. From the fairways it rewards the player, like Jack Nicklaus or Greg Norman, who can hit towering mid-irons. Round the greens it shakes the sweet hands of a Seve Ballesteros or a Jose Maria Olazabal. No wonder Nicklaus once predicted that Woods green jackets could run into double figures. But Woods has never looked so vulnerable going into the first major of the season. The split with long-term coach Butch Harmon is looking more damaging by the week. His father, Earl, is a more distant figure than he was early on in Woods career. His mother, Kultida, is no longer the supremely dominant woman in Woods life. The strapping has reappeared on his left knee. And Tigers idea of a grandstand finish at last weeks Tournament Players Championship was to spoon his second shot at the 18th high up into the crowd. In fact, he is looking more like Seve by the month. It is not just the fact that Woods is currently 104th in driving accuracy  that is not disastrous for a man who is third in driving distance  it is that when he does miss a fairway his ball is so wide it is in danger of crossing the state line. Even more damagingly, these misses are no longer confined to Tigers driver, but are seeping into his three-wood and mid-irons. One of the shots that Woods has used to subdue Augusta in the past is his stinger, a raking draw with a three-wood that no other player can quite emulate in terms of height and distance. But Harmon said: He cant hit it [the stinger] from the position hes in with the club face being that shut. He would hit it straight left every time. Hes got to change that position at the top of the swing. Woods also needs to adjust his takeaway. Comparisons between the 2000 US Open (in his stellar year) and now show that four years ago Woods initiated his swing by taking the club away slightly to the outside, but that now it is considerably on the inside. If this techno-rap makes it sound as though Woods might as well not turn up, that is, of course, far from the case. His brilliant short game is better than ever (he took 21 putts on the way to a second round 68 at the The Players Championship) and he still thinks pure thoughts on a golf course. If Olly could win playing as he was in 1999, then this years Masters is by no means beyond Woods. Coincidentally or not, Jack Nicklaus was almost the same age as Tiger when he began his first significant winless streak in the majors. That comparison asks three major questions of Woods upcoming year. Can he end the losing streak in majors? If not, can he finish in the top five as Nicklaus so often used to. And can he get 100 per cent healthy. Going back to the ham n eggs analogy there might be another comparison to be made. When Tiger first started the professional game, like the pig to ham n eggs, he was utterly committed. Now, like the chicken, is he just giving a part of himself? It is hard to believe, but we shall see. Certainly that crackle of static intensity doesnt seem quite so electric as three or four years ago. Fittingly, one of those best suited to challenge Woods is almost a clone of the worlds No 1 golfer. By winning the TPC, Adam Scott, who Woods once said was a better 19-year-old golfer than he was, has pushed himself to the front of the Australian resurgence. Scott, Craig Parry, Stuart Appleby and Robert Allenby have each won this year. Scott expects to prosper at the Masters because the course sets up so well for him. He can sling-hook it round the corners from the tee, he has the required distance, he can hit the high irons (Harmon says his swing is now where Woods was in 2000) and he has just received another short game lesson from Greg Norman, whose advice helped Scott to finish in the top 10 on his debut two years ago. If it is still a year or so too early for Scott, there are many who fancy one of the three nearly men  Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Davis Love  to finally win a Masters.

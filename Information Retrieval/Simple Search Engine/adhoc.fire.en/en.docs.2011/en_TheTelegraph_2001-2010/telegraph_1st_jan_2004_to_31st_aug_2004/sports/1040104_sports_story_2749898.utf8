The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Styris wins it for NZ
 - FIRST ONE-DAYER - Late Moin blast not enough  Scott Styris acknowledges the cheers after scoring 101 to steer New Zealand to a victory over Pakistan in the first ODI at Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday. (Reuters) Auckland, Jan. 3 (AP): Scott Styris scored his second ODI century to guide New Zealand to a four-wicket victory against Pakistan in the first match of the five-match series on Saturday. Man-of-the-Match Styris was not out on 101 when New Zealand moved past Pakistans 229 for seven with five balls remaining. The win seemed out of New Zealands reach when they lost three middle-order wickets for 15 runs between the 37th and 40th over. But Styris, who came in with New Zealand at 35 for two, kept a cool head to see the home side to its first win in six ODIs against Paksitan. He completed his century in 108 balls, with ten fours and two sixes. New Zealand, with six wickets down, needed 44 runs from the last five overs, 31 from the last 20 balls, 27 from 18 and finally 17 with two overs remaining. Pakistan had managed to take charge with some aggressive late-order batting and tight full-pitch bowling. It was only in the last two overs that Styris finally broke the visitors grip on the match. Styris did not panic as New Zealands required run-rate crept above six, to seven and finally beyond eight runs an over. He dominated the strike in an unbroken 74-run stand with Brendon McCullum, hitting regular boundaries to keep New Zealand in sight of the winning total. McCullum contributed only 13 but took regular singles to keep Styris on strike and had the honour of hitting the winning runs  a couple from the first ball of the final over. Styris raced to the 90s going from 93 to 99 in the penultimate over with a six before completing his century. Earlier in an outstanding all-round performance, Styris claimed three for 34, removing Saleem Elahi, Shoaib Malik and Inzamam-ul Haq to leave Pakisatn 120 for six in the 38th over. Jacob Oram, who took two for 28, also helped contain the Pakistan batsmen early. But Moin Khan and Azhar Mahmood broke those constraints in a brilliant display of late-order hitting. Wicketkeeper Moin hit eight fours and a six reaching his half-century from 58 balls while Mahmood hit two fours and two sixes in an explosive display. Mahmood and off-spinner Malik then restricted New Zealands scoring before Styris took the match away from them. It was nice to get across the line, Stephen Fleming said. We were under a lot of pressure but Eden Park is a tough ground to defend and as long as we had Scotty (Styris) there I knew we were in with a chance. New Zealand had lost their momentum when skipper Fleming was out for 45, but Styris survived the regular fall of wickets to carry New Zealand through. Pakistan coach Javed Miandad praised Styris performance, admitting that 229 was a difficult total to defend in Eden Park. I thought we had it in the middle of their innings but Styris batted magnificently. He also got three wickets, so he was a real hero for New Zealand, Miandad said.  Copyright

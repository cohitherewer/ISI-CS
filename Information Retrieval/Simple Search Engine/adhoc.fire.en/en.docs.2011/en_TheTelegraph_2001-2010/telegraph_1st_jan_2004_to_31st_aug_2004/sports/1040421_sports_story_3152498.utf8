The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly pushed to the brink
Chennai: Tollygunge Agragamis survival hopes, in the elite tier of the National Football League, suffered a major blow following their 0-1 defeat against Indian Bank on Tuesday. Indian Bank, already relegated to the second division, struck through Sabir Pasha in the 68th minute. They have eight points after 20 matches. Tollygunge have 18 from 19. The visitors worked hard but could not finish on a number of occasions with striker Akeem Abolanle missing two simple chances. Then in the 27th minute, Tollygunges Samshi Rezas powerful 20-yard drive was palmed away by goalkeeper Felix Edward. The local outfit came close twice before Pasha found the target. The goal came after defender Isiaka Awoyemi failed to clear a low cross from Mahendra Mani from the left. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Unfit team core adds to woes, says Brian Lara
- Skipper blames injuries to key bowlers for sides failure against England
 Even the experienced Chanderpaul was down Port-of-Spain: West Indies cricket captain Brian Lara has blamed injuries to key players for his sides failure to perform this year. The West Indies lost a four-Test series in South Africa 0-3 in January, and conceded last months home four-Test series to England by a record 0-3 for the first time since 1968. Bangladesh have arrived for a two-Test series, expected to offer some local relief. Though dismal batting was at the centre of the West Indies flops against England, notwithstanding Laras own record 400 not out in Antigua after the series was already decided, the skipper highlighted missing injured bowlers in his regular column for the Trinidad Guardian Monday. Lara noted Jermaine Lawson, one of the regions fastest bowlers, whose action needed remedial work after he was reported against Australia a year ago when he strained his back, and off-spinning allrounder Omari Banks, who departed from the South Africa tour with a back stress fracture. Also sidelined from that tour were fast bowler Jerome Taylor (back), and batsmen Wavell Hinds (groin) and Marlon Samuels (knee). None became fit enough to play England, but Lawson, Banks and Hinds have been named in warm-up matches against Bangladesh. Banks absence was underlined when the West Indies did not have a strong spinner in the fourth Test against England in Antigua last month, which could have brought a win instead of a draw, according to Lara. In hindsight, we would have cruised to victory in that match if we had the services of any specialist spinner on such a pitch, he said. He said the injuries have disrupted the teams line-up. In every team there is a core of players who make for its existence and when that becomes fragile, the team obviously suffers, Lara wrote. As captain of the West Indies team I found myself having to rearrange that core because of absent players through injuries. In any normal situation the senior players would look after themselves and also take one or two younger players under their wings. But even a toll was taken on senior players, including the vastly experienced Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who was dropped from the fourth Test against England because of fatigue, but returned to play well in the one-day series. The West Indies, fallen to eighth in the 10-team world rankings, plays last-ranked Bangladesh in the first of three one-day Internationals on Saturday in St Vincent.  (AP)  Copyright

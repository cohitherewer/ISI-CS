The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA looking to regain second spot 
London: South Africa are looking to reclaim the No. 2 Test ranking during their series against Sri Lanka, which began on Wednesday. A 2-0 sweep will fetch four points and lift South Africa to the second spot with 110 points in the ICC Test championship table behind world champions Australia who have 129 points. England, who defeated the West Indies in the first two Tests, are currently in second position with 107 points but even a 4-0 whitewash in the home series will not be enough to retain the second spot if South Africa triumph 2-0, according to an ICC media release. However, England will improve their rating to 109 if they sweep the series. If England win 3-0 they will end up with a rating of 108. On the other hand, if Sri Lanka, who have a strong Test record at home, can win both matches they will improve their rating from 99 to 105 to move above India to joint fourth place with Pakistan. ICC TEST RANKINGS (As on August 3) 1. Australia 129; 2. England 107; 3. South Africa 106; 4. Pakistan 105; 5. India 104; 6. Sri Lanka 99; 7. New Zealand 94; 8. West Indies 76; 9. Zimbabwe 51; 10.

 Inzy was not inspirational: Khan
 - Pakistan captain wants players to attend a fitness camp ahead of Asia Cup  Shaharyar Khan Inzamam-ul HaqShoaib AkhtarIslamabad: Acknowledging that Inzamam-ul Haq was not an inspirational leader, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said the team was found lacking in unity and national spirit in the Test series. I do not want to give excuses and as chairman I accept full responsibility. I admit there were faults, Shaharyar told the Senate standing committee on sports, which is looking into the reasons for the home teams defeat in the historic series against India. Shaharyar also told the committee during a marathon meeting on Saturday that he would see if the services of coach Javed Miandad was required and termed Inzamam as a decent man but not an inspiring leader, according to a report in local daily Dawn. He outlined three reasons for Pakistans first series defeat to India at home. The Indians played to their true potential while our strong point which was bowling let us down and our team was found to be lacking in unity and national spirit, especially in the Tests. But the chairman insisted that the defeat was not a disaster. We lost narrowly; however we have reviewed our cricketing failures and the PCB advisory council will analyse these further. Shaharyar ruled out any attempts at match-fixing in the series. The ICCs Anti Corruption Unit was here during the series and they gave us a clean sheet. There was no evidence of match-fixing. One senator Tariq Azeem called Shoaib Akhtar as a pampered and spoilt baby and said the fast bowler should be told clearly either to play cricket or do tantrums. Shaharyar assured the senator that Shoaib will not be given any special treatment in future and he will have to show complete fitness and commitment to be in the team. Meanwhile, Inzamam is determined not to allow the Shoaib injury saga that wrecked his team against India in the recent home series repeat itself in the forthcoming Asia Cup. Inzamam has said he would ascertain from the PCB as to the latest fitness position of the fast bowler and also call all the players for a fitness camp ahead of the six-nation event in Sri Lanka from July 16. When I meet the PCB officials on June 4, I would like to know the fitness position of Shoaib because he is a key player of the team, Inzamam was quoted as saying in The News on Sunday. Injuries have been a major problem for us in recent months and I dont want a repeat of things that occurred during the India series in the Asia Cup, he said. I will also ask the board to call the players presently playing in County cricket for the Asia Cup. I want to know the tournament availability of these players from the board.  REASONS FOR DEFEATAccording to PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, who appeared before the Senate on Saturday, the Inzamam-ul Haq led team lost to India because of three reasons:
 The Indians played to their true 
potential 
 Bowling, Pakistans strong point, let the side down 
 Pakistan were found lacking in unity and national spiritInzamams injury fears stem from reports that Shoaib had aggravated his rib injury, which stopped him from the taking the field on the third day of the decisive Test against India, by playing for Durham in the English county. The Pakistan captain also said that he would be laying emphasis on fitness of players before start of any tournament. From now onwards I would be laying a lot of stress on the fitness of players before they are selected for any tournament, he said. The burly middle-order batsman made it clear that the players should put country ahead of county, meaning the planned 22-day training camp from June 20 should take precedence over non-Pakistan commitments.

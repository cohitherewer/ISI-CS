The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB bank on strikers 
 - AFC CUP 
 - Bhowmick shows guarded optimism vs Geylang  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick explains a point to Bhaichung Bhutia as Chandan Das listens at the club ground on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Feb. 7: A long way to go  thats what Subhas Bhowmick had maintained after East Bengals success at the ASEAN Club Championship in July. A few months have passed since then and the champions have not had much to show  barring some success in the National Football League. As the red-and-gold brigade embarks on another journey, Bhowmick sounded a determined man to extend the trail of success, which had its origin in Jakarta. Well be aiming for a win, Bhowmick said after practice on Saturday at the club ground. The team left for Singapore late in the night to take part in the AFC Cup opener against Geylang United of Singapore. But going for a win does not mean that the Indian champions are taking the Singapore club lightly. Ive done all the homework possibleThey have a good attack and well have to be cautious for the first 20-25 minutes, Bhowmick said. He revealed that during that phase we will pack the midfield and play with one striker. Geylang, it has been learnt, have an Australian and a Chinese striker. They are playing well and the team narrowly came second in their home league which finished in October last year, the East Bengal coach said. Its the strikers who are giving Bhowmick a much-needed confidence. As he put it: Bhaichung (Bhutia), (Cristiano) Junior and Mike (Okoro) are doing a good job. I dont think scoring will be too much of a problem. Especially, Okoros return to form has pleased Bhowmick to a great extent. He doesnt know how good a player he is But the defence still remains a big worry for the coach. Neither Subhashish (Roy Chowdhury), nor Surkumar Singh have the experience to play in the central defensive zone in an international meet. So thats a worry. East Bengal, however, have the experience of Dipak Mondal and Mahesh Gawli in the team. East Bengal tried frantically to include Surya Bikash Chakraborty as the 20th member to bolster their defence, but the move fell through due to visa problems. East Bengal had similar problems in defence in the ASEAN Club Championship final. Despite that handicap, the red-and-gold brigade carried the day in style. So, why is Bhowmick a worried man now? When I had the team before the ASEAN meet, it was a lump of clay. I a five-week conditioning camp, and there I moulded the team according to my needs and didnt look back thereafter. But now the team has been playing continuously for past eight months, and that is sure to take its toll on the outfit, Bhowmick signed off.  THE SQUAD Sangram Mukherjee, Sandip Nandy, Surkumar Singh, Dipak Mondal, Mahesh Gawli, Debjit Ghosh, Sasthi Duley, Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, Subhas Chakraborty, S.

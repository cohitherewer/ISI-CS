The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Prabhjot hits out, Rach retaliates
 SUJIT BHAR Athens: Trouble has started brewing in the Indian hockey squad, with the team already out of running for a semi-final berth, even out of contention for the Champions Trophy. India and Argentina drew 2-2 on Monday. While Gagan Ajit Singh scored both the goals for India, Matias Vila struck twice for Argentina. They go onto the placings matches after the pool phase gets over, and the idea now is to avoid the worst finish ever. That is the position, down from a gold-hunting team that spent huge sums of money and energy in training in the US and Germany and playing meets in Holland and what not. Prabhjot Singh came out against his coach, saying Gerhard Rach was biased against him and did not use him long enough to prove his worth. Rachs reply was, probably the player wanted to excuse his performance, or non-performance... Rach said he had given everybody equal opportunity to play and everybody got the maximum affordable in a match. Prabhjot also was critical of Rachs very defensive strategy. The coach did not react to this. There have been minor problems among other players in the squad and bad blood isnt anything really new. Meanwhile, Deepak Thakur, who had been admitted to the hospital with chest pains after the match versus New Zealand, has been discharged from hospital and is in fine condition, said an official. Spain in semis Reuters adds: Meanwhile, Spain booked their semi-final spot from pool A after a 3-0 win over Egypt on Monday. Spain will meet either defending champions The Netherlands or Australia. Only Eduardo Tubau managed to score in the first half. In the second, Pol Amat scored from a penalty stroke and Tubau netted a penalty corner for a comfortable win. In other matches, Pakistan toyed with a hapless Britain, emerging 8-2 winners. New Zealand beat South Africa 4-1.  Copyright

 Ponting wants Aussies to improve away record
Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting challenged the games top-ranked side to play more aggressively on tour before they set off for Sri Lanka on Friday. I want the team to be able to win more away from home, Ponting told a news conference before the one-day squad headed for Colombo. I want us to play the same brand of cricket overseas as we do here in Australia. If we do that, we are going to give ourselves a very good chance of winning a lot more games. Thats the challenge that lies ahead of us now. Weve got a lot of cricket coming up on the sub-continent. The series of five one-dayers against Sri Lanka starts on February 20, followed by three Tests. Australia lost their most recent Test series in Sri Lanka 0-1 in 1999-2000. They were also beaten 2-1 in a Test series in India, and will tour there in October. For Ponting, the Sri Lanka challenge will be his first Test series as skipper. The 29-year-old Tasmanian blasted 1,503 Test runs at a Don Bradman-like average of 100.20 in 2003. Ive got a better understanding now of how the team best operates, the World Cup-winning captain said. Its worked out extremely well that Ive had the chance to captain the one-day side (for two years) before the Test team. Were playing really good one-day cricket at the moment so were pretty excited about our prospects over there. Sri Lanka last week named six spinners in their 25-man training squad for the one-day series. Australia are likely to recall leg spinner Shane Warne following his 12-month doping ban when they name their Test squad on February 20. Warne took five wickets this week for Victoria in a second XI match against Queensland and will also play for his state side against Tasmania in a four-day game starting on Monday. Its in Shanes hands now and Im sure the selectors will be keeping a very close eye on things over the next few days, Ponting said. Pontings world champions crushed India 2-0 in the one-day finals series in Melbourne and Sydney last week. Australia easily beat Sri Lanka twice in last years World Cup but Ponting remains wary of the home sides main weapon, off spinner Muttiah Muralidharan. I dont think you will ever hit him out of the attack but you can certainly put him under a bit more pressure, he said. Well have a good look at him in the one-dayers. Hes hard work wherever you play him and hes going to be even harder in Sri Lanka. The Steve Waugh-inspired tradition of Australian players wearing their baggy green caps when they take the field in Test matches will continue under his captaincy. So he says will Australias all-out attacking approach  scoring fast runs, setting attacking fields, avoiding draws, physically and verbally intimidating opponents  in an attempt to win every match as quickly as possible. There are a lot of little things that make this Australian team tick and making it as good as it has been over a long period of time, Ponting said. Something that Steve Waugh brought into the side only a few years ago was that every time we took the field, everybody would be wearing their baggy green caps for at least the first session of the day that we field.Little things like that, I want to make sure they continue so some of the traditions and ethos we have in and around the side dont die off. Well still play a very similar style of cricket  well still be very aggressive and try to win as many games as we can, and if possible win games as early as we can. Thats been a successful method for us over the last five or six years, I guess, and I dont see us changing.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

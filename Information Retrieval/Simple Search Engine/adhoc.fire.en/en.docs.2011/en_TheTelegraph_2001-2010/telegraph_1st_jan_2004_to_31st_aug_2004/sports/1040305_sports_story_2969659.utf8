The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Zone hit back after Yuvraj ton
 - Paul (3/65), Mohanty (2/44) effect North late-order collapse with second new ball  Yuvraj Singh en route to his 106 during the Duleep Trophy final being played at the PCA Stadium in Mohali on Thursday. (PTI) Mohali: Yuvraj Singh answered his critics with a classy hundred but a late-order collapse saw North Zone surrender the initiative to East on the first day of the Duleep Trophy final at the PCA Stadium on Thursday. Put into bat, North put paid to Easts advantage of the coin with purposeful batting from the top order, only to lose five wickets for 19 runs thereafter and slide to 304 for seven by close of play. Wicketkeeper-batsman Ajay Ratra was batting on eight after the fall of Gagandeep Singh off the days last ball. However, morning hardly showed the day when Akash Chopra (27) and Gautam Gambhir (46) put on 82 runs for the opening stand. Yuvraj (106) and Dinesh Mongia (84) then seemingly put North in the drivers seat. North remained so till the final ten overs, when North were cruising at 285 for two. But Shib Shankar Paul and Debashish Mohanty made effective use of the second new ball to change the complexion of the game on Day I. All the hard work has gone down the drain, said Yuvraj after his chanceless innings, which lasted 234 minutes, 162 balls and contained 16 fours. Ironically, the slump began with the stylish left handers unnecessary run out in the 80th over when he was turned back by Mongia and was beaten by Devang Gandhis throw from the cover region. That direct hit was very much an act of inspiration for the East skipper, who had watched the two batsmen negate his decision to bowl first on a green top with a 197-run third wicket partnership. In the very second over of the second new ball, Mongia mistimed a drive off Mohanty for a simple catch to Laxmi Ratan Shukla to undo his good work. Mithun Minhas might have been unlucky to be ruled leg before with his front foot well stretched forward but Joginder Sharma was guilty of fishing at an harmless delivery outside the off-stump from Paul. Mohanty then had Gagandeep caught behind to wrap up a satisfying day for East. Mohanty grabbed two for 44 while Paul was rewarded for bending his back hard with three for 65. Gandhi might have been deceived by the fair amount of the grass on the Mohali pitch. The story, as it unfolded, was similar to the second Test against New Zealand that ended in a draw at the start of the season. Chopra was assured in his stout defence while Gambhir picked up the scoring after a tentative start. But Paul, who had had a successful season in first-class cricket so far, surprised Chopra with his ability to bring the ball back in. Gambhir was dismissed in similar fashion when left-arm spinner Sourashish Lahiri caught him on the back foot, as two wickets fell for six runs. Yuvraj and Mongia, however, took the responsibility of coasting North to safety with their quick scoring. The former played a dominant role while the latter was content to play the accompanying orchestra. Yuvraj was under pressure to deliver after the selectors asked him to prove his fitness ahead of the Test team selection for the Pakistan tour. I was told by the selectors to play. The niggle is still there, it is a bit stiff but throwing is not a problem, he said after the match.  (PTI)  Copyright

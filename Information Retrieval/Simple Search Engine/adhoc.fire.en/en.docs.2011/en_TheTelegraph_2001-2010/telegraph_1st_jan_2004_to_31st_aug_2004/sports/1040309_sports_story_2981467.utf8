The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leicester verdict may take long
Cartagena: A Spanish court could take several days to decide whether to release on bail the three Leicester City soccer players who are accused of sexual assault, a senior court source said on Monday. Frank Sinclair, Keith Gillespie and Paul Dickov were sent to prison on Friday evening after a judge heard evidence from them and from three women who accused the players of breaking into their hotel room and sexually assaulting them.

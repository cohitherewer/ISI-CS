The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA set 325 for victory
 - FIRST TEST - Boje (5/88) checks Lankan progress after Rudolph century  Nicky Boje in action on Day IV of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle on Saturday. (AFP) Galle, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Opener Sanath Jayasuriya top scored with 74 as Sri Lanka set South Africa a tricky 325-run target on the fourth day of the first Test on Saturday. Sri Lanka shot out South Africa for 376 in the first session, securing a 110-run first innings lead, before declaring at 214 for nine shortly before the close of play. At stumps, South Africa were seven without loss in three overs. Earlier, loss of wickets at regular intervals saw Sri Lanka crumble in their second innings as the pitch became increasingly difficult for batsmen. The Proteas struck back led by left-arm spinner Nicky Boje, who took five for 88 from 22 overs. Veteran Jayasuriya was Sri Lankas mainstay, adding 62 for the first wicket with skipper Maravan Atapattu (25), then 27 with Kumar Sangakkara (13) and 37 with Thilan Samaraweera (19). Atapattu was trapped leg before by a ball that kept low from Lance Klusener, while Sangakkara miscued a lofted drive off Boje and was caught at mid off. Jayawardene was also caught on the deep off Boje as Sri Lanka reached 112 for three at tea. In the final session, wickets tumbled regularly with Jayasuriya nicking a slow off-cutter from Shaun Pollock, who then trapped Tillekeratne Dilshan (1). Samaraweera was the second Klusener victim of low bounce, while Romesh Kaluwitharana was beaten by spin and caught at slip off Boje. Upul Chandana made a brisk 29 from 40 balls, hitting three fours and one six, before holing out in the deep off Boje. Boje also picked up the wicket of Muttiah Muralidharan just before the declaration, to finish with five wickets for the day. Earlier, Jacques Rudolph scored his fourth Test hundred before South Africa were bowled out for 376 midway through the morning session. Sri Lanka needed just four balls to break through as Boje failed to add to his overnight 31. Makhaya Ntini skied one to Upul Chandana at deep mid-wicket off Muralidharan. Rudolph, on 91 when Ntini was dismissed, had a lucky escape on 96 after a thick edge missed Kaluwitharanas gloves before he finally brought up three figures with an inside edge past his leg stump. He was then dismissed for 102 when he became Muralidharans fourth wicket of the innings to extend the off spinners world Test record tally to 531.  Copyright

		 Monday, May 03, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Los Angeles: Kobe Bryant has become the latest uncertainty for the Dream Teams Olympic title defence in Athens next August with the LA Lakers player facing a possible sexual assault trial in late summer. Bryant is accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman in his hotel room in Colorado on June 30 last year and must answer the charges during hearings set to begin May 10 and end May 12 with the possibility of a trial in July or August. Bryants lawyer said in a statement published in the Los Angeles Times on Saturday that the player was unlikely to compete in the Olympics, and that he expressed his intentions at this time to allow USA Basketball ample time to seek a replacement player.				 																																	Buderim: The Australian womens hockey team saved its best performance for last by beating India 9-2 on Sunday in the fifth Test to win the series 2-0. Australian striker Julie Towers scored three goals and Nicole Arrold had her first goal in international hockey. The first Test was abandoned due to a power failure, the second cancelled due to fog and the third drawn 3-3 before Australia won the fourth 5-1 on Saturday.				 																																	London: Brazils Rivaldo, in South America thinking over a deal with Bolton, said he was very impressed with the Premiership side, the News of the World reported on Sunday. 				 																																	Rivaldo said discussions with manager Sam Allardyce and chairman Phil Gartside won him over. The 32-year-old Rivaldo said: I do not want anyone in Bolton to think that, if I play there, I am doing it for the wrong reasons. I am grateful to Sam Allardyce for the chance they want to give me and all I can say is how impressed I am with their whole set-up. 				 																																	Berlin: The entire team of Bayer Leverkusen is up for sale according to general manager Reiner Calmund, but only at the right price. 				 																																	The 2002 Champions League finalists have a reputation for selling their best stars  Michael Ballack and Ze Roberto left for Bayern two seasons ago  and Calmund confessed that trend would continue.				 																																	Every one of our players is up for sale, Calmund told television channel DSF. If the price is right then anyone can go. Brazilians Lucio and Juan along with Turkish World Cup star Yildiray Basturk are all being linked with moves away. 				 																																	We were unable to keep hold of top-class players such as Emerson, admitted Calmund.				 																																	We are not one of the top five clubs and have to recognise where we fit in.				 																																	Miami: Kelvin Davis won the vacant IBF cruiserweight title on Saturday with an eighth-round stoppage of fellow American Ezra Sellers.				 																																	Davis, 25, rose to 21-2 with one draw with his 15th victory inside the distance. Sellers, 35, fell to 27-6. 				 																																	Referee Frank Santore stopped the fight after two minutes and 33 seconds of the eighth round after Davis knocked down Sellers twice with left hooks.A powerful right by Davis knocked down Sellers in the final seconds of the fourth round and Davis followed up aggressively in the fifth.

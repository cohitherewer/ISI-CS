The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Top cricketers may participate
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Some top Indian cricketers could play a charity match in Ahmedabad to raise funds for the cancer-afflicted daughter of veteran Ranji Cricketer Kedar Chavan. India skipper Sourav Ganguly is also expected to be among those who will play. It has been called a clash of the right-handers and left-handers, at the Motera on June 5. Among others in fray for this one-dayer could be Rahul Dravid and many from the Indian team. Sachin Tendulkar may not be there because he is holidaying in Europe. A BCCI source said since this is a free time and since this is for charity, the board does not need to know and there is no problem.  Copyright

 Argentine grudge to provide spice
Gaudio (left) says he needs to play unbelievable tennis on Sunday, while Coria wants a final with a heartParis, June 5 (AFP): A French Open final between two Argentine claycourters would normally stir up little emotion outside of Buenos Aires and Cordoba, but there is an edge to Sundays final between Guillermo Coria and Gaston Gaudio. The two had a bitter clash last year at the Hamburg Masters which ended in fisticuffs in the locker-room after their semi-final match. At one-set all and up a break in the decider, Coria pointedly thumped his chest and glared at Gaudio at a change-over with the message being  You have no heart. Coria went on to win that set 6-0 but an incensed Gaudio and one of his coaches after the game pinned Coria against a wall in the locker-rooms and they had to be separated. According to Gaudio, its all in the past. We talked about it and thats it, he said after his straight sets demolition of David Nalbandian on Friday. Its over. Everything is clear now. Be that as it may, Gaudio and Coria have followed different paths to their showdown at Roland Garros. Coria is a product of the official Argentine federations coaching system. 			Gaudio is a city boy from Buenos Aires who dabbled in football and rugby before ploughing his own furrow through the junior tennis ranks. He is on record as saying Coria at times does not appreciate how hard it was for him to break into the top echelons of tennis having been financed and trained through the official channels. Coria stormed through to the semi-finals without the loss of a set before Britains Tim Henman took him to four. Gaudio needed back-to-back, five setters just to get into the third round, but then produced two of the best performances of his career to hammer Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Nalbandian. Gaudio said that he would need to play unbelievable tennis to get the better of Coria.  Copyright

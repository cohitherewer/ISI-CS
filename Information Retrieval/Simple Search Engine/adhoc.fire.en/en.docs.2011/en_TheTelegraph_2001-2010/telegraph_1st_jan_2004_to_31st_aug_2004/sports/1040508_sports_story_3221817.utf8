 Asif Iqbal slams Pak board
Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal has strongly criticised the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for instituting a medical committee to investigate allegations made against certain players that they may have faked injuries during the recently concluded Indo-Pak Test series. I fail to understand firstly what such an inquiry, conducted more than two weeks after the injuries were said to have been sustained, could possibly determine with regard to the degree of incapacity caused by that injury, Asif was quoted as saying by The News.

 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Three National Cricket Academy players  Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina and Venugopal Rao have been sent to the Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy in Australia recently to hone their skills further. Both the cricketers left for Australia on June 14. It was learnt from NCA sources that after the under-19 World Cup, both Raina and Dhawan were spotted by the NCA spotters as good prospects. Venugopal Rao also impressed the NCA bosses with his willow as well as medium pace bowling in the last couple of years. According to the source, they will have one-month stint under chief coach Bennet King. Cricket Australia (CA) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have several exchange programmes and earlier also few juniors boys visited Australia for the same purpose, the source revealed. Dhawan, the left-handed batsman from Delhi, performed well with the bat in the last season in the under-19 World Cup and other meets. While Raina, also a left-handed UP batsman, caught the eyes of the spotters by his run spree in the last season. Rao, an allrounder and trainee of renowned coach Tarak Sinha, who has already proved himself in the national arena, was given another opportunity to sharpen his skills during the one-month stint.

 I dont let pressure build: Pathan
 Pathan is full of praise for Wright Chennai: Irfan Pathans exploits in Australia and Pakistan may have earned him the tag of new pace spearhead, but the speedster is determined not to allow the accolades to distract him. Pathan said the emergence of many young fast bowlers had brought about a healthy competition but he believed that it did not put any pressure on him. If I think too much about what I should do then pressure will build on me. I never get into such a situation and allow pressure to build up, Pathan said on Tuesday. As far as I am concerned my performance and the teams victory matter the most. Asked whether the emergence of young bowlers put more pressure on him, he said: I do not think there is any pressure, whoever bowls well will definitely find a place in the team.We learn from each other. Pathan said his interactions with bowling legends like Dennis Lillee and Kapil Dev had helped him to perform better. Definitely, it helps. Talking to great bowlers, especially Lillee at the MRF Academy had definitely helped me. Pathan spoke highly of coach John Wright who was working very hard with everybody. Wright is doing a great job. Team India for Unicef Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly and Wright on Tuesday took time off their practice sessions to espouse the cause of girls education. At a function here on Unicefs education campaign called Access to school for girls, Sourav said: If we, as members of the Indian cricket team, can help the cause for little girls we would be delighted to do so.

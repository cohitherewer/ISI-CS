				 																																	New Delhi: Indias medal hopes at the Olympics received a boost when national mens champion Sharath Kamal and SAF Games womens gold medallist Mouma Das qualified for the table tennis singles event of the Athens Games to be held later this year. Sharath and Mouma booked their berths after finishing ninth and eighth in their respective events at the Asian singles and doubles Olympic qualifying tournament in Beijing, a statement from the Table Tennis Federation of India said on Monday.				 																																	Soumyadeep Roy and womens national champion Poulami Ghatak, the other two Indians to compete in the 13-nation event, finished outside the qualifying bracket.				 																																	The top 20 in the world get automatic entry into the Olympics. Besides, a quota of 40 berths is allotted for each continent.				 																																	The final world Olympic mens and womens singles qualifiers is to be held in Austria from May 13 to 16 which will be the last qualification event. The meet is restricted to players who have not qualified through their ranking or continental qualifying events. From here, the top two players of each discipline will make it to Athens. 				 																																	New York: Lindsay Davenport claimed the 40th singles title of her career with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Amelie Mauresmo in the final of the Amelia Island tournament on Sunday.				 																																	Fourth seed Davenport, the 1997 winner and last years runner-up, produced some of her best form of the year to win in an hour 18 minutes.				 																																	French third seed Mauresmo had knocked out world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne in the semi-finals on Saturday but was a pale imitation against Davenport.				 																																	Only when she was in trouble in the second set did she finally open up on her strong backhand side, saving one match point at 2-5 down before breaking back for 3-5. Although she held serve for 4-5, Mauresmos stand only temporarily delayed the Americans victory charge.				 																																	Im stunned and excited, said Davenport, who collected a winners cheque for $93,000. I didnt expect this because I felt I came in as the huge underdog on clay.				 																																	Augusta: Tiger Woods heads off to an army barracks next week searching for answers following another major meltdown at the US Masters on Sunday. The world No. 1 is unlikely to find his game at North Carolinas Fort Bragg where he is scheduled to go through four days of intensive US Army basic training in weapons and military tactics before ending the week conducting a junior golf clinic for families at the base.				 																																	The 28-year-old American, whose father Earl is an ex-Green Beret who trained at Fort Bragg during the Vietnam War, will also have a skydiving lesson and make a tandem jump with the armys parachute team.				 																																	Well, Ive always wanted to do something like that, Woods said. If I was never introduced to golf, thats where I would be.Following his brief army stint, Woods will not rush back to the PGA Tour. Having pulled out of next months Deutsche Bank Open in Germany, speculation persists that Woods is clearing his calendar to wed girlfriend Elin Nordegren.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mumbai test for Bengal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Its crunch time for Bengal as they take on Mumbai in their national one-day meet match at Eden Gardens Monday. The hosts are in no mood to give the Ranji Trophy champions that bit of extra respect going into this game. Were taking it one game at a time. Mumbai are a good side but were ready for them, Bengal captain Devang Gandhi said. Devang felt winning the toss and batting first might hold the key. Generally the Eden wicket is a bit on the slower side. Its better to have a few runs on the board. About the team composition, he said: Ranadeb Bose will come in place of Shib Shankar Paul. Paul has left for Bangalore to represent India A in the one-day match against England A.  Copyright

 Real coach ready to take the blame 
Madrid: Real Madrid coach Carlos Queiroz has taken full responsibility for his sides shock exit from the Champions League but says he will not be worrying about his future at the club. It was a very painful result for all of us, Queiroz said after his sides 1-3 defeat at Monaco. We did not expect this to happen, but as coach of Real Madrid I take full responsibility when we dont get the results we want. As for my future, I am not concerned about what might happen. My job is to analyse the game and to worry about the present. Queiroz said that he hoped the end of Reals dream of a domestic and European double would now have a positive effect on galvanising the team to win the Spanish league. Although we are very sad about what happened and it was a very negative experience for the club it could work to our advantage and open up the door to winning the league. Reals sporting director Jorge Valdano refused to be drawn when asked by reporters about Queirozs future. We havent even thought about whether or not Queiroz will stay on, he told reporters. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas struck a negative note about his teams elimination from Europe, saying that the teams form had been worrying him for some time. I could see this coming, he said after the game. On other occasions luck has been on our side and the results have flattered us. I see the team from the back and know that we are not in good shape, although this is just my opinion.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Graf, Sabatini to play for charity
 Steffi Graf Berlin: Legendary German tennis ace Steffi Graf is to pick up her racket once again to face long-time Argentine rival Gabriela Sabatini in a charity match in Berlin on September 25. Graf, 35, retired from tennis five years ago but is set to grace the court once again with the match proceeds going to her Children for Tommorrow Foundation. We are delighted this match is taking place here where she began her great career, explained Eberhard Wensky, tournament director of the German Open. Graf, married Andre Agassi, won 22 Grand Slam titles in a glittering career. She won her first title in 1986, when she was just a raw 16-year-old, as Graf triumphed over Martina Navratilova in the final of the German Open in Berlin. (AFP)  Copyright

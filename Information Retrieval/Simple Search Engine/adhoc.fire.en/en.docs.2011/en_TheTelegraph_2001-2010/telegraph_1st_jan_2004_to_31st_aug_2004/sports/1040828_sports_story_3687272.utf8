The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachins future to be known tomorrow
 - If maestro fails to regain fitness, Dinesh Mongia will come into picture; Team India leave for England a day early  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sachin TendulkarCalcutta: Team Indias departure for England has been advanced by a day, to Saturday, and a decision on whether a back-up is needed for Sachin Tendulkar should be made on Sunday. Having been knocked out of the tri-series, and workouts hit by rain (in Amsterdam), Sourav Ganguly and his men will take an early morning British Midlands flight for London. On arrival, around 10.00 am local time, the team is going to board a coach for Nottingham where the first NatWest Challenge match is slated for September 1. Officials there have been requested for nets in the afternoon itself, informed manager Goutam Das Gupta. If we get delayed, then a workout wont be possible, otherwise nets will be held After all, we are anxious about Sachins fitness and, to a somewhat lesser extent, even Ajit Agarkars, he pointed out. Sachin, it may be recalled, has been off workouts for a week  owing to the frustration-encouraging combination of a tennis elbow and viral fever. As for Agarkar, he woke up with a strained back last Sunday and missed the (rain-ruined) game versus Australia. He did bowl at Thursdays indoor nets but, given his fitness-record, the team management remains wary. According to The Telegraphs sources, there has been an informal discussion about probably adding Dinesh Mongia to Team India if Sachin doesnt clear Sundays test. Even if Sachin isnt fit for the three-match NatWest Challenge, everyone expects him to be part of Indias challenge in the September 10-25 Champions Trophy. Mongia has been in fine nick, turning out for Lancashire, and its going to make sense to call up somebody who has already spent the summer in England. Of course, his last India-appearance was 16 months ago, during the tri-series in Dhaka. The possibility of getting somebody to replace Agarkar, though, hasnt been talked about. Not till now, at least.  Copyright

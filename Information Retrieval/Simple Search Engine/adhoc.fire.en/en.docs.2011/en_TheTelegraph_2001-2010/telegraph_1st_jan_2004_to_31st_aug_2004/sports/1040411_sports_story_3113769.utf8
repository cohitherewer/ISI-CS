Mohun Bagan players will don a new-look jersey when they resume the National Football League campaign in Goa next week, but coach Aloke Mukherjee has warned the matches against Dempo and Vasco can be tricky. 				 																																																	If theres no drive from within, a change in jersey wont make any difference. Its time players should understand the situation and prove themselves. Any slip-up on our part may prove costly, Mukherjee said before leaving for Goa. 				 																																																	Mohun Bagan, 19 points from 16 matches, will first take on Dempo on Tuesday and Vasco three days later. 				 																																																	Debkumar Sasmals return to action after a long injury lay-off, however, pleases the coach. The availability of Sasmal is a great relief for me.

Meanwhile, club assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury said that he would sit with the special officers, looking after the football affairs, to sort out the existing problems regarding non-payment of dues to former players Bhaichung Bhutia and George Ekeh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Balaji reveals smiling secret
- There is too much competition in the team
New Delhi: The secret of Lakshmipathy Balajis ever-smiling face lies in the doctors scalpel! The bowler, whose performance and ever-smiling countenance won him a huge female fan-following in Pakistan, has revealed that a surgery on his jaw gives the impression that he is smiling constantly. I had a jaw surgery when I was very young, said the affable Tamil Nadu bowler in a TV programme. Balaji also recalled how fans in Pakistan sang a song for him  Balaji zara dheere chalo  evoking laughter from team-mates in the midst of the one-day match in Rawalpindi. The crowd was singing Everyone started looking at me  my team-mates and all and they all started laughing. And Balaji, who had a remarkable tour of Australia and Pakistan, admits that his popularity has seeped into his homeland where girls call him up, write letters and press for his autographs. But the lanky seamer admitted that despite his past performance, adulation and popularity, his place in the national team was not secure. There is too much competition. You have to work hard, you have to prove your worth in the team. He still finds it hard to accept his transition from naughty boy to being the star of the neighbourhood, but is enjoying it all after days of wilderness in the early part of his career. Balaji has preserved the bat which split after he had hit Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar for a six in the ODI series. But the importance of that memorabilia goes far beyond that six for Balaji as Sachin Tendulkar and Team India coach John Wright scribbled messages on that broken willow. Tendulkar scribbled  your strokes are awesome. Wright wrote  for Balaji, the Black Bradman. On a former players remark that he was the next Kapil Dev, Balaji said, he (Kapil) achieved his target after working it out for 20 years. Lets see, I am working on my fitness and other things. Balaji is disappointed that he has so far missed out on a five-wicket haul although he came close twice  once each in Australia and Pakistan. My dream was to get a five-wicket haul in Pakistan, and I somehow managed to get four wickets. (PTI)  Copyright

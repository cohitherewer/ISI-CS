The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laloo has eyes on the BCA too 
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Laloo Prasad Yadav isnt just eyeing the gaddi in New Delhi, he has his sights on the (undivided) Bihar Cricket Association (BCA), which goes to polls on May 9. According to The Telegraphs sources, Laloos men have persuaded the Jamshedpur-based Udit Sarkar (a lawyer) to challenge the president, Amitabh Choudhary, a suave Ranchi-located DIG. Laloo, it may be recalled, had staked a claim  by forming a body  to represent Bihar during the closing days of A.C. Muthiahs presidency. In fact, the 2001 AGM of the Board was also attended by one A.N. Sharma, owing allegiance to him. Subsequently, of course, the matter went to court and the Board only recognises the Choudhary-headed BCA. Three years on, Laloo seems to have got back his cricket-appetite. Incidentally, in the last elections (2002), Sarkar was comprehensively beaten by veteran B.N. Singh when he contested for the secretaryship. The BCA, by the way, continues to be registered in Jamshedpur.  Copyright

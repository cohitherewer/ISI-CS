 Leicester players back home
London: Three Leicester City players granted bail by a Spanish judge after being accused of sexual assault arrived back in England on Friday. Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie were granted bail late on Thursday night having spent almost a week in a Spanish jail after three women accused them of sexual assault at a luxury resort. They landed at Luton airport after flying from Alicante. Leicester City manager Micky Adams had already said the players would not be considered for selection for Saturdays Premier League match against Birmingham City. The first thing we will have to do when we do get (them) back is assess them both physically and mentally because it has been a traumatic time for them, as it has been for all of us, Adams said at a media conference on Thursday. Leicester City are second bottom of the Premier League, a point above Leeds United.  Copyright

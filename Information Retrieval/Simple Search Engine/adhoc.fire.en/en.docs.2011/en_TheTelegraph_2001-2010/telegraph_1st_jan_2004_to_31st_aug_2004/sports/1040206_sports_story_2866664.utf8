 Peshawar lacks facilities: PCB 
 - Waqar lashes out at match-fixing allegations Islamabad: Admitting that Peshawar lacks international standard facilities and security arrangements, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan has said that the city is unlikely to host a match during Indias historic tour to Pakistan next month. Khan told reporters on Wednesday that the Arbab Niaz Stadium lacked adequate facilities for the players and given the current security plans, it would be difficult for the PCB to organise important matches. However, Khan added, that the PCB would make a final decision only if the Indian security was satisfied with the arrangements in Peshawar. Meanwhile, as the ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) letters continued to rock the establishment here, former captain Waqar Younis lashed out at the allegations on Thursday and said the teams failure in Morocco and Kenya was purely due to cricketing reasons. Waqar, who was the captain for both the tournaments, said as the skipper he could vouch that the team had not under-performed deliberately. We just did not play well and we lost quite a few close matches. Luck did not favour us. But I know everyone tried hard to win, he said.  Khan said it was a matter of concern and the issue would be looked into. We are in touch with the ICC on many issues and we view this issue seriously. When I get back to the board office tomorrow I will look into it further, he said. Meanwhile, former PCB chief Tauqir Zia sought to defend his stand of not taking any action against some players despite a warning by the ACU that they could have under-performed in a few matches.

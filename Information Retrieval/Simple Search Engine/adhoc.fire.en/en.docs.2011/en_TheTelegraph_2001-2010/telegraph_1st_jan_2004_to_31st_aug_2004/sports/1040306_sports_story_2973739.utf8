The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, March 06, 2004  Algeciras for Sprinters Cup 
 BY HONKY DORY				 										Battle lines have been drawn and the two star events in Saturdays nine event race card  the 1,200m A. V. Thomas Sprinters Cup and the B. K. Rattonsey Stayers Cup over 3,000 metres  are expected to produce sizzling finishes. Rupees one million is at stake for the winner in each of the two prized events. 				 										Packed field in a sprinting event is a routine affair, and with some luck, most of the 15 horses aspiring for the Sprinters Cup could triumph. But the 14-strong field in the Stayers Cup has surprised most. The gruelling trip takes its toll as the fittest horse endowed with stamina are known to survive the journey.				 										Nevertheless, Algeciras may be the horse to beat in the sprint. The Vinayak-trainee, recently in the S. C. Jain Sprinters Trophy, had out-sprinted some of the hot-footed rivals and half-a-dozen of them are again in the line-up seeking revenge. The turn of foot displayed by the Cristofori-Miss Eye Dee Eye five-year-old was amazing after lying in the rear till 300m from home. The challenge to Algeciras may come from Onnu Onnu Onnu who comes from Hyderabad with big reputation.				 										Obligado, Baffert, Radical Force, Glensanda, Adolfito and Smart Supreme appear to be cut above the rest in the Stayers Cup field. However, going by his consistent form over the staying trips and also his weight advantage, by the terms of the race, it is the Cooji Katrak-trained Radical Force who gets the first call over the rest. P. Kamlesh partners the Alnasr Alwasheek-Aroma six-year-old.				 										SELECTIONS				 										1.30 pm: Aesculapius 1. Mayflower 2. Aerosat 3.				 										2 pm: Blue Horizon 1. Romantica 2.

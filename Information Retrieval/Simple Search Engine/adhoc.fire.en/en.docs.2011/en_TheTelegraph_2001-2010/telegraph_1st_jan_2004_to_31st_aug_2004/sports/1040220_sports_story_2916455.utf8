 Scolari: We couldnt turn our dominance into goals
 - Playing one of the favourites for Euro04, I think we did well: Eriksson  Irelands Kenny Cunningham (right) challenges Brazils Ronaldo during their international friendly in Dublin on Wednesday. (Reuters) Faro: England earned a 1-1 away draw against Portugal in Wednesdays friendly encounter and coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was satisfied with the result. Its always difficult playing against Portugal, said Eriksson, whose side had taken the lead at the start of the second half with a scrambled goal from defender Ledley King. They have a lot of pace and skill and with players like Rui Costa, Luis Figo and Simao Sabrosa in one on one situations you have to be really awake. We coped well with everything. We were playing away from home against one of the favourites for Euro 2004 and I think we did very well. Overall, Im rather happy with our performance. Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who led a free scoring Brazil side to World Cup glory in 2002, was clearly frustrated with his new teams failure to make their attacking superiority tell. We couldnt translate our dominance into goals, he said. England have a very good defensive system. We didnt do anything special but we didnt do anything badly either. This game showed us where we are playing well and where we are weak, said Scolari. England captain David Beckham thought his team was on the right track. We are on the right road now to getting things sorted, Beckham had said before the match. The England captain also said he was looking forward to his teams clash with European champions France on June 13 in Lisbon, the opening match of the tournament in Portugal. England are also drawn with Switzerland and Croatia in Group B. In Dublin, Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was pleased with his team even after a goalless draw with Ireland. Although it was 0-0 is was exciting, he said. Both teams denied space to the other. I think we settled much better in the second half. In the first half we lost the ball too early. Ireland coach Brian Kerr was disappointed. We had four or five decent chances, Kerr said. Robbie Keanes was maybe the clearest of all. Stephen Carr had one and so did John OShea.

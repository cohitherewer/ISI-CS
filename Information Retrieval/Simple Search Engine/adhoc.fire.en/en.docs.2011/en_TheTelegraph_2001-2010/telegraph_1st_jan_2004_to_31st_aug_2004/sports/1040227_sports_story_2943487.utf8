The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hayden in doubt for fourth ODI
 Symonds plays spinners well, says Ponting Colombo: Opening batsman Matthew Hayden is in doubt for Australias fourth ODI against Sri Lanka on Friday with a knee injury. The big left-hander aggravated an old injury while fielding in the third game on Wednesday and Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he was in doubt for Fridays match. Hes in a little bit of trouble, Ponting told reporters on Thursday. He was in a bit of discomfort batting, so well have to see how it pulls up. Team physiotherapist Alex Kontouri said Hayden had undergone intensive treatment on Thursday and was more optimistic he would be able to play. If ruled out, he could be replaced by Simon Katich. Ponting, meanwhile, believes allrounder Andrew Symonds is ready to make his Test debut after another professional display in the third one-dayer on Wednesday. Symonds, 28, scored a calm 45 not out to steer Australia to a comfortable five-wicket win, also bowling a useful nine-over spell to complete figures of one for 48. Symonds, yet to be dismissed in the series, was recently included in the Test squad for the first time and Ponting hinted that his prowess against spinners could help clinch a place in the side for the first match in Galle starting on March 8. He is playing beautifully at the moment and it is exciting to think that he could be in the Test line-up, Ponting said. He plays the spinners well and if they bowl a bad ball he is going to hit it. To have someone like him around is really good for the team. Ponting is also delighted with the way his batsmen have played Muttiah Muralidharan in the last two games. Warnes new delivery Meanwhile, Australian leg spinner Shane Warne has been honing a new delivery during his year-long ban and says he will surprise Muralidharan and the rest of the Sri Lankans with it in next months Test series. Hes talked about a lot of different deliveries, but I might have a new one up my sleeve, Warne said. Theres something Ive been working on. I havent shown it in any of the games since I came back. Im saving it for the Test series.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

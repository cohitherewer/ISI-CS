 Gillespie: Tait a rare talent
 Tait is damn quick, feels Gillespie Adelaide: Express fast bowler Shaun Tait, given a contract by Cricket Australia Tuesday, is a rare talent destined to succeed at the highest level, Test bowler Jason Gillespie said. Gillespie said the sheer pace of the 21-year-old South Australian, who represented Australia A this season and joined the recent Australian tour of Sri Lanka as a replacement for injured Brett Lee, gave him a distinct advantage over most of his rivals. He is pretty damn quick, said Gillespie of Tait, one of six changes to Cricket Australias list of 25 contracted players for 2004-05. Not everyone has that, you either can bowl fast or you cant. Thats Taitys big strength at the moment and I suppose the more games he plays the better hell be, or wed like to think so, with accuracy and just experience. But Gillespie stressed that patience was essential because of Taits youth. Its got to be remembered that he has only played a dozen or so first class games, hes very young experience-wise, and in cricket it does play a part to have that experience under your belt, he said. With time and patience hell get there for sure. Gillespie said competition for Australian fast bowling spots was intense. Taity will probably have to wait his turn, but Im sure hell do very well when he gets the opportunity, he said. He bowls fast and he bowls wicket-taking balls  that sort of talent is pretty rare, not just in Australia but around the world.  (AFP)  Copyright

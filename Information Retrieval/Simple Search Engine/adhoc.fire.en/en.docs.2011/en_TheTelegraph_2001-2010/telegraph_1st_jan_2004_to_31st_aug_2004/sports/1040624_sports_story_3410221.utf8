The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Buffon dig at Sweden, Denmark
 - Someone should be ashamed and it isnt us  Swedens Henrik Larsson celebrates after converting a penalty against Denmark in Porto on Tuesday. (Reuters) Guimaraes: Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has questioned the morality of Denmark and Sweden after the 2-2 draw between the two Scandinavian teams eliminated the Azzurri from Euro 2004. All three teams finished on five points, but Sweden and Denmark advanced to the last eight thanks to the number of goals scored in games among the three group C rivals. I cant believe that two nations like Denmark and Sweden who pride themselves on morality could do such a thing under the eyes of the watching world, said 26-year-old Buffon. There has been talk for days about the possibility of a 2-2 draw and now its happened  incredible. What kind of example does this set to the children who come to watch football. Someone should be ashamed and it isnt us. Buffon said he thought Italy had booked their place in the knockout stages when Antonio Cassano scored a last-gasp winner until he turned to share his joy with the fans. I went to celebrate with our supporters, but I could tell by their faces that the result in the other match hadnt gone our way, said the Juventus star, the worlds most expensive goalkeeper. Italy defender Alessandro Nesta said to go out without losing a match was a bitter pill to swallow. Its painful because we have five points and were undefeated, said the AC Milan centre-back, whose clubmate Jon-Dahl Tomasson hit both Denmarks goals against the Swedes. To finish third behind two teams who are inferior to us really hurts. Italys early exit was their third cruel end to a tournament having lost to France to a golden goal in the Euro 2000 final and then going out in controversial fashion to South Korea in the second round of the 2002 World Cup finals. Italy defender Massimo Oddo was equally dumbstruck by another embarrassment for the Azzurri, who were billed as one of the tournament favourites. I cant describe my feelings, said the Lazio right-back. Football can be cruel sometimes and in the last few tournaments weve had more than our fair share of bad luck. Italy striker Bernardo Corradi, however, refused to point the finger of blame at anybody else other than himself and his Azzurri teammates. The Denmark game cost us the most, said the Lazio forward, who started against the Bulgarians because Christian Vieri was not fully fit. We drew 1-1 with Sweden but they gave us a harder game, and on reflection that wasnt a bad result. Where it went wrong was against the Danes. We had so many chances to take three points and we didnt convert them. Striker Marco di Vaio, a second-half substitute for the Italians, agreed with Corradis assessment. The first game was so important and we only managed a point. In the end it came back to haunt us, said the Juventus marksman. We should never have been in this position in the final game in which our fate was in the hands of the other teams in the group. Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni, whose contract is now up and is not expected to be offered an extension, also lamented his teams failure to break down the dogged Danes. When this tournament began I always said the first result was the most important, he said. Several teams have struggled in their opening matches here and we suffered psychologically after our draw with Denmark. The soccer-mad Italians have a habit of finding scapegoats when they are knocked out of major soccer tournaments. Much of the blame for their premature exit from the 2002 World Cup was laid at the door of Ecudorean referee, Byron Moreno, accused of favouring the host nation as Italy went down to a defeat by South Korea. Trapattoni said he did not believe there had been collusion between the Swedes and the Danes. Asked whether he would consult European soccers governing body over the result, Trapattoni said: Absolutely not. Most disappointed Italians fans back at home blamed their own players for the exit. However, former Italian striker Gigi Riva added a cynical note about the Danes and Swedes. They put on a lovely show, he told Italian broadcaster RAI. Every time the Danes scored, they showed great enthusiasm. Then, however, they allowed the Swedes to equalise. They always speak badly of us, but they are worse.  (AFP)  Copyright

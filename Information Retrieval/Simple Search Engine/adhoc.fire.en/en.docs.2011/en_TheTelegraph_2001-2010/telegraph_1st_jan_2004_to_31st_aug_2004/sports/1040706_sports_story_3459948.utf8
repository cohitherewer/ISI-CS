The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greeks land amid mass hysteria 
Athens: Thousands of ecstatic Greeks cheered and waved flags as the plane carrying the team landed at Athens airport on Monday, while huge crowds lined the city streets ahead of homecoming celebrations. Addressing a packed Panathenaic stadium, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis congratulated the team ahead of their arrival. Earlier, thousands of fans who had gathered at the airport cheered as the aeroplane carrying the team touched down, while fire engines squirted water in arches over it in a sign of celebratory welcome. The national anthem rang out as the plane taxied in and the players emerged, led by captain Theodoros Zagorakis holding the trophy and German coach Otto Rehhagel, in an event televised live across the nation.

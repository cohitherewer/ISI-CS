 Lara stresses on taking lead
 Brian Lara Kingston: The West Indies captain Brian Lara has said his team needs to prepare better if it hopes to regain its former position as one of Test crickets elite teams. The 35-year-old expressed concern that his side continued to play its best cricket too late in the series after their second Test win over Bangladesh on Monday (as reported in Tuesdays City edition). Great teams take the lead. We are not a great team as yet and are far from it, Lara admitted. We allow the opposition to sort of steer the series in the direction they want and when we get familiar with the opposition, then we take action. Laras record since his Second Coming as captain has been disappointing and his team has yet to perform well early in a rubber. In his first series on return, a year ago in the Caribbean, Australia took a winning 3-0 lead before Lara and his men hit back with an historic consolation victory in the final match. That was followed by a 1-0 series win against Sri Lanka, only inspired by a victory in the second and final match after the first was drawn. Since then, there has been a similar success in Zimbabwe, and 0-3 reversals against South Africa and England where the West Indies best moments came after the series were lost. We need to cross a lot of hurdles off the field before we get on the field, Lara said. Things like fitness levels, intensity at training must be very, very hard. I prefer a team thats working very hard at the beginning of the series and sort of letting it ease as the series goes on. Lara said that he hoped his team could learn from other sports where preparation is vital to on-field success. My best friend Dwight Yorke knows for a fact that before a season starts he has to be fully, fully fit to last a season, Lara said. They (soccer players) stress a lot on that. We seem to stress on the fact that we are playing cricket and we are trying to get fit at the same time, Lara said. It cant work. I personally would prefer a fit team, maybe less talented I dont know, but a fit team is definitely a team that is going to make sure that the other areas come together.  (AP)  Copyright

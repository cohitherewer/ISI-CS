 Malik seeks PCB hearing
Rawalpindi: Former Pakistan captain Salim Malik, banned from cricket for life in year 2000 for alleged involvement in match-fixing, wants a chance to clear his name. The Qayyum commission recommended life bans for Malik and Pakistan pace bowler Ata-ur-Rehman and fined five other players for not cooperating with the inquiry. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later lifted Rehmans ban after they were asked by the Lahore High Court to hear the players appeal. I want the PCB to also hear my appeal. They gave Ata a chance, so why not me? Ive not got a chance to give my side of the story, Malik said on Saturday. Malik, who turns 40 this month, was banned by a judicial inquiry commission looking into match-fixing, headed by Lahore High Court judge Malik Mohammed Qayyum. Since then Ive filed several appeals against the ban. My appeal is now pending in the Supreme Court but they are yet to set a date for a hearing, Malik said.  (PTI)  Copyright

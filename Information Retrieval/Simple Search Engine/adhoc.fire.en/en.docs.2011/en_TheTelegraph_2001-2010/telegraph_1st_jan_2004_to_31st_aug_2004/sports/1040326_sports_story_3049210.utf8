The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Juggling acting, fashion amp; tennis
 - I expect to keep playing for a long time: Serena  Serena Williams is trying to make sure she doesnt have fear in her eyes Key Biscayne: Serena Williams is ready to reclaim the womens tennis throne she surrendered during an eight-month lay-off, but will continue to juggle fashion design and acting careers during the quest. The 22-year-old American returns here on Friday at the $6.5 million WTA Masters Series hardcourt event, after having been sidelined by left knee surgery and illness since defeating older sister Venus in last Julys Wimbledon final. I tried to keep my head up and be positive, Serena said on Wednesday. It got a little redundant. But at the end Im here. Thats all that matters. Serena said she comes back with no expectations of quickly winning Grand Slam titles or overtaking world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium, but added she never considered retirement either. I expect to play and keep playing for a long time, Serena said. This is my career. This is my job. I have to work. Once I look at it in that regard, I look at how lucky I am to do something I love. I cant take (other) jobs because I have this job. This is what I do. I have to lay low for a minute and get my game together. There is stuff I definitely could do. But I want to do this. And Serena left no doubt she wants to be the best once again. I left number one, barely hanging on, she said. You always have to be your best. It doesnt matter where you are ranked. If you are striving to be number one, you have to think you are number one. Each match I think Im able to improve. Thats what I want to do, get better with every set and every match I play. Henin-Hardenne and her second-ranked compatriot Kim Clijsters are absent this week, but Serena is content to wait before facing the new number one. Im going to play her soon enough. It doesnt matter who I play. Im going to have to play her eventually, Serena said. I think they are playing really good. Ive never heard that (they have raised the bar to be number one). I havent played either one of them in a while. I cant answer that. Im really focusing on me and making sure I dont have fear in my eyes. Serena said she has room for tennis and acting and fashion design in her life because she spends so much of her life in a hotel room when on the tennis circuit. The majority of my life is spent in my hotel room, she said. The time I spent in my room I could be drawing, making some dresses, reading scripts. Its all about how you use your time. I dont want a lot of down time. I dont have many acting gigs right now. Its all about scheduling. Its actually relaxing to me to be sitting and drawing in my sketchbook. (REUTERS)  Copyright

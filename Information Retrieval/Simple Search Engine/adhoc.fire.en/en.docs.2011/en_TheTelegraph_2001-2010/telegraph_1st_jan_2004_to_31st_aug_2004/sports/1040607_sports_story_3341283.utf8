 Murali may sue Bedi
Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan is contemplating legal action against former India skipper Bishan Singh Bedi for making defamatory remarks against him. Muralidharan, who recently surpassed West Indian paceman Courtney Walshs tally of 519 Test wickets to become the worlds highest wicket-taker, has consulted lawyers on taking action against Bedi for writing offending articles questioning his bowling action. The Sunday Times quoted a lawyer retained by Muralidharan as saying that they were studying the remarks attributed to Bedi in recent times. Muralidharan was recently reported for suspect action and a bio-mechanics team found that the spinners controversial delivery, that spins away from a right-handed batsman, did not conform to the laws of the game. Muralidharan had earlier twice been no-balled by Australian umpires Darell Hair and Ross Emerson and was later referred to an ICC experts panel which said his mysterious bowling action was due to a congenital deformity. Bedi, however, has maintained that the Sri Lankan should never be allowed to bowl. The former left arm spinner was of the opinion that Muralidharans action was basically faulty.  (PTI)  Copyright

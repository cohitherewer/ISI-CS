 10-man Real battle to 2-1 win
Madrid: Ten-man Real Madrid got their Spanish League title bid back on track after goals from Santiago Solari and Ivan Helguera gave them a battling 2-1 win against Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Real, who have five games left, lead the table on 70 points. Second-placed Valencia, with 69 points, have the advantage on head-to-head meetings and can return to the top if they get at least a draw against Real Sociedad. Former Atletico midfielder Solari put Real ahead in the fifth minute, but Veljko Paunovic equalised with a penalty early in the second half after substitute Demis Nikolaidis was brought down by Francisco Pavon. The centre-back was sent off for this. But Atletico failed to make the most of their numerical advantage with Helguera heading in off a corner 13 minutes from time.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal 9 points clear 
London, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Arsenal went nine points clear at the top of the Premier League on Saturday after beating Charlton Athletic 2-1, while title rivals Manchester United were held to a 1-1 draw by Fulham. Big-spending Chelsea snatched a barely deserved 1-0 win at Manchester City to go second, edging ahead of champions United on goal difference. Saturdays results could prove to be the turning point in the Premier League season as they left Arsenal on 67 points and Chelsea and United on 58 with just 11 games left to play. Away from the title race, Everton beat Aston Villa 2-0, Blackburn Rovers drew 1-1 with Southampton and the relegation dogfight between Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers finished goalless. Robert Pires, scoring his 50th goal for the club and teammate Thierry Henry had Charlton on the ropes, though the visitors rallied in the second half through Claus Jensen .  Copyright

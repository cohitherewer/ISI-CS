 Rajinder defends IHF policy
New Delhi: Chief coach Rajinder Singh defended the controversial experimentation with the national hockey team on Monday, just a few months before the Olympics saying it has broadened the pool of players, who can represent the country in major competitions. Rajinder is in charge of an 18-member experimental team  consisting of 13 members of the Junior Asia Cup winning side  that will leave for Japan on Tuesday to play in a four-nation meet. It will be a big test for the youngsters. We may pick three to four players from the team for the Olympics. And for others it would be a huge experience and will come in handy in the Junior World Cup, Rajinder said here at the National Stadium where the team is training. We are grooming them for the future and these experimentations will broaden our players pool. He said not much should be read into Indias performance while the team continues its experimentation. Not much emphasis should be given on win or loss while we continue the experimentation. They are secondary. Our main focus is on preparing a winning combination, he said. We must give youngsters more chance by making them play such tournaments. They should play at the highest level against tough opponents. It will be a test of their strength, mental toughness and attitude. Talking on drag-flicker Sandeep Singh, whom many are seeing as a replacement for Jugraj Singh, Rajinder said his performance would be assessed in the Japan meet. One should not be picked in the team just because he is a good drag-flicker. What if we dont earn a single penalty corner in a match. We need players who can contribute to the team in different ways. We will take into consideration various aspects of a player while selecting him. Sandeep is no doubt a fine player and he proved it in the Junior Asia Cup emerging as the leading goal-scorer. We will see his performance in Japan before taking a decision on him. Rajinder declined to comment Dhanraj Pillay would be asked to join the camp at Barog. Captain Ignace Tirkey, one of the senior players in the team, said that prospect of playing in the Olympics would spur his boys to do well in the competition. We are confident against China and Japan. But Korea is a tough side. said the mid-fielder, who turned 24 on this day. He said there is a thin line of difference between senior and junior players with both matching in skill and fitness. Maturity is the obvious difference. If one dodges them or tackles them, that may affect their confidence. But that may not happen with the seniors, said the 117-match veteran, who started playing internationals in 2000. Sandeep Singh said he was ready to grab the opportunity with both hands. I would not be missing the chance to prove my mettle at the highest level. Meanwhile, An 18-member developmental womens hockey side would be looking to get some valuable exposure as they face the regions top sides including Asian Games gold medallists China in the four-nation hockey tournament, starting in Gifu, Japan Thursday. The team, comprising of several rookies, is not expected to do wonders in the competition, but coach Rajinder Singh, namesake of mens team coach, was confident that it would at least do a world of good to the confidence of the players, most of whom would be making their debut at the international level.

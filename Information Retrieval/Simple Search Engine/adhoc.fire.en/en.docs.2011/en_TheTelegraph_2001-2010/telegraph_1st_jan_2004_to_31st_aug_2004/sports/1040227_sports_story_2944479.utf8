The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 The job has just begun 
FREE-KICK - P.K. BANERJEEFederation has to cash in on EB success																								Are we suddenly seeing something different in Indian football? A few bright patches out of the blue after years in darkness? To put things in perspective, let us admit that the hint was there, ever since India beat UAE in a World Cup qualifier in 2001.																								The recent success of East Bengal, Mahindra United and Indias win over Singapore are following a trend which was set on that momentous afternoon in Bangalore where Jules Alebrtos goal gave India a memorable win over the 1990 World Cuppers. UAE, mind you, were a cut above the teams we are playing now.																								There have been lows in between, like the SAFF Cup letdown in Dhaka last year. But by and large, encouraging signs are visible. No doubt, East Bengal deserve the lions share of the credit for making people realise that at least an effort is being made by an Indian club to look beyond the local confines.																								Make no mistake here. East Bengal have tasted success at the international level, albeit not at the highest tier of Asian football, because they are getting to play in that circuit more frequently. Sure, they have shown that they have the will to succeed and prepared to work hard in order to achieve something they think is possible.																								What I am trying to emphasise here is exposure has been the key behind these recent wins. Its simple. You dont win international games if you dont play them. Go and play the better teams. In all likelihood, you will lose initially. But dont bother about the margin of defeat and see what positives you have got and work on them. No one can stop you if you learn from mistakes, persevere and really want to do well.																								Thats why I say the recent victories of our club sides against teams representing other countries ranked higher than India have followed a trend and didnt land as a manna from heaven. Over the last five years, Indians have played more against foreign teams. They have seen that the difference between teams in South East Asia isnt that big and chased a dream they believed would materialise.																								Though we are talking about a team game, there are individuals who can often make a telling difference. In the Indian context, Bhaichung Bhutia has to be applauded for making such a huge impact on the mindset of the average Indian footballer. He had a low-key three-year stint in the third tier of the English league, but returned with an attitude that is inspiring many.																								Belief is the key in every adventure human beings undertake and Bhutia will remain a pioneer in Indian football for instilling this in his peers at a time of deep despair. His footballing prowess may not be the best India have produced, but his determination and courage to challenge the unknown is exemplary. Well done, boy, keep it up.																								The contribution of another individual is also worth a mention and this is Subhas Bhowmick. The East Bengal coach took a lot of care in organising his resources and a lot of thought went into the combination he formed. He too believed Indians can do it, at least up to a level, and showed the guts to overpower the so called superior. East Bengal club should also be praised for standing by the coach and generating the funds required.																								Now, starting something and maintaining it are two different tasks, where the latter is far more difficult. We have taken a small step towards reclaiming our crown in Asia. The job has just begun and the old proverb rings true here that we have miles to go. We all know that retaining a position is tougher than capturing it and there is no point in getting carried away with what we have achieved.																								The federations job becomes significant here. They have to make hay when the sun shines. They have to use this success properly, market it and gain more media attention. They need to put on their thinking caps, chalk out a plan and follow it. These are the things they didnt do in the past. It will be a costly error if they dont make most of this chance.																								Secondly, a look at the composition of the teams doing well reveal the presence of a number of players from the Tata Football Academy. Just imagine, if one academy can produce so many players who do well against foreign opponents, what will happen if we have a few more similar breeding grounds? This is another point to be taken seriously. Make no mistake, our administrators cant afford to relax now because this is the time to make the transition from feel good to feel better.

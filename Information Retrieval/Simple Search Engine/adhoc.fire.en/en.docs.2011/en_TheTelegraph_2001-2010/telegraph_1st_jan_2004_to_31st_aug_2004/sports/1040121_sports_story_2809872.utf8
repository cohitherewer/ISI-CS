The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venus, Kim off to flying start
 - Philippoussis tames Johansson - Coria, Rusedski knocked out  Kim Clijsters on  her way to beating Marlene Weingartner 6-3, 6-2. (AFP) Melbourne: Venus Williams made a triumphant return to tennis at the Australian Open on Tuesday but the maelstrom of misery which has engulfed Briton Greg Rusedski continued. The ankle injury that threatened to force second seed Kim Clijsters out of the opening Grand Slam of the year came through the test with flying colours in the night session. All she had to overcome was a little rustiness to advance 6-3, 6-2 over Marlene Weingaertner. I didnt really have any problems with the ankle and thats the most important thing, she said. For a couple of days I didnt even think I was going to be coming here as a player. So I am very pleased with the way I went out there. While Clijsters was clearly relieved, third seed Williams was all smiles at Melbourne Park. Despite not having played a tournament since losing the Wimbledon final to sister Serena last July, the former world No. 1 looked as sharp as ever as she thumped fellow-American Ashley Harkleroad 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. Oh, yes, Im back now, she giggled, before saying she was missing the absent Serena, who had beaten her in the final here last year. Its not the same without her, she smiled, we are like bread and butter. British No. 2 Rusedski had hoped to let his tennis finally do the talking after his positive test for the banned steroid nandrolone hogged all the headlines in the past two weeks. However, a lacklustre performance against 26th seed Albert Costa saw him eliminated 4-6, 3-6, 4-6. The Canada-born left-hander blamed his performance on illness. It was difficult because Saturday I had a fever and have had gastroenteritis, he said. Thats what made it difficult today, to be honest with you I had a heavy fever, it wasnt the ideal preparation. Rusedski, who admitted earlier this month that he had tested positive for nandrolone at a tournament in Indianapolis last July, says he will be cleared of any wrongdoing at a hearing in February. He insisted his off-court troubles had not affected him. No, it had nothing to do with today. Ive just got to wait and see how my tribunal goes, just go from there. Wimbledon champion Roger Federer put his shaky early-season form behind him with a tidy performance against up-and-coming American Alex Bogomolov. The Swiss second seed had looked far from convincing during the Kooyong International last week, losing to Andre Agassi and struggling against Thomas Johansson. On Tuesday, everything clicked as he romped home 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. Federer has yet to progress past the fourth round of the Australian Open in four previous visits to Melbourne. This time round the stylish Swiss is the bookmakers favourite. Straight sets in the first round is a good start, he said. World No. 5 Guillermo Coria slipped up 6-7, 2-6, 4-6 to Frenchman Cyril Saulnier. The Argentine had pulled out of last weeks Auckland Open with an abdominal strain. He was later cleared to play in Melbourne but was far from his best against the world No. 76. I had a great result at Wimbledon when I beat Xavier Malisse, but today is something else, said Saulnier. Days like this is why we play. I am like a wine that improves with age. Former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt suffered no problems, though, strolling into Round Two when a freak injury forced Cecil Mamiit to pull out.Hewitt was leading 6-2, 6-4 when Mamiit ran into the umpires chair chasing a drop-shot and hurt his right ankle. He lasted only one more game before calling it quits. Hewitts fellow-Australian Mark Philippoussis thrilled his home crowd with a 7-6, 6-2, 7-6 win over 2002 champion Johansson. Third seed and French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero did not hang about, pounded fellow-Spaniard Albert Montanes 6-0, 6-1, 6-1 for a resounding victory.He was followed through by British 11th seed Tim Henman who ousted Frances Jean-Rene Lisnard 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.

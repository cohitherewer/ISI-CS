				 																																	Sydney: Former world cycling champion Sean Eadie was named in Australias Olympic team on Tuesday, a day after being cleared of drugs trafficking. Eadie was dropped from the team last week when customs officials reported he had been caught importing human growth hormone five years ago.				 																																	But the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found in Eadies favour on Monday following an appeal by the 35-year-old. There has been an infraction notice served against him. Hes had his opportunity to appeal against that and hes been successful, Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) president John Coates told a news conference. He is entitled to be in the team. Ben Kersten, who had been named as Eadies replacement, has now lodged his own appeal over his likely exclusion after Coates said they would not both be included in the final team for the Athens Games. 				 																																	Athens: Less than a month before the start of the Athens Olympics, only seven out of 100 Greeks have bought Games tickets, a nationwide study released by the Games organisers (ATHOC) showed on Monday. Fearful of staging the worlds biggest sporting event in front of empty stadiums, ATHOC recently called on Greeks to snap up unsold tickets for the August 13-29 spectacle. ATHOC denied reports that two-thirds of tickets allocated to national Olympic committees and sponsors have been returned, but the flood of available tickets signalled otherwise. 				 																																	London: American-born 400m runner Malachi Davis was added to Britains Olympic track and field squad on Tuesday. The 26-year-old was granted a British passport just three days before the Olympic trials in Manchester earlier this month. He finished fifth and reached the required qualifying standard for the August 13-29 Athens Games. Davis was initially overlooked for selection after team leader Max Jones said preference was given to British-born runners.				 																																	London: Czech striker Milan Baros, the top scorer at Euro 2004, says he wants to stay at Liverpool and fight for a place in the English clubs starting line-up.				 																																	Baros scored five goals in Portugal but has struggled to establish himself alongside England striker Michael Owen in the Liverpool team since joining the club in December 2001.				 																																	Baros said on Tuesday: I have heard all the rumours about Real Madrid and Barcelona supposedly being interested in me and of course its nice to see clubs like that wanting you. But I am back at Liverpool now ready for a new season and I want to stay here.				 																																	Madrid: French defender Didier Domi has agreed to sign a two-year deal with Espanyol, the Primera Liga club said on Tuesday. The 26-year-old left back, on loan at Leeds United last season, will join the Catalan club on a free transfer from Paris St Germain.				 																																	Espanyol said he would undergo a medical prior to his official presentation later on Tuesday. Domi, who played for Newcastle United between 1998 and 2001, is the third player to join Espanyol since the end of last season.				 																																	London: Chelsea and Olympique Marseille have agreed terms for the transfer of Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, the Premier League club said on its website on Monday.Financial details were not disclosed but British media put the figure involved around  24 million, a club record fee.

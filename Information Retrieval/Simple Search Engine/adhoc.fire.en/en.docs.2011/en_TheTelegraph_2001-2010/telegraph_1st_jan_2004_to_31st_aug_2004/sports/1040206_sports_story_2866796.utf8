 Swati earns final WGM norm
 Gibraltar: Swati Ghate received her third and  final WGM norm after defeating Enrique Osuna Vega of Spain  in the ninth and penultimate round of the Gibraltar chess  meet.  Swati made her first norm in the Czech Open in Pardubidce  in 2002 and second at the British championship last year.  Incidentally, when ratified, she will be the third Indian  woman to become a WGM in less than three weeks  the others  being Dronavalli Harika and S. Meenakshi.  Surya Sekhar Ganguly joined top seed GM Nigel Short  of England at the top of the table with a crushing victory  over GM Jonathan Rowson of Scotland. Both are on seven points,  followed by P. Harikrishna and second seed GM Alexei Dreev  of Russia, both on 6.5.  Harikrishna managed to hold Dreev with ease, while  Tejas Bakre kept his final GM-norm hopes alive after settling  for a draw with GM Alexey Kuzmin of Russia.  Kunte and Sandipan played out draws with Scot Paul  Motwani and Englishman Peter Wells respectively, while Dibyendu  Barua drew with Serbian Bojan Vuckovic.  (PTI)  Copyright

 One job done, Bhowmick eyes bigger targets

 2003-04: East BengalCalcutta: It is remarkable how Subhas Bhowmick keeps his emotions in check. East Bengal had just emerged champions of the National Football League, done it thrice (equalling Mohun Bagan), and become the first team to win back-to-back. Emotions were running like saliva ahead of a steak well done. And their coach was cool as a cucumber. We are professionals, he said after his team beat Indian Bank 3-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium Wednesday. Our work never stops. We go from one target, one goal, to another. Now we look at the AFC Cup, and at more, bigger targets. We keep preparing, we make sure we dont lose our last two matches of the NFL Quite like the show must go on philosophy. Its a constant process, he explained, and, in between, one realised why coach Bhowmick threw a fit, and a leg, when a fan with a cardboard cut-out of a torch (the clubs symbol) ran in and presented his trophy to Bhaichung Bhutia during the break. The intruder was shoved out, even after Bhaichung looked only too willing to accept. It is a matter of focussing your mind, of looking at your target and target only. Such interference can spoil everything, said Bhowmick later. A coachs mind is occupied with so many things, so are players, and we had a job to complete. There was a good deal of tension. It surely has been a tense stint at East Bengal for Bhowmick. There was a time when his job seemed to be on the line. And then came the turnaround. I consider the December 31, 2003 match vs Mahindra United in Mumbai (which the red-golds won 1-0) the turning point for the team in this league. That was the day we came back into life, and we havent looked back, he said. I am happy, but its just another tournament win. I look forward to the May 5 match (AFC Cups home match versus Geylang United of Singapore, having won the away tie 3-2). That will be a very tough encounter and I believe we will prove the strength of the belief in the red-gold jersey. Unaware of the red-gold smear on this shirt, or maybe proud of it, he spoke expansively, talked about how he was desperate to win his first National League title last year, of how it became almost an obsession and I really pushed the players, and then how the players settled down and this unit finally understood what I wanted. It was a quiet assertion of Subhas Bhowmicks worth. Indian Bank coach V.P. Sathyan, as quiet as he has been even during his playing days, accepted he was outplayed. I had said even in the sixth round that this East Bengal team will win the league, he said. It was an honest assessment of ones strength. They have the experience, they have Asian and national level players, and of course, class. Yet, as a coach, Id say Bhowmick possibly was under more stress. He has the best bench strength in the country, and he cannot afford to slip up. I have the minimum, I was always on the low stress side. He did not think too highly of the Meghalayan referee Banari Nungram, but in his own way, he said: Maybe the federation should allot more experienced referees for key matches. A small mention for an official who could easily have turned the days proceedings into chaos. Finally, it was a quiet departure for Sathyan. I just hope my players dont get too demoralised from this. I hope we are able to learn from this and move on, he said, accepting relegation.  Copyright

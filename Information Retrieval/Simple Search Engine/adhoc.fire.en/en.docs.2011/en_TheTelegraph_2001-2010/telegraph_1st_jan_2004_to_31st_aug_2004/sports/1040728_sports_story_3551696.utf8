 Ex-girlfriend says Odumbe is guilty
Nairobi: Former Kenyan cricket captain Maurice Odumbe received money from an Indian bookmaker five years ago, his former girlfriend told an International Cricket Council (ICC) investigation board. Caitlan Patterson, a Canadian who lived with Odumbe for two years, said Odumbe travelled to Zimbabwe in December 1999, and told her he needed to make quick money by match fixing. Patterson said Odumbe returned to Kenya with $5,000. The revelations came during a hearing after the ICC ordered an inquiry in March, alleging Odumbe violated the games Code of Conduct by having inappropriate contact with a known bookmaker, and received money, benefit, or reward from that bookmaker. Under the Code of Conduct, players face penalties ranging from a suspension for a minimum of two years to a life ban.  (AP)  Copyright

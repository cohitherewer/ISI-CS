Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Five meet records stumbled on the penultimate day of the state age-group aquatic championships at the Subhas Sarobar swimming pool on Tuesday. And Avirup Dutt Mazumder, already in the news, created two more records  one in heat of the boys 100 m freestyle group I, while the other at the fag end of the day in final of the 400 m freestyle group I event. Sarajit Naskar, Esha Chakraborty and Shalini Banerjee also entered the record books by erasing the old marks in their respective events on this day. Sarajit Naskar of South 24 Parganas was the first to rewrite the 1500 m boys freestyle record in his own name when he clocked 20:03.30 seconds in group II to break the old record of 20:37.54 seconds of Hooghly boy Somnath Addya in 2003. Papan Sauttya of Midnapore finished second, but also bettered the old meet record at 20:15.38 seconds. Esha, in her turn rewrote another record in her name when she swam the girls 200 m breaststroke group I event in 03:01.04 seconds. Esha broke the three-year old record of 03:03.38 seconds set by Putul Nandy (N 24 Parganas). The third record of the day was created by Shalini Banerjee in the 50 m butterfly group II, when she wiped out Debolina Rajaks old record of 34.64 seconds by clocking 34.16 seconds. Piali Adak, who finished second in this event also bettered Debolinas two-year old mark. She timed 34.24 seconds. The other two records went against Avirups name. In his first appearance of the day, Avirup clocked 02:07.21 seconds in the 50 m group I freestyle heat, rewriting Alkbar Ali Mirs 02:07.81 seconds set in 1999. Avirup also finished the day in style, when he got down to business in the second-last boys event of the day  400 m freestyle. Avirups timing was far ahead of his compatriot Saibal Banerjee. Avirup touched the pad in 04:31.36 seconds while the second man did the same in 04:47.16 seconds. In this category, Avirup again erased a five-year old record set by Akbar ali Mir. Mirs timing was 04:37.28 seconds. Avirup took her gold medal tally to four. Though quite silently, Tagari Baidya of South 24 Parganas added one more gold to her tally of two on Monday.

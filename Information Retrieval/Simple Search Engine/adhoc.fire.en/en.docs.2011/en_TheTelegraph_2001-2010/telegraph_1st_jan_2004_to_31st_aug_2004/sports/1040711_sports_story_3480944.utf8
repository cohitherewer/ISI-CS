The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Abandoned tie gets official status
London, July 10 (PTI): The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday said the last league match of the NatWest series between New Zealand and West Indies, which was abandoned due to rain on Thursday, will get official status as the toss had taken place. As the team sheets were exchanged and the toss took place at Hampshires Rose Bowl on Thursday, this match will count towards official records, ICC said in a statement here on Saturday. Owing to inconsistencies in interpretation of cricketing laws, ICCs cricket committee, at its meeting in Dubai in May 2004, had recommended that all future Tests and ODIs that are abandoned without a ball being bowled shall be included in the records, provided the toss has taken place. A recent decision of the ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC) to approve the recommendation means that last Thursdays abandoned fixture between New Zealand and West Indies will be included in official one-day International records, the statement said. The cricket committee is chaired by former Indian opener Sunil Gavaskar and comprises former international cricketers, half of whom are nominated directly by current international players. It is empowered to make recommendations on a range of cricketing issues.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand on top with Kramnik
	 - AMBER CHESS  Anand split points with Bareev Monaco: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand split points with Russian Evgeny Bareev and remained in joint lead along with Vlaidmir Kramnik of Russia at the end of the fifth round of Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament in Monaco on Friday. The two leaders have 6.5 points each out of a possible 10 and are closely followed by Evegny Bareev of Russia and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine. Both have collected six points. The fifth place is jointly held by Russians Peter Svidler, Alexander Morozevich and Hungarian Peter Leko. All of them are another half a point adrift. The rest day proved miserable for the leaders as they failed to muster full points from the days matches last night. In the blindfold, Anand was up against the Rubenstein French by Bareev who is an exponent of the system. Bareev appeared well-armed and gave little chances to Anand, who failed to do much in the middle game. The truce was signed in just 25 moves. The return game was more exciting with Bareev looking hopeful with white. The English attack witnessed a bit of a seesaw battle and experts felt that Anand could have done a bit better in the middle game. Nevertheless, the Russian had sufficient counter-play with his double bishops and slowly neutralised the initiative to get another half point after 55 moves. Kramnik drew both the games against his bete-noire Alexei Shirov of Spain. The first game was a closed Ruy Lopez where the former played white. Kramnik had an advantage to boast of with his pieces spitting fire in the middle game but Shirov equalised with imaginative piece play and draw was agreed to in 30 moves. The rapid game was none-too-eventful with Kramnik up against the Rossolimo Sicilian with black pieces. Shirov could not claim any worthwhile advantage and after routine play the peace was signed in 40 moves. (PTI)  Copyright

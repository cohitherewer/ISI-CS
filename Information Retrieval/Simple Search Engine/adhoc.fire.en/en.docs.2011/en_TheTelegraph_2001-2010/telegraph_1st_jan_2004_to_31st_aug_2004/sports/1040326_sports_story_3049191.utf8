 Murali-Warne battle hots up
 - FINAL TEST - Atapattu century boosts Sri Lanka after Australias 401  Brad Williams dives across the pitch in a bid to stop the ball in Colombo on Thursday. (Reuters) Colombo: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan edged closer to Courtney Walshs world record of 519 wickets after finishing with five scalps on the second day of the third and final Test against Australia here on Thursday. While Muralidharan took his tally to 510 as he dismissed Darren Lehmann, Shane Warne failed to add to his haul of 511 despite bowling 18 overs on a turning pitch. Maravan Atapattu scored his 12th Test century as Sri Lanka, 0-2 down in the series, responded positively to end the day on 239 for two in reply to Australias 401 all out. Openers Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya made a brisk start to score 134 for the opening wicket, their first century stand for two-and-a-half years, before Jayasuriya skied a catch off part-time spinner Lehmann to be dismissed for 71. Atapattu added 41 with Kumar Sangakkara (22), before Lehmann broke through again courtesy of a dubious caught behind decision from umpire Steve Bucknor, and then the century-maker piled up an unbeaten third-wicket partnership of 64 with Jayawardene. Atapattu said: It is always special to get a hundred against the best side in the world. I was not having a very good series and I am happy that it came right in this Test match. Earlier, Australia, who started the day on 314 for six, added 87 in the morning session before Lehmann (153) became Muralidharans fifth and final victim of the innings. Lehmanns second century of the series, and the fifth of his 18-Test career, included 14 fours and two sixes. Muralidharan took his series haul to 25 wickets as he claimed five for 123 in 37.1 overs. Sri Lankan openers launched a stunning assault against the new ball, bringing up 50 in just 45 balls before settling into a more sedate scoring pace after the introduction of Warne. Jayasuriya was brutal, smashing nine fours and one six in his 78-ball knock, while Atapattu returned to form with some classical strokes to reach his hundred.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

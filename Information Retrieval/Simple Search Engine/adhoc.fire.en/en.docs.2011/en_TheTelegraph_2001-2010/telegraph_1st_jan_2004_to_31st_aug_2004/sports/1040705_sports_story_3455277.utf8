				 																																	Dhaka: Bangladeshs first womens wrestling competition due to have taken place on Sunday was cancelled after threats from Islamic groups, an official said, adding the decision was a triumph for fundamentalism.				 																																	Tabiur Rahman, general secretary of the Bangladesh Amateur Wrestling Federation, said his organisation took the decision to cancel the competition late on Saturday. The administration of the federation decided to cancel due to the threats; this is a triumph for fundamentalism in our country, Rahman said.				 																																	More than 40 women wrestlers gathered outside the venue in the capital Dhaka early on Sunday unaware that the event had been cancelled.				 																																	The Islamic group Jamiatul Ulama Islami Bangladesh had earlier said it was even ready to sacrifice life to stop the event from going ahead, and marched in protest through the streets of Dhaka. Rahman added that it was hoped the competition could be re-arranged within a month.				 																																	Arequipa (Peru): Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has issued a warning to his players ahead of the Copa America: no coca tea.				 																																	The World Cup champions play their first round games of the South American championship in the thin air of this southern Peruvian city at 2,390m (8,000ft). But Parreira has asked his players to avoid the common liquid remedy used by many travellers to alleviate the effects of altitude change.				 																																	We dont want any problems, he told the Lima-based sports daily Libero. Were very familiar with the medical benefits of coca tea, but were not including it in our diet.				 																																	Herbal teas brewed with coca leaves  the base ingredient in cocaine  are popular in Andean countries. But several South American players in recent months have failed drug tests after drinking the tea.				 																																	Berlin: German football association (DFB) President Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder could lose his job when the DFB executive hold an extraordinary meeting on Monday following the national teams dismal performance at Euro 2004.Mayer-Vorfelder has been heavily criticised for his handling of the search to replace coach Rudi Voeller, who quit after Germanys first-round exit from the tournament in Portugal.				 																																	German media have reported members of the board want DFB treasurer Theo Zwangziger to replace Mayer-Vorfelder as president. The 71-year-old may be asked to either resign at the meeting in Frankfurt or agree not to run for re-election in October, according to Germanys sport news agency SID.				 																																	Mayer-Vorfelder has said he has no intention of bowing out and Fifa president Sepp Blatter expressed fears that it was not the right time for changes in the DFB as Germany prepares to host the 2006 World Cup.				 																																	Baku: Azerbaijan, a former Soviet republic better known for its oilfields, is mounting a bid to host the prestigious Formula One motor racing circuit, the countrys sports ministry was quoted as saying.				 																																	I think that it is a matter of time before Formula One comes to Azerbaijan, Ragif Abbassov, spokesman for the ministry of youth, sport and tourism, told the Ekho newspaper on Saturday.				 																																	Hosting a Formula One race in Azerbaijan would be a coup for the countrys sports-mad president Ilham Aliyev, who used to head Azerbaijans National Olympic Committee.				 																																	Azerbaijan as yet has no motor-racing circuit, but according to Ekho, there are plans to build a track on the shore of the Caspian Sea.				 																																	Sonkajaervi (Finland): With his friend Inga Klauso, 19, riding upside-down on his back, Madis Uusorg, 20, crossed the finishing line here after just 1:5.03 seconds, securing an Estonian gold in the 2004 wife-carrying world championships. The whimsical event was held this weekend for the 13th time, and despite the name of the contest, there is no need to be married to compete. This was originally a domestic Finnish competition.

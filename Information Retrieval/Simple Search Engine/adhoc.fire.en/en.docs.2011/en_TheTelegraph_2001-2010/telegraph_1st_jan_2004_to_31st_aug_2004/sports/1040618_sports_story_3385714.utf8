 Unethical act: Miandad
Javed MiandadIslamabad: Javed Miandad on Thursday lashed out at the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), saying it was unethical to sack him as the national coach since he had already agreed to step down. Miandad, who was replaced with Bob Woolmer on Wednesday, said he had decided to quit after the PCB refused to grant him powers relating to team selection. I had told them clearly to give me more authority and power. I had asked for a team of my choice. They said this was difficult so I told them to go ahead and do what is best for Pakistan cricket, the 47-year-old former captain said. I felt if I was not getting what I want to make the team improve its performance, it was futile to carry on. But we reached a mutual understanding that PCB will honour my remaining contractual terms and conditions and I will step down, he was quoted as saying in The News on Thursday. Miandad, who has been sacked not for the first time, said it was unethical to announce Woolmers appointment and my sacking in one breath. It is unfair that you have one person under contract and bargain with another for the same post. They should have taken me into confidence and announced Woolmers appointment after two or three days. Had he known the board was going to sack him, he would have announced his stepping down himself, he said. Miandad said the PCB would regret its decision as had happened in the past. In the past also they have taken such decisions and regretted it. In the past also they brought me back. My only grouse is if they are going to treat their own people like this, where are we supposed to go? How can anyone question my commitment and credentials even after all these years? Miandad said. Only time will tell if Woolmer can improve the performances and if the board has taken a wise decision. Woolmer would not be successful if he is not given complete authority, he said.

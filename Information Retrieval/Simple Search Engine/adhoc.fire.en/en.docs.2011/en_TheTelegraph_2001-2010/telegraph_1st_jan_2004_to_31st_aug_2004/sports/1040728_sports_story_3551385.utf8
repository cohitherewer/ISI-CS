The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Educational tour for EB
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Bhaichung Bhutia, Douglas da Silva and Alvito DCunha take a break during practice at the club ground on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was cautious Tuesday about the teams prospects in the invitational tour in England. A squad of 20 reaches Leicester on Thursday, practises the day after and plays the two following days. Looking ahead, Bhowmick termed the trip as educational and stressed that the main objective of the team remained the AFC Cup fixture of September 17. We had little time to prepare for this, the players came in late, and then we had to play five league matches in between, explained the coach who just the other day had said that this trip was one of his main objectives this season. He talked about jet lag of travelling from Calcutta to the UK, which generally needs 72 hours to get over, and he talked about how difficult it will be to adjust to the weather. The tournament, if it can be called one, is very tight. East Bengal play Leicester City and Real Mallorca play Maritimo (of Portugal) on July 31. The winners play winners and losers play losers the day after. Bhaichung, meanwhile, is expected to leave for Cyprus immediately after the trip, for a test. THE SQUAD Sangram Mukherjee, (captain), Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Chandan Das, Sasthi Duley, Douglas da Silva, Climax Lawrence, Sujoy Dutta, Selwyn Fernandez, Dipankar Roy, Alvito DCunha, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Bijen Singh, Louis Aniweta, Syed Rahim Nabi, Madhab Das, Syed Hossain, Dipak Mondal, Bhaichung Bhutia, Tushar Rakshit, Sandip Das.

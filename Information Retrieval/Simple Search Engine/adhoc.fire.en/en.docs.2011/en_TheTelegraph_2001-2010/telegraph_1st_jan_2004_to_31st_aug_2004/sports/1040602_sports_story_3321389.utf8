				 																																	Madrid: Coach Rafa Benitez has rescinded his contract with Valencia, the Primera Liga champions said on Tuesday. Its official. Rafa Benitez has rescinded his contract with Valencia, club spokesman Manuel Mas said.				 																																	Benitezs representative Manuel Garcia Quilon rejected Valencias offer of a four-year contract extension and said the 44-year-old coach has decided not to stay for the remaining season on his current deal.				 																																	Spanish media reported that Benitez had been offered a five-year deal by Premier League club Liverpool, who sacked French coach Gerard Houllier last month after six years at the helm.				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munich have responded to Oliver Kahns hint that he might leave the club by saying that their goalkeeper and captain had a contract until 2006.				 																																	If Kahn has a problem, he should talk to us, not to the press, Bayern executive manager Uli Hoeness said.				 																																	Kahn said in an interview on Monday that he might consider a move abroad.				 																																	He (Kahn) should take a look at his contract, Hoeness told Tuesdays issue of soccer magazine Kicker.				 																																	It runs until 2006.				 																																	London: Nigeria retained the Unity Cup following a 2-0 win against Jamaica at The Valley here on Monday, goals from John Utaka and Bartholomew Ogbeche giving the Super Eagles victory at Premiership side Charltons home ground.				 																																	Jamaica face Ireland in the final match of the competition on Wednesday.				 																																	Utaka capitalised on a mistake in the Jamaica defence to put Nigeria ahead after 18 minutes before Ogbeche, who netted twice against Ireland, scored his teams second 10 minutes after half-time. 				 																																	Hengelo: Mozambiques Maria Mutola, the reigning Olympic and world 800m champion, may double up in Athens and also try to win the 1,500m, her agent said on Tuesday.				 																																	She plans to run the 1,500m in the Paris Golden League meeting on July 23 and that will be her only race of the year prior to the Olympics over that distance, her agent said.				 																																	But assuming Maria gets an Olympic qualifier, we will enter for the 1,500. As that race comes after the 800, there is a good chance she will double, added her agent.				 																																	Warsaw: Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery should be free to compete in the Olympic Games as long as drug allegations against them are not proven, IOC president Jacques Rogge said.				 																																	The promoters of two big European athletics meetings said last week that US anti-doping and track and field chiefs should suspend the two American sprinters until doping allegations against them have been settled.				 																																	Rogge said in an interview on Tuesday that he expects the case to be cleared up before the Athens Olympics in August. At the moment, the case of Jones and Montgomery does not exist as far as the IOC is concerned.

 Golf may return
London: Golf could reappear as an Olympic sport at Beijing in 2008 after an absence of more than a hundred years but there are conflicting views as to whether it should feature the games leading professionals. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says the top players would have to take part to merit the sports return, a feeling echoed by the International Golf Federation (IGF), which is keen to reintroduce golf to the Olympics. However, Ernie Els and Tiger Woods are among several leading players who would prefer their sport to be restricted to amateurs only if it returns4. The four major championships represent golfs holy grail, and the leading players believe that anything else, Olympic gold medals included, would rank as second best. (Reuters)  Copyright

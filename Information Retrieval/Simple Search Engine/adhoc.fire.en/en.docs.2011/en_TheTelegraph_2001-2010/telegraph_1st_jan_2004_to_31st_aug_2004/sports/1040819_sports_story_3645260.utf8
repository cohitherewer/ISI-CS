The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Time to live in Anjus hope now 
 - Bahadur Singh fouls all three throws  SUJIT BHAR Athens: Except for Anju Bobby George, nobody even seems to be going in for a medal in the athletics events of the Olympic Games. The basic, a showpiece shot put event, started Wednesday at the historic ancient Olympic venue on Mount Olympia, over 270km from here. Bahadur Singh finished an incredible two steps below last, all three of his throws being foul. Probably that can be swept aside as an aberration, really. But what the so-called Indian potential talks about isnt inspiring either. I hope to reach the final, said high jumper Bobby Aloysius. The qualification marks progress, as let out by the organisers, is 1.79m, 1.83, 1.87, 1.91 and 1.95 for final qualification. That makes me hopeful, because my personal best (in the last Chennai qualifier) was 1.91. Looks like I can tackle the field and make the final, she said as her face fell, watching Bahadurs desperation. The inspiring man isnt an athlete. He is shooter Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. It felt so good, said Bobby, as if we were being lifted. That lifting will take some doing here. I feel good about these Games, said Neelam J. Singh, discus star. I believe anything is possible, and Rathores success has boosted us. If anything, India do not expect to see any colour of discus medal. Bengals Soma Biswas conceded her trip to Ukraine for her heptathlon training was useless. This has become a strange heaven for Indian athletes in training. The food is better, sure, but the training facilities were no good, said Soma. The equipment wasnt upto the mark and even the run up to the jumping pit was faulty and injuries can happen any time. It was a total waste. I should have come here a week earlier, at least, to get into shape. The facilities here are excellent, she added. She, though misses her coach Kuntal Roy, because the IOA decided to bring a heptathlete, but did not bring a coach for her. I have to ring up sir, all the time and ask for advice (JJ) Sobhas coach is helping me, but... Soma, too, believes in aiming to just a final. That, too will be difficult. There are 37 athletes here who have entered above 6000 points, Soma said. No less than 22 are in the 6050 qualifying category. And then there are more... Realistically, a final berth will be good enough. Bengals other entry Saraswati Saha will be arriving only Thursday. Her event is later. And with KM Beenamol probably quitting after the Games, this could be the worst performance of the contingent. Anju notwithstanding. Anju has a very good chance to make the final, but surely there are so many in the 6.9 and over 7m category in the womens long jump in the Olympic field, it gets too crowded and too difficult. Even a hepathlete is doing 6.9m, informed Soma. Probably she will also be in the main long jump field. That makes it all the more difficult. However, Anju has shown enough courage and verve in the past to hit back and she just might. After Rathore, we all live in her hope now.  Copyright

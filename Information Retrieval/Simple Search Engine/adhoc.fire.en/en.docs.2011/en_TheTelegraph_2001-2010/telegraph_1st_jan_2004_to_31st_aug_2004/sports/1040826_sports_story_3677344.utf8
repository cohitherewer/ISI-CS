The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A system Indians would do well to emulate
 - Malaysian badminton in safe hands, despite Athens failure  SUJIT BHAR  Lee Chong Wei, a second-stringer, is the current national champion Athens: Malaysians depended heavily on their badminton prowess to earn a medal or two from the Athens Olympic Games. They were disappointed. Their star pair and class singles players were all ousted way before the medal rounds. Malaysians have earned three medals so far from the Olympic Games. In 1992 in Barcelona, Rashid Sideks brothers Jalani and Razif had won bronze in the doubles. From the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, the Malaysian-Chinese pair of So Beng Kiang and Cheah Son Kit had won doubles silver, while Rashid Sidek had clinched bronze. They had a lot of hope on the current world No. 1 pair of Chinese-Malaysians Choong Tan Fook and Lee Kwan Wah. Somehow, though, they managed to get psyched out in the Olympic arena and following a bye in the first round and a second-round victory, they lost in the quarter finals. In singles, world No. 3 Wong Choong Hann moved to the second round, but lost there to the ultimate champion, Taufeeq Hidayat of Indonesia. According to a senior journalist, the current players, whatever their rankings, should be prepared to be phased out to make way for the new era players. There is a whole second-string and third string-players ready to take over. Badminton has been the mainstay for Malaysians to earn honours from the around the sporting globe. Last years All-England champion was Hafiz Hashim. He hasnt found a place in the national team now. The areas badminton legacy is strong, with players from a powerhouse like Indonesia coming in for tourneys quite often. The Malaysians have kept their Commonwealth Games facilities alive and working through a very ingenuous process that Indians could well emulate. The Bukit Jalil School of Sports is the focal point of all these projects. It is a centrally-funded sports school which draws the top athletic students from all of the countrys 13 states. For a small fee, top coaches from around the world offer training in different disciplines. Badminton, though, remains the centrepiece. One Malaysia NOC official asked how the Indian badminton scenario was shaping up. This correspondent managed not to disgrace himself by talking about how the Indian badminton scenario is actually the fiefdom of a select very few and how the great Prakash Padukone had to hastily step back from that river of filth and corruption. The fact is that, for no more than around Rs 1 lakh (that is an approximation), an Indian shuttlebug can stay and train at the Bukit Jalil School in Kuala Lumpur for six months and get the best from top coaches like Misbun Sidek. Till two years back, national aspirants were being trained by the likes of Indonesian Indra Gunawan and Dane Morten Frost. The Malaysian Open is a meeting point of several international stars and this helps. Each of the 13 states holds a Grand Prix. The grand finale of the Grand Prix is the national championships. One of the second-stringers, 19-year-old Chinese-Malay Lee Chong Wei, is the current national champion. He won the crown ousting several top stars. Others in the limelight are Lee Tsen Seng and Kuan Eng Hong. As is evident from the names, the new stars, though, are mostly Chinese-Malaysians, settlers in Malaysia. They seem to be taking over from the natural domiciles and on that field there is a bit of extra competitive rush. The bottomline is that, for the next Olympic Games the Malaysians are sure to show up with an entirely new team. Something pretty enviable from the Indian perspective, even with the presence of the likes of Padukone, Pullela Gopichand and Vimal Kumar around to help.  Copyright

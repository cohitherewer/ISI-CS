The Telegraph - Calcutta
 There is a strong possibility Paes and Bhupathi will fetch gold 
 - Chance for Sharapova to prove Big W win was no flash in  the pan
Guest Column Naresh Kumar It was heart-warming to see the  colourful send-off of the smartly dressed Indian Olympic  teams on the television. With improving standards, sport  in India is at a high. The government has realised the importance  of sport as an international image builder. Money has been  doled out for training and coaching and rich rewards promised  to the winners. Hopes for medals are soaring.  Most belong to the realms of fantasy. Some are dreams, which  at times come true. And then, of course, there are some  realistic chances. At such high levels, even the greatest  of champions need a measure of luck. So many world champions  in the past have failed to win an Olympic gold! For India the hope of gold in  tennis, in the mens doubles, is possible. Paes and Bhupathi  have all the correct credentials. Ranked No.1 in the world  in 1999 till ballistic egos blew them apart, they are cooing  and billing like young lovers again. Non-stop chest-butts,  high fives and the chemistry of 99, as Paes put it, are  propelling them towards the Olympic slogan Altius, Citius,  Fortius. In one fell swoop they have swept aside the lingering  doubts we harboured about their partnership by winning their  very first preparatory tournament, the Toronto Masters. En route to the final, they beat  three of the worlds top ten teams. It was an amazing performance.  A time warp had taken them back to the halcyon days of 1999.  Even with the most outstanding sportsmen, gold is never  a certainty in the Olympics.		 Both Paes and Bhupathi  are unlikely to be overawed by the occasion or succumb  to Olympic pressuresModern doubles is played at an  unbelievable speed. It requires the highest level of skills  and lightning reflexes. Every angle, every shot, soft dinks,  bullet like volleys or spinning lobs can map out a single  breathtaking point in the twinkling of an eye. One reads  that chance rules all. It certainly rules in mens doubles.  The match can hinge on one misunderstanding or a missed  volley or interception. You have to have nerves of steel  and be brave of heart.  Often the man at the net is in  a dilemma  to intercept or not to intercept the opponents  return. Hesitation is fatal. Here is where instinct rules  and Paes instinct guides him well. I remember his first  Davis Cup doubles at Chandigarh against Japan in 1989 when  he was only 16. As captain, I gave him full freedom and  told him to do exactly what he thought was right. His unpredictable and outrageous  interceptions put a disciplined but superior Japanese team  into disarray and confusion, winning a five hour- 20 minute  marathon 17-15 in the fifth set, after being match points  down. Instinct cannot be taught, either you have it or you  dont. I remember chatting that evening to Ramanathan Krishnan,  the epitome of rigid discipline. He just kept shaking his  head laughing and saying, I cant believe it! Balance is one of the most important  factors in life and in sport. So, a great doubles team must  be well balanced. Bhupathi is like the tanpura in  Indian classical music, unperturbed and strumming the right  notes with his big serve and double-fisted backhand, setting  the stage for Paes marauding net play. His reach, consistency,  great reflexes and fighting spirit make him a perfect partner  for Paes. Having won several Grand Slam titles, both Paes  and Bhupathi are unlikely to be overawed by the occasion  or succumb to Olympic pressures. After reading what I have said  earlier, it seems that I have sent Paes and Bhupathi halfway  up the victory stand. But, when I read the names of the  other teams, I feel nervous. The Bryan brothers of the US,  Black amp; Ullyett of Zimbabwe, Llodra and Santoro of France,  Rodriquez and Etlis of Argentina, Arthurs and Hanley of  Australia (that is, if they dont split up and induct Todd  Woodbridge in place of Hanley) are some of the teams who  are equally good.  All are very tough and seasoned  competitors who will fight to the finish and give absolutely  nothing away. The mens doubles event is like a chequer  board where ultimately destiny will make the final moves. In mens singles, destiny has  partly exposed its hand. Federer, who left a spectacular  vapour trail of 23 winning matches before he hit an air  pocket and lost to Dominic Hrbaty of Slovakia, should be  an odds-on bet for the gold. He has tamed the brute power  of Roddick, who in my view is the best of the rest of the  field.  But injuries now play a major  role in the results of matches, more so in the mens events.  The margins are paper thin, and a niggle in one of the muscles  could well be the difference between defeat and victory. The Williams sisters, Henin Hardenne  amp; Clijsters who would have been strong contenders in  the womens event are all sidelined with injuries. In their absence, the tussle for  gold will be between Sharapova, Capriati, Davenport and  Mauresmo. On recent form, Davenport, a former Wimbledon  champion, seems to have an outstanding chance. For Sharapova,  it will be a testing time. She needs to win to prove that  her Wimbledon win was no flash in the pan. Copyright

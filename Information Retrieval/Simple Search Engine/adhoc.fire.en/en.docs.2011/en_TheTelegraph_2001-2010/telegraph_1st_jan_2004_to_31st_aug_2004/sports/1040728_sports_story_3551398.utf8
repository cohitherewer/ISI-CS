The Telegraph - Calcutta
 600 schools in Fifa-Unicef project 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Fifas initiatives in this part of the world have transcended its basic ideology of promoting the game, and reached the social forum that the sport can address  children. In this, Fifa has Unicef as partner, and sport is being used as a medium to keep children in schools. The project was kicked-off, so to say, recently in 600 schools (nearly 12,000 children) of the Murshidabad and Jalpaiguri districts, and the district administrations have done their bit for the effort. The outcome can be quality from quantity, and it can be education. A Unicef official says the programme will incorporate checks in which 15 days of school attendance will result in a match that the child can take part in. The coaches are from the school. Fifa has donated several kits for this project. The kits comprise everything from balls to goalposts and jerseys and boots et al in between. Unicef has found a perfect ally in this, especially in its effort to promote football among girls and the minority section. It is drawing the kids out, says the officer, as the initial resistance from the parents wither. Two matches were held and more are in the pipeline, and activity is being stepped up around the districts. While the Fifa initiative is to spread the game (a great work in the face of extreme politicking and lethargy on the part of the state and national soccer bodies), the Unicef wants the children to stay in school. Pity, the initiative has been restricted to government schools only, with the majority of the needy toiling in non-formal setups. Possibly, if in the future the process is linked up with Calcutta, a rich resource would be available.This is just a pilot project, and more is in the pipeline, and in more districts.  Copyright

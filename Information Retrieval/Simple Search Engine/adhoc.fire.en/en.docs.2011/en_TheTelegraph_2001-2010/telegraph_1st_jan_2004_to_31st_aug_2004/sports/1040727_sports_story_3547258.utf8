 Giles helps England wrap it up
 Captain Michael Vaughan (right) congratulates MoM Ashley Giles at Lords on Monday London: Spinner Ashley Giles took five wickets as England crushed West Indies by 210 runs in the first Test on Monday, their seventh victory in eight Tests. Giles completed match figures of nine for 210 to help dismiss the touring side for 267 in their second innings, with Shivnarine Chanderpaul left unbeaten on 97 after his second defiant knock of the game. The 31-year-old Giles was delighted to earn a place on the Lords honours board following his Man-of-the-Match performance. Vaughan also claimed his place on the honours board with a century in each innings, only the second England batsman after Graham Gooch to accomplish the feat at the home of cricket. Giles had struck the crucial blow in the morning session when West Indies captain Brian Lara was bowled for 44 by a delivery which spun sharply out of the foot holes, the left-armers 100th Test wicket. Debutant Dwayne Bravo then gave Giles a simple return catch and four balls later seamer Matthew Hoggard tempted Ridley Jacobs to edge one to Graham Thorpe in the slips. Giles had Tino Best and Pedro Collins stumped to complete second-innings figures of five for 81, and with Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff grabbing a wicket each England polished off the tail quickly. Chanderpaul, who made 128 not out in the first innings, farmed the bowling in the latter stages but was left three runs short of emulating Vaughans achievement. West Indies captain Brian Lara said his team should not be too downhearted, referring to England scoring 391 for two on the first day as the crucial part of the match. England beat West Indies 3-0 earlier this year and completed a 3-0 victory over New Zealand on home soil last month. The next Test in the four-match series starts at Edgbaston on Thursday.

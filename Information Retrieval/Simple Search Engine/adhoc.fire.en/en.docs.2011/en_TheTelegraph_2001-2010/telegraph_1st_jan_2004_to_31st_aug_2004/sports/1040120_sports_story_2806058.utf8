The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India look to move atop table
 - Tri-series tie vs Zimbabwe - Yuvraj or Badani may open with Sourav  Badani may get a chance to seal his place Brisbane: Fresh from their victory against Australia, India will take on Zimbabwe in a VB tri-series match Tuesday with the hope of joining the world champions at the top of the table. The Indians will miss the services of an injured Sachin Tendulkar, but Zimbabwe are unlikely to hold any terror for the Indians. In spite of Tendulkars injury, India are unlikely to risk either Virender Sehwag or Ajit Agarkar. Both of them are currently working under physio Andrew Leipus, hoping to be back as soon as possible. It doesnt leave captain Sourav Ganguly with too many choices and he is mulling the option of either Sanjay Bangar or Parthiv Patel in the XI. Indian have 12 points from three outings while Zimbabwe are yet to open their account having lost all three matches by huge margins. Bangar appears withdrawn into his shell after the disaster in Melbourne when he ran his captain out and didnt contribute too much either with the bat or ball. Sourav is also unlikely to disturb the bowling combination which faired creditably against Australia, thus ruling both Murali Kartik and Amit Bhandari out of contention. Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Ashish Nehra will be retained with Anil Kumble doing the spinners job. The opening slot is a bit of a worry for the skipper, though the captain is undecided who will go out with him. I will be opening, but we will have to wait and see who comes out as my partner, Sourav said. Laxmans reluctance to open is well known and it can be either Yuvraj Singh or Hemang Badani. The challenge presents both Yuvraj and Badani an opportunity to show their mettle. Provided he gets the nod, it will be a great opportunity for Badani to build his innings and cement his place in the side. Rohan Gavaskar, who came in as a last-minute replacement for Virender Sehwag against Australia, becomes an automatic choice for Tuesday after a decent showing in the last match. Zimbabwe are relying too heavily on Heath Streak in both departments of the game. But to pose a threat for the Indians, the likes of Stuart Carlisle, Sean Ervine, Grant Flower, and Andy Blignaut have to come good. The Indian team management believes the injury to Tendulkar will not keep him away for long but the timing of his return has been left to the maestro himself. Tendulkar is being given ice treatment and other required attention by Leipus. We dont expect him to be away from middle for long, team manager Shivlal Yadav said. We dont want to risk him and aggravate his injury. The same is true with Sehwag and Agarkar.  Parthiv likely to  figure in the XIKatich for Hayden Simon Katich will replace Australian opening batsman Matthew Hayden for the triangular ODI series encounter against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. Hayden, who scored a century against India in Sundays clash at Brisbane, has been left out of Thursdays match to help him recover from a series of injuries that were a result of wear and tear, Cricket Australia said in a statement on Monday. The selectors believe that this short lay-off should help Matthew (Hayden) as he prepares for the rest of the VB series and all other cricket that lies ahead, Trevor Hohns, chairman of national selection panel, said. It gives him the chance to heal a range of minor injuries that he has endured, including knee soreness which is a common problem among top-order batsmen, Hohns said. Hayden would remain in Brisbane before rejoining the squad in the lead-up to Australias match against Zimbabwe in Adelaide on January 26. A delighted Katich said, It was a nice surprise to get the call up and I am absolutely thrilled to get this opportunity. I love playing at the SCG so if the chance presents itself Im keen to grab it with both hands. Hohns said, Simons form has been irresistible this summer and although his selection in the squad is just for one match at this stage, we are keen to see how he performs at ODI level.

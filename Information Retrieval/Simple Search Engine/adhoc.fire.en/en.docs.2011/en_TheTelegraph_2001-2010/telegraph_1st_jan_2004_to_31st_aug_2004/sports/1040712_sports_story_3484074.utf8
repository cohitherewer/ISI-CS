The Telegraph - Calcutta
 France off to perfect start
 - FED CUP 
- Belgium stun Spain to take 2-0 lead in quarters  Thailands Tamarine Tanasugarn after beating Australias Nicole Pratt during their Fed Cup World Group play-off in Bangkok on Sunday. Tanasugarn won 1-6, 6-4, 6-1 to give her country a 3-0 sweep London: Amelie Mauresmo and Mary Pierce gave holders France an ideal start to their Fed Cup World Group quarter final clash against Italy in Rimini by winning their singles matches on Saturday. Belgium, without Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters, took an unexpected 2-0 lead against Spain, while the ties between Argentina and Russia and Austria and the United States were square at 1-1. Wimbledon semi-finalist Mauresmo wasted little time in winning her 11th successive Fed Cup tie with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Silvia Farina Elia in just over an hour, while Pierce beat Francesca Schiavone 6-3, 6-4. I came on the pitch full of confidence, knowing exactly what I had to do, said Mauresmo, who made a smooth transition from the grasscourts of Wimbledon to the clay in It-aly. Once I got into the rhythm, I didnt leave her many opportunities to come back into the match. I felt very, very confident. In Jerez, 18-year-old Kirsten Flipkens stunned Spanish number one Annabel Medina Garrigues 7-6, 1-6, 6-2. Flipkens, ranked 315th in the world, took the first set in a tiebreak before getting trounced in the second. She came back in the third set to give the Belgians a 1-0 lead. That was built on by Els Callens, who beat Virginia Ruano Pascual 2-6, 6-4, 11-9 in a match that lasted three hours and 35 minutes. Callens saved two match points in the third set and finally broke Ruano Pascual in the 20th game at her fourth opportunity. In Buenos Aires, French Open champion Anastasia Myskina took just 59 minutes to put Russia back in contention by beating Fed Cup debutant Natalia Gussoni 6-3, 6-0. Myskina needed to win her match after Gisela Dulko had upset world number nine Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4, 3-6, 6-4. Barbara Schett also had to level the tie for Austria in Innsbruck with a 6-2, 6-4 victory against Lisa Raymond after Chanda Rubin had given the US an early lead with a 6-1, 5-7, 6-4 win over Barbara Schwartz. Rain delayed the start for over 90 minutes but once on court Rubin wasted little time in taking the first set. She then raced to a 5-2 lead in the second but Schwartz held three match points before breaking the American three times to take the set. Rubin clinched the match, however, to put the US in front. But Schett seized control from the beginning against Raymond and the Austrian wrapped up the match in little over an hour.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

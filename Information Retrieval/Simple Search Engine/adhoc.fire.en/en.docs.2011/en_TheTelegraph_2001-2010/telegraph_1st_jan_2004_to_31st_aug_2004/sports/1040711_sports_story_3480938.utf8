The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka fight back in Cairns
	 - SECOND TEST  Kumar Sangakkara, who made 74, ducks a bouncer on Day II of the second Test against Australia in Cairns on Saturday Cairns, July 10 (Reuters): Sri Lanka fought back to dismiss Australia for 517 and reach 184 for two in their first innings reply on Saturday at the close of the second day of the second Test. Kumar Sangakkara and Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu put on 138 for the second wicket before wrist spinner Shane Warne had Sangakkara caught in the deep for 74. Atapattu was unbeaten on 75 from 114 balls including eight boundaries and Mahela Jayawardene not out on nine by the close. Earlier, leg-spinner Upul Chandana was Sri Lankas chief wicket-taker with a return of five for 109 while young fast bowler Lasith Malinga took four for 148. Australia lead the two-match series 1-0 after winning by 149 runs in Darwin last week. Justin Langer, who had put on 255 for the first wicket with Matthew Hayden (117), was first man out on Saturday for 162, caught at slip off Malinga. Chandanas five victims included Damien Martyn, leg before wicket for 97, and Darren Lehmann, caught at long on for 50. Australia had resumed at 370 for two, adding 104 runs in the pre-lunch session for the loss of five wickets. Australia were all out soon after lunch, losing their last seven wickets for 63 runs. Warne was out at lunch for two, caught at slip off Chandana. The 31-year-old Chandana, playing his 12th Test, also claimed the wickets of Simon Katich for one and Kasprowicz for nine. Pushing for quick runs, Australia went to lunch at 474 for seven but lost Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz cheaply after the break. Adam Gilchrist was then out for 35 following a 32-run stand for the last wicket with Glenn McGrath (0 not out). With the wicket holding few terrors, Sri Lanka have laid the foundation for a competitive score. It was a bit disappointing. We had the opportunity to close Sri Lanka out of the game, but all credit to them for clawing their way back, Gilchrist said. Gilchrist said Australia hoped the wicket would take more spin later in the match. Ive said all along, Warnie is a special bowler and he is capable of getting eight wickets anywhere in the world, Gilchrist said. Chandana, speaking through a translator, said he was very happy with his five-wicket haul, his second in his 12-Test career.  Copyright

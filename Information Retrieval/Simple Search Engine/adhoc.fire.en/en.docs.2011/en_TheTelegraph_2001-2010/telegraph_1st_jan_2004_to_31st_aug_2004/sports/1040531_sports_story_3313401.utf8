 Schumi leads another red rout
 Schumacher, wearing a black armband in memory of Umberto Agnelli of Fiat, after the Nrburgring win on Sunday Nrburgring: World champion Michael Schumacher restored Formula One to normal order here on Sunday when he won the European Grand Prix at a canter as Ferrari claimed their fourth one-two of the season. German Schumacher, who was beaten for the first time this season in last weekends Monaco Grand Prix, made the perfect comeback in his homeland as he led from his 60th career pole position to claim his sixth win in seven races. His smooth and calculated performance blew away thoughts that Italian Jarno Trullis Monaco victory for Renault could herald a challenge to the world champions domination. And Barrichello completed Ferraris return to form as he used a two-stop tactic, compared to most other drivers three-stop strategies, to climb from his seventh place on the grid to second by the end of the 60-lap race. Behind the red rout, which saw Schumacher extend his championship lead over Barrichello to 14 points, Briton Jenson Button claimed his fifth podium finish in six races as he came home third for BAR-Honda. His teammate Takuma Sato looked set to equal the best finish for a Japanese driver but a strong third place was ended with a desperate lunge on Barrichello and engine failure eventually forced him out late in the race. Trulli finished fourth, ahead of his fifth-placed Spanish team-mate Fernando Alonso for the fourth time this season, as Renault continued their impressive reliability with another double finish.

 Haldipur ton in Bengal victory
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT  Nikhil Haldipur hit 135 Jamshedpur: Nikhil Haldipur started from where he had left off in the last match, hammering 135 (111, 1x6, 11x4) to help Bengal post an 113 run-win over Tripura in the East Zone one-day meet on Thursday. In reply to Bengals 349 for five, Tripura made 236 for seven. Bengal have thus qualified for the next phase of the meet. They have 14 points from three matches. Their last match is against Orissa on Saturday. Apart from a fine opening stand between Haldipur and Arindam Das, Laxmi Ratan Shukla hammered a quick 82. After this, Tripura just didnt have any clue .  Copyright

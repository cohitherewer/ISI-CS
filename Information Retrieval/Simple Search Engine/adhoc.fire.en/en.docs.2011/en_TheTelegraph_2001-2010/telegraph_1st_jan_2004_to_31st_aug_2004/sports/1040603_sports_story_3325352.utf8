 Mourinho starts Chelsea journey
 Mourinho attends a press meet at his new club on Wednesday. (Reuters) London: After being named as manager of Chelsea on Wednesday, Jose Mourinho began the task of giving Roman Abramovich a tangible return on his massive investment in the Premier League club. Mourinho inherits a squad brimming with talent following the first wave of signings bankrolled by Abramovich, but despite a flood of transfer speculation, the former Porto coach hinted that his priority was to cut the number of players at his disposal. I want 21 outfield players, plus goalkeepers, no more. Among high profile players likely to leave Stamford Bridge are Argentinas Juan Sebastian Veron and Hernan Crespo, and experienced Frenchmen Marcel Desailly and Emmanuel Petit. Others whose Stamford Bridge days look numbered are Danish winger Jesper Gronkjaer, midfielders Boudewijn Zenden and Mario Stanic and striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, with Mourinho looking to build a team around a core of England internationals like John Terry, Scott Parker and Frank Lampard. What he may also struggle to cope with is Abramovichs tendency to interfere in team selection as well as transfer policy. Mourinho is sure to make major new signings. Liverpools England midfielder Steven Gerrard may prove impossible to tempt but Spanish striker Fernando Morientes and Ivory Coast forward Didier Drogba may be more realistic targets.

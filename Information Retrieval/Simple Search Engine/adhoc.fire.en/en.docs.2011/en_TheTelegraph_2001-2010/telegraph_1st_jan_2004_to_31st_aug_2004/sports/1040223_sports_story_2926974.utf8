The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan manage a face-saver
 - National League - Md. Sp. surrender lead 8 minutes to time; Poor refereeing mars play  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Relieved Mohun Bagan players after Manitombi Singh (extreme right) got the equaliser against Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: A few things do not change with time  the standard of refereeing in India and the quality of Mohun Bagan defence seem to be two prime examples. And these two factors ensured that Mohun Bagan open the second phase of the National Football League (NFL) with a 1-1 draw against Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium Sunday. After Chidi Edeh put Mohammmedan Sporting into the lead following a horrible defensive error in the 52nd minute, Manitombi Singh made it 1-1 in the 82nd. Mohun Bagan now have 15 points from 12 games while Mohammedan Sporting are on 10. However, it was referee Gokulanand Sharma who saw to it that Mohun Bagan do not go into the lead at the stroke of half-time. A Mehtab Hossain shot from about 30 yards struck the cross-piece and dropped well inside the goalline, but the referee overlooked it. The referee, in general, had a horrendous game. A couple of minutes before the disallowed goal, Edeh was tripped inside the penalty box, but Sharma ignored it. The players often broke into scuffles, but the man in black seemed to have no control over the game. The match never reached any great heights  just the up and down stuff expected from two teams lying in the bottom half of the table. Mohun Bagan had the better of the exchanges, combining well down the left. The balls did come flying in, but Ashim Biswas as the single striker was not there to convert them. A Mehtab Hossain tap-in from a goalbound melee following a Rennedy Singh corner was tipped over the cross-piece acrobatically by the keeper Gumpe Rime. Mohun Bagans new Zimbabwean recruit Noel Kasake had a reasonable game. He started as a defensive midfielder, but later shifted to an attacking position  adjusting well to both the roles. The post denied Mohun Bagan in the 41st minute when Mehtabs shot beat the keeper and came back into play. But, to everyones surprise, Mohammedan Sporting went into the lead after the breather. Bagan defender Palash Karmakar had the ball well under his control, but he gifted it away to Edeh and the Nigerian pushed the ball in. Big teams have the ability to fight back when they are down  but this quality is sadly lacking in the current Bagan team. There was hardly a move of note for most of the second session, and the equaliser was a freak one as well. Manitombi intended a cross from close to the right sideline, but the ball dipped into the net with Rime badly out of position. However, once the equaliser came, Mohun Bagan raised a number of attacks, but the strike force sorely missed someone called Jose Ramirez Barreto. The chance Ashim missed in the 88th minute was really a woeful one. Sunil Chettri sent a through ball and Ashim got it following a misunderstanding between the defenders, but his right-footer with Rime at his mercy missed the target. TEAMS MOHUN BAGAN: Prasanta Dora, Manitombi singh, Sanjeeb Maria, Palash Karmakar (Harpreet Singh, 69), Lolendra Singh (Abhay Kumar, 77), Mehtab Hossain, Basudeb Mondal (Sunil Chettri, 67), Noel Kasake, Rocus Lamare, Rennedy Singh, Ashim Biswas.

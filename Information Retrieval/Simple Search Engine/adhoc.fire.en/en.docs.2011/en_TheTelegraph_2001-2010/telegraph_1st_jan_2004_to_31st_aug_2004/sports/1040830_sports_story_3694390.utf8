 Italian wins intruder-hit marathon
Athens: Italian Stefano Baldini won the Olympic mens marathon on Sunday after an intruder dashed on to the course late in the race and bundled the then-leader Vanderlei de Lima into the crowd. De Lima, who surged to the front before the halfway stage of the 42.195 kms race from Marathon to the Panathinaiko stadium, managed to extricate himself from the spectators but was clearly shaken by the incident. The unidentified man, who was dressed in a kilt, was arrested and taken to a police station. I lost the gold medal at that moment, de Lima said. I was afraid, I did not know if the man who attacked was armed. The Brazilian had been tiring anyway at that stage and Baldini, a former European champion and twice world bronze-medallist, slipped into the lead at 40 kms and strode away to a comfortable win in two hours, 10 minutes, 55 seconds. American Meb Keflezighi finished second in 2:11:29 with De Lima, who received a standing ovation from the spectators in the venue of the 1896 Athens Games, taking the bronze medal. The race began in 30 degrees, cooler than the temperatures for last Sundays womens race but still hot enough for the toughest race on the Olympic athletics programme. The field remained bunched until 16 kms, when South African Hendrik Ramaala surged into the lead.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rameez wants code for former players
 - Latif-stung PCB to move ICC  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Rameez says a blueprint for action is needed Lahore: Hurt yet again by Rashid Latifs match-fixing allegations, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) intends moving the International Cricket Council (ICC) to introduce a code of conduct for former Test and ODI players. A code does exist, but applies to the present-day players only. Something definitely needs to be in place, otherwise people will go on making unsubstantiated charges... Its an issue which should be discussed by the ICC and we plan to call for a code of conduct, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph. Speaking on Monday afternoon, he added: Im aware the ICC has said proof must be furnished if an allegation is made, but what if no evidence is produced? The damage, after all, is done straightaway. So, a code is necessary. Latif, a former captain, charged that last months fourth ODI between India and Pakistan was fixed. India, it may be recalled, needed to win in order to keep the series alive  they did, thanks largely to Rahul Dravid and Mohammed Kaif. Among other things, Latif had then alleged: Even the common man could observe that the players were acting on a script because the body-language was not as it should have been... Deeply embarrassed, and under pressure from current captain Inzamam-ul Haq, the PCB has referred that to its disciplinary committee. The body is headed by Justice (retd) Amir Alam Khan, with Mohammed Nazir (Jr) and Maqbool Elahi Malik being the other members. Apparently, in an attempt to close the issue, Latif (who has returned from South Africa after an exhibition game) is understood to have contacted Rameez  who has often sup-ported him in the past  on Sunday night. Rameez, it seems, indicated that the matter was out of his hands and much would hinge on the disciplinary committees verdict. If Justice Khan and his colleagues arent satisfied with his explanation, theres a good chance that Latif may be banned from first-class cricket. Whatever his motives, many regard Latif as Pakistan crickets enfant terrible. Its not a nice label to have.  Copyright

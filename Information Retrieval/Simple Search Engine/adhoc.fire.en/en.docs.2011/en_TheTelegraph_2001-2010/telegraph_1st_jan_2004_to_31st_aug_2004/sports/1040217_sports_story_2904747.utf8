 ECB probes betting claim
London: English cricket authorities are investigating claims that a player had placed a bet on a county match. The ECB refused to name either the player or the match involved. An allegation of betting has been made against a player, ECB spokesman Andrew Walpole said. The matter is now in the hands of Gerard Elias, chairman of the disciplinary committee, and it is now up to him to make a decision. All international cricketers, and all English county players, are required to sign an agreement not to bet on any match. Rule-breakers could face a five-year ban from playing or administration and an unlimited fine.  (AFP)  Copyright

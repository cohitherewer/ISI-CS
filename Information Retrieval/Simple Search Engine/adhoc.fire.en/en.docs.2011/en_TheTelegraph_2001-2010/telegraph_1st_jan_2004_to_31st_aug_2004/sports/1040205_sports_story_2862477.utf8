The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Surgery to sideline Suley Musah
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Musah may be out for four months Calcutta: In a massive jolt for East Bengals AFC championship campaign, the club Wednesday came to know that the ever-dependable Suley Musah could be out for as much as four months. The Ghanaian needs surgery for a knee injury. Coach Subhas Bhowmick said: An acute knee ligament tear  medically called ACL  was noticed when we put him through an MRI in Mumbai as per Dr Anant Joshis advice. When a partial tear is more than 50 per cent it lays anybody low. We will put him through exercises, but thats no big hope. Bhowmick is also worried because Douglas da Silva isnt likely to be fit and has virtually no chance. Bhowmick has yet to receive the IFAs letter meting out the extraordinary punishment to him. While it is strange that it takes so long in the city, Bhowmick himself refused to comment on it.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Okoro form spreads cheer
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick felt on Friday that the biggest gain of his teams 4-0 win over Mohammedan Sporting was Mike Okoros return to goal-scoring habit. Hes a goal-getter. He almost single-handedly gave us four trophies last season. That he was not getting goal was a problem not only for him, but for the team as a whole. May be his goal today will help him get back his confidence, Bhowmick said of the Nigerian, who last scored for his team on November 8, during the Durand Cup semi-final. Bhowmick admitted the margin of win was beyond his expectation and added it would boost the morale of his team. Bhowmick didnt pick anybody for special mention and about Cristiano Juniors seventh goal in seven matches, he had this to say: Its his job to score and thats why hes been brought in from Brazil. Mohammedan Sporting coach Jamshed Nassiri, on the other hand, blamed it on the lack of experience, maturity and unprofessionalism.

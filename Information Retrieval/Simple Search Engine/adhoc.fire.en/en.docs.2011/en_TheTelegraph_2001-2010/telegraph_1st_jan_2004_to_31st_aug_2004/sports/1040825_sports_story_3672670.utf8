 Sally quits in sight of medal
 Sally Robbins Athens: An Australian rower, vilified by her crew mates for quitting in the Olympics final, said on Tuesday she had been overcome by anxiety and it would take a long time to win back her teammates trust. At an emotional news conference, members of the womens eight apologised for breaking national Olympic rules and expressed regret at condemning their teammate. The crew, who finished fourth at last years world championships, were reprimanded earlier on Tuesday by the Australian Olympic Committee for their disparaging remarks. Itll be a long process, and I think that I will be back, and will be back rowing with these girls again, eventually, said Sally Robbins.Obviously I have to earn their trust. At least one crew member refused to say whether she would row with Robbins again. Theres a little bit of a bitter taste in my mouth, said Kyeema Doyle. Asked if she would row with Robbins, she added: I will row the single scull for a while. Crew captain Julia Wilson was more conciliatory. Of course I regret saying what I did, but I was just so caught up in the moment. The Australian crew convened the news conference in Athens in an attempt to put a lid on the furore which has triggered a heated national debate back home with even Prime Minister John Howard having his say. The 23-year-old Robbins collapsed with about 500 metres remaining in the womens final, won by Romania, and could not continue despite the fury of her teammates. I take responsibility for what happened out there, said Robbins.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Sohails money on Sourav amp; Co.
 - Inzamams captaincy could have been better  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Lahore: Aamer Sohail is not one to mince words. The former Pakistan skipper feels India have a very good chance of winning Wednesday ODI series final at the Gaddafi. India are the favourites, theres no doubt about that. Their morale is high and Pakistan will be under pressure in front of the home crowd, Sohail told The Telegraph Tuesday morning. The former opener feels Inzamam-ul Haq and Mohammed Sami will be the key to Pakistans fortunes. The way Inzy bats will be important since he can make things easier for the rest to follow. Similarly, Samis spell will hold much significance against this strong Indian line-up. If Shoaib Akhtar and Shabbir Ahmed can rattle them at the start, it will be up to Sami to carry on the good work. Shoaib has been good with the new ball and has been picking up wickets. He is the main strike bowler. But once he is through with his first spell, it will be up to Sami to create the pressure, Sohail explained. For the Indians, it will be important for the openers to survive the early pace burst and ensure a good start. If Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag can give them a flying start, it will hard to check the visitors. Sachin played well in Rawalpindi but has struggled otherwise. Rahul Dravid has been the most consistent but if India are to post a huge total, the openers have to fire. That will set the trend, Sohail observed. He felt Pakistans preparations werent good for the series. The home side hasnt prepared well and that has been their problem. The way the bowlers have been generous with the wides and no-balls does not reflect well on the team. Its important they pick up early wickets because the Indian batsmen are matchwinners. Allow them to survive long and youve had it, Sohail sounded a note of caution for Inzamams men. His advice is simple. Discipline is most important youve got to be disciplined in bowling. But it does not mean surrendering aggression, which is their forte. Youve got to mix everything  be cautious and disciplined, aggressive as well. Sohail is not happy with Inzamams leadership. The captaincy could have been better. His handling of spinners hasnt been good. In the last game, when Pakistan picked up four Indian wickets, Inzamam should have gone for the kill. The idea should have been, not to allow them last the full 50 overs. He should have learnt his lessons from Rawalpindi where the Indians nearly achieved the target of 330. Youll be in trouble if you wish to restrict them. On Sunday, Inzamam shouldnt have got in Abdul Razzaq at 92 for four in the first 15 overs. It was a tactical mistake. He should have relied on Shabbir, Shoaib and Sami, Sohail said with typical flair, holding nothing back. He says the pace trio could turn out to be the matchwinners on Wednesday. They have the capabilities. They just have to complement each other to reach the desired goal. Like Imran Khan, Sohail is also in favour of a bowling coach. Its a good idea and its up to the PCB to decide. They have to sit and make a decision rather than act in a hurry. Wasim Akram or Waqar Younis can do the job but you have to gauge if they can perform as a coach. A great player doesnt necessarily become a good coach. That decision will take a while. Come Wednesday, it will be up to the home team bowlers to put up a disciplined showing. That will be the key to Pakistans fortunes.  Copyright

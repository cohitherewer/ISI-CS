 Bob Woolmer deal gets flak 
 Woolmer under scannerIslamabad, June 19 (PTI): Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis do not feel Pakistans new English coach Bob Woolmer can add enough zing to the team. They also found Javed Miandads unceremonious exit baffling. I thought Javedbhai deserved better, Waqar was quoted as saying in the media, while Akram felt that signing Woolmer for a four-year period was funny. The nation reacts senselessly if we lose to India. They have matured with Sourav Ganguly at the helm but we are struggling, Waqar said. In Pakistan even the chairman of the cricket board doesnt know what the future holds for him. How much zing can the laptop coach put into the boys is a big question, said Akram. And PCB sources have been quoted as saying that it was skipper Inzamam-ul Haq who prevailed upon a senior official of the PCB in calling up Shoaib Akhtar and Moin Khan on the Asia Cup probables roster. In another development, Shoaib has sued two citizens  Syed Muzammal Hussain and Najmaul Abass Shah  for 100 million rupees ($1.7 million) each for allegedly defaming him, his lawyer said on Saturday.

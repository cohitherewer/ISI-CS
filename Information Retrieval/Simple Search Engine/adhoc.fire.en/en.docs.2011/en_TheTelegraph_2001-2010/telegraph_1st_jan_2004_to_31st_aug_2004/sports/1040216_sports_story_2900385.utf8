The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ may dish out Sami treatment
 I dont count anything by history, says Bracewell Christchurch: The New Zealand team will be turning to psychology to overcome their fears of South Africa, coach John Bracewell said on Sunday. South Africa won the first of six one-day Internationals last week, but Bracewell was quick to refute suggestions the Proteas had already gained a mental advantage ahead of the second match on Tuesday. But he said the team would be using lessons learned in overcoming Pakistan pace bowler Mohammad Sami during last months series which New Zealand won. I was told that Mohammad Sami had a psychological grip over us, now hes seeing a psychologist, Bracewell said. If you do get to that position youve got to work on a strategy to overcome it. Thats what we did with Sami, how we get under his skin and combat what he did. We reduced him to a mere mortal which he hadnt been in the past, and we have to try and do the same here. Bracewell had a terse response to any suggestions New Zealand would find it hard to recover in this series from their opening defeat. I dont count anything by history. We lost one game and weve got five to go. We lost one against Pakistan as well, and the perception was the world had fallen on our heads then. Meanwhile, South Africa believe they can knock Australia off their perch and become the dominant team in the world of one-day cricket, coach Eric Simons said on Sunday. Its a goal for the guys to stay focused on, Simons said. The South African coach had said after defeating New Zealand in the first match that the Proteas were now looking to inflict a heavy series defeat. If ones dominant, one needs to maintain the dominance and thats the sign of a true champion side, he said.  (AFP)  Copyright

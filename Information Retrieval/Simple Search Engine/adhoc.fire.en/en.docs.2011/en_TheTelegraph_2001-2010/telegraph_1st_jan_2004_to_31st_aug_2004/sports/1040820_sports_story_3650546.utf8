 Mixed reactions in Athens 
	 - Hockey rule changes  SUJIT BHAR Athens: A few rule changes are being experimented at these Olympic Games, as Mandatory Experimental Rules, and as required by the FIH. Key among them (introduced in 2003 and to be used throughout 2004) are change rule 9.5: permitting a defender to use the stick to stop or deflect a shot at goal at eye height; and change13.3: Not requiring the ball to be stopped before a shot at goal at a penalty corner. The latter, presumably, was necessary because of the drag-flick rule at penalty corners, that allowed hits at any eight and sounding of boards wasnt mandatory. The reaction to this has varied. Gerhard Rach, the Indian national coach, said: It does create problems if the player isnt experienced enough, and many of his wards arent. He also says, though, that rule changes are for all, should benefit or adversely affect all. One must know that a rule is helpful for your game, not to put you down. Terry Walsh, the Australian coach, said: Finally it is a sensible move. This probably had remained the only sport in the world where we were restricted from lifting our sticks. It is only natural to do so. It will go a long way in changing the staid face of hockey. I am all for it. Sohail Abbas of Pakistan, though, has not particularly liked it. One of the most prolific scorers from penalty corners today, Abbas says it hampers the attacking flavour. I dont think it will, countered Rach. This will be good for hockey in general. The increase in Indias penalty corner conversion rate maybe indicative of these changes effects. It also stands to justice that the second change is complementary to the first. Good or bad, the face of hockey as we know it, is changing quickly.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Karan Rastogi replaces Paes
Chennai: Asias No. 1 junior player Karan Rastogi of India was Friday given a wild card in the main draw of the ATP Tour Tata Open commencing here on Monday. Rastogi was given the wild card in place of Leander Paes, who withdrew from the event so as to have more time to recover from the brain cyst, which he suffered in July last. It is a matter of pride for me to play my first ATP Tour event in India, an excited Rastogi said of his surprise selection. Rastogi, who has been ranked sixth in the acceptance list for the Australian Open juniors tournament later this month, had a reasonably successful 2003, where he defeated ten of the top 50 juniors in the world. The Australian Open standing of Rastogi is the highest for any Indian junior in a Grand Slam since Paes, more than a decade ago.  (PTI)  Copyright

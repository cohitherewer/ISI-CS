 ICC lauds Woolmer 
London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has lauded the contribution of Bob Woolmer, who was appointed coach of the Pakistan national team on Wednesday, to the ICC high performance programme. Bob has worked with our high performance nations over the past two-and-a-half years, helping to set up programmes that have enabled their players to improve their skill levels, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said in a statement here. This work is a key part of the ICC development programme and its success has been evidenced in the improved performances of the developing nations at the ICC cricket World Cup 2003. On behalf of the ICC, I wish him every success in his future endeavours. Woolmers initial contract was to work with Canada, The Netherlands, Kenya and Namibia up to the start of the ICC cricket World Cup 2003, but it was extended till after the event in order to embrace Scotland and the UAE. He has also been involved in the rapid increase in the amount of competitive international cricket for the developing nations, including the launch of the ICC Intercontinental Cup 2004.

 Fleming carries bat for NZ victory
 Stephen Fleming after reaching his century in Wellington on Saturday. (Reuters) Wellington, Jan. 10 (AP): New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming produced an unbeaten century to lead his team to a seven-wicket win over Pakistan and a 2-1 lead in their five-match one-day series here today. Fleming, who finished 115 not out, struck the winning runs from the second ball of the 47th over as New Zealand, reaching 259 for three, overhauled Pakistans of 255 for nine. The century was Flemings fifth in 210 one-day matches and came from only 125 balls, embracing a record partnership of 148 with Hamish Marshall for the second wicket and an unbroken stand of 71 with Craig McMillan for the fourth. Fleming carried his bat throughout the New Zealand innings to see his team home with 22 balls to spare and to their second win over Pakistan in eight recent matches. The New Zealand captain put Pakistan in to bat and took two catches, the first of which was his 100th catch in ODIs. He led a well-paced run chase. There was a hiccup when struggling opener Craig Cumming was out for three when New Zealand were only 10, but Fleming and Marshall quickly relieved apprehension of another Black Cap top-order failure. Their partnership of 148 in 115 minutes was a New Zealand record for the second wicket against all nations, surpassing Fleming and Nathan Astles 140 against South Africa in 2002-03. Earlier, Saleem Elahi made 80 and Abdul Razzaq an unbeaten 50 from 26 balls to carry Pakistan to 255 for nine on a batsman-friendly pitch. A series of run-outs curbed Pakistans total, but Razzaq led a bold counter-offensive which could have turned the match. He hit three fours and three sixes in a cameo to lift the tourists from 190 for seven to 255 for nine in the last seven overs. Meanwhile, New Zealand recalled Andre Adams and dropped Ian Butler from their squad for the fourth ODI.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Australia look to keep momentum going 
Sydney, Jan. 10 (PTI): Having launched their campaign with a thrilling 18-run victory over India, Australia will seek to keep the momentum going when they take on Zimbabwe in the second match of the triangular one-day series here tomorrow. Despite starting as clear favourites, the hosts will not be taking their opponents lightly and will try to garner the full six points to keep themselves ahead on the points table. Though satisfied with his teams overall performance in the opening match against India, Australian captain Ricky Ponting wants his players to keep improving, particularly in the fielding department which was a big disappointment in the Test series. We did pretty well in the last match, but we were not quite our best in the field, Ponting said. Zimbabwe skipper Heath Streak will face a daunting task of containing the formidable Australian batting line-up. It will be a big challenge for us. To beat Australia or India in the series will be a big achievement for Zimbabwean cricket, Streak said. The batters have got to convert the 30s and 40s into big scores like Stuart Carlisle did in the first tour game. Our bowling is a little bit inconsistent, but I think we have got the capability of bowling teams out, he said. Zimbabwe have lost 19 successive one-day matches to Australia since their only victory in their first encounter in the 1983 World Cup, but Streak said his players would not allow these demoralising statistics to upset them.

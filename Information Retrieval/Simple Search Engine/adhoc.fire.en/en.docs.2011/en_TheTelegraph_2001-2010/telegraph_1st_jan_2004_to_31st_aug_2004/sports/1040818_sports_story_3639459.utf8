The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Alokes team trips Bagan
 - Ever-Ready ride Satyajit Basus 41st-minute strike  A STAFF REPORTER  Mohun Bagans Eduardo Coelho jumps to meet an aerial ball in the CFL Super Division match versus Ever-Ready at Mohun Bagan ground on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh. Calcutta: One of the first calls coach Aloke Mukherjee received on his mobile, soon after Ever-Ready upset the very team which had forced him to leave last season, was from Rennedy Singh. Congratulations, Rennedy told his coach and the latters face said it all. Mukherjee maintained his usual cool composure after Satyajit Basus 41st-minute goal ensured victory in the CFL Super Division tie versus Mohun Bagan on Tuesday. But the conversation between the two ex-Mohun Bagan personnel  Rennedy was the green-and-maroon leader last season  could easily have suggested they were celebrating a revenge win. Mukherjee is India chief coach Stephen Constantines assistant and Rennedy is also in the national squad leaving for Vietnam on Wednesday. Mohun Bagan stayed on 23 points (after 10 games), while Ever-Ready moved up to 16 (from eight). Subrata Bhattacharya, without a genuine striker, was forced to start with Reggis Carlos Montero in the striking zone and persevered with the Brazilian for 35 minutes before replacing him with Abhay Kumar. I doubt whether Reggis has ever played football, was how Bhattacharya summed up the Brazilians performance. If the coach had to point a finger at a second man, it had to be Reggis substitute. At the stroke of half-time, Abhay was nicely released by Eduardo Coelho on the top box. The former took one Ever-Ready defender in his stride, dodged past goalkeeper Goutam Das and, with an absolutely open goal in front of him, ballooned the ball over the bar. That should have been the equaliser after Mohun Bagan had been dealt a sudden blow four minutes earlier. Satyajit himself took a flag-kick and, getting the ball back from left-back Bimal Sarkar, took a prompt shot from inside the box. Goalkeeper Subrata Pal stopped it partially and Satyajit snapped up the rebound. Bhattacharya pushed Coelho upfront in the second session and the long balls started sailing into the Ever-Ready box, aiming for the tall Brazilian defender. Mukherjee, on the other hand, asked striker Eugene Gray to shadow Coelho and the move paid off. The uneven bounce of the ground hampered free run of the Mohun Bagan midfielders, who love to play along the ground. Thus Basudeb and Co. fumbled in controlling and pacing the game the way they wanted. The match was held up for about three minutes as home supporters pelted stones at the Ever-Ready bench. Abuses were also thrown at Mukherjee and his players. Teams Ever-Ready: Goutam Das; Rajib Ahmed, Manoj Lodh, Anupam Sarkar, Bimal Sarkar, Satyajit Basu, Jayanta Sen, Shankha Roy Chowdhury, Sujit Ghosh (Surajit Chakraborty jr, 63; Surajit Chakraborty sr, 90), Eugene Gray, Earnest Jeremiah. Mohun Bagan: Subrata Pal; Manitombi Singh, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Eduardo Coelho, Rajesh Meetei (Malswama 59); Dulal Biswas, Basudeb Mondal, Noel Wilson (Palash Karmakar 46), Mehtab Hussain, Dharamjeet Singh; Reggis Carlos Montero (Abhay Kumar 35).

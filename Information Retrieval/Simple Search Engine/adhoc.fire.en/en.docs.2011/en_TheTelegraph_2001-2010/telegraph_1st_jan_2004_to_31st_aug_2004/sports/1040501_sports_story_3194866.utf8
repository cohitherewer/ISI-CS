The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gangjee surges past Faldo, Woosnam
 - BEIJING GOLF l City pro emerges sole leader with six-under on Day II  Gangjee isnt going to let the big names bother him Beijing: Calcutta lad Rahil Gangjee emerged sole leader halfway through the Volkswagen Masters China on Friday, ahead of heavyweights such as Nick Faldo, Zhang Lian-wei and Phillip Price. Gangjee, the 25-year-old Asian Tour rookie, produced a superb putting display en route to a second-round six-under-par 66 and a two-day total of 135 at the Pine Valley Golf Club to lead by one stroke over Australian Adam Groom, who returned a 69. Filipino Gerald Rosales, with the days best of 65, Korean maestro Kang Wook-soon, a two-time Asian number one, and Aussie duo Kim Felton and Richard Moir are a further stroke back on 137 in the inaugural, $300,000 event. Although Im leading, Im not going to be bothered with the big-name players behind me and Im just going to let it happen. I dont think Ill be nervous or anything like that, said Gangjee, who carded two of his eight birdies in the last three holes. Chinese stalwart Zhang carded a 70 but he rued a missed opportunity to narrow the gap as playing conditions were ideal for scoring. Zhang, who played in the US Masters earlier this month, is tied seventh on 138 with amongst others, Price, who carded a 70, Myanmar veteran Kyi Hla Han, who produced a 68, and Singapores Mardan Mamat. He enters the weekend three off the lead and is confident of reeling in the leader. On this course, you can shoot some low numbers. It was disappointing to card a two-under round as conditions were ideal. I had some good shots, and some bad shots for two bogeys. I wasnt happy to bogey the par-five 16. I had 116 yards to the flag and dumped the approach into the bunker, said the Chinese number one. Welshman Price, who beat reigning Masters champion Phil Mickelson in the Ryder Cup singles two years ago, will also be a major threat. I had a lot of chances today but I didnt make too many birdies. I was very frustrated as I didnt make many putts, said Price, before heading to the practice green. Six-time Major champion Faldo carded a 70 and will head into the weekend six strokes behind the unheralded leader. The halfway cut was set at 146 with 76 players moving into the weekend. Former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Jeev Milkha Singh were amongst those who squeezed through.  (AFP)  Copyright

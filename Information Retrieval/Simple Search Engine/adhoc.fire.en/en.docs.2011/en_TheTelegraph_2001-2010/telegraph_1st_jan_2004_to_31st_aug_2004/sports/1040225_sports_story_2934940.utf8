 Police to lecture quartet
 - Manchester United players charged with misconduct after Everton game  BY SAM WALLACE  Roy Keane Gary Neville Cristiano RonaldoRuud van Nistelrooy Manchester United were told Monday that Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville and Ruud van Nistelrooy will have to attend a meeting with Merseyside police at which they will be lectured over their conduct during the defeat of Everton at Goodison Park this month. The move by Everton, who sent around 100 complaints from fans to the police, is likely to infuriate United, who privately believe that the conduct of the home fans after Van Nistelrooys late winner was provocative and abusive towards the Premiership champions. It was claimed by Everton officials at the time that Keane made V-signs at the home fans and told them to f--- off, but pictures taken from the opposite side of the pitch clearly show abusive gestures being aimed at the United players by Everton fans. Another picture taken from the side of the pitch opposite to the stand where the goal celebrations took place revealed that a bottle was thrown at the winger Ronaldo before he delivered the cross that Van Nistelrooy headed home to win the game 4-3. Everton claimed that after the game on Feb. 7 some supporters were so angry that they refused to leave the ground until officials had taken names and addresses in order that statements about Uniteds behaviour could be collected over the following week. The move by Merseyside police, which will not involve criminal charges, is intended to be an alternative to Football Association action against United but is unlikely to improve the relationship between the clubs that soured at the end of last season. With the Premiership title already won before the last game of the season, a trip to Goodison Park, United were told by Everton that the presentation of their trophy would interfere with the home players farewell to their own fans. Eventually Everton backed down and, as a gesture of goodwill, manager David Moyes ordered his players to applaud United on to the pitch. A statement from Merseyside police said: We will be seeking to meet with the management of Manchester United to discuss the conduct of their players on the day of the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mohun Bagan rally to win 3-1
 - Super Division 
- Disorganised defence concedes goal in second match  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sunil Chhetri takes a shy at the Mohammedan AC goal as Ashim Biswas looks on during their Super Division match at the Mohun Bagan ground on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: It was a pathetic display of power sans organisation. Mohun Bagan spent most of the days 90 minutes at the Mohammedan AC goalmouth, but not only did concede the first goal, but managed to score only thrice through a maze of legs in their IFA Super Division fixture at home on Tuesday. There was no basic gauge to compare the two teams, the home side outdoing the visitors in every department of the game. However, the goal wasnt the strong point, it was sure, with shots either awry, or into Mohammedan AC goalkeeper Rajnarain Mukherjee. In the confusion, one adventure by Mohammedan AC suddenly found Ori Benjamin at the Bagan goalmouth, Eduardo Coelho and Palash Karmakar were on guard. Ori tossed the ball from right to left foot to get Eduardo out of the way before sending a soft volley into the netting, keeper Prasanta Dora hardly reacting. There was little by way of strategy and one needed little when you are craning all your necks to get a sniff of Mohammedan AC goal. The will, possibly, was not there. Ashim it was, though, who restored parity, in the 42nd minute. Noel Wilsons pass was relayed to Sunil Chhetri by Dharamjit Singh and as Chhetri passes high to the goalmouth, Ashim quickly nodded to effect a fine change of direction into goal. Onto the pitch deadlocked, Bagan again swarmed the rival goalmouth. There were misses galore before, in the 79th minute, youngster Jerry Zirsanga from Mizoram, in his second match for any club team (the TFA graduate of last years batch has only played in the India U-17 and U-19 teams) collected a loose one inside the box on the right. He let go a powerful volley which went in past the far post and past a stranded keeper Rajnarain. Sunil Chhetri completed the formalities in the 39th minute of the second session. Collecting a pass from Noel Wilson, he moved into the box, and coolly dodged a defender before as coolly shooting a grounder into the netting. It had confidence written all over it.

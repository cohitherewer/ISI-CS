The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Malleswari fiasco 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: In an event where world and Olympic records tumbled Wednesday, Indias Sydney Games bronze medallist lifter Karnam Malleswari could lift the weight (100kg) barely above her knees. Its abject disappointment for the country and for the weightlifting squad which now has Kunjurani Devis fourth finish as the best. And as if that wasnt enough, Pratima Kumari had pulled out several hours before the evening, citing back injury. The injury cited by Malleswari after the event was an old one, in the L4 and L5 vertebrae. Thats fine, but when this correspondent had met her in the morning, going out for weigh-in, there wasnt a word about any injury. She said she had done an MRI earlier in India, and I was told I was okay and could lift. But when I tried to take it today on the platform, I just realised I couldnt. Interestingly, she apparently had no problems in practice either. Malleswari had taken part in the higher weight category in the Sydney Games. For this Games she had pulled down for the 63kg, feeling that would give her a better deal. She did start off on a better deal, too, having entered at 235kg, with only gold winner Nataliya Shakun of Ukraine (who also broke the snatch world record of Hanna Batsiuskha of Belarus with a 115kg lift) and silver winner Hanna above her. Logically she was bronze candidate from the start. Yes, this is very disappointing, said Malleswari. Now I will have to go and get this checked out. Meanwhile, Shikha Tandon finished a poor seventh in the womens 100m freestyle heats at at 59.70 seconds, 2.32 seconds behind Vanessa Garcia of Puerto Rico, the top finisher in this heat 2. In mens singles sculls, Paulose Kunnel Pandari managed a fourth place, staying out of the medal race or even the 19-24 places. In sailing, the Indian pair of Malav Shroff and Sumeet Patel fared poorly, finishing 19th, 18th and 15th, in races 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Archer Reena Kumari lost to Shu Chi Yuan of Chinese Taipei 148-166 in quarters.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India, Aussies look to smoothen rough edges
	 - FINAL UNDER-19 TIE  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Robin Singh Calcutta, Feb. 7: Both India and Australia will be looking to smoothen any rough edges in the final preparatory game on Sunday at Eden Gardens prior to the under-19 World Cup in Dhaka. The visitors spent the day at Udayan  of which former Australian captain Steve Waugh is a patron  home for the children of leprosy sufferers at Barrackpore, after morning practice. The Indians, however, stayed indoors after their nets. Coach Robin Singh said there could be three changes in the team that played on Friday since the idea was to have a look at everyone before the World Cup. Weve got to ensure that the players are in the right frame of mind before the tournament, said Robin. Fielding is one area that both teams will look to improve upon. Catches were dropped at will on Friday, the Aussies being the worst offenders. Having come here without a conditioning camp, the visitors are aiming to get into their groove. These three matches have enabled us to take stock of the team, conceded coach Bennet King. The Aussies struggled to find their feet in Cuttack, but were slightly better here. The pitch has been better suited, with the bounce not alarming low, King explained. The Aussies, who are the defending champions, are expecting similar conditions in Dhaka and thus want to make the most of the three matches. King feels the team has improved drastically as far as performance and adaptation to the conditions are concerned. For India, bowling will remain a worry though the batting has shown signs of solidity at the top-order. The middle-order, however, remains a bit of a bother for skipper Ambati Rayudu. The way the middle-order collapsed on Friday was not good news for the coach. Except for left-arm pacer Rudra Pratap Singh, the other bowlers did not look impressive.They were found wanting in line and length and failed to keep their cool under pressure. Allan Beadle with his wristy ways and three wickets shows all the promise of developing into a useful allrounder in the future.  Copyright

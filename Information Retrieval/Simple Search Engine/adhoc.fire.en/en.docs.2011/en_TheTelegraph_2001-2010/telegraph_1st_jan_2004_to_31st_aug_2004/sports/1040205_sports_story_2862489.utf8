The Test series assumes great importance as both teams will be eager to finetune skills and gain confidence before going into next months Olympic qualifying meet in Madrid. After their debacle in the Azlan Shah Cup in Kuala Lumpur, India have chosen their best 21 players and will be led by Dilip Tirkey. Missing from action will be Dhanraj Pillay, who has a knee injury. Holland, despite being defending Olympic champions, have to go through the grind of qualifiers due to a new rule which allows only the continental champions a direct berth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Negi youngest Indian to beat a GM
Biel: Parimarjan Negi, 11, defeated Ivan Nemet of Switzerland in the Masters section of the 37th Biel International Chess Festival on Wednesday to become the youngest ever Indian to beat a Grandmaster. Surya Shekhar Ganguly, who had beaten GM Gregory Serper of Russia during the Goodricke International open chess tournament at Calcutta in 1995, held the record thus far. Parimarjan bettered Surya Shekhars record by a few months. The Delhi-lad already had a GM scalp to his credit but that was in rapid chess when he beat highly-rated GM Mikhail Ulibin of Russia in the rapid tournament here just 10 days back. The national sub-junior champion came back in reckoning for his second International Master norm after the victory and is now on five points. In the Grandmasters section, top seed and defending champion Grandmaster Alexander Morozevich of Russia beat GM Krishnan Sasikiran in the eighth round on Wednesday to regain sole lead. With this victory, Morozevich took his tally to six points out of a possible eight while Sasikiran is a point behind on second spot. Local favourite Yannick Pelletier is third on four points and half-a-point adrift are former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine and Etienne Bacrot of France. Luke Mcshane is at the bottom of the table with two points. Just two more rounds remain in this category-18 event as per Fide charts being played on a double round-robin basis between six players. As the close race between Sasikiran and Morozevich ended with the triumph of the latter, it now appears that the die is decisively cast in favour of the Russian. Morozevich is looking for his second straight victory here after last years exemplary score of 8/10. Sasikiran, who played black, once again failed with the Brayer variation of the Ruy Lopez, which he had played in the second round and lost to Ponomariov. Morozevich was in his element and proved that even when it comes to playing chess in classical style he is one of the best in business. With clinical precision, Morozevich got a stronghold in the centre after uncorking a new positional idea and caught Sasikirans queen unawares on the queenside. Getting two pieces as compensation was never going to be enough for Sasikiran and he called it a day on the 35th move. Pelletier was the hero of the day as he outsmarted Ponomariov. Playing black, Pelletier employed the Sicilian Paulsen and after erratic opening manoeuvres by white, the players arrived at a wild middle game position wherein both had to play very precisely. However, Ponomariov went for an attack against the king while Pelletier knocked down his queenside and even though the Swiss lost two bishops for a rook, his handful of extra pawns proved decisive in the ending. The game lasted 40 moves. Bacrot gave an impressive endgame display too and got the better of Mcshane whose return to form in hindsight looks temporary. It was a Ruy Lopez again and Mcshane missed the thread on course for equality. Bacrot quickly won a pawn as a result and the outcome of the game was never in doubt thereafter. Mcshane threw the towel in 51 moves. In the Masters section, Asian junior champion P. Magesh Chandran put it across GM Nukhim Rashkovsky of Russia and took his tally to 5.5 points from eight games played so far. Grandmasters Boris Avrukh of Israel and Andrei Shariyazdanov of Russia joined overnight leader GM Christian Bauer in the lead with fine victories over Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine and Alexander Riazantsev of Russia, respectively. All the three leaders have 6.5 points each. In other games involving Indians P Konguvel defeated compatriot R.R. Vasudevan. The latter now has to win the next two games to be in with a chance for his maiden IM norm. (PTI)  Copyright

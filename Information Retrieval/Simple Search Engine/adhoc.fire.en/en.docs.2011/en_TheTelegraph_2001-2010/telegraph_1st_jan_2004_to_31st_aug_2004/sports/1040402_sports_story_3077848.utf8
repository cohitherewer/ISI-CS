 Denmark not to play in Algeria
London: Denmark confirmed on Thursday that they would not play their Davis Cup first-round tie in Algeria later this month because of security fears. The Danish Tennis Federation has informed the International Tennis Federation that it will not send a team, the sports governing body said on its website. Algeria will automatically advance to the second round. The ITF added it would consider sanctioning the Danish Federation. Algeria will now face either Slovenia or Poland in the second round on July 16-18.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 India make Super League 
 - Bowlers help inflict 69-run defeat on New Zealand after batting letdown  Sunny Singh during his innings of an unbeaten 68 against New Zealand at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka on Wednesday Dhaka: Bowlers came to the fore to help India maintain their winning run in the under-19 World Cup on Wednesday. After being all out for 215, India bowled out New Zealand for 146 for their second victory in as many matches in group C. The 69-run win ensured India a place in the Super League and left them strong contenders to top the group. A.T. Rayudus boys had beaten Scotland by 270 runs in their opening match on Monday and will play their last match against Bangladesh on Friday. At lunch, it didnt seem India would have it so easy in the end. The target was not stiff even on a slowish wicket, but seamer Rudra Pratap Singh and spinners Praveen Gupta and Abhishek Sharma took two wickets each to dismiss New Zealand in 44.5 overs. New Zealand were 94 for two at one stage and had moved to 132 for four before their batting collapsed. The run rate, however, was always below the asking rate as the Indians kept them under a tight leash. Delhi leg-spinner Sharma ended the 68-run third-wicket partnership between wicketkeeper-batsman Bradley Watling and Brad Wilson by having the latter caught by MoM Sunny Singh. Walting was run out a little later for his 121-ball 55. Part-time bowler Praful Waghela then dismissed captain Daniel Flynn for a first-ball duck before Rudra Pratap and Gupta polished off the tail. The last six wickets fell for a mere 14 runs in a space of eight overs. In the morning, Sunny scored an unbeaten 68 to rescue India from a shaky 101 for six. The Haryana allrounder faced 81 balls and hit seven fours while adding 66 runs for the seventh wicket with Gaurav Dhiman, who hit a brisk 38 off 51 balls including three fours and a six. Their stand, combined with some loose bowling by New Zealand who conceded 23 extras, made up for the collapse of the top order that had plundered 425 for three in the previous match. The start was poor as Robin Uthappa fell with the total reading 15. It became 30 for two in the eight over following the dismissal of Shikhar Dhawan, the other opener, who had made an unbeaten 155 against Scotland. Captain Rayudu and the left-handed Suresh Raina took the score to 71 before the latter fell in the 14th over. This was followed by a collapse as Waghela, Dinesh Karthik and Rayudu all went back to the pavilion with the scoreboard showing 101 for six in the 24th over. This brought together Sunny and Dhiman and though the latter was dismissed in the 37th over, Sunny took the score beyond 200. He was the last man out. For New Zealand, right-arm medium-pacer Brent Findlay bagged four for 36, while Craig Smith and T. Davis got three for 42 and two for 47, respectively. New Zealand, who had beaten Bangladesh in their opening match, must beat Scotland in their last league outing on Thursday to make it to the Super League.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

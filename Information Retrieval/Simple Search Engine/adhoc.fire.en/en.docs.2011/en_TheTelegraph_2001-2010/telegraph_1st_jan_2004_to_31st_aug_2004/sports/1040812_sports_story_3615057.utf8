 Geraint Jones finds new mentor
 SIMON BRIGGS AT OLD TRAFFORD  Geraint Jones can reach the heights of Gilchrist, says Alec Stewart One of the great traditions of English handicraft was extended on Tuesday when Jack Russell, the finest wicketkeeper of his day, drove into Old Trafford for a special one-to-one tutorial with Geraint Jones. A famously close-knit group, wicketkeepers fit somewhere between masons and morris dancers when it comes to handing their secrets down from generation to generation. By acquiring Russell as a mentor, Jones is connecting himself into a lineage that stretches back to Alan Knott (the best of them all) and beyond. I want to be there for him, Russell said on Tuesday, because Knotty was always there for me. A lot of players used to talk to each other in the pub, but Knotty didnt drink, and he took a long time changing. I used to wait until 9.30, go round to the dressing room, and wed talk into the night. Russell met Jones for the first time during a 90-minute session before the Caribbean tour, when he described challenges of keeping in the West Indies to him and Chris Read, who was still the man in possession. One might have expected Read, as the consummate gloveman, to have made more of an impression. But in fact it was Jones inquisitive streak that really stood out. I drove away from there thinking theyve both got a good attitude but this blokes easier to work with, Russell said. He just wants to know, hes at you all the time for information, which is music to my ears. If I can pass just one good piece of information on then all the effort will be worthwhile. Russell was among the games great eccentrics. One of Michael Athertons most difficult tasks as England captain was trying to persuade him to ditch his battered old sunhat  which Russell claimed helped him to line the ball up  in favour of the regulation blue cap. The cap probably fitted better, but Russell simply refused to wear it. Jones, by contrast, is refreshingly free of the oddities that most wicketkeepers seem to collect along with their broken fingers. But then some observers, including Alec Stewart, reckon he is primarily a batsman  which is probably the right way round to be. Its easier for an ordinary wicketkeeper to become a top-quality wicketkeeper than an ordinary batsman to become a top-quality batsman, said Stewart, who should know. Geraint is an excellent batsman. I think he has the potential to be as good as Adam Gilchrist. This is where Russell comes in, with an ongoing brief to iron out any remaining imperfections in Jones keeping (which, after all, has only had 35 first-class matches to establish itself). The pair spent an hour Tuesday working on his technique up to the stumps to Ashley Giles  an area where Jones feels he has room for improvement. I havent been 100 per cent happy with my keeping this summer, Jones said Tuesday night. It has been closely scrutinised. There is a huge tradition of English keepers being fantastic glovemen, and I dont want to be remembered as one that wasnt.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Henman well placed in bottom half
 - WIMBLEDON 
- Federer, Hewitt, Ivanisevic drawn in same quarter  Ivanisevics goal in his final tournament is to survive the first week London: Champion Roger Federer is on a Wimbledon collision course with the man whose title he took, Lleyton Hewitt. Goran Ivanisevic was also drawn in the top quarter on Thursday as the winners of the last three years were all grouped together in the top 32 places in the 128-man draw. Former world number ones Marat Safin and Carlos Moya were also drawn in the top quarter. Following Andre Agassis withdrawal with a hip injury earlier this week, Ivanisevic, Hewitt and Federer are the only Wimbledon champions in the mens draw. Fifth seed Tim Henman was offered a relatively easier passage in the lower half after he was drawn in the same quarter as 2002 runner-up and fourth seed David Nalbandian. A possible semi-final opponent for the British number one could be second seed Andy Roddick, who retained the Stella Artois title last Sunday. In womens event, defending champion Serena Williams will probably have to overcome her conqueror at Roland Garros, Jennifer Capriati, in the last eight again after the two were placed in the top half. A Williams versus Williams final may also be on the cards for a third year running after Serenas third-seeded elder sister Venus, champion in 2000 and 2001, was drawn in the bottom half. In a potential repeat of the French Open final, Russian compatriots Anastasia Myskina, seeded second, and Elena Dementieva, six, were drawn to meet in the quarter finals. Nine-time champion Martina Navratilova, playing the singles for the first time since losing the 1994 final, faces Colombias Catalina Castano in the first round. Mens seventh seed Hewitt, who was knocked out in the first round by the tallest man in tennis six-foot-10 (2.08m) Ivo Karlovic last year, could meet Ivanisevic in an explosive third round. Three times a runner-up before finally winning as a wild card in 2001, Ivanisevic is returning to his favourite event for the first time since his famous triumph. It will be an emotional outing for the big-serving Croat as he will be retiring from tennis after Wimbledon. He will have to beat Hewitt if he is to fulfil his remaining Wimbledon dream. My goal is to pass first week. Then... who cares? he said earlier this week. Federer faces Alex Bogdanovic, a British wild card who had his LTA funding taken away for lack of commitment, in the first round. The first big name Henman may face could be last years runner-up Mark Philippoussis in the fourth round. (Reuters)  Copyright

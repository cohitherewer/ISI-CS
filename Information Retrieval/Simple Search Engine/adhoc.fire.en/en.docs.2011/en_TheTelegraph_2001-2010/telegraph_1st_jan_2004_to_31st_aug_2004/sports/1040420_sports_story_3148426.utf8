The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Balaji gives credit to Wright
Chennai: Young Indian seam bowler Lakshmipathy Balaji, who played a vital part in Indias first away series win against Pakistan, Monday credited coach John Wright for his superb performance. Speaking after his return from Pakistan, the 22-year-old Tamil Nadu star acknowledged Wrights fatherly advise. Wright in particular motivated me often with his pep talks like you are too good a bowler. You are better than others... Apart from motivating me with such words, John Wright also taught me to bowl differently to different batsmen, Balaji said. He said he had been following the rigid schedule of physical training laid down by the team trainer. Balaji said the frequent bowling tips from seniors like captain Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble helped him to remain focussed. With the tips I was gaining ground and confidence match by match. With confidence level improving, the rhythm and motivation also improved. These gave a boost to my performance every time I bowled, he said. On his interaction with former Pakistani speedster Waqar Younis, Balaji said: I spent just about two minutes with him. I sought suggestions on how to maintain a tight line and length while bowling to right-left combination of batsmen and also on strengthening my leg.  (PTI)  Copyright

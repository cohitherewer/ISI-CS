The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Strong reply by England
 - FIRST TEST 
- Ton on debut by Strauss after Cairns creates sixes record  Chris Cairns smashes a six on way to 82 on the second day of the first Test against England at Lords on Friday. (Reuters) London: Debutant Andrew Strauss, a late replacement for Michael Vaughan, scored a century at Lords on Friday to place England in a very comfortable position at the end of day two of the first Test against New Zealand on Friday. The Middlesex skipper shared an opening partnership of 190 with stand-in-captain Marcus Trescothick (86) as the home side reached 246 for two in reply to New Zealands 386. Strauss was out for 112, four overs before the end of play, caught at short-leg off left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori. Earlier, Marcus Trescothick recaptured the form, which had eluded him on Englands recent tours of Sri Lanka and the West Indies at an opportune moment at Lords on Friday. England were 136 for no loss at tea, with Andrew Strauss unbeaten on 65 on his Test debut. The morning session was illuminated by Chris Cairns, who struck 82 from only 47 deliveries in an astonishing display of clean hitting. The Black Caps all-rounder, playing his final Test at Lords, came to the crease in the first over of the day after the tourists had resumed at 284 for five. Little more than an hour later Cairns was dismissed for his highest Test score against England studded with four sixes, 10 fours and a five. His penultimate six off Andrew Flintoff, a mighty blow over the long-on boundary broke West Indian Viv Richardss world record of 84 Test sixes and the next ball also disappeared over the ropes, this time off the back foot over the cover boundary taking his tally to 86. Steve Harmison swung an evenly-balanced match back Englands way when he dismissed Jacob Oram after the giant left-hander had added only three to his overnight score of 64. He then plucked Daryl Tuffeys off-stump out of the ground after the night watchman had scored eight, and seven balls later Simon Jones dismissed Brendon McCullum for five when the New Zealand wicketkeeper dragged the ball on to his middle stump. Daniel Vettori fell to Harmison for two, also playing the ball on to the stumps, and Cairns was left with number 11 Chris Martin for company. After Cairns dismissal, Trescothick and Strauss took England safely through to lunch before picking up where they had left off after the interval. Neither batsman took any risks but neither looked in any trouble against the four-pronged New Zealand pace attack of Tuffey, Martin, Oram and Cairns, bowling accurate but unthreatening fast-medium. Trescothick push-drove Tuffey for four, then square-drove Oram to the boundary. He square-cut Cairns to the boundary then was briefly startled by the same bowler when one delivery flew above McCullum to the ropes followed by a delivery which skidded low. The England skipper reached his 50 from 95 balls with nine fours followed closely by Strauss, whose half-century contained five fours from 90 balls. New Zealand, missing the express pace of Shane Bond, still regaining full fitness following a stress fracture of the back, lacked variety in their attack with Daniel Vettoris left-arm spin the only change to four right-arm seamers of similar speed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB back with 4-goal bang
 - Junior shoots record goal as Bhaichung, DCunha, Okoro pitch in - Salgaocar  shocked  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Alvito DCunha is congratulated by Anit Ghosh after scoring East Bengals first goal against Mohammedan Sporting at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Bhaichung Bhutia, who struck the second, is in the background. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Fire the coach. Sack the superstars, bring in fresh blood. And a seeming resignation to the fact that theres little to gain from this red-gold brigade. Those were the sentiments that could be heard in and around the East Bengal tent with the team struggling to get a toehold on the current National Football League race. And coach Subhas Bhowmick was missing the rub of the green. After Friday, though, these views should be put on hold. The defending champions 4-0 rout of Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium needs to be studied in ways beyond the glossy scoreline. Mike Okoro finally placed a ball into the net and Cristiano Junior was on a record scoring spree. Alvito DCunha and Bhaichung Bhutia also registered their names in the scoresheet. Fridays win pushed East Bengal to share the second spot with JCT at 18 points from 10 matches, two points behind Dempo SC, who have played a game less. Mohammedan Sporting (6) look doomed. The match could have been different had the black-and-white strikers used their intelligence inside the box. In the 18th minute a Subhas mistake allowed Syed Rahim Nabi to break free, but the forward shot straight at Sangram Mukherjee. Soon after, Syed Hossains free-kick from about 30 yards tested Sangram under the bar, and Dipendu Biswas failed to push home a rebound on the stroke of halftime. Then came a typical Alvito goal, two minutes within the first-half injury times. Junior squared a ball aimed at Bhaichung on top of the box, but latter sold a dummy for Alvito, whose rasping drive was too hot for Gumpe Rime. The goal changed everything, East Bengal pushing Mohammedan Sporting back. The 68th minute of the match saw a Bhaichung classic. He chested down a right-wing long cross from Sujoy and his first-time volley was an absolute cracker. Within four minutes, Junior made history. The Brazilian, while receiving a Sujoy cross, was pulled down by his marker Madhab Das inside the box and the referee S.M. Balu rightly pointed his finger to the spot-kick. Junior had no difficulty in scoring his seventh goal in as many matches, surpassing Omolaja Olalekans six in the 1997-98 season.  The roving Okoro, trying too many things too quickly, finally saw his diligence bear fruit in the final minute. It was a carbon copy of the first goal with the characters being different. Sujoy sold a dummy of a Malsawmtluanga square pass leaving the Nigerian clear at the other end to push home his first goal since his strike in the teams 3-0 win over Air India in the Durand Cup semi-final, on November 8.

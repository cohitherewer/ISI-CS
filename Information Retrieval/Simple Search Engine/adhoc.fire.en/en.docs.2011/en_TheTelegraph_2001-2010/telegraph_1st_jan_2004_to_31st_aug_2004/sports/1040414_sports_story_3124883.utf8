The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wadekar praise for bowlers
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Wadekar says the day couldnt have gone better for India Rawalpindi: Superb show, is how former captain Ajit Wadekar summed up Team Indias performance on the opening day of the decider. Speaking to The Telegraph at the Marriott in Islamabad, he said: The day couldnt have gone better... The tail did add some runs, but it was largely hit-or-miss stuff... I must say our bowlers were outstanding and made use of obviously helpful conditions. Wadekar, who arrived late on Monday, added that the toss (won by India) became crucial with a capital C. Praising the choice of Parthiv Patel as opener, Wadekar  also Indias longest serving coach (though then designated cricket manager)  observed: He seems full of confidence, a top requirement for any opener. If he clicks, then we stand to gain in many ways... Of course, he made the point that the Day I advantage ought not to be frittered. At times, its more difficult consolidating than getting to a position of strength. So, we must carefully build on this start. Wadekar is the fourth one-time captain (after Chandu Borde, Gundappa Viswanath and Dilip Vengsarkar) to grace this Revival Series. Borde and Co. had come to Lahore for the second Test.  Copyright

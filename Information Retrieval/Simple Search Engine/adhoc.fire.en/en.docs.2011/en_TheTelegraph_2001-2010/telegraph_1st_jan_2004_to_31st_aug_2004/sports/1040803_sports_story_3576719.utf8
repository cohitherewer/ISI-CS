 Respect for WI the key: Vaughan
 - Mental lapses affecting side, says coach Gus Logie  Michael Vaughan Birmingham: England captain Michael Vaughan said respecting the opposition was the key to the teams 256-run second-Test defeat of the West Indies here at Edgbaston. Englands win, with more than a day to spare, put them an unbeatable 2-0 up in the four-Test series. However, Vaughan insisted: We respect the West Indies. I think thats the key to our performances that we are respecting them and preparing in a real thorough manner. Aprils drawn fourth Test in Antigua saw West Indies captain Brian Lara score a Test world record 400 not out. And Vaughan added: Any team with Brian Lara in it is very, very dangerous, so we have to be wary of him. Left-arm spinner Ashley Giles, on his home ground, claimed the bowling honours with a Test best match return of nine for 122, after his nine for 210 saw England to a 210-run win in last weeks series opener at Lords. But unlike Lords where Vaughan, in both innings, Andrew Strauss and Robert Key all made hundreds, at Edgbaston it was Marcus Trescothick  who made two centuries  and Andrew Flintoff, with a Test-best 167, who had three figures to their name. They are huge contributions. We missed out this week but those three got the big runs. Im also very pleased for the bowlers, the way they ran in on a placid wicket. To have a good side you have to have individuals who are playing to a high standard but you also have to have a lot of hard work and preparation. I just think we are getting it spot on at the minute. Vaughan said England now believed they could win a match from any position and cited the first-innings sixth-wicket stand of 170 between Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones, who made 74, as proof of his teams resilience. You sense that they expect to win in any position. We were 262 for five in the first innings on a flat deck and that was below par. It was that key partnership that was the difference between a 400 total and 569. We should have been 300 for three, but we still believed in the dressing room that wed get a big total because we had Flintoff and Jones at the crease. That just comes from winning and being around each other on a regular basis. If you win games of cricket from the positions that we have done in the last year and come through the last year and gives you extra belief and thats all that happened. Lara came under pressure to quit the captaincy from former West Indies skipper Viv Richards on Sunday. But after presiding over West Indies 30th defeat in 40 Tests away from home Lara insisted he would not resign. Its impossible to even think about that at the moment. I have the job to do as captain until the fourth Test at The Oval. My employers will decide whether or not I step down, Lara told reporters. I am committed to West Indies cricket. I was asked back to do this job and I am doing the best I can, added Lara.  (AFP)  Copyright

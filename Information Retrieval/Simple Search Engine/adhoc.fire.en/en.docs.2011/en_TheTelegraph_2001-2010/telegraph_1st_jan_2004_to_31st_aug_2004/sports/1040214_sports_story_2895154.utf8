 Korchemny indicted in THG case
San Francisco: A track coach, the trainer for baseball great Barry Bonds and two executives of a nutritional firm were indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on charges of distributing illegal steroids and human growth hormones to star athletes. Following an 18-month secret probe, the grand jury in San Francisco issued indictments against Victor Conte, 53, owner of Burlingame, California-based Balco Laboratories, his vice-president Jim Valente, 49, track coach Remi Korchemny, 71, and Greg Anderson, 37, Bonds personal trainer. While operating Balco, Conte and others conspired to distribute illegal performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and various other prescription drugs, to dozens of athletes, US attorney general John Ashcroft said in Washington DC. The indictment said Balco distributed steroids in a testosterone-based cream, as well as a liquid drug known by its code name of The Clear which contained THG. (Reuters)  Copyright

 PCB remark upsets Shoaib
 Shoaib says he is fit for Asia Cup Islamabad: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar is disappointed over reports that he will have to prove his fitness and attitude before being picked for the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. Reacting to Shaharyar Khans recent comments, Shoaib said: I dont know what has prompted the PCB chief to say this. I am very mu ch available for the Asia Cup and have recovered from my rib injury after two weeks of rest. Shoaib said he will send his latest medical reports to the PCB to reconfirm his availability for the Asia Cup. I am sending my latest medical reports to the board. Doctors have cleared me to resume playing and advised me to continue taking treatment. They have cleared me because they know I am fit to play, the Rawalpindi Express was quoted as saying in The News. I thought I had cleared things with the board before I joined Durham and even after reaching England I have kept the board informed about my fitness, Shoaib said. As far as my attitude is concerned, I know I have made mistakes but it is something that I had a clear discussion with the chairman about and have made myself very clear. Meanwhile, chief selector Wasim Bari said he is awaiting reports on all those playing county cricket in England. At present, our position is that we have asked the board to let us know the fitness position of those playing in England. We want to know who is fit and available to be considered for the Asia Cup, Bari said. Only after we get this information we can talk about other things and finalise our list of probables for the Asia Cup and other tournaments, he added.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bond may miss second Test too
 Bond has been troubled with soreness since playing 10 days ago London: Fast bowler Shane Bond has undergone a scan on his troublesome back and is in danger of missing the second Test in Leeds, New Zealand Cricket has said. Bond, who missed the seven-wicket first Test loss at Lords because he was not considered fit enough after suffering a stress fracture in his back 12 months ago, had been troubled by soreness since playing against Kent 10 days ago. The 28-year-old had a scan in London and was ruled out of the four-day match against Leicestershire starting on Friday. That would have been his last chance to get match fit. New Zealand team manager Lindsay Crocker said it was too early to determine whether the fast bowler would miss the second Test at Headingley beginning on June 3, or indeed whether he could be sent home. We dont want to speculate until there is a definite answer, said Crocker. There is no thought of replacements yet. We want to be very careful with him, hopefully hell get through Thursday and we can work on getting him right. Bonds absence from the second Test would be a huge blow to New Zealands chances of levelling the three-match series. The bowling attack at Lords lacked the penetration Bonds extra pace would have given them and England coasted to victory on the final day. Allrounder Jacob Oram will also miss the match against Leicestershire after sustaining a side strain on the final day at Lords, though he is expected to be fit for the second Test.

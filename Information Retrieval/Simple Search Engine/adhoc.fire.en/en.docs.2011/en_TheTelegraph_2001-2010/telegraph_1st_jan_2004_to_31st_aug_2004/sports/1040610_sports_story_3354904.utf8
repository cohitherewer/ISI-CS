The Hottest Feet... Meet The Group d Stars
Germany BallackMICHAEl BALLACK
A sought-after colossus Michael Ballacks stock rose after a series of towering performances for the surprisingly successful German side at the 2002 World Cup made him one of the stars of the tournament. As luck would have it, suspension denied him a place in the final which Germany lost 0-2. Ballack deliberately brought down South Koreas Lee Chun-Soo in the semi-final, denying him a clear shot at goal when the score was 0-0. A yellow card meant Ballack was out of the decider. The irony came minutes later when Ballack converted his own rebound to give Germany a 1-0 win over the co-hosts. The midfield colossus (1.89m), who now plays at Bayern Munich following a switch from Bayer Leverkusen, was born in Chemnitz in East Germany. Football supremo Franz Beckenbauer at one stage criticised him for being too lackadaisical, but his committed and selfless attitude in Korea and Japan was the best possible response. Ballack was superb in the two-leg 2002 World Cup play-off match with the Ukraine when Germany had their backs to the wall, confounding his critics by scoring three goals in two matches, including the equaliser in Kiev (1-1). In the return match, a header in the fourth minute sent the German crowd wild and opened the way to victory for his teammates, winners 4-1. He is the lynchpin of the tactical game of coach Rudi Voeller, his former director of football at Leverkusen. For Ballack, who dreamed of playing for Real Madrid, Euro 2000 was another nightmare. Although he did not play against Romania, Ballack was selected for the crucial game against Portugal, but the Germans were swept away 0-3 and he was replaced at the interval. The year of 2002 was another campaign of near glory as he finished in the runners-up team in four competitions (World Cup, Champions League, German championship and German Cup). A move to Bayern Munich in 2002 rectified that and he won the German title and Cup in his first season. KloseMIROSLAV KLOSE
The back-flip man Germany made a surprise run to the 2002 World Cup final, a disappointment lightened by the emergence of Kaiserslautern striker Miroslav Klose, who scored five goals. Klose treated TV viewers the world over to his trademark backflip each time he scored, including three in the 8-0 humiliation of Saudi Arabia.His feats sparked comparisons with former great Gerd Muller, who picked up the nickname of Bomber with his tally of 68 goals from 62 international matches for Germany. He was born in the Silesia region of Poland which was German territory before World War II. His father was a professional footballer at Auxerre in France in the 1980s and the family moved to Germany when Miroslav was nine-years-old. He played in regional sides before joining the Bundesliga club Kaiserslautern in 1999. Voeller gave him his international debut on March 24, 2001, in a 2-1 win over Albania where he rewarded the coachs faith with a goal. He gives everything, reaches deep down into himself, noted Voller, who knows a thing or two about strikers haveing scored 47 international goals from 90 games himself. Hattricks seem to be Kloses speciality as he also bagged three goals in matches against Israel and Austria ahead of the 2002 World Cup, performances that ensured his presence on the giant stage. There are younger men challenging for his spot, notably Kevin Kuranyi, who knocked Klose off his perch and onto the substitutes bench in 2003. He looks set to quit Kaiserslautern at the end of this season, with VfB Stuttgart, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich hot on his trail. To one day pull on a Bayern shirt would be a dream come true, Klose freely stated. Two years after the World Cup launched him on the international scene, Euro 2004 could propel him to further heights with a move to one of the European giants, though Klose himself will be more intent on hunting more goals and another crown for his nation.Latvia PaharsMARIANS PAHARS
Latvias Michael Owen When Maris Verpakovskis scored six goals in six games to help surprise package Latvia qualify for Euro 2004, he was in fact taking up the baton from Marians Pahars, who had been the star of the side before him. Born in the Ukraine, the pint-sized Pahars arrived at Skonto Riga in 1995 at just 19, helping the club win the Latvian title four straight seasons. His strike rate attracted a 1.2 million euros bid from Southampton, and he found himself on his way to the south coast of England and a Premiership adventure in March 1999. His talent stood the sturdy test of the English game, his guts, speed and guile winning over the fans of the Saints, who because of his size and goal rate called him the Latvian Michael Owen. His biggest fans see him as something of a magician as he shows no fear of attempting the unexpected pass, shot or move. His sang-froid in front of goal serves him well and makes sure he is regularly on the score sheet. In just his sixth league game for Southampton he scored both goals in a 2-0 win over Everton, it was the last day of the season and the three points assured the clubs Premier League survival. While Southampton struggled over the following seasons, Pahars continued to rack up the goals, 13 in the 1999-2000 season, nine in 2000-01 and 16 in 2001-02, regularly making the difference between victory and defeat for the modest side. A serious ankle injury in November 2002 kept him out of action for the best part of a year. However, in November 2003, Latvia symbolically had him on the bench during their landmark Euro 2004 play-off victory over Turkey in Istanbul. National coach Aleksandrs Starkovs brought Pahars on in the final minute of the match with Latvia leading 3-2 on aggregate, an unassailable lead when the two away goals are counted, to give the striker a much needed psychological boost and his 50th cap.Czech Republic NedvedPAVEL NEDVED
Man with the golden touch The Czech Republics undisputed golden boy is their captain Pavel Nedved. The roving midfielder has led the national charge towards Euro 2004. Since his big money move to Juventus in 2001, his dazzling performances have made up for the Turin giants loss of Zinedine Zidane. Such was his impact during the 2003 Champions League campaign, when he led Juventus to the final, and also playing for the national side, he was awarded the prestigious European Player of the Year. He is technically gifted, has great tactical awareness and is physically strong. However, its his ability to lift team morale when under pressure that has won him so many fans. Euro 2004 will be the third finals for Nedved. In 1996 they unexpectedly made the final only to be beaten by Germany on a golden goal. At Euro 2000, Nedved was unable to inspire his nation past France and Holland. Originally from a village in western Bohemia near the German border, Nedveds career began back in Czechoslovakias Division 2 at the age of 17, in the regional capital of Pilsen. After serving his military service at Dukla Prague, he opted for city rivals Sparta. Fresh from Euro 96, Nedved moved to Lazio, where he won a string of titles. He marshalled the Roman midfield to victory in the last Cup Winners Cup in 1999 and also the brilliant League and Cup double in 2000. There was also a second Italian Cup and a run to the 1998 Uefa Cup final, where Ivan Zamorano inspired Inter Milan to a 3-0 win. In 2001 Nedveds talent received one of the ultimate compliments when Juventus, with $64 million to spend from the sale of Zidane, prized him away from Rome.The Netherlands NistelrooyRUUD VAN NISTELROOY
The goal machine Ruud van Nistelrooy is a one-man goal machine, scoring at such a prolific rate for both Manchester United and Holland that he is widely perceived as one of the best strikers in the game today. Since taking his place at the head of Uniteds attack in 2001, when he joined from PSV Eindhoven, his goal rate has been around three for every four matches, with more than a goal a game ratio in the all important Champions League. Born in Oss in south-central Holland on July 1, 1976, he started out his footballing life as a sweeper while also doing well at tennis and gymnastics. Dutch second division side Den Bosch provided the platform to move up a level and join first division SC Heerenveen in 1997 after four seasons and just 17 goals. After just one season in which he scored 13 goals, mighty PSV wrote a cheque for 6 million euros (then a Dutch record) to bring him to Eindhoven. He was an immediate hit at PSV despite the inevitable criticism regarding his transfer fee. He went on to score a remarkable 31 goals in that first season. By this time, he had already made his first appearance for Holland, finished the year as second top scorer in Europe and won the accolade as Dutch Player of the Year.  United boss Alex Ferguson saw Van Nistelrooy as the ideal man to spearhead the attack. Nistelrooy scored 36 goals in his first season. In 2002-03, he plundered 44 goals as United swept to the Premiership title. Now, after helping Holland reach the final stages of Euro 2004 - scoring a hattrick in the decisive 6-0 play-off win over Scotland, he should finally have a major international stage to provide further evidence of his abundant talent. DavidsEDGAR DAVIDS
Man in the engine room Edgar Davids has battled controversy on and off the pitch both with Juventus and Holland. He is one of the most talented and important midfielders in the modern game. He was sent home in disgrace from Euro 96 following an outburst directed at then Holland coach Guus Hiddink and also had to survive a doping ban in 2001 when he tested positive for nandrolone despite fiercely denying the allegations. His exclusion from the Dutch team dragged on for two years following the tournament in England but he is now a key member of Dick Advocaats side. Meanwhile at club level, he has helped Juventus to three Italian titles since joining the team in December 1997 although his only joy in four Champions League finals was with former club Ajax when they beat AC Milan in 1995. Ironically he would join Milan in 1996 after signing from Ajax where he won three straight Dutch titles between 1994 and 1996 and a domestic Cup as well as their glorious Champions League triumph in Vienna. While he has won virtually every honour available at club level, with Holland it has been a series of disappointments. At the 1998 World Cup, Davids played five matches, scoring once but was helpless as Holland suffered the cruel fate of losing on penalties in a semi-final thriller against Brazil. Davids was there again at Euro 2000 but as in France, the inability to convert penalties into goals proved crucial, Italy taking advantage in Rotterdam to squeeze into the final via the crap shoot of a shootout in a final four clash. He helped Juventus to a defence of their Italian title in 2003, a campaign in which they also reached the final of the Champions League but again Davids was the victim of the penalty shootout as AC Milan emerged triumphant in Manchester. His days with Juventus now look numbered as he joined Barcelona on loan in January 2004 where there is a contingent of Dutch players as well as coach Frank Rijkaard. (AFP)  Copyright

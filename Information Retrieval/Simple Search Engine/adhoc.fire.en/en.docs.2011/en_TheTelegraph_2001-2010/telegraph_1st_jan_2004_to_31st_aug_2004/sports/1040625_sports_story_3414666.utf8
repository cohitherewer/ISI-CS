The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Best period in Dutch colours
 - This time Im completely focussed: Nistelrooy Braga: To say Ruud van Nistelrooy is enjoying his first ever major championships would be a gross understatement  hes loving it. This is definitely the best period Ive ever had playing for The Netherlands, said the Manchester United striker after taking his tally of goals to four in Euro 2004 on Wednesday. I hope it can continue. His first-half double spurred the Dutch to a 3-0 win over Latvia and a quarter final date with Sweden in Faro on Saturday. Van Nistelrooys mood was a far cry from the disconsolate figure he cut after the Czech Republic had beaten the 1988 champions 3-2 to leave their last eight dreams hanging by a thread. Van Nistelrooy said his sharp form was down to two things. Im always well prepared, and this time Ive prepared myself very well, and Im completely focussed, he explained, clutching his Man of the Match award. The Czech defeat had left the Dutch embroiled in a dirty fight with Germany and Latvia for the group D runners-up spot, with Van Nistelrooy reflecting, we knew we had to win our match and hope for a result in the other one. It was a funny group, we played well against the Czechs and lost, then had a bad game against Germany and got a point. Now weve got a tough game against Sweden  I think theyre playing the best football of the whole competition  theyve scored how many goals? Eight? But its a quarter final, anything can happen. Cheers erupted from the Dutch-dominated stands whenever news came through from Lisbon that the Czech Republic had scored against Germany, but Van Nistelrooy revealed the vibes from the terraces proved slightly misleading. I thought it was 2-0 to the Czechs at half-time when in fact it was only 1-1! Van Nistelrooy, who missed Euro 2000 through injury, is now joint top-scorer with Englands 18-year-old prodigy Wayne Rooney, and the United hitman had a few words of praise for the new kid on the block. Waynes doing great, hes doing so well on a big stage for someone so young. Its a fantastic achievement. Meanwhile, Dutch midfielder Philip Cocu paid tribute to the Czech Republic. We have to thank the Czechs for beating the Germans, Cocu said. We heard from the crowd reaction in the second half that there had been another (Czech) goal and that of course gives you an extra push to keep going. In a related development, Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert thinks the fans were justified in jeering coach Dick Advocaat before the teams 3-0 win over Latvia. The supporters blame Advocaat for the defeat against the Czech Republic, where he substituted lively winger Arjen Robben for defensive midfielder Paul Bosvelt with the team 2-1 ahead.

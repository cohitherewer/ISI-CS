The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly in safety-first mode 
 - Absence of first-choice keeper vs Churchill worries hosts coach  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Yusif Yakubu Calcutta: The second phase of the National Football League (NFL) kicks off in the city with a tough one for Tollygunge Agragami. Having finished the opening phase with a tally of 10 points, Tollygunge take on title contenders Churchill Brothers at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday harbouring no illusion about their prospects. Had we earned 14-15 points, we could have thought of starting tomorrows game aggressively, but the position we are in we cant afford to do that, said Tollygunge coach Krishnendu Roy. I have told the boys to see out the first 15-20 minutes and then take it as it comes...  What has compounded Roys problem is the unavailability of first-choice goalkeeper Chinmoy Banerjee. Down with fever for a couple of days, he informed the coach on Thursday that he wont be able to play the Churchill game. Its a big setback for us I now have no choice but to field the inexperienced Sumit Debnath. He will be a hero if he can produce a great performance against a top team like Churchill, well have to wait and watch, Roy said, adding that a draw would satisfy him. The Tollygunge defence will have to watch out for Churchill goal-machine Yusif Yakubu and Ghanaian Benjamin Ansah, who has been roped in for the second phase. Yakubu is a very opportunistic striker who can head and volley equally well Ive also told my defence to keep an eye on (Husseini) Osumanu who is very dangerous in dead-ball situations, said Roy. The Tollygunge defence will be spearheaded by Isiaka Awoyemi and Ebi Barber, while the goal-scoring duties will be shouldered by the tried and tested Akeem Abolanle and Sheikh Habib Ali. Akeem has been performing at a certain level every game, but we need to minimise our missed chances, Roy observed. Marcus Pacheco, the Churchill coach, made no bones about his intention of going all out for victory. We are aiming for the crown, so we have to push ourselves for maximum points from the very first match, he said. The Goans remember the goalless result with Tollygunge in the first phase. We respect all teams including Tollygunge, but I must mention that we were denied a genuine goal in that game.  Copyright

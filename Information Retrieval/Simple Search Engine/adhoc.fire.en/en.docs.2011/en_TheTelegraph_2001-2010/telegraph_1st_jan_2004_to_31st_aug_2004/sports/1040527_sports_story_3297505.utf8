 Diego in rigid rehab regime
Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona is undergoing a rigid rehabilitation for drug abuse and is considering whether to seek further treatment outside of his native Argentina, his doctor said. The 43-year-old soccer great, who led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup title, has been at a psychiatric hospital in a Buenos Aires suburb since early May, when he was rushed to a private clinic for lung and heart problems. Dr Alfredo Cahe, Maradonas personal physician, said he appeared to be taking drug rehab seriously for the first time in his life. Hes adapting well, Cahe told Radio 10. Hes undergone previous treatments but nothing as rigorous as this. Maradona, an admitted cocaine addict, had been undergoing drug rehabilitation in Cuba for the last four years before he was hospitalised twice after returning to Argentina in April on personal business. Each time, he was placed in the intensive care. Cahe said he was consulting with Maradona and his family to see if he should continue treatment outside the country.  (AP)  Copyright

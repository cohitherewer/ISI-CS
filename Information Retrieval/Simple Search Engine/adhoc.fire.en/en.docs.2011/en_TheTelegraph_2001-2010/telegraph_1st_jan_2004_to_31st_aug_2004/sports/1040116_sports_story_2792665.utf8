 ICC: Atapattu investigation is still on
London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday dismissed reports from Sri Lanka suggesting that the investigation into the discovery of Rs 1.1 million ($24,300) from a room occupied by Marvan Atapattu, had been completed. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said he had written to the Sri Lankan cricket board to clarify whether it had issued any such media statement as has been reported. If, as has been reported, Sri Lanka cricket issued a statement suggesting that this issue has been finalised, I would be concerned, Speed said. Not only is it inaccurate to make this suggestion, it is also inappropriate for a board to usurp the role of the Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), which is an independent body that makes its own judgement and reports to the ICC. This is outside the jurisdiction of an individual board. If any board makes inappropriate or inaccurate comments about the role played by the ACSU, I would take the matter up directly with the board involved.  (AFP)  Copyright

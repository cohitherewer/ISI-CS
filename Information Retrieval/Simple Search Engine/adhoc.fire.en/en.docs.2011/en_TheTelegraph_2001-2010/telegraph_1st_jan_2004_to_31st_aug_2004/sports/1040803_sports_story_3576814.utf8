 Time for strikers to shine, not defenders: Van Basten
 Van Basten Zeist (Netherlands): Marco van Basten promised his Netherlands team would play attacking football after accepting a four-year deal to become the national coach. The 39-year-old former international striker replaces Dick Advocaat, who resigned after his team lost 1-2 to hosts Portugal in the Euro 2004 semi-finals. It will be our goal to play beautiful and offensive football, Van Basten told a news conference on Monday. It is time for the strikers to shine and not the defenders. During the Euro finals I only saw two coaches who played offensively, Portugal and the Czech Republic. Van Basten will be assisted by John vant Schip, with his former Ajax Amsterdam teammates Rob Witschge and Stanley Menzo completing the technical staff. Dutch football association (KNVB) director Henk Kesler said Van Bastens position would be reviewed after the 2006 World Cup. In the contract it is also demanded that the Dutch national team has to play offensive, dominating and recognisable football, Kesler said. It is time Dutch fans can identify again with their national team. It is Van Bastens first job as head coach after completing his professional qualifications last year. After seven years out of football, the former World Player of the Year joined the technical staff at Ajax in 2002, assisting Vant Schip in coaching the reserve team. Van Basten had previously indicated that he wanted more experience before taking a big coaching job. I always said that I would take my time but the way everything developed during and after the Euro finals my career moved rapidly, Van Basten said. The whole situation really surprised us but when we received the official offer from the KNVB we took the challenge.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

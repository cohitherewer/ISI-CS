 Indians miss bronze
Kozhikode, July 8 (PTI): India A missed the bronze medal in the Youth Chess Olympiad after losing to Uzbekistan in the tie-breaker on Thursday. The hosts got an individual medal though, as India A captain S. Arun Prasad finished second on the top board, behind Chinas Wan Hao To. Second seeds China took the team gold with a tally of 27 points, followed by defending champions Hungary, who finished on 24. Overnight leaders China beat India C 2.5-1.5, while top seeds Hungary lost to India A by a similar margin. The win took India A to 22 points, but that was not enough. India B and Iran ended in joint-fifth position collecting 21 points each with identical tie-break scores. The three Indian teams played well against higher-rated rivals but they were late in striking form which cost them a medal.  Copyright

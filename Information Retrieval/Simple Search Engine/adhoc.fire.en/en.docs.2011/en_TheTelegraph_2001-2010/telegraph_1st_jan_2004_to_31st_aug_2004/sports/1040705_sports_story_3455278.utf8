The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I am a maniac, but a good guy: Tyson
 Mike Tyson Phoenix: Mike Tyson was sprawled on his back on the canvas, not the kind of place you want to be if youre a fighter, much less the former baddest man on the planet. A day after his 38th birthday, his back was in spasms and his face contorted in pain. Tysons power and speed have seldom been questioned in the 18 years since he first won the heavyweight title. Its the other things, mainly his bizarre ways both in and out of the ring. Tyson has served time for rape, bitten Evander Holyfields ear, tried to break another fighters arm and threatened to eat Lennox Lewis children. Hes wasted away some $300 million, owes $38 million to various creditors, and is basically broke. Despite what a British tabloid reported, though, hes not homeless. I told them I felt like I was homeless, not that I was, Tyson said. Sitting in the gyms dressing-room, with sweat running down his face and chest, he tries to explain a life lived in constant turmoil, always on the edge of disaster. Ive come to the conclusion Ive had a bad psychological opinion of myself, Tyson said. I never realised how many people were pulling for me, wanted me to do well. It was too much pressure for me. I didnt know how to handle it. I wanted people to think Im a normal guy. Im a maniac, but Im a good guy, Tyson added. I dont know if the two intertwine, but thats the real deal. He celebrated his birthday by taking a big bite out of a cake before it was even cut. He thought about going to a strip club to celebrate, but then began wondering how his children would feel and decided against it. Hes living in a modest two-bedroom house in Phoenix where he tends to his pigeons at 4 am every day, then goes running. The Bentleys are gone, theres no entourage to speak of and Tyson insists hes trying to live a clean life.  (AP)  Copyright

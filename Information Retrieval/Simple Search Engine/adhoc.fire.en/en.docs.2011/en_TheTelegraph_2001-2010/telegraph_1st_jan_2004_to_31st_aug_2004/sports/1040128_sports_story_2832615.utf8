 PCB wants Akram to coach fast bowlers
 Akram Islamabad: A desperate PCB has finally decided to Wasim Akram to coach his countrys speedsters in special build-up sessions ahead of the historic home series against India next month. Former PCB chairman Tauqir Zia had said earlier in November that the Board would like to have Akram working on the development of fast bowlers in Pakistan and may offer him a job too. Also to be invited for coaching assignments are former greats Imran Khan and Aaqib Javed as Pakistan resort to last-minute measures of curbing the daunting Indian batting line-up currently in full flow in Australia. Akrams assistance and advice to Indian bowlers, particularly to Irfan Pathan, has become a subject of hot debate in the country but PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said the PCB did not think it was a big issue. Rameez said Akram would be approached for help as soon as he returned next month from his present stint as commentator for the tri-series in Australia. The new crop of pace bowlers, whom the PCB wants to be coached ahead of the Indian tour, includes Mohammed Sami and Shoaib Akthar.  The idea behind asking the trio to hold special sessions is that the current bowlers could learn from their experiences, iron out technical irritants and get mentally prepared for the series against India. The PCB is also concerned over developments relating to fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed, being probed for charges of throwing by the ICC.  Imran, who had a look at Sami, told the PCB that the bowlers problem stemmed from the fact that he was trying to take a wicket with every ball. According to Imran, Sami is trying very hard to take a wicket with every ball he bowls and this is not helping him Rameez said. (PTI)  Copyright

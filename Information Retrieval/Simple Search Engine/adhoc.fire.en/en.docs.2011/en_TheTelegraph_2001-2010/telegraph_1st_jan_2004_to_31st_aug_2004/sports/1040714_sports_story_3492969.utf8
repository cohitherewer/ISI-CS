 Peirsol, Beard break two more records at US trials
 Amanda Beard swims to a new world record in the womens 200 metre breaststroke at the US Olympic trials in Long Beach on Monday. Beard timed 2:22.44. (AP) Long Beach: Aaron Peirsol broke his 200m backstroke world record and Amanda Beard regained hers in the 200 breaststroke at the US Olympic trials on Monday. Peirsol clocked one minute 54.74 seconds, more than half a second under his previous mark of 1:55.15, on the sixth night of competition. This really means a lot to me. The 200 back record is like my baby. I want to take care of it, Peirsol said. In one of the most eagerly anticipated contests of the trials, Peirsol and rival Michael Phelps took the race out hard, both turning at 100m under world record pace. Peirsol led all the way, lengthening his lead on each of the four laps. My strategy was to stay ahead of Michael in the first 100, then pull away. Thats what I did, Peirsol said. Phelps, who improved his 400m medley world record earlier in the trials, finished second in 1:55.86. Beard recaptured her world record for the 200 breaststroke, clocking 2:22.44 to smash the global standard of 2:22.96 set just two days ago by Australias Leisel Jones in Brisbane. Jones had broken the previous mark of 2:22.99 that Beard shared with Chinas Hui Qi. Beard was under world record pace at the 100m mark, though she was only in third place. By 150 metres she was clearly in command, turning half a second under Jones pace. In the mens 50m freestyle semi-finals, Jason Lezak posted 21.98, equalling the worlds fastest time this year. Gary Hall Jr won his semi-final heat in 22.12 seconds, setting up another showdown on Tuesday between the two powerful sprinters. Jenny Thompson, Americas most decorated female Olympic athlete was relegated to fifth place in the finals of the womens 100m freestyle. In a major upset, Kara Lynn Joyce came from behind to pass favourite Natalie Coughlin in the final 10 metres and win in 54.38 seconds to Coughlins 54.42. Correia became the first black woman to make a US Olympic swimming team after being named in the 4x100 freestyle relay squad. (Reuters)  Copyright

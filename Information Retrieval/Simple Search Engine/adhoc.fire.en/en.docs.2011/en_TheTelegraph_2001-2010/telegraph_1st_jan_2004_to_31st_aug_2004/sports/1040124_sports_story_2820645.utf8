Melbourne: Defending hampion Andre Agassi needed just 89 minutes to surge a step closer to his fifth Australian Open crown on Friday before Andy Roddick staked his claim with an even more ruthless third-round performance. 
Agassi brushed aside former Melbourne Park runner-up Thomas Enqvist 6-0, 6-3, 6-3 in a breathtaking display of power and precision while world number one Roddick unleashed his firepower on Taylor Dent to win 6-2, 6-0, 6-2 in just 71 minutes. 
I think I played pretty good tonight, Roddick said. 
The duo were joined in the fourth round by womens top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne and Marat Safin, who fought his personal demons for more than three-and-a-half hours before beating Todd Martin 7-5, 1-6, 4-6, 6-0, 7-5 in a dramatic encounter. 
Henin-Hardenne needed all her confidence to beat free-hitting Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-2, 7-5. The world number one was trailing 5-3 in the second set before getting back on track. 
It was a good fight, the Belgian said. She had nothing to lose and put me under a lot of pressure... shes a tough opponent. 
Henin-Hardenne will play Italian qualifier Mara Santangelo next. 
Swedens Enqvist had won five of his previous nine matches with Agassi but on Friday it was one-way traffic. 
I had a real sense of urgency, Agassi said.You go out there with a real clear idea of what you want to do when youve played each other so many times. 
The win stretched Agassis unbeaten run in Melbourne to 24 matches. He first won the title in 1995 and added three more in 2000-01 and 2003. Injury prevented him from playing Down Under in 2002. 
US Open champion Roddick, looming as the man to beat, fired only four aces and 30 clean winners past Dent but put his fellow-American under so much pressure that he committed 26 unforced errors and 11 double faults. 
Former world number one Safin, now ranked a lowly 86th after an injury-plagued 2003, could not claim to have played his best but did just enough to overcome Todd Martin. 
Known as Big Red for his booming serve and imposing presence, Safin was at times brilliant but also often resembled a park player, frequently venting his anger by slamming his racket into the ground. 
You know... (it) was frustrating, he said. I couldnt find a way to break him, I was looking for so many ways I got a bit upset. 
A former US Open champion and finalist here in 2002, the Russian will tackle another American in round four, James Blake. 
Blake is sporting a shaved head and his dreadlocks are being auctioned for charity. He suffered no apparent Samson effect by cutting his locks and stayed strong on Friday to whip Frenchman Olivier Patience 6-1, 6-3, 6-2. 
But another Frenchman, ninth seed Sebastien Grosjean, dropped a set and came back to beat Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-3. In another match, 16th-seeded Sjeng Schalken of Netherlands beat Jurgen Melzer of Austria 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-1. 
In the womens draw, despite a problem with her left leg, Amelie Mauresmo beat Spains Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-1, 6-2. 
Runner-up in 1999, the fourth seed was in control of the match but needed a medical time-out midway through the second set after suffering problems with her lower left leg. She resumed playing after the leg had been heavily massaged and quickly reeled off the last three games to wrap up a victory in 61 minutes. 
Mauresmo plays Australias Alicia Molik next. Molik defeated Luxembourgs Claudine Schaul 6-7, 6-1, 6-2. 
Lindsay Davenport also advanced, breezing past fellow American Laura Granville 6-4, 6-0. The fifth seed, winner in Melbourne four years ago and the only former champion in the womens draw, struggled with her serve but still had too much power for her 54th-ranked opponent. The 27-year-old Californian will play 11th seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia in the fourth round. 
Gustavo Kuertens joy at achieving his best Australian Open performance was short-lived when Paradorn Srichaphan beat the former world number one. The Thai 13th seed cantered through 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 against the three-times French Open winner. 
Until this year Kuerten had not progressed beyond the second round in seven previous visits and it appears that Melbourne Park is not destined to be a happy hunting ground for the Brazilian. Paradorn will next run into Agassi. 
 Santoro fined for spitting 
Frenchman Fabrice Santoro was today fined $1,500 for spitting towards a line judge during his second-round defeat to Australian Mark Philippoussis at the Australian Open. Santoro was seen spitting in the direction of the line judge after arguing with chair umpire Andreas Egli, following a disputed line call in the fourth set on Centre Court late on Thursday.

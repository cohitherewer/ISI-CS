The Telegraph - Calcutta
 9-man Tolly hold Bagan
 A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge Agragamis Isiaka Awoyemi hits Basudeb Mondal of Mohun Bagan, resulting in the formers expulsion at Howrah Stadium on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami took in their stride a one-man disadvantage to snatch a point from Mohun Bagan on a dank Saturday afternoon at the soccer-turf-turned-cattlefield of Howrah Stadium. The 1-1 scoreline, after 90 action-packed minutes which produced three red cards and as many yellow, amply reflected the guts and gumption displayed by Tollygunge players. They lost the services of Gouranga Datta, a key midfielder, in the 35th minute following a second booking. Four minutes into the second session, out went dependable defender Isiaka Awoyemi after a nasty scuffle with Basudeb Mondal. Referee Udayan Haldar marched off Mohun Bagans Mehtab Hussain, too, for punching Isiaka. The ugly incident, which took place close to the right sideline deep inside the Tollygunge half, saw Isiaka landing the first blow on Basudeb after being fouled. The normally cool Mohun Bagan medio retaliated, albeit less violently, to escape with a yellow card. A clutch of Mohun Bagan players rushed towards the Nigerian with Mehtab throwing a punch at Isiakas ear. The situation did not worsen further thanks to Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharyas timely intervention. Down to nine men  as against Mohun Bagans 10  and with over 40 minutes to play, Tollygunge waged a grim battle for survival. Their second-minute lead, courtesy an Akeem Abolanle volley, had been neutralised by substitute Amit Das  following an eye-catching three-touch move featuring Mehtab, Dharamjit Singh and Gourmangi  within a minute after change of ends. Mohun Bagan were pressing hard for the winning goal with Gourmangi, Basudeb and Amit combining well in enemy territory. Raids came thick and fast, but the Tollygunge rear-line held firm with central defender Debkumar Sasmal, a Mohun Bagan-reject, and custodian Arindam Ghosh standing out. Abhay Kumar couldnt control the ball after being set up by Basudeb and Amit. Arindam came to the rescue a number of times, two one-handed punches to deny Amit and Sunil Chhetri being picks of the lot. Mohun Bagan have now dropped nine points in 11 games, for a tally of 24. Tollygunge have 17 points after 10 matches.

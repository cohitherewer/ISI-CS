 Murali targeted for being Asian: Shastri
Bangalore: Former Indian cricketer and television commentator Ravi Shastri on Wednesday said Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan was being victimised because he was an Asian and a successful bowler. Shastri argued that while one could not say Muralidharan was absolutely above board, action had not been taken against quite of few bowlers, whom he did not name, who are no different from him. I dont find anything wrong with his bowling action. I have no problems with his off-break. He is an Asian and that has ruffled quite a few feathers, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

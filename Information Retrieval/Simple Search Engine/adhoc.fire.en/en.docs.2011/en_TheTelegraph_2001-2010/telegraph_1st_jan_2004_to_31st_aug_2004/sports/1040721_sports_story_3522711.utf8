The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Status quo on Azhar
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Colombo: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is understood to have set aside an informal advisory from the International Cricket Council (ICC), calling for Mohammed Azharuddins Media accreditation for the ongoing Asia Cup to be withdrawn. The former India captain, it may be recalled, is serving a life ban for being involved with match-fixing. According to The Telegraphs sources, the ACC feels that acting on the world bodys advice could invite a controversy as big as the match-fixing scandal itself. Also, it has clarified Azhars accreditation was processed by tournament hosts Sri Lanka Cricket, on the recommendation of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Azhar, banned by the BCCI in December 2000, is working for an Indian TV channel.  Copyright

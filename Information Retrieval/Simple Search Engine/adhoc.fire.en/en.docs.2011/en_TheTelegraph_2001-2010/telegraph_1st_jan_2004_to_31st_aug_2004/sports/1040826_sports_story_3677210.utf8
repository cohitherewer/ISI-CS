 Frustrated Maradona breaks down 
Buenos Aires: Former Argentina captain Diego Maradona broke down in tears during a television interview on Tuesday as he talked about his frustrations over his treatment for cocaine addiction. After being confined to a psychiatric clinic on the outskirts of Buenos Aires for three months, Maradona is fighting to obtain a judges permission to leave Argentina and resume treatment in Cuba. Im old enough and have enough decision-making power to know what to do with my life, the 43-year-old said in a TV interview. But he showed he still had a few of his old soccer skills as he balanced a ball on his forehead for the TV audience.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Crown goes to Tollygunge 
	 - EB beat Kalighat to finish runners-up  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal got the better of Kalighat in their last league match of the A.N. Ghosh Memorial Trophy at the Jadavpur University Salt Lake campus ground on Wednesday, and with 22 points finished runners-up. Tollygunge Agragami took the title with 24 points. East Bengal, with five wins, a draw and a loss (Tollygunge had six wins and a loss), finished ahead of Kalighat (20 points), with five wins and two losses. In a match that witnessed a bit of skirmish, East Bengal piled up 273 for eight (including 54 penalty runs for Kalighat bowling five overs short). That was a great recovery from 43 for five after 9.3 overs, when Sanjib Sanyal had picked up three wickets. Laxmi Ratan Shukla scored 96 off 78 deliveries and Shib Sagar Singh an unbeaten 41. Sanyal could pick up one more, ending with four for 32. Kalighat folded up in 43.1 overs, scoring 250, Manoj Tewari hitting 60. That was the seed of the trouble. Bowler Ritam Kundus appeal for lbw was upheld by umpire Sekhar Chowdhury, but Tewari stood his ground for quite some time. A comment from an East Bengal official infuriated Tewari. After the match got over, Tewari walked up to the official and asked for an explanation. The trouble started, people pushing each other around. Quite an oddity in a cricket match. Other cricketers joined in before good sense prevailed. Brief scores East Bengal 273/8 (L.R. Shukla 96, Shib Sagar Singh 41 n.o.; Sanjib Sanyal 4/32, Shabir Ali 2/27). Kalighat 250 (Manoj Tewari 60, Sayan Dey 47, Md Ziauddin 45; Ranadeb Bose 3/38).  Copyright

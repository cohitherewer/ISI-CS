The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thorpe will be the greatest ever
 - Top coaches vote for Aussie even if he cant match Spitz  Ian Thorpe and Michael Phelps on the podium after the 4x200 relay in Athens on Tuesday. Phelps and his US teammates took gold, but it was Thorpe who won the big one  the 200 freestyle, dubbed as the race of the century, on Monday. (AP) Athens: While Ian Thorpe will probably never match Mark Spitzs record of seven gold medals at a single Olympics, some of the worlds top coaches think he may still be regarded as the greatest swimmer after the 2008 Beijing Games. Spitz remains the measuring stick in Olympic swimming after winning two golds in 1968 and another seven in 1972. The American won four individual titles, all in 1972, with the remaining five golds coming in relays. Thorpe had a disappointing night on Tuesday, when Australia finished second in the 4x200m relay and he just scraped into the 100 freestyle final, but his stunning victory in the 200 freestyle on Monday gave him his fifth gold medal. He won three Sydney as a 17-year-old and has picked up another two in the first three days in Greece. There will never be complete agreement on who is the best but former Australia coach Don Talbot believes Thorpe will have a strong case if he wins again at the 2008 Olympics. He already has three individual titles and no man has more than four in their career. And after winning the 400 freestyle in Sydney and Athens he could become the first male swimmer to swim the same event at three Olympics. In my book hes potentially the greatest swimmer the worlds ever seen but I dont think hes there yet, Talbot said. But if he can get up again and win in Beijing then youre probably going to have to hand it to him. I think he is walking the right trail at the moment but only time will tell because longevity is a big part of it. Thorpe be will just 25 at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing but US coach Richard Quick said he already one of the greats whether or not he wins in China. I dont want to rank the great ones but if theres many people ahead of him its a very short list, Quick said. But its not just his swimming accomplishments, its also his personality. Hes a great guy and a great representative of our sport and Im proud to be in a sport where hes involved. Jacco Verhaeren, coach of Thorpes greatest rival Pieter van den Hoogenband, said the Australians biggest attribute was his determination. Hes very, very experienced now but most of all, hes a very tough competitor, he said. Thats his greatest quality.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

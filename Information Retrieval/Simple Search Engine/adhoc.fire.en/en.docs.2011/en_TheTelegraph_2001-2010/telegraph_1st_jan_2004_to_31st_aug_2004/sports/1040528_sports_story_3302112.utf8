The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mourinho comes out about Chelsea
 Jose Mourinho is one of Abramovichs favourites Lisbon: Champions League winners Porto coach Jose Mourinho took a firm step towards Chelsea Thursday when he named the English Premiership side for the first time. I would really like to accept Chelseas invitation, he told cable channel Sport TV. Its going to be decided in the next few days as I have informed Portos management of my intentions... and the two clubs have talked. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is keen for the 41-year-old coach, one-time assistant to Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson at Porto, Sporting Lisbon and Barcelona, to replace Claudio Ranieri. Last month Porto president Nuno Pinto da Costa warned Abramovich he would go to war over the move. Porto accused Chelsea of illegally approaching Mourinho about the prospect of taking over from Ranieri. But last week the Porguguese press announced that Porto had lined up Luigi Del Neri as his successor. Del Neri, currently coach of Italian side Chievo Verona, was expected to be named this week. Premiership rivals Liverpool, who sacked Frenchman Gerard Houllier recently, are also reported to be interested in Mourinho, but the Portuguese coach refused to be drawn on speculation about a move to Anfield. He played the Liverpool question with a straight bat preferring to discuss his teams achievements. This is history for us and we will bring the cup back to Portugal and celebrate with the whole nation, enthused Mourinho. I am proud of myself and this fantastic team. Monaco are a great side but we deserved to win.  (AFP)  Copyright

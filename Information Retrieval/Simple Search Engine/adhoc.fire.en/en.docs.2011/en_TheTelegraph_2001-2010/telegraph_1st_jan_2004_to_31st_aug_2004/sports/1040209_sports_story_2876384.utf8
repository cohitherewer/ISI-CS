(Reuters) Even as Jonas Bjorkman and Thomas Enqvist were winning Sundays reverse singles to give Sweden a surprise 4-1 victory over defending champions Australia in the first round of the Davis Cup World Group in Adelaide Sunday, World Group newcomers Belarus were setting up a shocker in Minsk, throwing 2002 champions Russia 3-2 out of the competition.

Earlier in the day, Max Mirnyi trounced Andreev 6-3 6-4 6-4 to bring the home team level at 2-2.

		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	New Delhi: Sania Mirza and Manisha Malhotra beat Yoon-Jeong Cho and Mi-Ra Jeon 7-6 (7-2), 7-5 in the doubles of the Fed Cup womens team tennis competition to give India a 2-1 win over South Korea here on Tuesday.				 																																	Earlier, Ankita Bhambri put India ahead before Mi-Ra beat Sania to help South Korea level the scores 1-1.				 																																	Ankita needed an hour and 53 minutes to defeat Kyung-Mi Chang 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 but her domination was much more than the scoreline might indicate. Sania went down to Mi-Ra 4-6, 2-6. 				 																																	Ankita once again stole the limelight from her more famous compatriot. The local lass displayed little of the rustiness that had affected her on Monday when she was playing after a two-month gap.				 																																	India had beaten Chinese Taipei 3-0 on Monday.				 																																	Meanwhile, New Zealand took an unbeatable 2-0 lead over the Philippines, as did Thailand against China, 				 																																	London: Wales have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to be awarded Russias place at Euro 2004 in the wake of midfielder Yegor Titovs failed drugs test.				 																																	The Football Association of Wales (FAW) said on its official website on Monday that it had filed an appeal to the court in Lausanne, Switzerland after Uefa rejected their original appeal in March.				 																																	Uefa banned Titov after he tested positive for a banned stimulant following Russias first-leg playoff against Wales in November in Moscow, which was drawn 0-0. Titov did not play in that match but featured in the second leg that Russia won 1-0 to qualify for the tournament in Portugal.				 																																	Kabul: Afghanistan have disbanded their national soccer team after nine players disappeared from a training camp in Italy last week, an official said on Tuesday. 				 																																	Six of the players have been arrested in Germany, where they sought asylum, and Italy has promised to hand them over to Afghan authorities soon, the official said, adding they would be punished for damaging Afghans honour.				 																																	Dublin: Manchester United captain Roy Keane was named in Irelands squad on Tuesday for the first time since he turned his back on his country on the eve of the 2002 World Cup.				 																																	Keane, who indicated last week he was ready to return to the Irish fold, was named in manager Brian Kerrs party to face Poland in a friendly international next Wednesday. Keane quit the Irish squad complaining of its lack of professionalism under McCarthy and of poor facilities at Irelands World Cup training camp.				 																																	Boston: Kenyas Timothy Cherigat won the mens Boston Marathon on Monday, improving on his fourth place from last years edition as his country celebrated their second men/womens marathon double in 24 hours.				 																																	Cherigat came home ahead of compatriot Robert Cheboror as the 27-year-old added to Kenyas earlier success in the womens race, Catherine Ndereba winning the event for the third time.				 																																	Their victories came after Evans Rutto and Margaret Okayo won in London on Sunday. Cherigat finished in a time of 2:10.37, 1:12 clear of Cheboror.				 																																	The 31-year-old Ndereba times 2:24.27 to beat last years Tokyo Marathon winner Elfenesh Alemu of Ethiopia by just 16 seconds.				 																																	Sydney: Australias Olympic gold medallist Brett Aitken announced his retirement from international cycling on Tuesday.				 																																	Aitken, who teamed up with Scott McGrory to win gold in the Madison at Sydney four years ago, said he was quitting for family reasons. The 33-year-old has a disabled child and his wife is due to have twins in October, shortly after the Athens Olympics.

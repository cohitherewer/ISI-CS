The Telegraph - Calcutta
 2 amateur cueists for city camp
	 - WORLD amp; ASIAN MEETS  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Pankaj Advani will be looking for the billiards title Calcutta: Top amateur cueists of the country will assemble in Calcutta mid-August to take part in a coaching camp-cum-selection trials for the fourth Asian billiards and for the World snooker championships scheduled for later this year. The Billiards and Snooker Federation of India (BSFI) will hold the camp for the Indias top cueists including Pankaj Advani, Alok Kumar, Rafat Habib, Yasin Merchant, Devender Joshi, Ashok Shandilya and Saurav Kothari. This camp will be held at the newly constructed Billiards Hall of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) Eastern Centre complex from August 13 to 19. We will shortlist cueists for the international meets from this camp, said BSFI secretary C. Kapur told The Telegraph, on Saturday. According to Kapur, the hall was prepared much earlier but wasnt being used properly. The BSFI grabbed the opportunity to utilise the three boards with these trials. The dates for the Asian billiards meet havent been finalised. The World meet will be held in the Netherlands from November 20 to December 4. There will be eight billiards and the same number of snooker players (some players will play in both) vying for the six berths (three each) for the two meets. Pankaj Advani, being the current world champion, automatically selects himself in snooker. Contestants for the other two slots will be from Alok Kumar (Punjab), Yasin Merchant (Maharashtra), Rafat Habib (Railways), Rishav Tukral (Delhi), Brijesh Damani (Bengal), Manan Chandra (Delhi) and BVS Murthy (Karnakata). In billiards, Advani and Kumar apart, the six others will be B. Bhaskar (Punjab), Ashok Shandilya (Railways), Devender Joshi (Maharashtra), Mohammed Asim (Railways), Saurav Kothari (Bengal) and Dhruv Sidwata (Railways). The coaches, for the camp and to shortlist the teams, will be Michael Ferriera, Manoj Kothari and Subhas Agarwal. Meanwhile, a team of three, comprising Pankaj, Saurav and Aditya Mehtab, will leave for Carlow, Ireland, Sunday to compete in the world under-21 snooker meet starting July 27.  Copyright

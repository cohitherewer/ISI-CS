 Fear of defeat inspires Pollock
 Pollock is aiming for the 3000 run-300 wicket club Wellington: Allrounder Shaun Pollock today said the fear of becoming the first South African team to lose a series to New Zealand is all the motivation the tourists need for the third Test starting here on Friday. In stark contrast to five years ago, South Africa arrived in Wellington this week battling to save rather than win a series after being stung by nine wickets in Auckland. In 1999, Hansie Cronjes men won the deciding Test by eight wickets to take a 1-0 series victory. This time all New Zealand need is a draw to win a series against South Africa for the first time in their 72-year rivalry. Weve never lost to them before so its important we do everything in our power to win this Test and even the series, Pollock said. Theyve always been looked on as a small cricketing nation. We understand New Zealands very rugby focused and wed expect to beat them in regards to where were ranked (second to New Zealands sixth). But thats whats great about the game.Pollock said South Africas problems were both physical and mental  tiredness after 16 months of continuous cricket and the drudgery of being on a winless streak since the first one-dayer in Auckland six weeks ago. Pollock said it was up to the individuals to lift themselves several notches, particularly his bowling cohorts who have struggled throughout the tour. Pollock meanwhile hoped to steal Chris Cairns thunder by reaching his own big milestone in this Test. After Cairns joy at becoming the sixth member of the 3,000-run, 200-wicket group of six on Monday, Pollock is eyeing even more exclusive company if he scores just 102 more runs here. Im going for a different record, the 3,000, 300 mark. Theres only four guys in that group and its in the back of your mind to try and get the milestones, he said. Cairns and Sir Garfield Sobers do not have enough wickets to make the 3,000, 300 club, leaving just Ian Botham, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Richard Hadlee for Pollock to join.  (AFP)  Copyright

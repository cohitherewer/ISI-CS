The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Golden oldies shrug off poor form
	 - Kahn, Barthez, Sorensen begin in great style  Kahn celebrated his 35th birthday with a solid game versus the Dutch Lisbon: They say you have to be a little mad to be a goalkeeper, but with every mistake likely to lead to a goal being conceded shot-stoppers constantly face the wrath of teammates and fans alike. Three of Europes best came to Euro 2004 with formerly solid reputations looking frayed at the edges. Foremost among them was German skipper Oliver Kahn, who has cut a sad figure in recent months after a poor season at Bayern Munich and whose error in the World Cup final two years ago gifted Brazil their opening goal. Then there is French veteran Fabien Barthez, who became so error-prone at Manchester United that he slid to third choice a year ago prior to a move back to France with Marseille. Thomas Sorensen of Denmark arrived in Portugal looking to forget all about mistakes which gifted England two goals in their 2002 World Cup second-round encounter in Japan. But as England keeper David James said before the tournament got underway, if you dont come to terms with the bad times, you dont appreciate the good times as much. And with their respective first games under their belts in Portugal, the sun is shining once more on Kahn, Barthez and Sorensen. Barthez, veteran of Frances World Cup win in 1998 and Euro 2000 triumph, was a hero once more as Les Bleus defeated England 2-1 with two late Zinedine Zidane goals cementing a victory only made possible after the 32-year-old had saved former Old Trafford teammate David Beckhams second-half penalty. Under pressure from Gregory Coupet, who has won three straight French league titles with Lyon, Barthez has once again shown his qualities. Kahn, meanwhile, celebrated his 35th birthday and 69th cap with a solid and confident showing as Germany held traditional rivals The Netherlands to a 1-1 draw on Tuesday despite blooding several youngsters. We were determined to make a good start in this event and that is what we succeeded in doing, said Kahn. We had the Dutch under the cosh in the first half and overall we showed with this game what we are capable of. Sorensen, for his part, played a blinder in Denmarks entertaining goalless draw with Italy which gives the Danes, champions in 1992 against all expectations, every chance of reaching the second phase alongside either the Azzurri or neighbours Sweden. Sorensen made a string of superb saves, most notably from Alessandro Del Piero and Francesco Totti, to keep the Danes in contention for a place in the last eight and earn the Man-of-the-Match award. The big shot-stoppers form against the Azzurri was light years away from his nightmare against England in Niigata, Japan, where he could only help a Rio Ferdinand header into the net for the opening goal and then allowed an Emile Heskey effort to slide underneath his body into the net for the third. But just as past errors can be forgiven, so heroic saves leave keepers to bask in only a temporary afterglow. The eccentric Barthez spoke for his fellow-goaltenders in noting that the match against England is forgotten, now all concentration on the next game. Every match is a final.  (AFP)  Copyright

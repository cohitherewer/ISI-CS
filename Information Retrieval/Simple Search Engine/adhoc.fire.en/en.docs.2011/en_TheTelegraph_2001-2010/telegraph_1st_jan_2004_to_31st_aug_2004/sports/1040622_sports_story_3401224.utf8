 Rampant Portugal pull it off
 FROM PAUL HAYWARD IN LISBON  Portuguese fans celebrate in central Lisbon after the hosts beat Spain for the first time in 23 years on Sunday. (AP) Assuming France win group B on Monday night and England qualify in second, Sven-Goran Erikssons men will face a revived and sometimes rampant Portugal in the quarter finals of Euro 2004. The hosts scored their first victory in a competitive international against their bigger neighbour Sunday night while Greece finished runners-up in group A and Spain traipsed over the border in disgrace (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). So if the French deal with Switzerland and England achieve at least a draw against Croatia, Erikssons team will collide with Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United, the gifted Brazilian-born playmaker, Deco, and the imperious Luis Figo. A fine goal from the substitute Nuno Gomes sent Spain back to heartbreak hotel and completed Portugals great escape. An opening day defeat against Greece suggested they were about to join Belgium as the only European Championship hosts not to have made it beyond the group phase. In international football these days, Spain never quite kill the bull. Though the heat was on them, it was the host nation who were most desperate to reach the knock-out stage. This whole competition was intended as a display of Portuguese potency in the world. After spending four billion euros on infrastructure projects and 10 stadiums, seven new and three refurbished, the authorities in Lisbon were seeking a return on what their sports minister has called one of the greatest financial outlays ever in Portugal. But now Portugal were driven by gusts of national pride. With Luis Figo and Ronaldo raiding the flanks, they slashed at the Spanish full-backs, Puyol and Raul Bravo, creating few clear chances but providing most of the entertainment. Sunday night both teams invested in youth. Just as Portugal summoned Ronaldo for his first start of the tournament, so Inaki Saez of Spain called on the 20-year-old Fernando Torres from Atletico Madrid to sharpen his attack. Both are certain stars of the future. Though Pauleta trails only Eusebio and Luis Figo on Portugals list of all-time top scorers, he failed to impress in his countrys three group A games. At half-time, Nuno Gomes of nearby Benfica was summoned to lend greater thrust to the hosts finishing. Gomes came about a mile up the road from the Stadium of Light to the Jose Alvalade Stadium  but a much greater emotional distance from the international suspension he served for protesting excessively during Portugals semi-final defeat against France at Euro 2000. This time, in the 57th minute, Gomes made his statement not with his mouth but his feet. Turning between Helguera and Juanito 22-yards out, Gomes swept an exquisite shot to the right of Iker Casillas, and promptly disappeared under a mound of exultant colleagues. Spain, who had seemed content to play for a draw, were jolted into life by the fear of elimination. On 75 minutes, Albert Luque  on for Joaquin  aimed a powerful header past Rocardo only for Ricardo Carvalho to nod the ball off the line. Luques corner was then headed on to the crossbar by Juanito, who was swiftly replaced by Fernando Morientes as the Spanish threw three and sometimes four men forward in search of a parity. But Portugal were growing more dangerous. Costinha wasted a chance to finish the game, heading a sumptuous cross by Maniche over the bar when all alone, and then the tireless Maniche had a shot from a scorching counter-attack cleared off the line by Raul Bravo. The Portuguese blew imaginary whistles. And then they were through  maybe to face England, who will not want them to be in such rampant form.

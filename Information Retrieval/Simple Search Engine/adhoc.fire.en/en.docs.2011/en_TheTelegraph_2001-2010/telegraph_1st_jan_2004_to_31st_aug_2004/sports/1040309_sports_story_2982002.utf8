The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Confident Bagan take on Mahindra 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee sounded a warning on Monday  his team has got back the confidence to challenge anybody and is determined to make winning a habit in the remainder of the National Football League (NFL). The team is charged up after the win over Salgaocar (on Thursday). There is no question of thinking of anything but three points tomorrow, Mukherjee said on the eve of his teams clash with Mahindra United. That win also helped the team get back the confidence. And its time to make winning a habit, he added. The three-time champions have in their kitty 18 points from 13 matches, while the visitors from Mumbai have 23 off 14 outings. Mukherjee indicated Eduardo Rebeiro (who hit the winner against Salgaocar) would start with Ashim Biswas upfront. Midfielder Rocus Lamare will be assigned to mark S. Venkatesh. Echoing his coachs feeling, captain Rennedy Singh said the team was oozing confidence. Our defence has to be careful tomorrow. If we dont concede a goal, Im confident well definitely score one and win, he pointed out. Mahindra United coach David Booth ruled out giving special attention to any particular Mohun Bagan player. We believe in team game and well not deviate from it, he said. Booth, however, maintained Mohun Bagan would not be taken lightly. Apart from East Bengal (who currently lead the NFL table), Mohun Bagan belong to a class of those teams who can beat anybody on a given day, he opined. He refused to dwell too much on the Jose Ramirez Barreto-factor. Im concerned about those players (of Mohun Bagan) who are available, the Englishman said. Mahindra will miss Arun Malhotra, who was red-carded against East Bengal, as well as injured goalkeeper Nasim Akhtar who has been sent home. Sundar Rajan and Jinto Jose have been flown in as replacements from Mumbai.  Copyright

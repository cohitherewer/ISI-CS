The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venkat says Pak less formidable
 - The welcome in 1978-79 was unforgettable  Venkat is pretty impressed with Sami Chennai: Terming the tri-series defeat Down Under as an aberration on an otherwise successful tour, former India captain S. Venkatraghavan said India go in as the favourites against a less formidable Pakistan in the upcoming series. Our performance in Australia was superb. Forget the last two matches, those were aberrations rather than a rule, Venkatraghavan said on Sunday. Our players performed so well and their confidence level being so high, the team should lift itself up. If Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan get to really bowl to their potential and perform well, then it (Indias bowling attack) will be a different one, said Venkat, who recently said he will step down as an ICC elite umpire next month. As for the current Pakistan team, Venkat felt they were in a learning process. Definitely one can say the Pakistanis are not the same formidable side that they were. Probably, there is a curve and the present team members are in the learning process. Their bowling is also weak. He said the outcome of the series would hinge on what sort of wickets we come across. They have three experienced campaigners in Inzamam-ul Haq, Yousuf Youhana and Rashid Latif. I am pretty impressed with young fast bowler Mohammed Sami, and they have Shoaib Akhtar as well, he said. The mention of Indias tour of Pakistan, the first since 1989-90, made Venkat nostalgic. For, he was part of the 1978-79 team that visited Pakistan when the two countries, like now, re-established sporting contacts after a more than two-decade gap. It happened almost 27 years ago. I remember the reception that we got at Karachi airport, it was phenomenal, he recalled. The welcome was something one can never forget. It was very warm and I distinctly remember that they had formed a cavalcade throughout the route from airport to hotel and the crowd was waving both Pakistan and India flags together on the entire stretch of the route. Initial reaction was pretty good. That is the first thing that I remember. There were lot of receptions to the team, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

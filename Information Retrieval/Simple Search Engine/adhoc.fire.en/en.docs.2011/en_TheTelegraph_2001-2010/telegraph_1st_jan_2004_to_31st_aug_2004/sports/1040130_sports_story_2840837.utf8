The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Reid thinks Nehra must change style
Perth: Bruce Reid feels Indians should bowl more yorkers if they are to fox the Australians in the tri-series. I will work with the fast bowlers to improve on their yorkers. It could be a big weapon, said the bowling coach, who will join the team for the remaining two league games and for the finals. The former Aussie paceman has been impressed by Irfan Pathan. He is doing very well for a 19-year-old. I like his attitude. He has the potential to be a very good bowler, provided he adds a yard of pace. He can also bat and can become the allrounder India are looking for. Reid felt Ashish Nehra has to reassess his style. I reckon he has to completely change his methods. I am told he was a good swing bowler early in his career but lately his wrist action is not very steady. A couple of ideas could help him but he would have to take that major decision about his bowling ways. He is pretty set in his style and would have to dismantle it. He has to do couple of things straightaway  he has to be fit and again, he could only be fit if his front foot comes down in line with the pitch. At present his back leg is pointing towards mid-off and it is a very damaging style, Reid said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kapil Dev feels Indian attack has come of age
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Kapil says Akram has every right to offer tips to anyone he pleases Calcutta: About a decade has elapsed since Kapil Dev bowled his last delivery in international cricket. Yet, the emotion that comes attached with the very name is still evident wherever he travels. Like at the Calcutta Book Fair on Thursday, when the living legend inaugurated his autobiography, Straight from the Heart. He gave the Indian pace attack a new meaning, and he was happy to discuss whether the Indian attack had come of age. Yes they have, I really feel happy when everyone talks about them. But he wasnt quite sure whether bowling coach Bruce Reid had, indeed, given a new lease of life to Zaheer Khan amp; Co. I dont think anybody can change something overnight. The new breed of Indian pacers have the talent in them, therefore, they are delivering. But its the possibility of injuries to these pacers which makes him a little edgy. Theyre playing too much cricketthe pacers should be guarding against injuries. And that was his main advice for the precocious Irfan Pathan. Work hard during the off-season so that you dont get injured He is a talent, no doubt about it But Pathan has to guard against injuries, Kapil elaborated. Just the right advice from someone who never sat out a Test match in 15 years with injury. As the topic shifted to the hullaballoo being created over Wasim Akram giving tips to Indians, Kapil said: Those who are creating such a noise about Akram giving tips to Pathan, are actually insulting the Pakistan great. Akram has years of experience behind him and has every right to help anybody who asks for advice Kapil also didnt conform to Imran Khans views that Indian batsmen will have a tough time facing the battery of Pakistan pacers in the forthcoming series. It might just be the reverse to what Imran said Indian batsmen may very well make things extremely difficult for the Pakistan pacemen. However, he sounded sure of the fact that the series will be quite an enthralling one. Itll be evenly poised with both testing each others skill to the core.  Encouragement session The India under-19 boys will get some good advice before they embark on their World Cup campaign in Bangladesh next month. Ill meet them for dinner in the first week of February. It will be an informal gathering, but Im sure they will be encouraged, Kapil signed off.  Copyright

 Harrison gets 2-year suspension
 BY ALAN ABRAHAMSON The US track and field programme, scandalised by a rash of doping cases, took another blow on Monday when sprinter Calvin Harrison, a gold-medallist at the 2000 Sydney Games, was suspended for two years for a second violation. The ruling, unless reversed on appeal, leaves Harrison ineligible for the 2004 Games, which begin in 10 days. He had been named to the 1,600m relay pool. His attorney, Ed Williams of New York, said it was not immediately clear whether they would appeal to the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport. The USADA said the sanction is the 12th it has announced this year against a track and field athlete, accounting for more than half of the 23 sanctions it has imposed in 2004 against US athletes in all Olympic sports. The 30-year-old Harrison, of Raleigh (North Califirnia), tested positive for the banned stimulant modafinil at last years US championships in Stanford. In 1993 he tested positive for pseudoephedrine, a stimulant that was banned at the time but no longer. The second positive test prompted the two-year suspension. The suspension began July 26, the date of the hearing in the case. Harrison did not attend the hearing, according to the ruling from a three-member arbitration panel. Were pleased that the panel confirmed USADAs position that athletes are warned not to take drugs, and should be held accountable when they do, said Travis Tygart, USADAs chief legal counsel. Said Williams: They didnt accept my argument that track and field officials placed an unfair burden on the athlete. The decision leaves the US relay squad and, by extension, the track team, in limbo. The 2004 Games begin on August 13. US officials have a few days after that, until just before the track and field competition begins, to finalise the US roster. Harrison won gold in the 1,600m relay in Sydney. His twin brother, Alvin, silver-medallist in the 400 in Sydney, was also on the winning relay team. The IOC might strip the entire 2000 US 1,600m team of its medals because Jerome Young, who ran in the early rounds, tested positive in 1999 for nandrolone. The USADA, meantime, is seeking a life ban against Alvin Harrison and three others, relying in part on evidence obtained through the prosecution of the BALCO case in federal court in San Francisco. The others are Tim Montgomery, world-record holder in the 100m dash; Michelle Collins, the 2003 world indoor 200m winner; Chryste Gaines, two-time Olympic relay medallist. In the criminal case, four men  including BALCO founder Victor Conte  are facing a welter of federal charges, including allegations of distribution to athletes of banned substances such as the designer steroid THG. Each has pleaded not guilty. Of the 12 track-related sanctions the USADA has announced in 2004, four involve THG: middle-distance champion and three-time Olympian Regina Jacobs; hammer throwers John McEwen, runner-up at the 2003 US championships, and Michelle Phillips, the 2003 US womens winner; Kevin Toth, the 2003 US shotput champion. Jacobs announced her retirement but nonetheless was hit with a four-year ban, the other three received two-year suspensions.  LAT-WP NEWS SERVICE  Copyright

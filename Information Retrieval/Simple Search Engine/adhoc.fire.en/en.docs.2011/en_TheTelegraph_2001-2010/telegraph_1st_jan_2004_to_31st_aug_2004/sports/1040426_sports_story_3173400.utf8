 Ronaldo: Ill follow David anywhere 
	 - Brazilian heaps praise on the English star  Ronaldo wants to play alongside Beckham for years to come London: Should England captain David Beckham move from Spanish giants Real Madrid to Premier League big-spenders Chelsea in the summer he is likely to be joined by Brazils World Cup hero Ronaldo. Ronaldo told the News of the World he had been so impressed by the service he received from Beckham he would follow him anywhere and if it happened to be Chelsea so be it. It is my dream to play in the Premiership and it would be perfect if it was with David, said Ronaldo, who leads the scorers list this seaosn with 24. If that place is Chelsea  very good. I will ask for Davids opinion. I cant think of anybody who knows more about football in England than him. I can assure you that David and I will play together in the same side for many years to come. I will go wherever he goes, he added. Ronaldo told the newspaper that he was far keener to be on the same side as Beckham than on the opposing one, despite Brazil having got the better of England in the World Cup quarter final in 2002. When you actually play alongside David you get to see how good he really is, said Ronaldo. I have played against him and with him and can say with 100 per cent certainty I would always rather play with him. David has so much creativity when the ball is at his feet, he amazes even me. I know when he has the ball, unexpected things happen. Thats why he is so important.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Md Sami to represent Pak
Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has nominated young fast bowler Mohammed Sami to represent the country at Mondays official launch of the ICC Champions Trophy at Lords, media reports said on Sunday. The decision to nominate Sami for the ceremony instead of any senior player was termed as a new trend by The News which said that even though many other players are also playing in England, the PCB preferred the 22-year-old. Although senior players like Saqlain Mushtaq, Shoaib Akhtar and Azhar Mahmood are presently playing in England for different counties, the PCB, it is learnt, has nominated Sami for the honour of representing Pakistan in the photo call, it said. Cricket boards generally nominate the captain or a senior player but the PCB, apparently, has decided to set a new trend. PCB to write to Durham PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has expressed surprise at the batting heroics of Shoaib Akhtar in a county championship match and said he would write to the Durham county club to make sure the fast bowler did not aggravate his injury, if he has one. As the news of Shoaibs gutsy batting display in his first appearance for Durham this season in a crucial match against Somerset on Saturday reached him, the PCB chief expressed surprise that Shoaib has started playing so early despite claims of injury. Batting at number nine, he made 46 which helped Durham to a one- wicket victory. (PTI)  Copyright

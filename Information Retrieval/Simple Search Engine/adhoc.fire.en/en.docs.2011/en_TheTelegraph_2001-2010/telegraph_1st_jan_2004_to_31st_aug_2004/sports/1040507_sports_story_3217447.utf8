The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Johl surges ahead of Harrington
 - MACAU OPEN 
- Indian opens up one-shot lead in Round I  Amandeep Johl in action in Macau on Thursday. (AFP) Macau: Yoga-practising Indian journeyman Amandeep Johl set a new course record to open up a one-shot lead after the first round of the $275,000 Macau Open on Thursday. Johl rattled off seven birdies, one eagle and no bogeys for a blistering 62, one shot better than the par-71 Macau Golf and Country Clubs previous course record of 63. The 35-year-old from Chandigarh also upstaged Irish Ryder Cup star Padraig Harrington, who was left disappointed after he could only muster what he called a boring two-under-par 69 in perfect conditions. Johl, who is chasing his first victory on the Asian Tour after 10 fruitless years on the circuit, leads by one from South African Nico Van Rensburg, who shot an eight-under-par 63, with Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant on seven under. Americas Jason Knutzon and Taiwanese duo Wang Ter-chang and Lin Wen-tang are a further shot back after carding six-under-par 65s, one clear of eight players tied on five under. Johls scintillating display further underscored the growing strength of Indian golf, following rookie Rahil Gangjees triumph at the Volkswagen Masters in Beijing last week. The Indian veteran attributed Thursdays dream first round to clear thinking, revealing that two-hour sessions of yoga every day had strengthened his powers of concentration. All day I just told myself Just stay out of your own way, dont think too much. And I was able to do that, which was the key thing, Johl said. Im doing everything right at the moment. Im doing yoga and mind-training for about two hours every day. Its part of the routine now, he said. You learn to detach, and that helps a lot in golf. It helped today. Johl started strongly with three birdies in his opening six holes, but said the turning point came at the 373-yard par-four eighth, where a sand wedge from 60 yards rolled in for an eagle two. It just popped in and that turned everything round, said Johl, who rattled in a hattrick of birdies on the 11th, 12th and 13th before sinking another on the par-four 16th. Harrington was left cursing a solid but unspectacular opening round, which included three birdies and one bogey.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tollygunge rally to 2-1 victory
 - Sandip, Habeeb strikes allow hosts breathing space in National League  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge Agragamis Akeem Abolanle (right) in a tussle for the ball with Haywards Sportings Louis Aniweta during their National Football League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: On the back of a sparkling second-half display, Tollygunge Agragami rallied to script a 2-1 victory over Haywards Sporting Club at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. It was a deserving victory for the local side and it allowed them some breathing space in the first division of the National Football League. Former Tollygunge player Abdulateef Seriki put the Goans ahead in the 13th minute. But Sandip Das and Sheikh Habeeb Ali scored in quick succession to ensure full points for the home team. Tollygunge now have 13 points from as many matches while the NFL debutants remain on 16. Having to overcome the early shock of conceding a goal was not an easy task for Krishnendu Roys boys, more so against the ever-consistent Haywards. However, the genesis of the teams fightback was in the way Krishnendu utilised his striking weapon, Habeeb. Between Haywards Sportings goal  which was, in fact, the first positive goalmouth move of the match  and Habeebs introduction as Ajay Singhs replacement in the 35th minute, there was hardly any sign that Tollygunge Agragami will win so convincingly. But the nippy strikers sudden sprint and alacrity in chasing the ball exposed a few cracks in the rival defence. He also inspired his teammates to come out with a different mindset. Habeeb didnt play a direct role in his teams equaliser, but his backstage involvement couldnt be denied at all. Just on the stroke of halftime, Amitava Chanda took a rasping shot from the top box. It was so powerful that the Haywards Sporting goalkeeper Felix DSouza could not hold on to it and Sandip quickly followed the rebound to slot home. Habeeb, however, made no mistake in delivering the knockout punch on the rivals four minutes into the second half. Felix should also be blamed for handing Tollygunge Agragami the winning goal. When Habeeb  brought in the team on lien from George Telegraph  jumped to meet a left-wing Napoleon Singh cross, neither any defender nor the goalkeeper challenged him inside the six-yard box. The striker gleefully obliged with a pin-point header.  Following a disappointing (2-3) loss to Churchill Brothers, my boys were upset and so, I desperately needed a point to boost their morale. Todays win, therefore, is not only invaluable but also inspiring for us, Krishnendu later told reporters. He further revealed that the decision of holding back Habeeb was a significant part of his strategy. I deliberately wanted to see off the initial bursts from Haywards Sporting. Shamsi (Reza) was up to the task as a defensive screen. So once things got settled, I brought in Habeeb and that move paid off, the Tollygunge coach explained. In another move, Krishnendu had pitted his two foreigners in the backline  Ebi Bar Bar and Isiaka Awoyemi  as markers against Dudu Omagbemi and Seriki. The Haywards Sporting attackers were bottled up to such an extent that they were given hardly any space to operate. With the Goa side going all out in search of their second goal, Tollygunge got too many chances to extend the lead. Habeeb twice and Gauranga Dutta once were handed sitters on a platter. But they could not get past Felix, who was somehow inexplicably coming up till the halfline, from a one-to-one situation. Meanwhile, Tollygunges Gautam Debnath and Haywards Sporting reserve Dipankar Chowdhury were picked for dope test after the match. Teams Tollygunge Agragami: Chinmoy Banerjee; Kabijit Khotel, Isiaka Awoyemi, Ebi Bar Bar, Amitava Chanda; Napoleon Singh (Gauranga Dutta, 72), Sandip Das, Shamsi Reza, Jiten Rai, Ajay Singh (Sheikh Habeeb Ali, 35, Sujit Neogi, 90); Akeem Abolanle.

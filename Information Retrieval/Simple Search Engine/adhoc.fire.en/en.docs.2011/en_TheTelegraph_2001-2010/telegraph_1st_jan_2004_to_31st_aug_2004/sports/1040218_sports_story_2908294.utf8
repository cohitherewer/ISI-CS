 East clinch first-innings lead
Dharamshala: East Zone secured first innings lead against South Zone in their Duleep Trophy match which ended on Tuesday. Chasing Easts 388, South managed 332 in their first innings, which sealed the fate of the match. Having gained a decisive lead of 56 runs, East overcame a few hiccups in their second innings and declared at 211 for nine. South didnt lose a wicket in the four overs they played in their second innings. East Zone now have five points while South get three. It was good lead for East Zone, who play their last match against England A in Amritsar from February 27. With just one team from the group making the final, East now stand a good chance of reaching the title-round. The start of East Zones second innings was stuttering. Openers Shiv Sundar Das (who scored 120 in the first innings) and Deep Dasgupta, Arindam Das and Rajeev Kumar all fell cheaply before captain Devang Gandhi and Rohan Gavaskar steadied the ship. It was a big disappointment for Deep (0). He is in reckoning for a place in the Indian squad for the Pakistan series, but the failures in both innings did no good to his chances. Devang, who failed to capitalise on a good start in the first innings, made 87 and shared a steady stand with Rohan. The junior Gavaskar fell for 37 and Devang had another fruitful partnership with Laxmi Ratan Shukla (22). For South Sunil Joshi once again shone with figures of three for 48. S. Shreeshanth (two for 47) and R. Ramkumar (two for 68) gave Joshi some good support. Earlier, East Zone took about half-an-hour to wrap up the South Zone tail. South resumed at 304 for eight. Utpal Chatterjee struck first, removing R. Ramakumar before Sourashish Lahiri dismissed last man S. Sreeshanth. N.P. Singh remained not out. For East Zone, Lahiri finished with three wickets. Utpal, Shib Shankar Paul and Debashish Mohanty took two wickets apiece. Jadhav hits ton Dhiraj Jadhav compiled a marathon century as West Zone batted out the final day for a dour draw with Central in the Duleep Trophy league match at the Devi Lal Stadium in Gurgaon. West reached 352 for four in reply to Centrals first innings score of 549. With the first innings remaining unfinished, the teams earned no points after four days of toil on a lifeless track. Both the sides will have everything to play for when they play their next games. Jadhav made 154 in a tortoise-like innings that lasted nine hours and 18 minutes, and consumed 445 balls but only nine times did the ball go past the boundary rope. Another patient knock came from Hrishikesh Kanitkar who was unlucky to fall four short of a century. His 96 came from six hours and 45 minutes, needed 285 balls and contained nine fours. Kanitkar and Jadhav added 213 runs for the second wicket from 615 balls to grind the central bowling to dust. Jacob Martin remained unbeaten on 50 but his innings was no less in length, spanning 219 minutes and 181 balls with six fours. Central take on North in the group match from Saturday at the Nehru Stadium here. Brief scores Central Zone 549. West Zone 352/4 (D Jadav 154, H Kanitkar 96, J Martin 50 n.o.; Kulamani Parida 2/37 (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
On the threshold of history and in the midst of accomplishment  Zisis Vryzas CZECH REPUBLIC  The Czech Republic have no players suspended for this match.  Marek Jankulovski, Tomas Ujfalusi and Pavel Nedved would be suspended for the final if they receive a yellow card in the match.  Pavel Nedved (Juventus) missed the Champions League 2002-2003 final against AC Milan due to suspension.  Jan Kollers goal against Denmark took him into the top three of his countrys all-time top scorers list. He is now on 29 goals and needs two goals to go equal second on the list with Zdenek Nehoda. Antonin Puc is top of the list with 34 goals.  Karel Poborsky, who has 98 caps, could become the first Czech player ever to reach a century of caps at Euro 2004 provided his nation reaches the final and he plays in both matches.  Poborsky has six all-time European Championship finals assists, more than any other player.  If he plays, Poborsky will equal the competition record for most European Championship finals matches which is currently held by Lilian Thuram and Zinedine Zidane, who have played 14 matches. He will break the record if the Czechs reach the final and he plays.  The Czechs have already used all but one of their 23 players. Third choice goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky is the only player who has not featured.  Poborsky has played the most minutes, 291 minutes, for the Czech Republic at Euro 2004. Tomas Galasek is the only Czech player who has started in all four games.  Milan Baros has now scored in all four matches at Euro 2004, just one match short of Michel Platinis record for scoring in most consecutive matches.  Baros two goals against Denmark have brought his total in this tournament to five making him the current leading scorer. On the all time list of European Championship finals leading scorers he has now moved into fourth position.  Baros has scored 21 goals in 29 international matches. This is an average of 0.72 goals per match. No other Euro 2004 player has a higher average.  Baros has also scored in the last six Czech internationals.  The Czech Republic have won nine successive competitive matches which is one of the best ever streaks by a European nation. In each of the nine matches the Czech have scored at least two goals.  Their own personal best is an 11 competitive match winning streak between December 1997 and October 1999.  The Czechs have also won five successive European Championship finals matches, equalling the French and Dutch record.  In the last five European Championship finals matches, the Czechs have scored at least two goals. France hold the record of nine consecutive European Championship matches with two or more goals scored. That streak was ended by Greece in the quarter final of Euro 2004.  The Czechs have played two previous European Championship finals  winning on penalties against West Germany in 1976 and losing to a golden goal against Germany 20 years later.  Pavel NedvedGREECE  No Greek players are suspended for this match. Giorgos Karagounis and Theodoros Zagorakis will be suspended for the final if booked. Karagounis was suspended for the third group match against Russia after receiving two yellow cards in the first two matches of the tournament.  Zisis Vryzas will win his 50th cap if he plays.  Midfielder Theodoros Zagorakis, who has not scored a single international goal, is the second most-capped Greek player ever with 93. Only Efstratios Apostolakis, who won 95 caps between 1986 and 1998, has played more times for Greece.  Goalkeeper Antonis Nikopolidis, defenders Traianos Dellas, Michalis Kapsis and Yourkas Seitaridis and midfielder Theodoros Zagorakis are the five Greek players who have not missed a single minute of Euro 2004.  It is the first time Greece have qualified for the semi-finals of a major tournament. In 1980, their only other European Championship finals appearance, they finished bottom of their group behind eventual winners West Germany, Czechoslovakia and The Netherlands.  In 1994, Greece finished bottom of their group during their only appearance at a World Cup.  The Greek squad is the third oldest in Portugal. Only the Latvians and the French have a higher average age.  Greece are facing their fourth former European Championship winner at Euro 2004. In the group phase they eliminated Russia (1960) and Spain (1964). In the quarter-final Greece knocked out defending champions France.  Greece can become the second country to qualify for the final after being absent from the previous edition. The Czech Republic, absent in 1992, reached the final at Euro 1996. MISCELLANEOUS  Greece have played the Czech Republic/Czechoslovakia six times before.  The Czech Republic clearly have the upper hand with five wins and a draw. Greece have scored just two goals in these six matches. The Czech Republic have scored 11.  The only previous competitive encounter dates back to Euro 1980 when Czechoslovakia beat Greece 3-1 in the group phase. Anthimos Kapsis, father of Greek defender Michalis Kapsis, played the full 90 minutes in that game on June 14, 1980.  The last meeting dates back to April 17, 2002 when a friendly in Ioannina ended in a 0-0 draw.  The match was Otto Rehhagels eighth match in charge of Greece. He fielded 13 players who are in the Euro 2004 squad.  The match was Karel Brueckners fourth in charge of the Czech Republic. He fielded 12 players who are in the current squad.  Striker Stepan Vachousek made his international debut for the Czech Republic in that match.  Both countries won their quarter final without needing extra-time.  The Czech Republic are the only remaining team with a 100 per cent record. France, who won all five of their matches at Euro 84, are the only team to ever win this tournament with a 100 per cent record since the group phase was introduced.  Brueckner has lost no competitive matches as coach of the Czech Republic. He has won 11 competitive matches and drawn one, a 1-1 draw against The Netherlands.  The winners of the last two European Championship finals have come from the group containing the Czech Republic. Germany (1996) and France (2000) both competed with the Czechs in the group phase.  Italian Pierluigi Collina is the referee for this match. This will be his third match at Euro 2004.  No country with a foreign trainer has ever won the World Cup or European Championship. Rehhagel is from Germany while Brueckner is a Slovakian.MISCELLANEOUS Greece have played the Czech Republic/Czechoslovakia six times before.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India blank Pak 3-0
Chandigarh: India blanked Pakistan 3-0 in the three-Test series to win the Rexello Castors Peace Cup snooker tournament here on Sunday. After beating their arch-rivals in the first two Tests, the Indians won the inconsequential third test 6-1. World amateur champion Pankaj Advani, who had looked out of nick in singles over the past two days, regained his form and outwitted Imran Shahzad 94-0, 75-6. (PTI)  Copyright

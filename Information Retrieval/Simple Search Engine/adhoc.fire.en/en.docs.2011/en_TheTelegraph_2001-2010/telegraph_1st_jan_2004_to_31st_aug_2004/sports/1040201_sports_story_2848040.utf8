The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Federer faces the giant Russian test
Melbourne, Jan. 31 (Reuters): Top of the world and seemingly untouchable, Roger Federer is a red-hot favourite to slay Russian goliath Marat Safin in the final of the Australian Open on Sunday. After becoming the first Swiss man to reach number one, second seed Federer will be anxious that his ascent to the top of the world rankings does not fall flat against a resurgent Safin. The Wimbledon champion pulverised third seed Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 after convincing wins against Lleyton Hewitt and nemesis David Nalbandian. However, Federer knows the danger posed by Safin. Former world No.1 Safin, who ended Agassis 26-match win streak in Melbourne with a 7-6, 7-6, 5-7, 1-6, 6-3 semi-final victory, has already made a mockery of his low ranking. Marat has definitely got the game to win these tournaments, said Federer, who is playing his first Grand Slam since splitting from Swedish coach Peter Lundgren. Marats a nice guy... and its good to see him back. Were all happy. But were scared at the same time. Safin has been making up for a frustrating 2003  during which he won just 12 matches  and will be on a mission to become the first unseeded Australian Open champion since Mark Edmondson won in 1976. I came here to try to win it, shrugged Safin, who lost the 2002 final to Swedens Thomas Johansson. Federer, he has great talent. You have to be careful with him but this is a completely different final. Im full of confidence and its a completely different story. Hes really tough on this surface. You cant get up on him with a kick serve because hes so tall and so strong with his backhand, said Federer, who has never played Safin on a hardcourt. For Safin, fatigue could be a critical factor. He has battled through three five-setters in six matches. The 2000 US Open champion could barely stand after his gritty win over Agassi, although an extra day of rest will have helped the recovery process.  Copyright

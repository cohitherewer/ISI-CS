 Tolly hold Vasco in Goa
Margao: Tollygunge Agragami wasted clear chances to settle for a goalless draw in their National Football League (NFL) match against Vasco at the Nehru Stadium here on Thursday. Vasco have now drawn six of their eight matches for a tally of nine points, while Tollygunge have seven points from the same number of matches. The first half was mainly confined to midfield with Vasco failing in their bid to penetrate the Tollygunge defence because of too many mispasses. Vasco looked threatening in the closing minutes, but Amechi and Agnelo Gomes failed to find the target from close. (PTI)  Copyright

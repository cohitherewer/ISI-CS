 Atwal misses cut again
Duluth (Georgia): Arjun Atwal failed to make the cut after shooting another six over 78 on Day II of the Bellsouth Classic at the par-72 TPC in Sugarloaf on Friday. This is the second consecutive tournament in which Atwal, the only Indian on the PGA Tour, has failed to make the money rounds, the first being two weeks ago at the Bayhill Invitational in Orlando.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Junior lifts EB again 
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Md. Sporting gift Indian Bank first point  Junior scored his  fourth goal in as many matches  Bhaichung played  perfect foil for JuniorMumbai: Defending champions notched up their maiden away win in the National Football League when Brazilian recruit Cristiano Lima Junior struck in their solitary goal victory over local outfit Mahindra United at the Cooperage here on Wednesday. Junior scored in the 68th minute on a pass from star India international Bhaichung Bhutia, just in front of the goalmouth. With this win, East Bengal increased their points tally to 11 from seven matches while Mahindra remain at 12 points. Mahindra enjoyed better ball-possession in the first half and could have taken the lead in the second minute, but Abhishek Yadavs header off a James Singh flag-kick took the crosspiece before being cleared by a defender. Mahindra continued with strikes, but failed to find the target. The Calcutta giants too had an opportunity, in the 33rd minute. When substitute Sur Kumar Singhs long shot fell Bhaichungs way, the striker was on a vantage position. However, Bhaichung hit the crosspiece before Mahindra custodian Kalyan Chowbey regrouped himself to claim the ball. The home team again came near to scoring in the 37th minute when Yadav headed to unmarked Kasif Jamal. But the latter committed the mistake of missing the target at close quarters. Bhaichung, who had an unimpressive first half, again messed up a scoring opportunity when he hit the ball into Chowbeys hands when he reached out for a brilliant cross from Junior in the 40th minute. After the change of ends East Bengal came into themselves and dominated throughout, with umpteen scoring opportunities. The matchwinner also came through at this time. Receiving a pass from the mid-third Bhaichung, marked by two defenders, brilliantly relayed the ball to Junior who was advancing from the right. The Brazilian collected smoothly and slotted home quickly. Mahindra, in desperate search for the equaliser, nearly succeeded when substitute Parveen Aroras hit on Felix Aboagyes pass was well saved by East Bengal goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee. Goalless draw Dishing out an impressive performance Indian Bank finally managed to break their losing streak and earn a point, playing out a goalless draw with Mohammedan Sporting in the National Football League here Wednesday evening. The bankmen were a transformed lot compared to their earlier six matches and impressed with their attacking game against the Calcutta team looking to settle scores with the local outfit for their relegation to the second division last year. Mohammedan Sporting are currently a rung above Indian Bank, in 11th place. Indian Bank took time to settle down, but thereafter the Sri Lankan duo of Nadika Jayasurya and medio Fazlur Rahman combined well with Sabir Pasha in attack. The three came near scoring once each, but were thwarted either by the defenders or by goalkeeper Gumpe Rime. Late in the first session Mohammedan Sporting saw more of the ball and some good work by Bungo Singh and strikers Nigerian Edeh Chidi and Dipendu Biswas, put the bankmen in a spot of bother. Mohammedan Sporting had their best chance in the ninth minute when Bank custodian Edward Felix advanced from his charge. A tailor-made forward pass by Chidi was well taken by Nabi, but he sent the ball over the crosspiece. The verdict, thus, was quite disappointing for the Calcutta club, who looked buoyed to regain their lost ground after notching up their maiden NFL win in the last match. Mohammedan Sporting, under new coach Jamshed Nassiri, beat Tollygunge Agragami at home. The club also made debut in the premier tournament. (PTI)  Copyright

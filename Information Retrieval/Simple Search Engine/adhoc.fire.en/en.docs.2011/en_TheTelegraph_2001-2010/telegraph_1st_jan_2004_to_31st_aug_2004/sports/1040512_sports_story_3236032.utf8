 Hussain should be dropped: Botham
 - If you have an exodus of senior players, it will be difficult for youngsters to take their place  Botham feels England selectors need to blood a young player into the middle-order London: England great Ian Botham called Tuesday on the selectors to drop Nasser Hussain and bring in a new middle-order batsman. Botham is worried that with Hussain, 36, Graham Thorpe 35 in August and Surrey teammate Mark Butcher 32 the same month, England will be confronted by several retirements from their middle-order in quick succession unless they take action now to blood a younger player. And legendary allrounder Botham told BBC Radio Five that former captain Hussain should be the one to make way for the likes of either Middlesex left-hander Andrew Strauss or Durham allrounder Paul Collingwood. Despite everything he (Hussain) has done for us, I think its time now for a Strauss, a Collingwood or whoever to come in to that middle order, Botham said. Because its much easier for someone to come in and settle down when hes got players like Thorpe and Butcher around. If suddenly you have an exodus of three senior players, which could easily happen with Thorpe, Butcher and Hussain, then its very difficult for those youngsters to come in and take their place. So I think we should take a leaf out of the Australians book and say okay, thanks a lot Nas, but now weve got to go forward. England are due to name Sunday their squad for next weeks first Test against New Zealand at Lords. Hussain needs just five more matches to reach his publicly stated goal of playing 100 Tests for England, a landmark he could reach during the current home season where seven Tests in all, three against New Zealand and four against the West Indies, are scheduled. During Englands 3-0 Test series win in the Caribbean concluded last month, Essexs Hussain had a modest return of 197 runs in seven innings at an average of 32.83 with a best score of 58.

 Simon Jones cleared for Windies tour
London: Fast bowler Simon Jones has been cleared to join the England squad in West Indies after a scan on his shin bone revealed no major problems, a team official said Friday. The 25-year-old was added to the squad Monday after proving he had recovered from a long-term knee problem on tour in India with England A. He had a bone scan Thursday on his left shin and that was clear. Hes going to fly out on Monday lunchtime, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokesman Andrew Walpole said from the Caribbean. Jones will not be able to play in Mondays warm-up match in Jamaica but will be available for the first Test of the four-match series which starts on March 11.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

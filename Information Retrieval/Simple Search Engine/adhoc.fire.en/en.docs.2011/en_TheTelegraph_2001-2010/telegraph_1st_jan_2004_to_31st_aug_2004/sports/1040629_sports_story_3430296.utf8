The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara wants to build on England victory
 - I want to see this young team really contesting against big teams in four or five years  Lara is happy to see Dwayne Bravo come up trumps Nottingham: West Indies captain Brian Lara warned his side not to become complacent after their crushing seven-wicket NatWest series one-day International win against England at Trent Bridge on Sunday. The result took the West Indies to the top of the table following their washed out opener Saturday against New Zealand, the third side in this triangular event, at Edgbaston. But Lara insisted this victory would count for nothing when West Indies played their next series match, on Thursday, against England under the Headingley floodlights. We know its going to be a different story. Its going to be an improved England team and we have to have an improved performance to stay on top, Lara told reporters following an impressive West Indian display. After Lara won the toss, West Indies bowled out England for 147  the hosts lowest-ever one-day International total at Trent Bridge. All his youthful pace attack chipped in, with 20-year-old medium pacer Dwayne Bravo taking career-best one-day International figures of three for 26. Im not surprised but I am happy they came up trumps, Lara said. Its good to see for our cricket. Lara himself was there at the finish on 32 not out made from just 33 balls. But the batting honours belonged to his fellow lefthander Chris Gayle, the opener unbeaten on 60 off 90 balls with nine fours. The duo shared an unbroken stand of 55 in 45 balls and Lara said: Ive been batting really well. Im always very confident of my form going into a game. What I am enjoying now is seeing the guys scoring runs the (Shivnarine) Chanderpauls, the Chris Gayles putting their heads down and scoring runs. In April, Lara regained the world record for the highest individual Test score when he made 400 not out against England. But West Indies, who have been struggling in the five-day game they dominated for most of the 1970s and 1980s, lost the four-match series 3-0. And when they could only manage a draw in their next Test, at home to minnows Bangladesh, Lara threatened to resign the captaincy. But he insisted at the time he had done that to spark his side and stressed on Sunday there was no contest when it came to personal milestones or team success. Theres a lot of chat about the world record and the 501 (Laras world record first-class score made for Warwickshire against Durham in 1994), Lara said. But what has always driven me is playing for West Indies. Being at a low ebb now, our cricket, its given me that something more to continue. I want to see us get back to the top and whatever I achieve personally is not very important. I want to see this young team really contesting against the big teams in the world in four or five years. That is enough drive for me and Im sure thats enough drive for the young ones alongside me. Vaughans challenge Meanwhile England captain Michael Vaughan challenged his side to bounce back against New Zealand at Chester-le-Street on Tuesday and demonstrate the resilience that last year saw them win the series final against South Africa after losing their opening match against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge. We are going to have do exactly the same again and show all our fighting attributes, Vaughan said. (AFP)  Copyright

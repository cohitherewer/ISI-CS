 Humpy in Round 2
Elista (Kalmykia): Koneru Humpy stormed into the second round of the world womens chess championship with a crushing victory over Cecile van der Merwe of South Africa in the second game of the first round on Sunday. WGM S. Meenakshi bowed out of the championship after going down to Iweta Radziewicz of Poland in her second game as also WGM D. Harika, who lost her second straight game against the higher-ranked Viktorija Cmilyte of Lithuania. Humpy, the top seed, needed just a draw to advance to the next round of the two-game mini-match after having won the first game. The Indian, though, was determined to win her second game as well. Playing white, Humpy forced an advantage in a Benoni Defence game as Cecile conceded an easy and effective grip in the centre. Quite on the expected lines, Humpy went for the thematic break on the queenside in the middle-game to open a second front and soon after found her opponent crumbling under pressure. Even the exchange of queens by the South African did not help her as Humpy made decisive inroads with her fire-spitting bishops and rook to force resignation in just 31 moves. Meenakshi was surprised with her opponents English Defence with black pieces.  (PTI)  Copyright

				 																																	Dubai: The Kaiser has given his thumbs down to Africa. According to him, it may not have been such a smart idea to agree to allow Africa to stage the World Cup for the first time in 2010. Europe cannot wait 24 years to host the World Cup, the president of the 2006 World Cup organising committee said.				 																																	Uefa made a big mistake to accept this rotation in my opinion. Europe is the biggest market, the World Cup without Europe is not a World Cup, he said in Dubai. The big question is, can one African country organise the World Cup? We are talking about 32 countries, to have more than one million foreigners coming, can you solve this problem? Which country can manage this? Maybe one, South Africa can, maybe Morocco because its bidding for the fourth time. Egypt, I dont know. I dont know if its a wise idea to give it to Africa, he said.				 																																	London: Ken Bates has resigned as chairman of Chelsea, the club said on Tuesday. At an emotional last Chairmans Supper Club attended by over 300 people, he (Bates) expressed no blame as he said that the intended period of hand over from himself to the new regime had not gone as he had anticipated, and that the differences of eastern and western cultures perhaps resulted in his decision, the club said.				 																																	There had been speculation about the position of the 72-year-old since Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the Premier League club last July, which intensified with the arrival of former Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon in February. Bates had retained the title of chairman of the football club but he was replaced as chairman of Chelseas parent company by Abramovich associate Bruce Buck earlier this year.				 																																	Buenos Aires: Former Newcastle United striker Carlos Daniel Cordone has failed a doping test for the second time in less than one year, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) said on Tuesday. The San Lorenzo player tested positive following his teams 2-0 win over Chacarita Juniors on the opening weekend of the Clausura championship on February 14, AFA spokesman Raul Steimberg said.				 																																	Prohibited substances were found in the analysis, Steimberg said, without specifying the substance. Cordone, 29, tested positive for marijuana last April and was suspended for three months but he now faces a minimum two-year ban.				 																																	Cape Town: World high jump champion Jacques Freitag announced on Wednesday that he was withdrawing from the Olympic Games in August, due to an ankle injury.The 21-year-old South African, who won the world championships in Paris in 2003 with a leap of 2.35-metres, first sustained ankle ligament damage in 2001. In June 2001 I had an operation on my right ankle, to repair the ligaments, Freitag told a media conference. It is now with regret that the injury has resurfaced and I will more than likely need to have full reconstruction on that ankle. I have decided to withdraw from all future competitions this year, including the Olympic Games.Sport on Screen Cricket, Duleep Trophy final  East Zone vs North Zone, live from 9 am on DD Sports

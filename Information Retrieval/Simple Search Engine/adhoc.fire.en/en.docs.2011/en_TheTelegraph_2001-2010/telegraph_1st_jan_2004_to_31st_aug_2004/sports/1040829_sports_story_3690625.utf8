 De Villiers wants revamp
Durban: Former South African fast bowler Fanie de Villiers has called for drastic changes in the countrys cricket set-up to arrest the sliding fortunes of the national team which has faced one reverse after the other on its current tour of Sri Lanka. The team, led by Graeme Smith, has already lost the two Test series against the hosts 0-1 and the one-day series. There is no doubt about the need for immediate changes in South African cricket, De Villiers said in a talk show on Saturday. But it remains a question who in the national cricket hierarchy has the guts to take a decision like that and who can implement such a change successfully, added the former fast bowler.

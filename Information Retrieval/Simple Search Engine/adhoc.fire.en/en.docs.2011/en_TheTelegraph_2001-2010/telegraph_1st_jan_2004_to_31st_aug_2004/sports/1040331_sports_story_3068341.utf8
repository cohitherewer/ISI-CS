The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Smith steers SA to victory
 - FINAL TEST vs NZ - Kirsten hits 76 in farewell match as visitors draw series  Gary Kirsten is hugged by Shaun Pollock as he leaves the pitch for the last time in Wellington on Tuesday. (Reuters) Wellington: A classic captains knock of 125 not out by Graeme Smith and a crucial 76 from Gary Kirsten in his Test farewell helped South Africa finished the series 1-1 following a six-wicket win over New Zealand in the third and final Test on Tuesday. The convincing victory shattered New Zealands dream of a first-ever series win over South Africa. Set a target of 234 to win, South Africa were led from the front by Smith who put the frustrations of an arduous tour behind him as he brought up his seventh Test century. He was joined by Kirsten with South Africa in trouble at 36 for three, and together they worked over the New Zealand attack in a 171-run fourth wicket partnership which ended with the dismissal of Kirsten just on lunch. But at 207 for four the result was then a formality. In his 101st and final Test, the veteran Kirsten was at his majestic best, reaching 76 in nearly four hours at the crease to end his career with a prolific 7,289 Test runs at an average of 45.27. Not known as an emotional player, Kirsten kissed his helmet, before walking off in tears, through a guard of honour from his teammates. It had been a difficult tour for South Africa, losing the one-day series 1-5 and losing the second Test in Auckland by nine wickets. But the motivation of not wanting to be the first South African captain to lose a series to New Zealand drove Smith on and he appropriately brought up the winning runs, driving Chris Martin to the deep. When the final day began, both sides had an equal chance of victory with South Africa requiring 152 runs and New Zealand seven wickets. But conditions were ideal for batting with little breeze and a pitch that offered little to the bowlers. Smith and Kirsten were not to be hurried and refused to take risks in a partnership of intense application. Kirsten brought up his 34th half-century in 187 minutes and looked comfortable until the penultimate ball before lunch when he was given out leg-before to Scott Styris. Weve got to become more consistent, was how New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming summed up his sides performance. Kirsten said his team was determined to win this Test. With the stresses the team had been under we were really determined to get this one just to make the tour a little bit better and certainly from a personal point of view I would say it was pretty much the highlight of my Test career, he said. Smith paid tribute to the 36-year-old who made his debut against Australia in Melbourne in 1993. Its fantastic to send Gazza off with a victory. Hes given us so much as an individual and as a teammate.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

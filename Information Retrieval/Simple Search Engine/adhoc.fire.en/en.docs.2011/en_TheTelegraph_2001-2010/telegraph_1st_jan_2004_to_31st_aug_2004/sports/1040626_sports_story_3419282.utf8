 Stich remarks sexist, says Navratilova
London: Martina Navratilova derided former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich as a one-slam wonder on Thursday after the German said the 47-year-olds first-round victory was terrible for womens tennis. Back playing Wimbledon singles for the first time since 1994, Navratilova thrashed Colombias Catalina Castano 6-0, 6-1 in the first round before losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 to Argentine Gisela Dulko on Thursday. I get really upset when I see one-slam wonder Michael Stich criticising the depth in womens tennis, said the nine-times former Wimbledon singles champion. Look at how I hit the ball. Not at the result, not the fact that Im 47 but how do I play. I think its a sexist reaction. People keep saying it about women but they dont say it about men. When Michael Jordan comes back and kicks butt in the NBA, theyre not questioning the level of NBA. Its the same thing in NHL. It happens over and over. How can it be bad for womens tennis if I get out here and play good tennis? The womens game has never been stronger. Navratilova was disappointed not to have beaten Dulko, who knocked her out of the French Open in the first round last month. With some irritation, Navratilova brushed aside any suggestion that she had tired after winning the first set. Fatigue? No, I could go play three more sets. Did I look tired? she snapped.

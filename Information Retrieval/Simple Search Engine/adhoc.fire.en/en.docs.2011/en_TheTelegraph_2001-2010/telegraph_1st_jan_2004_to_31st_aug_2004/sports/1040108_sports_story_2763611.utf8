The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bright signs, but none to fill void
 Serve amp; Volley / Naresh  Kumar One hopes that Prakash  Amritran (top)j and Rohan Bopanna will in due course  bridge the gap In the past, I have described  the Indian sporting scene as a moonscape  barren and forlorn.  Now, as we move into 2004, the picture has been transformed  into a verdant valley with spring in the air.  In 2003, our sportsmen and sportswomen  have distinguished themselves at the international level  in several disciplines. The glint of Olympic medals is no  longer a mirage. The government has opened the purse strings  and commercial sponsors buoyed by the economic boom are  stepping forward, while the administrators are fast acquiring  a global vision. India has at last broken from its slumber  and is moving to the fast lane. Indian tennis had a good year  in 2003. A harvest of four Grand Slam titles, two mixed  doubles with the Australian Open and Wimbledon for Paes  and Navratilova and the Wimbledon doubles for Bhupathi and  Mirnyi. And of course, the girls under-18 doubles title  for Sania Mirza at Wimbledon.  Sounds grand, doesnt it?  The truth, however, is that Paes  and Bhupathi now in their twilight years, levitate high  above the near void that exists above junior levels in Indian  tennis. The Indian presence normally fades out at the third  tier Challenger level tournaments  many dreams away from  the Grand Slams.  In the Davis Cup, we once again  failed to qualify for the World Group of 16 and have been  pushed back into the Asia/Oceania Group I, where we are  to play against New Zealand in 2004. The tie seems like  a piece of cake as both in 2002 at Wellington and 2003 in  Calcutta, India won easily. But there is a difference this  year. Leander Paes, may not be able to play as he has not  fully recovered from his illness while Rohan Bopanna, who  made a superb showing against The Netherlands in the World  Group playoffs, is on the injured list.  The team will be left with Prakash  Amritraj, Harsh Mankad and Mahesh Bhupathi  who does not  play the singles. New Zealand does not have a formidable  team, a couple of them I am told, are teaching pros. But  the absence of Paes will give them heart and the chilly  winds and conditions in New Zealand will not help our boys.  It is going to be a tough tie, but it is time for our youngsters  to deliver.  In international tennis, the breakthrough  from the junior levels to a respectable senior level is  the most difficult step. It requires support for three to  four years from a travelling coach as well as a top-class  physical trainer. A very expensive proposition, considering  that quite a few do not make it even after full support.  This is the area where Indian tennis promotion is very weak.  One hopes that Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj will in due  course fill the gap left by Paes and Bhupathi. Since his Davis Cup debut in 1990  against Japan in Chandigarh, Paes has not missed a single  tie. He has played 95 matches out of which he won 66 and  lost 29! This is just two matches short of the greatest-ever  Indian Ramanathan Krishnan, who has played 97 matches, won  69 and lost 28. In the next couple of years Paes  could pass the century mark! In an era, where Davis Cup  participation often clashes with personal interests and  income, Paes total commitment to the country by agreeing  to play both singles and doubles at the risk of injury deserves  a gilded accolade.  How does one describe a phenomenon  like Paes. The superlatives do not seem to be enough to  describe his commitment, never-say-die spirit, resolve and  attitude. These are bolstered by a frightening intensity,  which raises his game at crucial times beyond his limits.  It would not be an exaggeration  to say that Paes heroic exploits, especially in the Davis  Cup and Grand Slams, have inspired the whole nation. In  fighting with heart and spirit  the most glamorous qualities   Paes stands alone in Indian tennis history. Paes had put on 18 kilos in weight  because of the steroids used to treat his illness. Whittled  down by 10 kilos now he is in full training to get back  to his normal weight. However, he will need time and quite  a few tournaments to be back at his competitive best.  It is unfortunate that 2004 is  the year of the Olympics. If Paes and Bhupathi had not split  up, and had adequate competitive preparation, they would  have been favourites for the gold in the mens doubles.  They still have a good chance if they can manage to hit  form. One wishes that the Olympics had been held two-three  years ago when they were at their best. Indian domination of Asian tennis  is coming to an end. For Paes and Bhupathi the shadows are  getting longer and though there are good Indian junior prospects,  a breakthrough does not seem imminent. Thailand has Paradorn  Srichapan who is currently No. 11 in the world and Korea  has Lee  a top-class player with victories over many top  notchers.  In away ties we have very slim  chances and on grasscourts in India we can only make a contest  of it if Paes returns to his best and wins his two singles  matches and the doubles. It seems India will have to be  content staying in Asia Oceania Group I for some years to  come. Copyright

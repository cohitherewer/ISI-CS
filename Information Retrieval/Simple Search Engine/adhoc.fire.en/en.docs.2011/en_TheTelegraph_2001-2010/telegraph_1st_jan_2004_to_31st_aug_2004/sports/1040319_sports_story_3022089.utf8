 Balaji eager to partner Pathan
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 			Peshawar: For young Lakshmipathy Balaji and Ramesh Powar, the Pakistan trip has been an experience worth cherishing both on and off the field. The Tamil Nadu pacer, who has played 13 ODIs till Rawalpindi, feels that his combination with Irfan Pathan, can work wonders for the side on Friday. I enjoy bowling in tandem with him. If he plays tomorrow it will be nice. The partnership worked in Australia and hopefully it will be the same here, Balaji said Thursday. He feels that the experience of bowling on Australian pitches has helped him mature. Playing in Australia was great fun. You relish the experience. I have learnt the usefulness of bowling a fuller length. Balaji is trying to make amends for his poor showing in the second game during which he gave away 47 runs in his six overs. I bowled well in the first match but after that it was bad. I have worked on my accuracy, he said. The pacer can prove to be very useful under these conditions here. His plan for the Pakistan batsmen is quite simple. Hit the deck hard and make them uncomfortable. Its easier that way because they get committed to the front foot very easily, especially Shahid Afridi. Debutant Powars showing in Rawalpindi had impressed all including the Indian skipper. An exasperated Shoaib Akhtar had even hurled a beamer at him in desperation. How did he tackle Shoaibs pace? It was a good experience. I never thought of his name or fame. I tackled him just as any other bowler. In fact, I had decided to take minimum risk against Shoaib and instead go after Afridi, the gutsy off spinner said. What has been his strategy against the Pakistani batsmen? Bowl slow and give it the loop. It then becomes very difficult to hit and you have a good chance of dismissing them, Powar said.  Copyright

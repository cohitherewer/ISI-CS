 ZCU to persuade England
London: Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) chairman Peter Chingoka will try to persuade England to go ahead with their tour in October at a meeting at Lords on Tuesday. Chingoka and ZCU board member Ozias Bvute will attend an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) management meeting called to discuss the controversial visit. The meeting takes place on the same day as an ODI between Sri Lanka and a Zimbabwe side seriously weakened by the absence of 13 rebel white players. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu steered away from the controversy ahead of the first one-dayer. We will approach this series just as we approach all the others, we dont care who plays for the opposition, Atapattu said in Bulawayo.Its not for us to say who Zimbabwe should pick in their teams. We are here to represent our own country and we will play as hard as we always do. In 10 or 15 years time people will look back on this tour and it wont matter who was playing. It will be the result of the series that counts. But Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he hoped to meet a full-strength side when he leads his team to Zimbabwe straight after the Sri Lanka series. It would be disappointing for the player group to go there and play a second or third string side, Ponting said. It is a little bit of a worry at the moment, but hopefully things will be resolved and we can go to Zimbabwe and play a full-strength team. Meanwhile, South Africas cricketers have urged the ICC to step in to end the racially-charged row in Zimbabwe. It is clear the situation cannot be resolved internally in the current environment, Tony Irish, chief executive of the South African Cricketers Association said on Monday. This has now become an international concern and its our belief that the ICC must become involved to try and safeguard the best interests of cricket.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

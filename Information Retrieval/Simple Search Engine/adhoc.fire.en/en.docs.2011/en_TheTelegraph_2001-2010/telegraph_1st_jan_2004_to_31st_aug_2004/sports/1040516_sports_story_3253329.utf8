The Telegraph - Calcutta
SA to play seven ODIs in India
Mumbai, May 15 (PTI): India will host South Africa for a seven one-day International series after hosting Australia in a four-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in September-October. There will be no ODIs against Australia and no Tests against South Africa, BCCI sources said on Saturday. The Australians will play a warm-up three-day game before plunging into the Test series, while South Africa will be visiting only for a period of 18 days which gives time only to play ODIs, the sources said. As per rotation policy, the Delhi and District Cricket Association and Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association are in line to host two of the four Tests against Australia. There are lingering doubts, however, on whether Delhis Ferozshah Kotla, which is being renovated, will be ready in time to host the Test match soon after the monsoon, the sources said. There is also a question mark over the Green Park ground in Kanpur which could not host the Test match against New Zealand last season due to bad pitch conditions and the tie had to be shifted to the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera. Meanwhile, encouraged by last years positive response and interaction levels, the BCCI has decided to convene the conclave this year too. It will be held next month under the chairmanship of Sunil Gavaskar, who is also the chairman of the Bangalore-based NCA. The captains, umpires and referees of all the senior level domestic meet held last year have been asked to send in their reports and observations to the BCCI, the sources said.  Copyright

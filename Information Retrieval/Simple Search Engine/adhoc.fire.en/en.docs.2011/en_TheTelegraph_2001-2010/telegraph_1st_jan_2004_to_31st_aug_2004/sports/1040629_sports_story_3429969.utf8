The Telegraph - Calcutta
Dont blame me for umpire axe
- Its bad luck for him to lose his job, but others on court should have known the score, not just me: Sprem
 Karolina Sprem in action against 
Magdalena Maleeva at Wimbledon on Monday. The Croat won 6-4, 6-4. (AFP) London: Croatias Karolina Sprem insisted she was not to blame for the axing of a top Wimbledon umpire after his embarrassing scoring blunder. Sprem is furious that she has been targeted by some American players after her second-round win against former champion Venus Williams where the match ended in controversial circumstances over a scoring mix-up in the tie-break. Ted Watts, the 56-year-old official, was dropped from the Championships after he wrongly called the score in the second set tie-break. He accidentally handed Sprem an extra point and she never looked back as she went on to take the match. Im a little bit upset at whats been said. I was confused at the time and didnt know what was happening. If I didnt know the score, then maybe she (Venus) should have known, said the 19-year-old who reached the fourth round on Sunday with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2) win over American 32nd seed Meghann Shaughnessy. And if she didnt, then the umpire should know. Its bad luck for him to lose his job, but there are so many people in the court who should know the score, not just me. Watts miscalled the score in the decisive second set tie-break on Thursday, awarding a point to Sprem in error. As a result, the match was technically unfinished with Sprem leading 7-6 in the tie-break but Watts believed the score was 8-6 and awarded victory to the Croatian. The stray extra point came when Sprem, serving at 1-2 in the tie-break, committed a fault on her first serve. World No. 2 Andy Roddick was sympathetic towards Venus. Personally, Id have trouble just taking a point from someone, he said. You know, Ive heard that no one noticed and stuff, but if its the biggest match of your life, Im figuring you know what the score is. That just seems like that would be the case.  (AFP)  Copyright

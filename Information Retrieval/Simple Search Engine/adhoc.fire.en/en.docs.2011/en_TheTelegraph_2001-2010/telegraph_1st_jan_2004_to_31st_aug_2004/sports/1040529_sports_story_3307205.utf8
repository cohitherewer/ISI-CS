The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rebels feel the cash crunch
 - Streak and 14 others plan trip to England  Money matters, knows Streak Harare: Zimbabwes 15 white rebel cricketers are considering touring England in an effort to earn some money while their dispute with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) rumbles on. The players were fired by the ZCU after they made themselves unavailable over what they consider to be racially driven selection policies. There have been a few ideas to keep the guys in cricket, former captain Heath Streak said on Friday after local media reported the group may try to organise a tour of England. We thought of getting some games together for the guys, or just getting them playing some club cricket, he said. A tour is certainly being looked at. That is one of the ideas that have been thrown at us from people who are sympathetic to our cause and who are trying to help us. Streak, whose sacking as captain sparked the dispute, said it was important the rebels kept playing at whatever level. Theyre not employed, and I dont want them to run away and plot other things, he said. It will be hard for them to then turn around and start playing cricket again. At least, if they stay in the game, once this is resolved we can get them back and playing again. The players have asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to set up a dispute resolution committee to arbitrate the issue, though the ICC has yet to decide whether it will do so. There are quite a few logistics to sort out. But it (the tour) is a possibility because the guys have got some good marketability in England at the moment, Grant Flower said. Besides the loss of regular earnings from playing international cricket, mounting legal bills, estimated at around 50,000 already, is the immediate cause for the players to think of a tour. If theres no resolution to this whole thing then Ive got to look at making the best of the years Ive got left in cricket and capitalising so I can get myself into a stable financial position to support my family. Ive lost a lot of income out of not playing, Streak said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

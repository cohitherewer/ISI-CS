 Time for Waugh to refocus on cricket
 Sydney: Steve Waugh says he will need to dig  deep to refocus on playing for New South Wales this week  so soon after his heady exit from Test cricket.  But the NSW skipper says he intends to be ready and  do what he can to help his young state teammates for the  rest of the (southern) season. Waugh and his family will pack the car and head for the two-hour drive north to Newcastle for the defending champions Sheffield Shield match against competition leaders Victoria, starting on Friday. The former Australian captain faces a huge task to avoid feeling flat following a farewell Test that was the stuff of dreams. Its going to be difficult, theres no doubt about that, said Waugh. But youve got to look at the NSW side. Theyre keen and there are a lot of young guys there and I have a responsibility  Im still the captain of that side. Ive got to manage to lift. Its always been great playing for NSW. Newcastle is a bit more laidback, so Ive got to get myself up for it. Waugh could be excused for pulling the pin on all cricket after saying goodbye to Tests in such perfect fashion at the SCGround. He made a match-saving 80 before being carried around his favourite ground on the shoulders of his teammates with the Australian flag across his shoulders and baggy green cap on his head. Nothing in this weeks Shield game can match that, but Waugh wants to fulfil his commitments. Its where I started, for NSW, so Im finishing up where I started, he said. I think I owe the state something, they gave me my first opportunity. There are only five Shield games and five one-day Cup games and I think if I can help some young players, then its going to be worthwhile.  (AFP)  Copyright

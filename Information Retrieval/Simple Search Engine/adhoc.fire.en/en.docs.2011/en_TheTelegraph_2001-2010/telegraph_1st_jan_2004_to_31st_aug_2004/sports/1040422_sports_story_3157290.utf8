The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India start with 10-0 win
 Chinese defender Wang Zhen blocks the path of Indian forward B. Lakra during their junior Asia Cup match in Karachi on Wednesday Karachi: Penalty corner expert Sandeep Singh and captain Sandeep Michael scored hattricks as India opened their Junior Asia Cup campaign with a 10-0 rout of China on Wednesday. Singh hit the board with immaculate conversions in the 12th, 25th and 42nd minutes. Michael scored field goals in the ninth, 49th and 69th as India completely dominated the match. Tushar Khandekar started the goal spree in the seventh minute before Sandeep hit two and Michael one to take the tally to 4-0. Hari Prasad netted the fifth before half-time. Girish Pimpale and Michael netted two each and Singh one in the second half to complete the rout. India, who won the world junior title in Hobart in 2001, are one of the three favourites in this tournament with Pakistan and South Korea. Its nice to score ten in your first match and I am happy with the penalty corner conversions, said India coach Harendra Singh. Sandeep got four penalty corners and converted three which is a good ratio. India meet Sri Lanka in their second match on Thursday. (PTI)  Copyright

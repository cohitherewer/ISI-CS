 IOC suspends Kim Un-yong

Lausanne: Kim Un-yong, the IOC vice president, was suspended on Friday as South Korean prosecutors investigated him over corruption charges. 
The IOC said in a statement that Kim was deprived of his rights until the investigation and an inquiry by the ethics commission was finalised. 
South Korean prosecutors are awaiting a full health report on Kim who collapsed last week and was taken to hospital for treatment when he was about to be served with an arrest warrant. 
The 72-year-old, one of South Koreas most powerful sports leaders, is accused of accepting over 500 million won ($427,000) from businessmen in return for his efforts to get them seats on the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC). He is also suspected of embezzling billions of won donated by traders to his World Taekwondo Federation. 
Prosecutors have also indicted Lee Kwang-Tae, a former KOC member, for corruption. Lee reportedly paid 100 million won to Kim to secure his KOC membership. Kim resigned his national assembly seat and quit the leadership of Taekwondos world governing body last week.IOC president Jacques Rogge ordered the IOC Ethics Commission to investigate Kim last week. 
Kim, who was given a severe warning when the IOC investigated the Salt Lake City cash-for-votes scandal that saw 10 IOC members either expelled or forced to resign, now risks being forced out of the IOC which he joined in 1986. (AFP)

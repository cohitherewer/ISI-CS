(AP) Birmingham, Feb. 21 (AP): Marion Jones lost the sprint but won her first attempt at long jump in four years at the Norwich Union indoor meet Friday while Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele set a new 5,000 m world record (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). Jones was beaten by Belgian sprinter Kim Gevaert over 60 m in her second comeback race. She then went on to win the long jump  her first since finishing third at the Sydney Olympics  with a final leap of 6.75 m in a weak six-person field. Gevaert set a Belgian record with her run of 7.13 seconds at the national indoor arena. Jones finished second with 7.16. I was pleased with my start and then when I got up, the turnover just wasnt there today, but Im still pleased with the race, Jones said. Jones long-time rival Zhanna Pintusevic Block, who took the world 100 m title from her in 2001, finished fourth with 7.31 seconds. American Angela Daigle was third with 7.27. Jones was extremely pleased with her long jump performance. I rushed a little bit on the runway and wasnt composed enough in the air, Jones said. That was not bad. It was my first jump in four years and my first competition indoors  to start with 6.75 is ok, Ill take that. Bekele ran 12 minutes, 49.60 seconds to beat the world indoor record of his training partner and idol, Haile Gebrselassie and win $ 30,000. Today was very hard, it was a very difficult record to beat, Bekele said. Haile is my hero so its special that the record was his. Bekele said he wouldnt run at the world indoor meet in Budapest next month, but wouldconcentrate on the world cross country championships in Brussels. It wasnt Gebrselassies night. In trying to break his own two-mile record, the Ethiopian was overtaken by teenage countryman Markos Geneti in the final meters. Geneti, 19, ran 8 minutes, 8.39 seconds to edge out Gebrselassie. The mens 60 m was won by American Brian Lewis in 6.58 seconds. After a false start, Briton Darren Campbell broke before the gun went off and was disqualified. The mens long jump was won by American Dwight Phillips with a first round leap of 7.91 m  19 cm ahead of second-place Briton Christopher Tomlinson. The mens 200 m was won by Britains Christian Malcolm in 20.74 seconds, the mens 400 was won by Chris Brown of the Bahamas in 46.48 seconds and the womens triple jump was taken by Ashia Hansen (14.47 m).

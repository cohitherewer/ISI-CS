 Sachin asked to pace his innings: Sourav
 Sourav feels wickets in Holland will be easy paced Mumbai: The Team India thinktank has instructed batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar to pace his innings so that he can bat out the full 50 overs in one-day Internationals. With important ODI tournaments including the Champions Trophy to follow, Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly said it was crucial for Sachin to play the sheet anchors role. Yes, the team management has asked Sachin to pace his innings according to the match situation. Both Virender Sehwag and Sachin are attacking batsmen. It is better that one of them slows down and tries to play the full quota of overs, Sourav said here on Tuesday before the teams departure to Holland for the tri-series meet, which runs from August 21 to 28. Sourav appeared pleased with the fact that India would be able to warm up for the September 10-25 Champions Trophy in England in the right manner. Though we have not played ODIs in Holland, we know we will be playing world champions Australia and Pakistan before taking on England in another three one-day match series (September 1-5). It is a good way to prepare before a major tournament such as the Champions Trophy. On the wickets in Holland, the stylish left-hander said: I am sure it will be an easy-paced wicket although the stadium might be comparatively smaller. The Indian team left without coach John Wright who will be joining the team at Amsterdam.  (PTI)  Copyright

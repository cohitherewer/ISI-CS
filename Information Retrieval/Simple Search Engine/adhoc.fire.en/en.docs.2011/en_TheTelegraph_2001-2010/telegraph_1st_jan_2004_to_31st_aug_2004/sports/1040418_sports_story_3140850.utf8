 Henry worlds best: Wenger
London, April 17 (Reuters): Thierry Henry was hailed as the worlds best striker by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger on Friday after he scored four goals in the Arsenals 5-0 rout of Leeds United. Henry is the first Arsenal player for 53 years to score hattricks in successive games at Highbury  he scored three in the 4-2 defeat of Liverpool last Friday  and the first to score four goals in a game for the club since Ian Wright in 1991.  Asked whether there was a better striker than Henry, he said: I dont think so. I am not the most objective person but personally, no, I dont think so. His finishing gets better and when he breaks through no one can catch him. Its difficult to find new words for him, the best is just to watch him.  Copyright

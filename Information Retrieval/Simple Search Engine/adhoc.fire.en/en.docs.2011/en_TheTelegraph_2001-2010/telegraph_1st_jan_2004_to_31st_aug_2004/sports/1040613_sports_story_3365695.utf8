The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ 255 runs ahead
 Chris Cairns appeals at Trent Bridge on Saturday. (AFP) Nottingham, June 12 (AFP): New Zealands bid to salvage some pride from their series with England remained firmly on course after the third day of the third and final Test at Trent Bridge here on Saturday. At stumps, New Zealand were 190 for five in their second innings, already a lead of 255 with two days left and the hard-hitting Chris Cairns, the world record holder for most Test sixes, still waiting for his final Test innings. Craig McMillan was 28 batting and nightwatchman James Franklin remained unbeaten on two. England had already secured the series 2-0 after seven and nine wicket wins at Lords and Headingley, respectively. On the stroke of lunch, England were bowled out for 319 in reply to New Zealands first innings 384, a deficit of 65. Cairns took five for 79 as he wrapped up the innings. It was the 13th time in his 62-Test career that Cairns, 34 on Sunday, had taken five or more wickets in an innings and the fourth time hed done so against England. New Zealand started Saturdays final session on 99 for one with captain and first innings centurion Stephen Fleming batting on 35. Brendon McCullum, on three at the break, added just one to his score before falling to Ashley Giles. McCullum edged to Andrew Flintoff at first slip to leave New Zealand 106 for two. Flintoff then took two wickets for no runs in five balls. Flintoff, bowling around the wicket, had Fleming leg before for 45, the opener contributing to his own downfall by not playing a shot. Flintoff then had Nathan Astle leg before for nought. Scott Styris and McMillan kept the Black Caps going with a stand of 51 before Styris was given out caught behind off Stephen Harmison for 39, much to his displeasure.  Copyright

 Henin-Hardenne to defend title
 Henin-Hardenne at a news conference in Beersel, near Brussels, on Tuesday. (Reuters) Brussels, May 18 (Reuters): World No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne will defend her French Open crown after recovering from a viral infection. I have recovered from the viral illness I contracted earlier this year and am feeling well again, the Belgian said on Tuesday. I have been practising regularly and even though I do not feel 100 percent, I feel I am in a good enough shape to go to Paris. Henin-Hardenne, who beat compatriot Kim Clijsters to win her first Grand Slam title in Roland Garros last June, had been doubtful for the tournament which starts on Monday after falling ill last month. Doctors had ordered her to rest until the beginning of May. The 21-year-old won the Australian Open and three other titles this season before being forced out of action in April. In her only claycourt tournament this season, she reached the semi-finals in Amelia Island where she was beaten by Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo. My build-up to Paris has not been perfect since I had to stop for several weeks and have played only four matches on clay this year, Henin-Hardenne said. For several weeks, I was really unsure whether I could go to Paris and participate in my favourite event.... but after two weeks of practice, I have decided to go for it. Injury may force Costa out Former French Open champion Albert Costa could miss next the French Open after limping out of the ATP World Team Cup on Tuesday, adds Reuters from Duesseldorf. The Spaniard, who won the French Open in 2002, picked up a mystery injury to his left leg against Chiles Nicolas Massu and conceded at 1-4 down in the first set.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Doping impossible in mens game
 Agassi says the ATP test process is quite extensive Key Biscayne: Eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi believes that doping in mens tennis is nearly an impossibility but said safeguards are needed to prevent players ingesting tainted supplements. Agassi, seeking his fourth consecutive title here at the Masters Series hardcourt event, spoke out on doping concerns two days after he participated in the ATP doping task forces first meeting. What would be required to somehow cheat in my opinion is nearly an impossibility, Agassi said.  Agassi, hitting back at recent positive tests for tainted supplements, cited the extensive ATP test programme as a near-perfect net against doping cheats, citing the number of times players are randomly tested in and out of competition. We test so often  I got tested 20 times last year, Federer 23 times, Andy (Roddick) 20 times  we test so extensively that weve absolutely removed the possibility of somebody taking drugs to obtain a strategic advantage, Agassi said. The issue of tainted supplements hit the ATP last year when seven players tested positive for traces of the banned substance nandrolone and again this year when Britains Greg Rusedski faced a similar doping ban from a 2003 test. All were exonerated, Rusedski the last earlier this month, because ATP trainers had been distributing possibly tainted nutritional supplements to players, a practice halted last may. But for now, ATP players are fearful of taking any supplements, even those that legally aid their ability to endure the demands of their sport. Agassi said he no longer takes supplements because he cannot be certain of content. Thats the scary part, Agassi said. In this interim, until we find out whats going on, players cant take that risk. I dont take that risk, no. Agassi said there is virtually no way a player could take improper drugs long enough to enhance his performance without being caught, adding that he has never believed any opponent in his career was aided by a banned substance. If there was ever a question, I was convinced and assured they would be caught, Agassi said. The question is something I have never allowed room for because of our testing. I cant imagine how you could do it. All the highest standards of testing apply. I dont know how you would apply it for a short time, much less how you would be working it (long term for an edge). I dont know how youd pull it off. Agassi was heartened by the task force, which meets again in May in Hamburg. Im encouraged because I think the problem and the goal needs to be properly defined, he said. Simply doing without supplements is not the answer. If you deny the player vitamins and supplements and ask him to expend himself day after day, continent after continent, you are tearing away at the product. Until we move to an eight-game pro set, water is not enough. In the wake of the Balco steroid scandal, Agassi stressed the need for tough anti-doping measures. While there are drugs out there that have been abused that create a distinct advantage, I dot believe in tennis we have seen it implemented as a form of cheating, Agassi said. We need to keep our sport clean. Were going above and beyond, even to the point of shooting ourselves in the foot.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

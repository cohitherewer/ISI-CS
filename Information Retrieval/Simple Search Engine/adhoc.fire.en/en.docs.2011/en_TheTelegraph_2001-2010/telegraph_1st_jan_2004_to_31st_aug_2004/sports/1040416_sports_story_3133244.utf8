The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies drub India 5-0
Canberra: Australia scored four second-half goals in their 5-0 win over India, while Malaysia defeated South Africa 3-2 in the first leg of the four-nation hockey tournament on Thursday. Australia led 1-0 at halftime via a 28th minute Michael McCann strike. Nathan Eglington opened the scoring in the second half with a penalty corner in the 41st minute and Grant Schubert netted a field goal in the 47th. Andrew Smith made it 4-0 with a penalty corner in the 61st minute and Travis Brookes scored from open play in the final seconds. Australia had a 4-2 win over South Africa on the opening night. India and Malaysia have a win each and South Africa are winless after two rounds. The first 15 minutes were even and I thought we probably got some ascendancy as the half wore on, but there were limited opportunities for both sides, so I think 1-0 was probably a fair indication, said Australian coach Barry Dancer. In the second half, we continually moved the ball quickly in the midfield and that gave us a lot of opportunities going into the attacking circle. In the earlier match, Malaysia led 3-0 at halftime after a second minute field goal from Boon Huat Chua and successful penalty corners from Muhamad Rahim and Tajol Rosli Mohamad. South Africa rallied with a field goal from veteran Gregg Clark and a 68th minute penalty corner from Denzil Dolley. Malaysia face Australia on Saturday, while India will take on South Africa. South Africa started the second half with more commitment and played a more physical game that resulted in frequent clashes. The African sides pressure tactics resulted in nine circle penetrations and seven shots on goal in the second half, after gaining only two circle penetrations in the first half, and the effort paid off with a goal to Gregg Clark who half-volleyed high into the net a rebound from Kumar Subramanian in Malaysias goal. South Africa scored from its second penalty corner with three minutes for the final hooter with Denzil Dolley getting a deflection.  (PTI)  Copyright

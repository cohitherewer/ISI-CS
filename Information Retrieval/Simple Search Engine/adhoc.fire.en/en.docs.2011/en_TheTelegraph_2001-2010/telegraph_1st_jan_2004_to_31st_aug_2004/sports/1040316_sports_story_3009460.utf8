The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harmison owes it to Hussain
	 - Fairytale return for seamer  SHY GUY: Steve Harmison is cheered on by teammates after being named Man of the Match in Kingston on Sunday London: Just over a year ago Steve Harmison could barely complete his run-up, but on Sunday he put those nightmares behind him with seven wickets for 12 runs as the West Indies crashed to a Test low 47 all out and England won the first Test by ten wickets. Fast bowler Harmisons haul, the best Test return at Jamaicas Sabina Park, was the cornerstone of Englands win in the opening game of the four-match series. But his astonishing figures looked a long way off when the Durham quicks professional world collapsed around him in Perth in November 2002 during the third Test against Australia. Harmison, 25, repeatedly lost his run-up as Australia made 456, a total that would help them retain the Ashes in just 11 days playing time. It would have been embarrassing enough for a club cricketer; for a man touted as Englands great fast bowling hope it was pitiful with figures of one for 86. Many wondered if Harmison, whose tour of Australia began with seven successive wides in the opening match, would recover and he admitted months afterwards: That was the first time in my life I thought please dont throw me the ball, I dont want to bowl. But crucially for Harmison one man did not lose faith in him, the then England captain Nasser Hussain. Nasser helped me through the crisis. His encouragement was priceless, said Harmison, who was playing in only his 13th Test in Jamaica after making his debut against India in Nottingham in 2002. I was struggling but he refused to take me off. He just said: keep going youll get it back. Harmisons pace had been evident from the time he made his Durham debut back in 1996. At well over six feet it was clear that his ability to get bounce was going to give good batsmen something to think about. But, like just about every other English fast bowler of his generation, Harmisons career was blighted by injury. And, even when he was fit, his direction was often so wayward that it was wicketkeepers rather than batsmen who had most reason to be fearful.  (AFP)  Copyright

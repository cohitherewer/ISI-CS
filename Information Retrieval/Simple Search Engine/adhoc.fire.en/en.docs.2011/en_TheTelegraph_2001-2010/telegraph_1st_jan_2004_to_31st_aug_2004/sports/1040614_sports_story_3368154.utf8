The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Next match is life or death, says Scolari 
Oporto: Luis Felipe Scolari will need to call on the guile he employed to guide Brazil to World Cup glory two years ago if he is to extricate Portugal out of the hole they have dug for themselves. The Euro 2004 hosts slipped up badly in their Group A opener here Saturday, errors from Paulo Ferreira and Cristiano Ronaldo handing Greece a gift-wrapped 2-1 victory. The unscripted reverse has suddenly put Scolari under intense pressure. I can only say sorry to the Portuguese public  this is not what they deserved, said Scolari, who described his sides next game against Russia on Wednesday as a matter of life or death. Ill now have to go away and talk to the players  theres no space for a second accident, added Big Phil after his first competitive match since assuming control of Portugal ended in disaster. Who knows what changes Ill make for the next game. Its sad, but youve got to be prepared to win or lose. Greece played better than us today, thats all there is to it. Portugals quest to at last get their hands on a major trophy after decades of disappointment got off to the worst possible start when Georgios Karagounis pounced on a sloppy pass from Ferreira, Chelseas new 20 million euro signing, on the left. The 27-year-old Inter Milan player slammed the ball past keeper Ricardo from 20 metres out for a seventh minute lead as captain Fernando Couto fatally backed off challenging him. That major mistake offered Greece a goal and gave them confidence, reflected Scolari. It meant the traditional dangers of an opening match were made even worse. We lost control of the match, the team got very nervous. Mistake No. 2 came five minutes into the second half. Scolari brought on Ronaldo for Rui Costa and within five minutes the teenager who has dazzled the Old Trafford fans in his first season in the Premiership made his mark on the game but not in the way he would have wanted. He handed the Greeks a handsome gift when knocking over Georgios Seitaridis in the penalty area  Angelis Basinas duly sending Ricardo the wrong way as he slotted the spot kick into the top right hand corner. That second error allowed Greece to close down the game, reflected Scolari. Ronaldo made amends for his earlier indiscretion when giving Portugal a consolation goal deep into injury time from Luis Figos corner. Its such a short competition  the next match is vital  life or death, said Scolari.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Alok wins Asian title
New Delhi: Alok Kumar on Friday became the second Indian to win the Asian Snooker Championship as he relied on his experience to subdue compatriot Pankaj Advani in an all-Indian final in Aqaba, Jordan. The 35-year-old displayed a fine blend of aggression and tactical ploy against world amateur champion Advani to win his first major international title. Yasin Merchant had earlier won the title in 1989 and 2001. The clash was touted to be an intriguing battle between experience and youth power but Alok made sure that the 19-year-old Advani was not allowed to get into his groove and emerged victorious 6-3, according to information received here.

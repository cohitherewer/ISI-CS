 Australia beat Pak to title 
 - Azlan Shah Meet l Korea overcome Germany to secure third spot  The Australians celebrate after winning the 13th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. (Reuters) Kuala Lumpur: Playing a tactically superior game, Australia clinched the prestigious Azlan Shah Cup, overcoming defending champions Pakistan 4-3 in the final at the National Stadium on Sunday. Keeping their composure and sticking to their game-plan, Australia sewed up the game as Travis Brooks (21, 29), Michael Boyce (45) and Troy Elder (57) scored at crucial moments. Pakistan, kept on a leash by some close marking by the Aussies, had their moments when Kashif Jawaad (30) and Sohail Abbas (44, 65) found the net, but eventually yielded to a better organised, more balanced and a fitter team. Pakistan began well with their speedy forwards repeatedly troubling the Aussie defence. Their inability to sustain the pressure cost them the match in the end. Flowing moves from the wings had the Australian defence on the hop as Rehan Butt and Shabbir Hussain came close to scoring, pushing the opposition on the backfoot. A needless stoppage, however, broke the Pakistani concentration leading to an Australian resurgence. Centre-half Muhammad Saqlain fell to the ground after being tripped by an Aussie player during a Pakistani counter-attack. There was a brief stoppage as Saqlain rolled around and it was the breather the Aussies were looking for. Brooks, gaining possession in the midfield, cut through the Pakistani defence with a brilliant run and capped it with a reverse hit to the board to put Australia in the lead in the 21st minute. The Aussies kept pressing and scored again, this time Brooks foxing Pakistani goalkeeper Salman Akbar with a wrong foot shot after yet another solo run from the 25-yard line. To Pakistans credit, they regrouped quickly and forced a free-hit at the top of the circle in the very next minute. Skipper Muhammad Nadeem took a crack into the circle where Jawaad got a touch to put Pakistan back in the game. Thus, with the score-line reading 2-1 in favour of Australia at half-time, the game stood evenly poised with Australia failing to convert both their penalty corners while Sohail Abbas drew blank from the only attempt. However, eight minutes into the second-half, Abbas came good with the second penalty corner as the match headed for an exciting finish. The Aussies hit back strongly off the very first move from restart as Mark Knowles put through Boyce who slammed a wrong-foot shot past the goalkeeper. The Aussies were denied further success as Salman Akbar brought off several great saves, but he had no answer to elders 57th minute penalty corner drag-flick and Australia jumped to a 4-2 lead. The Pakistanis were not quite finished yet. They reduced the margin five minutes from close when Abbas converted the fourth penalty corner for his 10th goal of the tournament. The inspired Pakistanis mounted pressure, but the Australians managed to see off the challenge. In another match, South Korea staged a superb rally to emerge 6-5 winners against world champions Germany for a third-place finish in the seven-nation competition. In a gripping contest, the Koreans displayed great character to come back from 0-2 and 1-3 to force a 3-3 deadlock that could not be broken despite 15 minutes of extra-time. While Christian Wein (1), Matthias Witthaus (23) and Benjamin Koepp (47) scored for Germany during regulation play, the Koreans replied through Lee Jeung Seon (37 and 50), Yoon Young Sik (52). In the penalty shootout, Yeo Woon Koon (first), Lee Jung Seon (third) and Seo Jung Ho (fourth) converted for Korea, while Germany could score off only two through skipper Florian Kunz (second) and Christoph Bechmann (fourth). Korean goalkeeper Ko Dong Sik brought off three good stops to deny Justus Scharowsky (first), Bjoern Emmerling (third) and Tibor Weissborn (fifth). German keeper Christian Schulte made one save from Kim Kyung Seok who pushed weakly into the pads. In the play-off for the fifth-sixth place, Apain defeated Malaysia 2-1. The hosts led 1-0 on a goal by Chua Boon Huat (18), but Spain hit back in the second through Santiago Freixa (49) and Alberto Esteban (58).  (PTI)  Copyright

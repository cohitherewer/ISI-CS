 Inzamam ready to take on India, Australia
 Inzamam feels the team must start afresh Lahore: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq said on Monday that he and his young team would not shrink from facing India and Australia in the season ahead. We are not wary of India or Australia and if we meet them in the hectic season more than once its better for my young teams grooming because you learn while playing better opponents, Inzamam said. Pakistan began training here on Monday for a season in which they are due to play India at least three times. They will also face Australia at least twice in one-day Internationals at neutral venues before their tour Down Under. We lost to India in our home series but it was a closer fight than projected. The team has to put that behind and resolve to start afresh, said Inzamam, who is next in the firing line after coach Javed Miandads removal. Five of Pakistans key players  Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Danish Kaneria and Shoaib Malik  who are playing county cricket in England, are set to join the training camp in the next few days. The teams new coach, Bob Woolmer, will join them on July 2. Also due to join the camp is South African physical trainer Murray Stevenson, who has been hired to check a recent spate of injuries to Pakistani players. Besides Pakistan and India, hosts Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and qualifiers  The United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong  feature in the Asia Cup to be held in Sri Lanka from July 16 to August 1. Pakistan square off with world champions Australia and India in a tri-series in The Netherlands from August 20 to 27. They then meet India again in the ICC Champions Trophy in September. Pakistan will tour Australia for three Tests and a tri-series involving The West Indies from December 2004 to February 2005. Their season culminates with a tour of India in February-March next year. We know the outings against India and Australia are difficult, but I believe on the saying that when its tough, the tough get going and this will have to be learnt by the boys, the Pakistani captain said. Inzamam said Woolmers introduction was a positive step. Miandad worked a lot on batting techniques and the management felt that there is a need to bring in more discipline and professionalism. So we now have Woolmer who transformed South Africa into a good unit in the 90s.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Fighting Japan hold Poland 4-4
 - OLYMPIC QUAlIFIERS - Our forwards just did not settle down, says India coach Rajinder  Indias Deepak Thakur (left) evades a challenge from Gilles Petre of Belgium in Madrid on Tuesday. (AFP) Madrid: A fighting Japan averted another loss with a last-minute equaliser to force a 4-4 draw with Poland in a pool A match at the Olympic hockey qualifiers on Wednesday. Japan, who were down 0-2 and 2-4, came back strongly to score twice in the last nine minutes, including the equaliser five seconds from the hooter. Poland thus moved to four points while Japan picked up their first point in the tournament. The Polish strikes came through skipper Piotr Mikula (10th, 51st), Artur Mikula (7th) and Zbigniew (33rd, penalty stroke) while the Japanese replies came from captain Kenichi Takayama (14th, 70th), Takashiko Yamabori (19th) and Naohiki Tobita (61st). Meanwhile, India nearly came a cropper but survived for an unconvincing 1-1 draw with unfancied Belgium in their opening match on Tuesday (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). After a goalless first-half, India placed in pool B, scored in the 61st minute when Len Aiyappa converted the seventh penalty corner. But immediately, the Indians were reduced to 10 as Baljit Singh Dhillon had to leave the field with a yellow card suspension. Belgium, who had earlier muffed two sitters, equalised in the 64th when Charles Vandeweghe found the boards from a counter-attack. Earlier, Pakistan pulled up their socks none too soon to flatten Canada 4-2 (pool B) and hosts Spain enjoyed a comfortable 6-1 win over Japan (pool A). The Indians did penetrate the Belgian circle to force two penalty corners but could not convert either. Skipper Dilip Tirkeys direct hit was way off the mark and then Gagan Ajit Singh fouled in his attempt to stop Deepak Thakurs push. The Indian midfield which performed with reasonable assurance but did not acquit itself in ball distribution, saw Baljit Singh Dhillon playing from deeper position and having to carry the ball. Dhillon executed a couple of brilliant through balls but these passes were not utilised. At the other end, the Indian defence had relatively quiet time, barring the two occasions when the Belgians made attempts at the goal where Devesh Chauhan easily parried the shots. On resumption, the Indians continued to press hard but without success as the forwards repeatedly went out of position and failed to combine. The Indians also enjoyed some luck as Belgium missed a couple of sure goals. Towards the close, India forced three penalty corners on the trot, the last of which was converted by Aiyappa, but the lead was shortlived with Vandeghe neutralising. Coach Rajinder Singh later said: To sum up, our forwards wasted a few chances and also their receiving was not up to the mark. I thought that the half-line did not provide adequate support to the forwards. He also rued Indias failure to convert as many as six penalty corners during the match. We could convert only one of the seven penalty corners we received, he said. Tonight, our forwards just did not settle down and also, I must compliment Belgium for putting up such a good defence, the coach added. Skipper Dilip Tirkey felt that the one mistake in the deep defence led to the Belgian equaliser. But for this blemish, our deep defence played extremely well, while the half-line put in a lot of effort. However, had we cashed in on the few chances we got, then we could have won the match, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

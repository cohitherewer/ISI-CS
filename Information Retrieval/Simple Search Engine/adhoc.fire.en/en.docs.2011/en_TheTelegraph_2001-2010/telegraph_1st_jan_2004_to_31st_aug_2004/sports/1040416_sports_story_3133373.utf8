The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain suffers concussion
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings Syed Hussain was critically injured on Thursday during the NFL match with East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium and remained under observation in a city hospital. Hussain, a second-half substitute, collided with East Bengals Chandan Das for an aerial ball and suffered a heavy blow to his head. He collapsed in a heap, and East Bengal team doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta rushed to treat him on the spot. He suffered a cerebral concussion and remained senseless for a few minutes (when play was held up), though his pulse could be detected, Dr Dasgupta later said. He suffered temporary loss of memory and was put on artificial respiration while being removed to the hospital, he added. A club official, however, informed that Hussain had regained consciousness and he talked to him in the hospital.  Copyright

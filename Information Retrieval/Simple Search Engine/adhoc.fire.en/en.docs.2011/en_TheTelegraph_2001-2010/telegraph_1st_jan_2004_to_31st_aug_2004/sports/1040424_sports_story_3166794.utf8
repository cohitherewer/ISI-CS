				 																																	Miami Beach: Anna Kournikova is being sued by her parents, who say the tennis star has taken over the waterfront home the three jointly own.				 																																	Sergei and Alla Kournikova filed the suit last week in Miami-Dade circuit court. They want the seven-bedroom home partitioned, meaning they want money for their share of the home. 				 																																	It was purchased for $5 million in 2000.				 																																	Kournikova, who has never won a tournament and is known mostly for her supermodel looks, has not played competitive tennis in more than a year because of injuries.

The Western Province player was felicitated with three other awards by the United Cricket Board of South Africa at an awards ceremony in Johannesburg on Thursday. 				 																																	Kallis also bagged the Players Player award, the countrys Cricket Supporters award, and the Player of the Year award. Veteran cricketer Gary Kirsten, who retired from international cricket after the recent New Zealand tour, also received an award for his contribution to the game. 				 																																	Jamshedpur: Former Olympian B. V. Satyanarayan died of cardio-respiratory failure on Friday, family sources said. The 72-year-old Satyanarayan, who had undergone an operation in Vellore after doctors confirmed brain tumour, was rushed to Tata Main hospital on Wednesday when his health started deteriorating, the sources said. A former national record holder for two decades in long-jump (24.5 ft), Satyanarayan leaves behind his wife, three sons and a daughter.

The patient Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Pele) was admitted to this hospital suffering from a detached retina in his left eye and underwent surgery to correct the problem, read a statement from the Albert Einstein hospital. The surgery went without problems with a good result.				 																																	Reports said Peles problem arose during a trip abroad at the weekend.				 																																	He was in Switzerland and suffered an abrupt loss of vision in his left eye, Peles ophthalmologist Marcelo Cunha said. 				 																																	He called me and I told him to go and see a doctor. The diagnosis was that the retina had moved out of place. Now, Pele will have to rest for 10 days. The chances of a total recovery are very good. His vision will return to normal little by little.

Nothing is certain but I doubt I will be coaching (Japan) after 2006, the Brazilian was quoted by Japans Nikkan Sports daily. Like Ive said before, I still feel I can do a job for Japanese football. But I wont accept any offers from J-League clubs.

 Rare failure for Mongia
London: Dinesh Mongia was dismissed cheaply as Lancashire managed 210 in their first innings on the opening day of the Division I County Championship match against Surrey on Wednesday. Mongia made only 12 as Lancashire slumped to 21 for four before Chris Scofield (69) took the score past the 200-mark. (PTI)  Copyright

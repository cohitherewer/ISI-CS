 Barry Richards new PCB consultant
Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday said it had finally convinced former South African great Barry Richards to serve as cricket consultant for its national academy in Lahore. Richards will come for 30 days in a year as consultant for not only the national academy but would add to our commitment to secure our future, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said on Monday. Richards rejected PCBs offer of full-time coach two years ago owing to his commitments as TV commentator. He is the second foreigner Pakistan have sought after former Australian captain Greg Chappell agreed to serve as consultant and to tour Pakistan next month. Our main problem is batting and through these two great cricketers, our players will get useful guidance, said Rameez, also a former captain. Due to less movement our batsmen play more towards the on-side and the manuals would teach them how to play these shots under all conditions. (AFP)  Copyright

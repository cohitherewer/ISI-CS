The Telegraph - Calcutta
Australia, NZ launch annual ODI series
Wellington: Australia and New Zealand will play an annual three match one-day International series starting this December, cricket authorities on both sides of the Tasman announced on Wednesday. The series will be for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Simultaneous news conferences were held in both countries to announce the new event. Former New Zealand Test captain Walter Hadlee and his son, ex-Test paceman Dayle, were in attendance at the news conference in New Zealand while the Chappell brothers, former Test skippers Ian and Greg, featured in Australia. The inaugural series will be played in December in Australia as part of a tour of Australia by the Black Caps. The December 2005 series will be played in New Zealand and from December 2006 two matches in each series will be played in one country and one match in the other country on an alternating basis. The Black Caps will play two Tests in Australia inNovember in addition to the three one-dayers for the trophy. The chief executive of New Zealand Cricket, Martin Snedden, said the series would be named the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy in recognition of the contribution both families had made to cricket in their respective countries. There is a very close bond between the two countries and that bond has materialised in the creation of trans-Tasman rivalries in all of our major sports, Snedden said in a statement. I am confident the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy will become as eagerly anticipated as other great annual sporting events such as the Bledisloe Cup (rugby union) series. Australias calendar Australia will host New Zealand, Pakistan and West Indies in a hectic schedule of Test and one-day matches during the 2004-05 southern hemisphere summer. Australian cricket followers have a zealous appetite for cricket action and were particularly pleased to be bringing three international touring sides to Australia as part of the one summer, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement on Wednesday.

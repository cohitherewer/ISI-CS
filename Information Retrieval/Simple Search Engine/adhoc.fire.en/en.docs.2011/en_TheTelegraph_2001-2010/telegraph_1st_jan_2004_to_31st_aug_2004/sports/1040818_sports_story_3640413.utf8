The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nikhil run cut short by Gade 
 SUJIT BHAR Athens: Not much else matters on a day in which the country won its first individual Olympic silver medal, ever. Shooter Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore made the country proud, all right, but the rest have a lot of catching up to do. The mens hockey team, though, brought back some relief after their come-from-behind 4-2 win versus South Africa. In badminton, Nikhil Kanetkars fine run was expectedly stopped short by sixth-seeded Dane Peter Gade. Kanetkar lost 10-15, 6-15 in the pre-quarter finals of the mens singles. There was a slight competition provided by the Indian early in the first game, before fading out to come back again with Gade 8-3 ahead. Five consecutive points later, Kanetkar lost hope and the first game. In the second game Kanetkar never really managed to get a toehold and it was a long, hard fall and departure in 43 minutes overall. In archery there were mixed results. Reena Kumari won her pre-quarter final 7-4 in a shoot-off over Tshering Chhoden of Bhutan. Regular scores were tied at 134-all. Satyadev Prasad moved into the pre-quarter finals. Prasad beat Ron Van Der Hoff of Holland 158-155 in the second round. However, Sumangala Sharma failed to keep pace with Jean Kristin Lewis of South Africa and lost her pre-quarter final engagement 153-157. In sailings 49 first race, Malav Shroff and Sumeet Patel finished way down at 19th spot. They will have more races to correct errors of Tuesday. Wednesday just might be another medal day for India here. Two women enter the weightlifting arena and one of them is Sydney bronze winner Karnam Malleswari. Along with her will be Pratima Kumari, in the 63kg class. Malleswari will be in the 63kg category, a category down from Sydney. I feel good having gone one category down, she said. I think I feel stronger, and I feel I will be able to repeat if not better my Sydney performance. The fact is that she will probably be among weight category that suits her. She has an entry total of 235 kg, and if entries are any indication, there are only two above her (at 240kg). That gives her a headstart. Meanwhile, Kunjurani Devi has had a late revival of fate, when she was promoted to fourth place in the womens 48kg competition. The original fourth-placed girl, Aye Khine Nan of Myanmar was disqualified after a positive dope test. In boxing, Akhil Kumar went down to former world champion and Sydney Games bronze medallist Jerome Thomas of France on points in the first round of the flyweight category. In bantamweight, Diwakar Prasad sailed into the second round after he outfoxed Moroccon Hamid Ait Bighrade 25-17 in the 54 kg bout. Prasad will now face Nigerian Bolum Nestor in the round of 16.

Lisbon: Uefa has charged Croatia with improper conduct after the team was shown five yellow cards in the Euro 2004 match against Switzerland on Sunday. The case following the 0-0 Group B draw will be dealt with on Tuesday. Russia were warned about their improper conduct after being shown four yellow cards and Roman Sharonovs red card in their 0-1 defeat by Spain in Group A on Saturday. Switzerland midfielder Johann Vogel, who was sent off against Croatia has been suspended for one match as expected, Uefa said.There were no immediate details about a possible suspension for Sharonov. Meanwhile, Swiss coach Kobi Kuhn was very proud of his ten-man team which held for much of the second half to earn a 0-0 Euro 2004 draw with Croatia on Sunday. Defensive midfielder Johann Vogel was sent off four minutes into the second half for a second bookable offence.I am very proud of the team, it was a good performance for 90 minutes and very good in the second half with ten men, said Kuhn. It was very hard but it is too early to say what this result means. We have wait until we have seen more games. The two sides are seen as the underdogs in group B which also includes England and France. We have a good record against England but we know we have to improve up front. We had some chances and at this level you have to take them. Croatias Otto Baric said: It was very hard out there because it was very, very hot. The players were fighting and trying but they couldnt manage it..  (Reuters)  Copyright

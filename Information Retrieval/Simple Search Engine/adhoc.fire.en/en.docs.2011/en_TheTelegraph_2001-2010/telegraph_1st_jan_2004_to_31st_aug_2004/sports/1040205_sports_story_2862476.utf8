The Telegraph - Calcutta
 AIFF nod for Vietnam meet 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said on Wednesday the Indian senior team will take part in the LG Cup in Vietnam as part of its preparation for the pre-World Cup matches. Indias first pre-World Cup match will be on February 18, versus Singapore in Margao. The next match will be over a month later in Kochi and the third one in Japan. This period, after the first match, is what the AIFF wants to use to play this tournament which the Indian team won in 2002. Colaco was here for the deal-signing ceremony with Leicester City (along with East Bengal). He informed the second stage of the National Football League will start on February 22. He also indicated that there was only an extremely slim chance of any club getting a replacement for a foreigner in the next phase of the league. The issue had started with Mohun Bagan requesting a replacement for Jose Ramirez Barreto and then requests had come in from some other clubs as well. Colaco said he would meet AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi on Thursday to discuss whether such replacements can be granted.  Copyright

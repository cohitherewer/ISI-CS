The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt can, says Agassi
Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt can take heart as he tries to return to the top of the tennis rankings. The former top-ranked Australian, now at No. 11, has received the endorsement of one man who knows exactly what is needed to achieve the feat. Andre Agassi, whose own climb from the tennis wastelands in 1997 was far greater than the task facing Hewitt, says the two-time Grand Slam winner has the fighting qualities needed to make it back. Certainly, he could be a potential No. 1 player again, Agassi said of Hewitt, who finished 2001 and 2002 as the top-ranked mens player in the world but ended 2003 at No. 17. I mean, if he thinks falling to 15 in the world is an accomplishment, he should have been around me a few years ago. I would have shown him what it really means to work hard and fall to 140 in the world. Agassi fell to No. 122 in the world at the end of 1997, then made the biggest one-year jump into the top 10 in the history of the ATP rankings by climbing back to No. 6 the next year. Things can change fast, said Agassi, Its not easy to be on top... Especially the way he plays the game, he works so hard in every match that its easy to understand any sort of physical or mental struggle that could occur at any given time.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

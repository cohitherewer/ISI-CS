The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ranadeb off to a new beginning
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: He was in contention for a place among the World Cup probables last year but Ranadeb Bose has since failed to make much headway. He seemed to have been another face lost in the crowd but the 24-year-old has made it a habit of making his presence felt from lost situations. The medium pacer, who grabbed 23 wickets in Ranji Trophy last season, failed to pick a wicket in the season opener against Rajasthan this time. He got very little chance to prove his worth after that. Shib Shankar Paul was in terrific form and to keep the team balance right, Ranadeb got the axe. Ironically, he has claimed five or more wickets in this seasons last engagement in both forms of the game  five versus Gujarat in Ranji Trophy and Wednesdays six for 35 against Tamil Nadu in the national one-day meet. I dont want to comment anything on getting dropped. But Ive always tried to make best use of the opportunities that came my way. I havent been picked for the Duleep Trophy and the first-class season has ended for me, Ranadeb, who played for Elite A in Duleep last season, lamented. He did not get a chance in the zonal one-day meet in Jamshedpur, and was overlooked for the Deodhar Trophy too. Anyway, Im happy with my showing and will work hard to start the next season on a fresh note, he added. His bowling has showed improvement this season, the smooth run-up and delivery along with a fresh burst of pace. He attributes it to playing for Corsham Club in Wiltshire, England and sessions with coach Gopal Bose. I bowled long spells in the League games and it helped a lot. Gopalda also made me believe that a bad phase is only a temporary happening, Ranadeb said. He also worked on getting my outswinger right. I think Im mentally stable and more matured, he admitted. I try to bowl to my limitations and did just that today, he explained. Ranadeb also did not forget physio Ranadip Moitras contribution. Hes been of great help and made me physically stronger and fitter. Significantly, the medium-pacer will not go to England during off-season and undergo pre-season conditioning as prescribed by the CAB.  Copyright

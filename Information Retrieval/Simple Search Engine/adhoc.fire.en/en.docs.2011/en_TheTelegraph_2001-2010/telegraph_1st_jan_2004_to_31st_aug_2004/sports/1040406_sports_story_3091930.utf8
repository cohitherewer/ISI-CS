 Help for 10-year-old cancer patient
Lahore: In a touching gesture, the Indian team has appealed to cancer specialists back home to help save a 10-year-old Lahore girls life. Huba Shahid has been diagnosed with rabdomy sacroma (facial cancer). Her father Shahid Siddique Chhina, who is a local journalist, has been told that the recommended treatment is gamma knife surgery that is available only in India in the sub-continent. The Indian teams appeal was made public by manager Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on Monday. The girls father is keen that the treatment be done in India, Shetty said in a statement. I hope that doctors (in India) would respond to the appeal by the cricketers and facilitate little Hubas treatment at the earliest as time is running out for the child, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

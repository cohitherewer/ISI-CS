The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sporting players agree to take field 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: It took the Mohammedan Sporting officials some persuasion on Tuesday to get the players assurance that they would take the field against Mahindra United in a National Football League match on Wednesday. The players gathered at the club ground on the match-eve but refused to take the field until the officials assured them of the dues. We had an hours session with the club officials and they have promised us that the dues will be cleared in 22 days time, striker Dipendu Biswas told reporters after practice. Were happy that the officials have listened to our demands and we will give our 100 per cent tomorrow. The foreigners Chidi Edeh and Okoli Onyeka Odafa were absent from practice on Tuesday, but the club officials said both would play on Wednesday. Coach Jamshed Nassiri said his team would play in the 4-4-2 formation. We are not at all in a good positionTheres no choice but to go for a win, he said. Nassiri pointed out that Mahindra United sometimes looked patchy following a lack of communication between their midfielders and the defence. Ive told my boys to cash in on that, Nassiri said. Mohammedan Sporting went down fighting against the same rivals in the first phase and the coach felt that the team should take confidence from that 3-4 verdict. I wasnt the coach at that timeBut I had seen Mahindra United in the Federation Cup final. Theres no reason why we cant beat them. Mohammedan Sporting will miss defender Amjad Ali Khan, who will be sitting out with double booking. Mahindra United, too, will miss the experienced Arun Malhotra (double yellow) in the defence. They have 24 points from 15 games while Mohammedan Sporting have 15 from as many matches.  Copyright

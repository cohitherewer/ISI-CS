 Brazil aim to settle scores vs Paraguay
Asuncion: Champions Brazil are promising that adversity will bring out the best in them as they aim to settle scores with Paraguay in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Brazil face injury problems, searing heat and will only have had one training session before the match against the Paraguayans, who are making a habit out of upsetting their neighbours. Brazil lost 2-1 on their last visit to Asuncion three years ago and had their 2002 World Cup celebrations dampened by Paraguay, who beat them 1-0 in their first match after winning the final. Paraguay also qualified for this Augusts Olympic Games at Brazils expense, beating them 1-0 at under-23 level in January. Brazil must thrive in the most difficult moments, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said. We will make sure that our quality prevails. Well get over all this on the pitch, he said. If we can impose our rhythm, well win the game. Parreira was only entitled to his players 48 hours before Wednesdays match because the date had been allocated by Fifa for friendlies. As a result, most of the squad took part in domestic games for their European clubs at the weekend, flew out on Sunday and arrived in Paraguay on Monday where they were greeted by temperatures in the high 30s Celsius. Im not complaining but the guys have come from Europe, said Parreira. No matter how motivated you are, the human body suffers. In addition, midfielder Kleberson, right back Belletti and midfielder Alex all withdrew from the squad through injury.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

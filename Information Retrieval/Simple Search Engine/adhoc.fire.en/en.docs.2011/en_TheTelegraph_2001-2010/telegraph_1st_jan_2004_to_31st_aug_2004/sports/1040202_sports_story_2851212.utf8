The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, February 02, 2004  Flame justifies classic form 
 FROM PRAVESH GUPTA Mumbai: Psychic Flames  juggernaut rolls on. The Darius Byramji-trained filly won  the McDowell Indian Derby here on Sunday. The Razeen-Eminence  daughter, however, had to win another battle in the stewards  room after the rider of the second-placed horse, Estonia,  lodged an objection on grounds of interference passing the  distance-post. Pesi Shroff, who partnered the 8-1 shot to  victory, also bettered his Indian Derby record of seven  wins.				 										The objection raised by Mallesh Narredu was more of a technical nature, though the jockey and connections of the 4-1 joint-favourite  with Simply Supreme and Artois  felt that Estonia was knocked out of her strides when she was beginning to make her move. In the live proceedings of the review process and the repeated replays of the tapes from various angles, Mallesh failed to justify his objection and got over-ruled by the stewards.				 										Shroff was quite flexible about following the riding instructions of Darius. A warm-up gallop last Thursday and the Calcutta Derby tapes being his only knowledge of the filly, the jockey refused to wait till the final turn to exploit Psychic Flames sharp turn of foot. More so because the likes of Estonias, Artois, Lancasters and few others were known to be equally brilliant with late run.				 										Trailing the field of 17 runners till the halfway mark, Pesi improved on the wide out of the field to be eighth. He was sixth into the straight while leads changed in front. But 250m from home, it became quite apparent that it was going to be a two-horse race when Psychic Flame and Estonia shot out of the pack simultaneously. However, the Flame was always travelling better until the infringement took place.				 										It was the Flame who had come close to Estonia and also brushed her while the heat was on. But in his effort to avoid a collision, Pesi had Psychic Flame shifting away. With the winning post less than a furlong away, he was also quick to collect the Flame and put her on even keel. Thanks to his cool temperament the jockey did not get rattled but continued to ride out the Flame with hands and heels, matching Estonias challenge in the next 75 metres.				 										However, taking no chance in the final 100m, Pesi whipped the filly on her shoulder who accelerated to a length victory.				 										Estonia was also a spent force close to home as she was nearly edged out from the second slot by trainer Zadmal Singhs Sprungli. This factor may have also influenced the stewards when they over-ruled the objection.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Last chance for Diego, says doctor
Buenos Aires: Argentine football legend Diego Maradona faces the final battle to vanquish his demons and save himself from a life-threatening drug addiction, his personal physician Alfredo Cahe claimed on Monday. Maradona, 43, has checked into the Del Parque private drugs rehabilitation clinic in western Buenos Aires, which Cahe admitted was probably the last chance for the 1986 World Cup winning captain. I hope that it will have the necessary effect, said Dr Cahe. Until now that hasnt happened. I hope that hell finally wake up and take responsbility. Dr Cahe said that Maradona had been checked in against his will, with the former footballer preferring to return to the luxurious residence at General Rodriguez, 50 km to the north west of Buenos Aires, or Cuba, where he has lived for most of the past four years. Cuban leader Fidel Castro even put a plane at Maradonas disposal should he want to return to the island, according to sources close to the player. But he was persuaded by his former wife Claudia Villafane who explained: Youre going to stay there five or six days. Since Saturday, Maradonas family had been trying to find a centre, which would accept the player. Several clinics had refused to take him, fearing he would resist treatment and the media circus would deny privacy to other patients. The Del Parque is far from the luxury Maradona is used to, although he will have his own room and will not mix with the other patients. But the biggest problem will be getting the former footballer to follow his treatment. Its extremely difficult but without the acceptance of the player it is practically impossible, said Ricardo Grimson, the Drug Prevention Programme secretary. Sleep therapy, strict diet and total rest are the treatments being used by doctors at Del Parque with specialists estimating the duration of treatment of six and eighteen months. The first task facing doctors will be to get Maradona to lose weight, fight against his cocaine addiction and the resulting withdrawal symptons.  AFP  Copyright

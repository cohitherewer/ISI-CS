The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Maria 2nd-youngest in final
 - This is unbelievable, I dont know how Im here This is crazy  Lindsay Davenport makes a backhand return to Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon on Thursday. (Reuters) London: Seventeen-year-old Russian Maria Sharapova overhauled former champion Lindsay Davenport 2-6, 7-6, 6-1 on Thursday to become the second-youngest Wimbledon finalist since tennis turned professional. The Siberia-born teenager, who left her homeland for Florida as a seven-year-old, became the first Russian since Olga Morozova in 1974 to reach the final, where she will face either holder Serena Williams or Frances seed Amelie Mauresmo. In the Open era only Martina Hingis, who won the title in 1997 as a 16-year-old, has played in a final at a younger age than Sharapovas 17 years and two months. This is unbelievable, I dont know how Im in the final. This is crazy, said Sharapova. This is my favourite Grand Slam and Id never imagined Id be in the final so early. I dont know what to say, Im going to cry right now. Davenport won the last of her three Grand Slam titles in Melbourne four years ago and at 28, her relative lack of mobility was exploited by Sharapova in a contest lasting one hour and 52 minutes. A lengthy rain-disruption just after the start of the second set came to the rescue of Sharapova, who had earlier appeared overawed at playing in her first major semi-final. I just kept believing in myself and somehow I tried to find a way to turn it around, Sharapova added.The American fifth seed, playing in her 15th Grand Slam semi-final, initially had more problems with the British weather than with her opponent. Sharapova and Davenport had played just two points before rain forced them to scurry back into the locker room for 30 minutes. Once they returned, the 1999 champion capitalised on Sharapovas nerves to break in the opening game by forcing the Russian to net a backhand. Davenport then made her experience count as the Russian struggled to control her spectacular shots. Sharapova could do little to stem the flow of unforced errors as Davenport reeled off five games in a row to seal the first set and move ahead 2-0 in the second. But a second rain disruption, this time for 50 minutes, recharged Sharapovas batteries and she came out firing to break Davenport in the sixth game to get back to 3-3. The Russians battling instincts kicked in again when she was forced to save break-points in the ninth and 11th games, each time with an ace. The tie-break became a battle of wills as the players exchanged a flurry of mini-breaks before Sharapova grabbed a 4-3 advantage with a ferocious drive volley. Cheered on by the Centre Court crowd, the 13th seed levelled the contest after 80 minutes with a scorching crosscourt winner. The teenager continued to captivate fans with her attacking play and boundless energy in the decider, forcing Davenport on to the back foot to edge into a 4-1 lead with yet another blistering forehand winner. As Davenports game disintegrated into the grey clouds hovering over Centre Court, Sharapova booked her place in the final after the American sailed forehand long. With a look of disbelief on her face, Sharapova stood behind the baseline, soaking up the atmosphere before blowing kisses to all corners of the stands. Mahesh-Elena in quarters Top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Elena Likhovtseva have reached the mixed doubles quarter finals. The Indo-Russian pair beat 15th seeds Daniel Nestor of Canada and Russian Lina Krasnoroutskaya 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) on Wednesday. Bhupathi and Likhovtseva will now meet the unseeded American pair of Bob Bryan and Lindsay Davenport, who defeated Pavel Vizner of Czech Republic and Lisa McShea of Australia 6-2, 6-3. Karan Rastogi and Chu-huan Yi of Chinese Taipei reached the second round in boys singles with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Argentinas Juan Pablo Amado and Vahid Mirzadeh of the US. Indian challenge in girls doubles ended in the first round with the defeat of Tara Iyer who had teamed up with Elizabeth Kobak of the US.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

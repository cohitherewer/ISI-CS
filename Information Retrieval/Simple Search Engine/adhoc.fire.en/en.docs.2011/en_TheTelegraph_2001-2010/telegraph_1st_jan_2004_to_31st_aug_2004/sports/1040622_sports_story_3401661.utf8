The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Martina turns the clock back
 - Federer, Hewitt, Venus reach Round II  Goran Ivanisevic reacts to a missed shot during his match on MondayLondon: Defending champion Roger Federer and 2002 winner Lleyton Hewitt eased into the second round at Wimbledon Monday but both men found themselves upstaged by 47-year-old Martina Navratilova. The veteran American, nine-times a singles champion at the All-England Club and who last played a singles match here when she lost the 1994 final to Conchita Martinez, brushed aside Colombias Catalina Castano, 23 years her junior, 6-0, 6-1 in the first round. Joining her in the second round was fellow American Venus Williams, twice a champion and a finalist in the last four years, who breezed past Switzerlands Marie-Gayanay Mikaelian 6-3, 6-0 on a frustrating opening day to the tournament which was punctuated by a series of rain delays. In other matches Thomas Johansson of Sweden beat Nicolas Kiefer of Germany 4-6, 4-6, 6-4 ,6-3, 6-0 and Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia beat Mikhail Youzhny of Russia 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2. Then Frenchman Fabrice Santoro beat Alberto Martin of Spain 7-5, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. Wildcard Navratilova, who made her debut here in 1973 and is now ranked at 700 in the world, broke serve twice in the opening set which she wrapped up in just 17 minutes on court two. The Colombian youngster then saved three match points before she eventually capitulated after just 46 minutes. Navratilova now plays either 23rd seeded Serbian Jelena Dokic or Argentinas Gisela Dulko, the player who beat her in the first round of the French Open. You can only play as well as your opponent does and she didnt really push me until near the end. But it was a good match for me overall, said Navratilova. She started playing better at the end and it was nice to be pushed, but she is a better clay-court player and I am a better grass court player. Asked about criticism of being given a wildcard into the event at 47 ahead of younger, up-and-coming players, Navratilova said she felt no guilt. Some people are saying why is she doing it and others are saying its great what she is doing. Its nice to be appreciated like that. Tennis is for the fans, she added. Top seed and defending champion Federer reached the second round with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-0 win over British wildcard Alex Bogdanovic and managed to avoid the humiliation suffered by his predecessor Hewitt. Twelve months ago, the Australian arrived here as defending champion but slumped to an embarrassing first round defeat at the hands of Croatias Ivo Karlovic, who was ranked 203 at the time. It was one of the biggest shocks in the history of the event with Hewitt becoming only the second mens champion since the tournaments inception in 1877 to bow out in the first round.

Federer now faces Colombian qualifier Alejandro Falla for a place in the third round. Hewitt, the 2002 winner, avoided a repeat of last years embarrassment when he brushed aside Austrias Jurgen Melzer 6-2, 6-4, 6-2. Melzer, the junior champion in 1999, never settled and sent down 28 unforced errors to Hewitts nine as he slumped to his third defeat of the year at the hands of the 23-year-old Australian. Meanwhile, 13th-seeded Thai Paradorn Srichaphan, who warmed up in style winning the Nottingham grasscourt title at the weekend, saw his hopes dashed when he became the latest victim to be steamrolled by Karlovic. The Croatian picked up where he left off in 2003 with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win in two hours and 12 minutes and he admitted that his famous win over Hewitt has helped him rise to the brink of the top 50. Also winning among women was 11th seed Ai Sugiyama of Japan, beating Amanda Janes of Britain 3-6, 6-2, 6-3.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Lewis to retire
London: World heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis will retire from boxing on Friday, BBC Radio has reported. The 38-year-old Briton has not fought since June last year, when he stopped Vitali Klitschko. He has been under pressure to decide on his future and the WBC set Lewis a deadline of March 1 to confirm a rematch with the Ukrainian. Lewis is expected to hold a press conference in London on Friday. Lewis retained the WBC title last June in controversial circumstances when he stopped Klitschko after the sixth round. Lewis has 41 career wins.  (AFP)  Copyright

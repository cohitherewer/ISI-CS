The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav calls for complete intensity
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Anil Kumble is unlikely for Thursdays tie versus Australia Calcutta: The Team India thinktank is contemplating bringing back Virender Sehwag, who has recovered from a shoulder problem, in Thursdays tri-series clash against world champions Australia. According to The Telegraphs sources in Sydney, if Sehwag does make the XI, then Hemang Badani (and not Rohan Gavaskar) will sit out. As of late Wednesday, indications were that Sachin Tendulkar and Ajit Agarkar will continue to be rested. But while the Sehwag bit is uncertain, one understands that leggie Anil Kumble has a sore bowling shoulder and is unlikely to play. His place, then, will go to Murali Kartik. Agencies add from Sydney: With their tails up after beating Australia in their own den for the first time in 12 years, captain Sourav Ganguly is demanding complete intensity from his team in what promises to be a pulsating day-night game at the SCG. We two are probably headed for the finals but we are really keen to do well against them in the final two league games. We feel it would count in the finals, Sourav said. India and Australia have split their two matches in the series and have each beaten Zimbabwe twice. The Indians flew in to Sydney on Wednesday morning, a bit sheepish on the Rahul Dravid affair. Sourav, however, has had a close look at his reserve bench and has a fair idea of their capabilities. He liked what he saw from Irfan Pathan in the last few weeks and L. Balaji is quickly growing in confidence. But above all, Sourav, who always relishes the one-day arena, must be perked up to open the innings. He has had a few starts in this series and will really like to get a big score in Sydney. Australian coach John Buchanan has attributed Indias success in the ongoing tour to an astute Sourav. I think Sourav played a pretty good mental game from the beginning of the Test series, Buchanan said. Whether it be with Brett (Lee) or with whomever it might be, the team or individual, I think hes been pretty astute with the way hes carried himself and his team through this whole series. Theyre playing some good cricket... And their top-order batting is, as we saw through the Test series, the key to their performance, he added. With Hayden having been rested, Simon Katich has a chance to express himself in the one-day arena. He has really begun to flower in the last month or so, batting brilliantly in the Sydney Test and carrying on the form in the domestic season. Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn are two other batsmen who would like to shrug off a somewhat lean patch and reduce the burden on the others.  Teams Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Damien Martyn, Simon Katich, Michael Bevan, Andrew Symonds, Michael Clarke, Andy Bichel, Brett Lee, Brad Williams and Jason Gillespie. India (from): Sourav Ganguly (captain), Virender Sehwag, Parthiv Patel, V.V.S. Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Hemang Badani, Rohan Gavaskar, Anil Kumble, Laxmipathy Balaji, Ashish Nehra, Irfan Pathan, Murali Kartik. (PTI)  Copyright

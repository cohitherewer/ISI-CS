The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC refusal disappoints Pak Board
	 - Code for ex-players  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Rameez feels the issue should have been discussed Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is disappointed that the International Cricket Council (ICC) has ruled out the introduction of a Code of Conduct for former players without even waiting for a formal proposal. I still feel the ICC must have a Code and, yes, Im disappointed the governing body didnt even wait for a formal proposal from us. Indeed, it reacted on the basis of reports in the Media... There ought to have been a discussion, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph. That the PCB, stung by Rashid Latifs latest allegation, would move the ICC for a Code of Conduct was first reported in these columns on Tuesday. The ICC responded that very day, with chief executive Malcolm Speed doing the talking in Nairobi. Rameez, for his part, added that the ICC should ask Latif to appear before its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit. Unless an investigation is launched, the charges continue to circulate... If theres evidence, let the world know. If not, the ICC must tackle the former player in question... Latif has alleged that the fourth ODI, won by India, was fixed. The PCB, of course, has already activated its disciplinary committee, headed by Justice (retd) Amir Alam Khan. Meanwhile, according to PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, Justice Khan alone will decide whether Latif should be accorded an in-camera hearing. The former captain has sought that privilege.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We should regain title: Kumble 
 Rahul Dravid runs between wickets during a practice session at the pre-Asia Cup camp in Chennai on Thursday. (AFP) Chennai, July 8 (PTI): Anil Kumble said on Thursday India have a good chance of regaining the Asia Cup as they are going to the tournament with a full-strength team with bowlers capable of getting quick breakthroughs. Participating at a function organised by Asia Cup title sponsors Indian Oil, the leg-spinner said he has been practising hard for the last two months and is confident of a good performance in Sri Lanka. We have picked the best team for the tournament with Harbhajan (Singh) and the medium-pacers, who are capable of getting quick breakthroughs. India should re- gain the trophy, said the veteran. Kumble thanked captain Sourav Ganguly, who earlier in the day said that the leg-spinner was bowling at his best. I am really thankful to Sourav for his comments. I have been working hard for the last two months and I hope I will be able to live up to the expectations of my teammates. Yuvraj Singh, who was also present at the function along with Irfan Pathan, brushed aside questions on the second openers slot in Tests. A lot of statements and comments have been made on the openers issue. Now we are looking ahead to the Asia Cup which is a limited-over tournament. Test matches are far way but I will do my best, if picked.  Copyright

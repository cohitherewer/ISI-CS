The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Friday, May 14, 2004  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Subhas Bhowmicks fate will finally be decided on Friday when IFA secretary Subrata Dutta is expected to announce the verdict after consultations with the governing body members. The IFA disciplinary committee had decided to debar Bhowmick from sitting in the technical area, reserve bench or inside-fence of any IFA-organised meet for two years (beginning May 16), for some derogatory remarks against the association. The East Bengal coach appealed against the harsh punishment and explained before the governing body that he didnt mean to insult the association.				 																																																	 The marathon National Football League (NFL) campaign out of the way, East Bengals focus shifts back to matters international. The NFL champions, who returned home on Thursday evening after winning their final match against Haywards Sporting in Goa, get back to practice Friday afternoon as they prepare for their AFC Cup away match against Malaysias Negeri Sembilan.				 																																																	East Bengal, who have already qualified for the quarter finals from group E, will top the group even if they draw with Negeri on Tuesday. We want to win that match, too, but Ill think of how to go about it tomorrow only, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said after landing in the city.

		 Saturday, July 24, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Calcutta: Keshav Misra who almost bagged the title in the second round itself with a brilliant round of nine-under 63 and consolidated his lead to 10 strokes on the penultimate round, lost five strokes on the final day. Despite the fumble, he annexed the Royal Challenge Indian Golf Tour opener - the Northern Indian Amateur title at the Army Golf Course in New Delhi Friday, according to information reaching here. 				 																																	The 26-year-old finished with a tournament tally of six-under 282 to win by four strokes.				 																																	Vikrant Chopra, playing along side cricketing legend Kapil Dev and veteran Vikramjit Singh, submitted a card of two-under 70 to end up as the runner-up. 				 																																	Raleigh (North Carolina): An arbitration panel hearing world champion sprinter Torri Edwardss doping case has determined there may be exceptional circumstances for her positive stimulant test and has referred the case to the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), her agent-lawyer said on Thursday. We are pleased the arbitration panel agreed that she is not a cheat, Emanuel Hudson said. But he cautioned that this was just another hurdle for Edwards as she fights to retain her place in next months Olympics. The case now goes before an IAAF doping review board, Hudson said. 				 																																	New Delhi: Indian hopes of emulating Soumyajit Sarkars historic feat was dashed Friday when none of their paddlers could make the quarter finals of the Asian junior table tennis championship at the NDMC stadium. Indias medal prospects were dealt a severe blow when Soumyajit Sarkar, Subhadip Das, Aniket Koparkar and Mousami Paul lost in the pre-quarter final to bring the curtains down on the hosts challenge. 				 																																	Athens: Greece declared on Friday their formal security planning for next months Olympics was over and it was ready to guard the Games and implement the biggest ever security operation for an Olympics.				 																																	 We are ready. We will organise a presentation of the whole system as early as next week, Public Order Minister George Voulgarakis said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan steamroll Md. Sp.
 - Question mark over black-and-white brigades survival after 4th defeat  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ashim Biswas, Sunil Chhetri and Jerry Zirsanga (right to left) after Mohun Bagans second goal against Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Agreed that its premature to say Mohammedan Sporting as a footballing force are dying. But the way Mohun Bagan outran, outclassed and finally demolished them 3-0 in a CFL Super Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday brought up the match once again that the black-and-white brigade is very much on the wane. The contest could also be observed as a study in contrast: while one team was shining and looked determined to reclaim the championship, the other struggling to get a foothold on surviving the league itself. Ashim Biswas put Mohun Bagan ahead in as early as 14th minute. Then in the second half, W. Mehraj Uddin (52nd minute) and Sunil Chhetri (63rd) completed the rout. The scoreline could have easily doubled as two goals  one each from Ashim and Chhetri  were ruled out as off-side and the same duo messed up converting sitters on quite a few occasions. At no point of time did Mridul Banerjees Mohammedan Sporting manage to open up the opponents defence  a fact that clearly pointed to Mohun Bagans omnipotent presence in the match. The win took Mohun Bagan to 17 points from seven outings while Mohammedan Sporting, having suffered their fourth consecutive defeat, remained on three from five matches. Seen from a technical point of view, it was Subrata Bhattacharyas midfield that tilted the match heavily in favour of his team. Dharamjeet Singh, Noel Wilson and Tomba Singh gelled so well and worked on feeding the three-pronged forward line so elegantly that Mohammedan Sportings intention of guarding the defence and frustrating the opponents soon went up in smoke. Tomba and Dharamjeet started the onslaught with inviting crosses from both flanks in the seventh and ninth minutes respectively, but Brazilian Reggis Carlos Montero and Ashim failed to get to the ball in time. The latter, however, soon opened the floodgates. When Ashim blasted off for Mehraj Uddins high centre, beating the off-side trap, he kept his cool, dodged past goalkeeper Chinmoy Banerjee twice before volleying home the opening goal. Basudeb Mondal replaced an ordinary Reggis, who was culprits for squandering too many promising moves by standing on off-side positions, on the half-hour mark as Mohun Bagan temporarily decided to slow the pace of the game. Their attacking designs, though, were restored in the second-half when Jerry Zirsanga substituted captain Manitombi Singh and the green-and-maroon outfit was then stomping the rival area with as many as four forwards. In the 52nd minute, Mohun Bagan won a free-kick near the box. Basudeb pushed it sideways, Wilson sold a dummy over it and Mehraj Uddin came up with a powerful right-footed grounder, which gave Chinmoy little chance to react. Eleven minutes later, the Bagan midfield again came in action as Dharamjeets long across-the-field centre found Zirsanga on the right. the second-half substitute relayed it back to his former Tata Football Academy (TFA) teammate Chhetri at the other post. The latter took his time and drove home unchallenged. In the 69th minute, Ashim followed the ball and pushed it in after Chinmoy blocked a Chhetri try. But referee Subrata Das ruled the goal out saying the former was off-side. Nine minutes from time, a Chhetri goal was disallowed on the grounds that Ashim was off-side.

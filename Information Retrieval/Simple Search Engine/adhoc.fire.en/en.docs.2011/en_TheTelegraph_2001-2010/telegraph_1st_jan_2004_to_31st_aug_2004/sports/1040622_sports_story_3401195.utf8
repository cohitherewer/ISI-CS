The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Must-win game for Azzurri
	 - Italians wary of Scandinavian conspiracy  Christian Vieri will be available despite pain Lisbon: Christian Vieris rant at the Italian media on Sunday was misdirected. Instead of telling Italian journalists he was more of a man than they would ever be, they might have been more impressed if he had told them he was a better mathematician. Thats because cool people with a head for figures will be needed on Tuesday night to determine whether or not Italy advance to the Euro 2004 quarter finals following their group C match with already eliminated Bulgaria in Guimaraes. Italy will qualify for the last eight as long as they beat Bulgaria and Sweden and Denmark, who meet in Porto, do not draw 2-2 or higher. Other scenarios are possible depending on how the two matches finish. Italys cause is not helped by suspensions to Francesco Totti, Gennaro Gattuso and skipper Fabio Cannavaro and on Monday coach Giovanni Trapattoni also faced an injury doubt over midfielder Cristiano Zanetti. Zanetti, who played in the opening 0-0 draw with Denmark but did not feature in the 1-1 draw with Sweden on Friday, missed training on Sunday with a muscle problem. Vieri, who marched out of Sundays news conference following his protest at media coverage, did not join the in-house training match as he is suffering pain in his left knee. Vieri worked out in the gym and had a massage. He is not believed to be at risk for the Bulgaria match that Italy must win to have a chance of reaching the quarter finals. Matteo Ferrari and Marco Materazzi are the two main options to replace Cannavaro in the centre of defence, while Gattusos slot in midfield could go to Stefano Fiore or Mauro Camoranesi. The build-up to Tuesdays crunch matches has been overshadowed by suggestions that the Swedes and the Danes might have shaken hands on their result and the Italians want the match closely monitored. Italy are unhappy with the way Danish television cameras tracked their striker Francesco Totti for the whole 90 minutes of their opening game against Denmark and caught him spitting in the face of defender Christian Poulsen. The pictures were used as evidence against Totti and subsequently led to the Roma captain receiving a three-match ban from Uefa. Totti will only return to action if Italy get to the semi-finals. I would like to see 50 television cameras at that game (Sweden versus Denmark), said Italy hardman Gennaro Gattuso, who will be suspended for the Bulgaria match after picking up two yellow cards in the first two group matches. Instead of watching us, everybody should go and keep an eye on what happens there. In these last few days everybody has been following our movements, now lets see how they behave. Im sick of being lectured. We are Italy and we have a tradition. Lets look in their houses. Talking as tough as he tackles, Gattuso said he thought Italy were being victimised by world footballs governing bodies, a reference to the 2002 World Cup in which the Italians were knocked out in the second round by South Korea, a match full of dubious refereeing decisions. The truth is that we Italians are not well-liked, he growled. May be its because our championship is the most beautiful in the world. Ive heard people say that Uefa respect us, but in every tournament recently something strange happens to us. Italy striker Alessandro Del Piero, carrying an equally big chip on his shoulder, said it would be scandalous if the Sweden versus Denmark game ended up as a high scoring draw. It would be a dirty result if it were to finish 2-2 and we were knocked out, said the Juventus striker, whose Italy team might not be in such trouble had he hit the target in the Azzurris first two games. Bulgaria, already eliminated after defeats against Sweden and Denmark, will be without captain Stilian Petrov and centre back Rosen Kirilov who are suspended  and almost certainly injured defender Ivailo Petkov.

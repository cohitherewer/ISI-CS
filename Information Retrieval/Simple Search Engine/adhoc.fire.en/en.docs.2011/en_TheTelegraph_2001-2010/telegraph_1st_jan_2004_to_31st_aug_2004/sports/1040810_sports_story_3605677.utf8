Cricket Online
Ravi ShastriI am a right-handed batsman and often get a leading edge while playing the on drive. Is there any problem with my footwork?																										(Abhijit Medhi, 14, Tezpur)																										Yes. The problem is youre not getting close enough to the pitch of the ball and hence closing the face of the blade a bit too early. Therefore, the leading edge.																										I always face problems tackling spinners. Whenever I try to step out, I get bowled or stumped. Please help.																										(Plabit Narayan, 17, Guwahati)																										Youre obviously misjudging the flight because youre not watching the ball close enough and might be just lifting your head at the time of playing the shot.																										I am a medium-pacer. Whenever I try to bowl a yorker, the ball falls short of the right length. Please help.																										(Sagar Handique, 17, Dibrugarh)																										Check the spot where you want to bowl. For starters, look at the centre of the stump. Aim at the centre to the top and youll get it right.																										How does one read the googly coming out of the leg-spinners hand?																										(Tapas Basu, 19, Calcutta-7)																										Watch the hand very closely. You will see the ball coming out of the back of the hand. Also watch the seam of the ball and youll get a clear indication.																										I am a medium-pacer and often spray the ball all over. My coach says the position of my head does not remain still during delivery. How do I correct this?																										(Sibu Datta, 23, Guwahati)																										Your coach has got it spot on. Try to concentrate on the area where you want the ball to land and this might just help.																										I am a right-hander. When driving straight past the bowler I often get caught and bowled. Please help.																										(Ramen Singh, 19, Calcutta-84)																										Its because youre playing too early and, by not getting to the pitch, youre playing with the bat away from your body.																										I am a left-arm spinner. I often bowl too many wide balls. Please help.																										(Subir Ganguly, 19, Howrah)																										Your head is not still at the point of delivery. Youre also not watching the spot where you want the ball to land.																										I am a medium-pacer. How does one bowl the off-cutter?																										(Timir Pratap, 17, Durgapur)																										You got to hold the ball seam up and roll the fingers across the seam clockwise if youre a right-hander and anti-clockwise if youre a left-hander. Youll also need a quick arm action to get the off-cutter going.																										I am a right-handed batsman and love to play my shots. Generally I use a light bat but my coach suggests a heavy one. What should I do?																										(Ramprasad Datta, 21, Calcutta-10)																										You got to use what youre comfortable with. It should not cause you any inconvenience when playing a shot. Youve got to make the right adjustment.																										Does the punch from the middle get affected when using a laminated bat?																										(Rajdeep Mukherjee, 18, Asansol)																										Im afraid I havent used one and, so wouldnt know. Stick to the wooden one and you would be better off.

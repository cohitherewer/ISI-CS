 BY STAR RACER		 ShankerCalcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh may call the shots in Saturdays eight-event race card. Vijay has strong representation in most of the races, including the two trophy events, the Alokananda Stakes and the Bangalore Turf Club Cup (BTC Cup). His lightweight filly Amelina just needs to beat her stable-mate, and a two-time winner Reminiscent, to claim the stakes. S. Shanker partners the Duja-Academy Gold three-year-old filly against the C. Alford-ridden Reminiscent.				 										In the BTC Cup, Vijays Announcer also enjoys a big handicap advantage over Bharaths Tasmac and he could upstage the speedster. Some of Vijays other wards, Twothousandfour, Assailer, Crimson Rage and Amaryllis also run with a good chance to win their respective events.				 										Race card and selections				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. shock Churchill 2-0 
Margao: Mohammedan Sporting put paid to Churchill Brothers bid to stay in hunt for the National Football League title when the relegation strugglers from Calcutta shocked the hosts 2-0 at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday. Syed Rahim Nabi and Okoli Oneyka Odafa were the scorers. Mohammedan Sporting, who had earlier lost to the Goan rivals 1-2, took their tally to 18 from 17 matches while Churchill remained on 29. Mohammedan Sporting shot into the lead in the 37th minute through Nabi. Stung by the reversal, Churchill went all out. But the Mohammedan Sporting defence stood up to the challenge. Then, ten minutes from time, Odafa made it 2-0 on a counter attack. As Churchill went up in search of the equaliser, the Nigerian utilised the open space in the rival area and slotted home after dodging past Mascarenhas.  (PTI)  Copyright

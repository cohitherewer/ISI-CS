The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Good or bad, labels dont affect me 
 - I continue to learn and every opportunity teaches something. Bottomline is that Im keen to improve: Yuvraj Singh  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Yuvraj is a big fan of Andy Roddick and Ruud van Nistelrooy Lahore: Yuvraj Singh has been making a difference to Team Indias one-day performance. Now, hes looking to make an impact in Test cricket  provided opportunities keep coming his way. Of course, he made good use of the chance in Multan. Among the most popular of players, Yuvraj spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the second Test. The following are excerpts Q You realised a dream when picked for last Octobers Mohali Test. You played in Multan as well. Whats Test cricket like? A Its much tougher than the one-day game and, really, youve got to be up to it every single day... One may end up fielding for 150-200 overs, something very demanding. Personally, I was excited both in Mohali and Multan. Both times, though, you played only because Sourav Ganguly couldnt...  (Grins) But, what to do? Im glad I made full use of the opportunity in Multan, where I got my maiden fifty. Were you nervous in Mohali? No... The team was under pressure and, so, my approach had to be different. In Multan, we needed quick runs and I did my bit... That fifty made me feel I did belong to Test cricket. Are you confident of cementing your place in the XI? I know I wont be there once Sourav returns, but Ill be happy with whatever chances come my way. Its not for me to choose. I suppose you can improve on your bowling and press for a berth as a genuine allrounder... Im already working hard... For three years, you were labelled a ODI specialist. Did that upset you? It did, initially, but I realised I couldnt control the handing out of such labels... I realised that if Im consistent in the ODIs, Ill definitely get a Test call. Thats how it worked out. How do you look back on three-and-half years of international cricket? I was very young (18) when I started, in Nairobi, but after a good start I wasnt consistent and probably not too sure of my role in the XI... I wasnt mature... With time, Ive learnt quite a few things, particularly from seniors. Early on, it was felt you were pretty casual... When things dont go well, people are bound to say something. Ive never been laid back, though. Souravs support must have made a difference? It has and Im thankful... Its because of him that I made a comeback after being dropped (in 2001-2002). What have you learnt from Nairobi till Lahore? Look, I continue to learn and every opportunity teaches something. Bottomline is that Im keen to improve. Your teammates apart, have you grown to admire players from other teams? Some Australians  Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist... Also, to an extent, Inzamam-ul Haq. All are quality players. Whats the effort that goes into fielding? Quite a bit, because one run out may change a match ... Like Inzamams in Multan? Well, yes... I thought it would be close but, as it turned out, my throw was much quicker. Ironically, you were dubbed a poor fielder on your first-class debut (for Punjab)...  (Laughs) Absolutely... If anything, that stigma made me work harder. Youre still new to Test cricket, but how comfortable have you been moving from one form to the other? Test cricket is definitely more challenging... The biggest difference is having to concentrate for many more hours... Its quite an experience. What were your emotions when history was scripted in Multan? As a kid, I would be fascinated by talk of India versus Pakistan games... People used to be so passionate and that did rub off on me. But, at no time did I even dream I would be part of a record-creating Test team... Perhaps, one will remember Multan in an even more special manner as the years go by. How do you unwind? With plenty of music... Sleep a bit too. Youve played quite a few ODIs... Which innings gave you the most satisfaction? The 139 at the SCG this year (against Australia)... I dont think Ive ever batted better. Sadly, we lost that rain-affected match. Today, are you indebted to somebody more than the others? My parents (Shabnam and Yograj). I wasnt good at studies, but I wasnt discouraged from taking to cricket in a big way... A personal question  how did you take to your parents separation?  (After a pause) I was affected, I was hurt... Yet, some things in life cant be changed and, so, one moves on after accepting the reality. Are you in regular contact with your father? Yes... If I have a (cricket) problem, I give him a call... Often, weve worked together in Chandigarh. Who else do you seek out if theres a cricket-related worry? Sachin Tendulkar... Hes the best guide around and, thankfully, hes got much time for me. He keeps saying watch the ball carefully... Do you have heroes outside cricket? Im a big fan of Andy Roddick and Ruud van Nistelrooy... Among teams, I root for Manchester United. Finally, whats your reaction to being labelled a playboy? Im indifferent... Good or bad, labels dont affect me.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, July 21, 2004  Errol is the man to follow 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Trainer Errol Bhungard is the man to follow in Wednesdays seven-event race card. Errols Sea Legend is ideally placed at the handicap to land the 1,200m La Gitana Cup. The Warrshan-River Foyle son was unlucky to have missed a hattrick of wins last season.				 										Splendid Quest and Thoughtful are the other horses from Errols yard who may deliver the goods in their respective events  the 1,000m Freelancer Handicap and the 1,400m Aunty Pip Handicap. Splendid Quests winter performance is best ignored as the Libor-Palaiyta mare is known to do better over the monsoon course.				 										Thoughtful was trifle unlucky to have lost narrowly to Schumacher in her only winter start over a scurry. The Concordial-Research four-year-old is cut out for a mile or thereabouts and the slated trip is tailor-made for her.				 										Trainer Daniel Davids Grand Annual winner Regal Fortune may make a winning debut in the Woolver Valley Handicap. Sea Legend, Thoughtful and Regal Fortune, all three, will be ridden by the visiting jockey Imran Chisty.

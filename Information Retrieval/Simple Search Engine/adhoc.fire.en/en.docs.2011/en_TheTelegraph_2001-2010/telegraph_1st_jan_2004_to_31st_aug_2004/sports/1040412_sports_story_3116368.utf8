 Mickelson, DiMarco lead as Rose wilts 
 Phil Mickelson watches his drive on the second hole at the Augusta National Golf Club on Sunday. (Reuters) Augusta: Phil Mickelson put himself on track for a long-awaited Major breakthrough at the US Masters on Saturday after overnight pacesetter Justin Rose and Tiger Woods fell back in testing conditions at Augusta. Left-hander Mickelson fired a three-under-par 69 in the third round, tying fellow American Chris DiMarco for the lead at six-under 210. DiMarco carded a 68 in bright sunshine. Widely regarded as the best modern-day player yet to win a Major, Mickelson had a chance to snatch the outright lead at the par-four 17th. A par putt can give you much more momentum than a birdie putt, especially around here where you just try to make par so many times, the 33-year-old Mickelson told reporters. Heading into the final round, Im much more at ease than Ive been in the past when Ive been anxious, wondering how its going to go on the range, is the swing going to be there? I dont feel that anxiety. I havent felt it all year. Ive had some good final rounds in the past and fortunately Ive been able to learn from those and play pretty well on Sunday, added the Californian, who has never before led a Major after 54 holes.Mickelson, chasing his first Major title in his 47th start, set the tone by saving par at the first with a deft up-and-down from the left of the green and sinking a 25-foot birdie putt at the par-four third. Exuding confidence in front of hugely supportive crowds, he then sank short birdie putts on seven and eight before parring the final 10 holes. Britains Paul Casey returned a four-under 68 for third place at four-under 212, with European Ryder Cup captain and twice champion Bernhard Langer a further shot back in a tie for fourth after a 69. World No. 1 Woods struggled in the fast-running conditions, carding a three-over 75 after hauling his way back into contention with a second-round 69. Bidding for a third Masters title in four years, he dropped a shot at the first after finding a fairway bunker off the tee before hitting back with a birdie four at the 575-yard second. Britains Rose, who had preserved his two-shot cushion with a one-under-par 71 in Fridays second round, tumbled down the leaderboard with a nine-over 81. The 23-year-old Englishman made six bogeys in a front nine of 42 as Augustas slick greens were quickened by the blazing sun, and then dropped three more shots after the turn to finish at three-over 219.

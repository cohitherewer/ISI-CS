The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Phelps in eight events
	 - ATHENS OLYMPICS  Michael Phelps Long Beach (California): Michael Phelps will enter five individual events and three relays at the Athens Olympics in his quest to equal or surpass Mark Spitzs record haul of seven gold medals the 1972 Games in Munich. Phelps and his coach Bob Bowman told a news conference at the end of the US Olympic Trials on Wednesday that the teenager would contest the 200m metres freestyle, 100- and 200m butterfly and 200- and 400m individual medleys. He also plans to race in the 4x100m freestyle, 4x200m freestyle and 4x100m medley relays. Conspicuously missing was the 200m backstroke, an event in which Phelps is ranked No. 2 in the world and in which he placed second on Monday behind Aaron Peirsols world record-breaking performance. Weve decided to save the 200 for another opportunity somewhere down the road, Phelps said. Meanwhile, Jenny Thompson finally scored her first victory of the trials on Wednesday. Thompson won the 50m freestyle in 25.02 seconds. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Gilchrist, Symonds face inquiry
Colombo: Adam Gilchrist and Andrew Symonds will face a disciplinary inquiry on dissent charges following an umpires decision in the second one-day International against Sri Lanka in Dambulla on Sunday. The home team sealed a dramatic one-run victory to level the six-match series. ICC Match Referee Mike Procter said Gilchrist and Symonds have been summoned to attend an inquiry. The inquiry, initially scheduled late for Monday evening, has been postponed by a day. The duo was at the crease when umpire Peter Manuel ruled Symonds out leg-before. Both players questioned the decision and Manuel brought the batsman back after consulting with the second umpire. Procter said Gilchrist and Symonds face level I Code of Conduct charges for showing dissent by protesting against an umpires verdict. If found guilty, the pair could be fined up to 50 per cent of match fees with a warning. (AP)  Copyright

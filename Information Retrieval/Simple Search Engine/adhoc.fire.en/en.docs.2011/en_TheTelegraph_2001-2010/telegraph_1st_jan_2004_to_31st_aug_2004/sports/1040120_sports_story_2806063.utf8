The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East master North
 Devang Gandhi hit a fine 75 Paradip: Unbeaten half-centuries by skipper Devang Gandhi and Kiran Powar helped East Zone beat North Zone by eight wickets in a Deodhar Trophy match on Monday. Set to make 226 in 50 overs for victory, East blasted the rival attack to reach the target in 38 overs with Gandhi making 75 and Powar 79. The duo added 160 for the unfinished third wicket stand to help the hosts record their second straight win in the championship. Openers M.S. Dhoni and Nikhil Haldipur provided the perfect platform with a 67-run stand and the hosts had little trouble in negotiating the North bowlers. Gandhis 96-ball knock contained eight fours. Powar faced 84 balls and also hit eight fours. After North skipper Ajay Jadeja pulled out of the match due to illness, stand-in captain Dinesh Mongia promptly decided to bat. They never recovered from the early blows inflicted by Sanjib Sanyal (four for 48).  (PTI)  Copyright

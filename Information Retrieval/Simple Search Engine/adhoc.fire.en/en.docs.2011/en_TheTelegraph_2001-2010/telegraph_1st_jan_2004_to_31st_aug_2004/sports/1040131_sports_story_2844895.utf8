The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Even Hingis fails to halt tedium
 BY MARTIN JOHNSON  Schnyders lifestyle is more interesting than her tennis There is a widely held belief that womens tennis is now being recommended by doctors as a more natural alternative to Mogadon (an anti-depressant drug), but if we can just forget about the actual tennis (which is not difficult, believe me) it is far more entertaining than any Australian soap opera. Fathers from hell, weirdo coaches, obsessed fans  and thats before you get to the players biogs, where you can learn all about the girls favourite movies, whos got a pair of chihuahuas called Bertie and Algernon, and whether they like to chill out in front of the TV with a tray of moms home cooking. If this is not QED for the riveting nature of womens tennis its hard to know what is, and when it comes to interesting lifestyles, there is not a man on the circuit who can come close to matching one of the semi-finalists, the 25-year-old Patty Schnyder. At the age of 19, Patty teamed up with a middle-aged self-styled natural therapist, who instantly turned her into a vegan with an orange juice consumption of three litres per day. His claims that he could also cure aids and cancer sadly fell upon deaf ears, but Patty is not the sort of girl who dismisses such visionaries as cranks, and was soon having him treat her injuries with applications of hot oil and a rolling pin covered in needles. She then followed his advice to make him her boyfriend and sack all her trainers and coaches, which so perturbed her parents that they had him investigated by a private detective. This in turn led to her dispensing with the therapist and marrying (just as soon as hed completed a jail sentence for fraud) the private eye. Her parents declined to come to the marriage, possibly on the grounds that they didnt much fancy a wedding breakfast of boiled cabbage leaves and orange juice. Both womens semi-finals took place in the afternoon session, as the evening prime-time TV slot in this tournament is reserved for a proper game of tennis, in which important advertising revenue is not put at risk by a game liable to last no longer than an episode of Skippy The Bush Kangaroo. Namely, a game between two men. Theyve also found a way to make womens tennis even more boring, by hiring former women players to commentate on it. Martina Hingis ability to make Virginia Wade sound interesting is more impressive than anything she managed on court, and in a voice flatter than an Agassi forehand, she predicted a hard time for Clijsters on the grounds that when you play a left-hander, the bounce comes from the other direction. And when Clijsters made a mess of a smash, Martina made the prescient observation that you have to energise your own power. So when Clijsters went from 3-1 up to 3-5 down in the second set, we knew at once that the Belgian must have been going through one of those agonising periods when your power simply refuses to be energised. Schnyder, though, was unable to hold her service game for the set, and as she dunked one into the net, Hingis  as only a former Grand Slam winner can  provided the crucial insight into how this had happened. She went for the big ace there, Martina said, but netted.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

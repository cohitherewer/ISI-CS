The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004  Fallon punished for fixing 
				 	 Fallon				 										London (Reuters): Champion jockey Kieren Fallon was banned on Monday for 21 days for fixing a race, Sky News reported. Fallon, 39, was suspended over his riding in a race at Lingfield last Tuesday where he appeared to ease his mount and was caught in the last strides. A separate inquiry is to be held into the betting patterns surrounding the race.				 										It was reported in a Sunday newspaper that Fallon had told an undercover reporter that a horse he was riding would not win. Fallon was referred to the Jockey Club after losing a 10-length lead and being beaten by a short head in the race in question.				 										Ballinger Ridge, the 15-8 second favourite, looked to have the race at his mercy but Fallon seemed to take things easy with 200 metres left and he was caught on the winning post by Rye, the 8-11 favourite with Chris Catlin on board.				 										Officials at Lingfield had expressed concern about the betting on the race and instead of the local stewards banning Fallon for 21 days for the riding offence, the case was passed on to the Jockey Club in London for further consideration.				 										Fallon apologised for the ride, but Sundays News of the World, which devoted its first five pages to the jockey, said he told one of their investigators three hours before the Lingfield race: Im down as favourite but Rye, thatll win.				 										In the morning papers, Ballinger Ridge had been named as the likely favourite with Rye as second best.				 										Jockey Club spokesman John Maxse told Reuters: The News of the World have offered us their dossier and we will incorporate that into our ongoing investigation.				 										Before the race was off, we had alerted our officials at Lingfield that we were concerned about Ballinger Ridge, which was Kieren Fallons mount, due to some suspicious betting patterns on the race.				 										 Fallon is no stranger to controversy. A brilliant, forceful rider, the 39-year-old Irishman has won the British champion jockeys title six times but there have been some hiccups along the way.				 										His career rocketed from the mid-1990s when he quit the North of England circuit where he was a regular, landing the plum job of stable jockey to Henry Cecil at Newmarket. By then he had put behind him an incident in 1994 when he was banned for six months after the Jockey Club found him guilty of violent or improper conduct by pulling fellow-pilot Stuart Webster from a horse at the end of a race at Beverley in Yorkshire.				 										With Cecils powerful stable behind him, Fallon became champion jockey for the first time in 1997, riding over 200 winners during the year.				 										The duo teamed up to win the 1999 Epsom Derby on Oath but split soon afterwards when Cecils wife admitted having sex with a leading jockey. Fallon denied any involvement. The previous year Fallon had been awarded 70,000 in libel damages at the end of a high-profile 18-day hearing in the High Court in London over a newspaper allegation of non-trying on a horse called Top Cees which later went on to win the Chester Cup.

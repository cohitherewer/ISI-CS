The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pontings race against time
 Ricky Ponting walks back to the pavilion after straining his back on Wednesday. (AP) Kandy: Aussies are expecting skipper Ricky Ponting to make a quick recovery for the third day of the second Test versus Sri Lanka after a back sprain. Ponting caught his spikes on a sponsors mat while fielding and left the field during the morning session after complaining of breathlessness and severe pain. It is a lot better now after quite a lot of treatment and we expect him to bat tomorrow, Australias physiotherapist Alex Kontouri told reporters. We have been treating him every half an hour to keep his back moving and make sure it does not stiffen up. We will do the same in the night, give him some anti-inflammatories and start treatment early tomorrow. The plan is for him to bat next but the key test for him will be how he wakes up tomorrow. Century-maker Gilchrist (going strong, unbeaten on 140) said: (It is) really pleasing to make an impact in this series and to make some Test runs as I have been a bit dry this summer, Gilchrist told reporters. Nice to get in and get past that initial 10 balls or 10 minutes and give myself the best chance of batting. It felt much clearer in my head today and I looked to play as straight as possible. When we came off Ricky (Ponting) asked me what I thought about everyone moving up one and I agreed to that initially but then I thought that I should do it to lessen the disruption to that middle order, he said. I went back to Punter and he said that Buc (coach John Buchanan) had also mentioned that and we agreed to do that. Gilchrist believes the pitch has improved after starting moist on day one when 17 wickets tumbled. It played pretty well today. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Pakistans killer punch out of nowhere
- Dravids bold decision didnt pay off as Indians were nervous; Sachin putting himself under pressure
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasrJust when everyone thought the Indians were running away with the show, the Pakistanis came back with the killer punch.If India did them in on the morning of the fifth day in Multan, Pakistan took revenge by finishing it off early afternoon on the fourth day in Lahore.Its a tit-for-tat response that everyone loves, and this is exactly what makes Pakistan-India ties so different from what other games have to offer. With honours shared and one to go, it promises to be really enticing.I am sure Pakistans performance in the second Test had much to do with the criticism that had been unleashed by the media and the resentment among the public, which refused to come to the stadium after the home sides dismal performance in the last fifteen or so days.I am glad that the team and the team management took it positively and used it as a source of energy.For the Indians, things went awry from the very start.What was considered a bold decision by Dravid to bat first, didnt pay off. But, mind you, it didnt pay off because the Indian top order showed signs of nerves, and not because it was a bad decision.The way Yuvraj Singh batted confidently, fluently and majestically left no one in doubt that the captains decision was right. The demons were more in the minds of the Indian batsmen than in the track.That the captain was also part of that batting failure didnt help his cause, but that is beside the point. The determined innings Sachin Tendulkar played in Multan and his two failures in Lahore suggest that he is putting unnecessary pressure on himself.His body language and facial expressions while he is at the crease add to this perception. He seems to be a bit too focussed on the outcome to think about playing his natural game, which is lot more attractive for the spectators and rewarding for the team.I think it will be a good idea for the team management to encourage Tendulkar to be his natural self while batting.This has the potential to simply demoralise any side in the world, and Pakistan is no exception.On the field, it was Dravids run-out in the second innings that had a great influence on the final outcome of the match, just as Inzamams run-out had a clear bearing on the result in Multan.There were a lot of similarities, almost eerie resemblance, in the two incidents. Pakistanis rarely connect in the field, but this one by Imran Farhat was as good as they come.There were at least two occasions when I thought Pakistan lacked intensity in their approach. First, when they failed to finish off the Indian first innings and second, when they failed to build their own innings on the morning of the third day.On both occasions, they allowed India to claw their way back in the match, but were able to recover in time. If Umar Gul was the surprise package in terms of bowling, Asim Kamal, I am sure, would not have surprised the Indians any less when it came to batting.And, finally, a quick word on Shoaib Akhtar, who at last made a difference with his presence. On the last day, he very much looked the part, giving rise to hopes that he may live up to his pre-tour billing in the deciding third Test.Lets see. Copyright

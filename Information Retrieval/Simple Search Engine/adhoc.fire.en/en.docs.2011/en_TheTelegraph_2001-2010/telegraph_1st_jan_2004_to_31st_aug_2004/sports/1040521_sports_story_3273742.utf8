 Lanka PM meets Indian envoy 
Colombo: Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse Thursday held closed-door talks with Indian ambassador, Nirupam Sen, seeking support for suing the ICC over its decision to ban Muttiah Muralidharans doosra. The Prime Minister received Sen at his official Temple Trees residence for the talks, officials said. Details of the talks were not disclosed, but Rajapakse said on Wednesday that he was seeking surpport from the other three Test playing nations in South Asia  Bangladesh, India and Pakistan  over the issue. The Sri Lankan premier mounted a campaign to defend the star off-spinner after he was reported for suspect bowling action by ICC Match Referee Chris Broad during the home series against Australia last month. Rajapakse snubbed ICC president Ehsan Mani who advised politicians to stay out of the Muralidharan row and allow the ICC to deal with the situation. Australian premier John Howard added spice to he debate on illegal bowling action last week when he said Muralidharan was a chucker, prompting the world record-smashing spinner to consider boycotting Sri Lankas tour of Australia in July. Rajapakse said Muralidharan, the most successful bowler in Test history, was a national asset and he would do everything within his power and that of the government to defend the bowler.

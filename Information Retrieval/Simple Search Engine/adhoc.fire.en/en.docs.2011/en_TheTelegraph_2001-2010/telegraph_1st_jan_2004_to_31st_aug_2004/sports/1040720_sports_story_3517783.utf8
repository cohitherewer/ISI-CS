 Indian girls storm into quarters
New Delhi: Indian girls registered convincing victories over Hong Kong and Iran to storm into the quarter finals, while the boys stayed on course for a last-eight berth in the Asian junior table tennis championship on Monday. The girls, who had to beat Hong Kong if they were to avoid meeting South Korea in the quarter finals, won the group A encounter 3-0. The team comprising Madhurika Patkar, J. Swarna and Moushmi Paul then beat Iran by the same margin before losing to Chinese Taipei and finished second in the group. In the boys section, India got a bye against Yemen and then thrashed Iran 3-0. They are almost assured of a quarter final berth but will have to at least win one of the remaining matches against Kuwait and China to avoid defending champions Chinese Taipei in the last-eight stage. Both Indian teams had finished fifth in the last edition of the event and are hoping to at least maintain that same position. Shubhadip Das overcame Irans Media Nasab 11-6, 11-3 ,11-5 while R. Abhishek defeated Mohsin Khation 11-7, 11-2, 11-6. Hamed Naderi, however, gave Arunava Ganguly a tough time before losing 11-5, 6-11, 11-6, 7-11, 9-11.  (PTI)  Copyright

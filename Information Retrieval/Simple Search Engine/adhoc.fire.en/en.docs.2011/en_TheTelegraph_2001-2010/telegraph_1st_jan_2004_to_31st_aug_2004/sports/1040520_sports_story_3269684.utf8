The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kelli banned for two years
New York: American sprinter Kelli White has been stripped of her 100 and 200 m gold medals from the 2003 World Championships after accepting a two-year suspension for taking banned drugs. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said Wednesday that White, 27, had admitted taking the drugs and accepted the minimum ban for her first offence. The suspension started from Monday and means she will miss Augusts Olympic Games. Ms White has made mistakes but I admire her courage in acknowledging these mistakes and accepting responsibility for them, said Terry Madden, USADA chief executive. White tested positive for a stimulant, modafinil, at the world championships in Paris in August.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

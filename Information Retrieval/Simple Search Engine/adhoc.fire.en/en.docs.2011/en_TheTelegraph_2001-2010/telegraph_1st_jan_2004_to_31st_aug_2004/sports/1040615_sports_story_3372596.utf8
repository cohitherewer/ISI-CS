The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Schumi authors another record
 - German superstar the first to win same race seven times  Michael Schumacher after his win in Montreal on Sunday Montreal: Ferraris Michael Schumacher won the Canadian Grand Prix to write yet another page in the Formula One record book on Sunday as the first driver to win the same race seven times (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). While the world champion punched back from his lowest starting position of the year to win for the seventh time in eight races, Ferrari were handed a one-two when Ralf Schumachers Williams was disqualified. Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, Schumachers Ferrari teammate, moved up to second place with Briton Jenson Button inheriting third for BAR. It was the Germans 77th career victory and third in-a-row at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit. Both Williams and Toyota failed a post-race technical inspection for using oversized brake ducts on their cars. Buttons podium was his sixth of the year and consolidated his third place in the championship. But he had left the circuit by the time the results were declared official hours after the race had ended. Schumacher leads the 18 race championship with 70 points to Barrichellos 54. Briton Jenson Button has 44. Ferrari have 124 points to Renaults 61. The race was no thriller, dictated by pitstop strategy, but Schumacher hailed it as a fabulous achievement nonetheless. It all worked out to plan, he said. You enjoy any race you win. I have no special reason why I have won so often here  I probably just had a good package and a bit of luck. STANDINGS Drivers 1.

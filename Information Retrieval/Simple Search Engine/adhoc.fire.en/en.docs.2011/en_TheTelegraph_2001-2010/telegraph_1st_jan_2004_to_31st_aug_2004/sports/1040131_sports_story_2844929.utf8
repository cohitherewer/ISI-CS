 EB deny IFA claim
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  BhowmickCalcutta: The IFA might have handed East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick a harsh penalty, but the club will stand by his side, thats for sure. That too at a time, when IFA maintains, everything has been done keeping the club in full knowledge of the action. We never knew our coach was going to be treated like this. If we had any prior knowledge, we would surely have acted accordingly, East Bengal president Pronab Dasgupta said on Friday. On Thursday, IFA slapped a two-year ban on Bhowmick, barring him from club coaching. The ban, however, allows him to coach in the NFL and other international matches. While he will be barred from occupying the inside fencing during the IFA-organised matches, the same is not applicable to the teams away ties. Bhowmick has done a fairly good job and were going to stand by him, Dasgupta said. Dasgupta, along with the club secretary, will sit with Bhowmick in a couple of days time in this regard. Dasgupta also made it clear that the IFA ban had come at a very wrong time, especially when the boys were preparing for the AFC Cup. This wont do any good to the morale of the team. Weve to act fast and do something, he added. Bhowmick, however, didnt comment anything saying it would be taken up by his lawyers once IFAs letter reached him. The IFA informed the letter will be despatched by February 4. Meanwhile, the players were unanimous in describing the punishment as harsh and unprecedented. As captain Suley Musah put it: This (the punishment) is certainly not going to affect us in the AFC meet. The coach has also told us to concentrate on this tournament.  Copyright

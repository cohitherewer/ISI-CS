 Winning start for Humpy
 Humpy Elista (Kalmykia), May 22 (PTI): GM Koneru Humpy launched her campaign on a winning note against the unheralded Cecile van der Merwe of South Africa in the first round of the womens world chess championship that began on Saturday. WGM S. Meenakshi was in good form too as she held the higher-rated IM Iweta Radziewicz of Poland with black pieces. D. Harika, the other Indian in the fray, went down fighting against IM Viktorija Cmilyte of Lithuania. The top guns generally had a smooth day in the opening round and there were not many surprises except a few draws that have become customary, especially for the favourites who play black in the first game of these two-game mini-matches. Humpy, surprisingly, had to struggle in her first outing that certainly gave her jitters for the rounds to come. I was better in the middle-game but ended up misplaying it for a completely equal position. Later, just to imbalance the position, I had to concede two rooks for the queen and she (Cecile) somehow fell for the bait in the final stages, said Humpy about her game. She employed the Sicilian Defence and had little to worry about with her black pieces as Cecile gave her a level playing field despite having the advantage of white pieces. The Indian, however, used every trick in her armour to create some chances for herself. Eventually Cecile blundered a rook to find herself on the receiving end. On the other board, Meenakshi played a fine game to hold Radziewicz, who played the white side of a rather unorthodox Grunfeld Defence after the former gave her an easy opening. The middle-game surfaced with Meenakshi having enough resources to counter whites initiative and Radziewicz was at her wits end in trying to work out a concrete advantage for herself. Slowly but surely, Meenakshi got herself rolling on the queenside in the endgame and once the rook ending surfaced the Indian was in a copybook position. The draw was agreed to after 68 hard-fought moves. Harika had to suffer because of her narrow opening repertoire that was soon taken to task by Cmilyte who played the white side of a Kings Indian Defence. Opting for the classical set-up, Cmilyte got a tangible advantage in the bayonet attack and tightened the noose. She wrapped one pawn to coast home.  Copyright

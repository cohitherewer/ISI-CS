 Hussey to replace Bevan, Katich for Ponting
Sydney: Opener Michael Hussey will replace the injured Michael Bevan while Simon Katich has been included in place of skipper Ricky Ponting in the Australian squad for their tri-series match against India in Perth on Sunday. The national selection panel has chosen Hussey, who has captained Australia A but is yet to represent Australia, to join the national squad ahead of its match against India in Perth on Sunday, Cricket Australia announced Friday. Bevan will miss the Perth match and also the best-of-three finals because of a fractured rib while the Australian skipper has been rested for the last league match in keeping with Cricket Australias rotation policy. Commenting on Husseys selection, chairman Trevor Hohns said: Hussey has been knocking on the selection door for some time and we believe he deserved this opportunity. His form this summer has been excellent and it is clear that it has played a big part in his selection. We will sit down and review the squad following the match in Perth as the side moves into the finals series. Lefthander Hussey, who plays for Western Australia, has scored 326 runs from five innings in the inter-state one-day meet this summer at an average of 81.50, including a hundred against New South Wales.

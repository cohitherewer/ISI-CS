 Amnesty to put China under scanner 
London: With the Olympics in Athens drawing to a close, Amnesty International pledged to put the focus on what it termed Chinas appalling human rights record ahead of the 2008 Games in Beijing. Amnesty International welcomes the intense spotlight that will be focused on China in the four years until 2008, the London-based rights group said in a statement. Severe abuses of fundamental human rights are a daily occurrence in China. If this spotlight can curtail or even end these abuses, then the Olympic charter, with its commitment for the preservation of human dignity might be relevant in China by 2008. When the Chinese capital was awarded the Games in 2001, the International Olympic Committee said it hoped the advent of the Olympics would help improve the countrys human rights situation. However progress had been negligible, Amnesty said. So far at least, little has been delivered to support these confident assertions, the statement argued.  (AFP)  Copyright

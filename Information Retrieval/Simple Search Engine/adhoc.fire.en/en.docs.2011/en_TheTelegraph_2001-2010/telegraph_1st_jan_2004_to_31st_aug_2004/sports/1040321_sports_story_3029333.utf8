The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Yasir can become our Sachin 
 - Laxman should not play one-dayers - Sourav needs to fire now  BY RASHID LATIF  My choice for the MoM award in the Peshawar ODI would have been Abdul Razzaq Most feel Pakistan are looking more positive than India at this stage. The reason is obvious  as we play more and more against India, the players have lesser pressure. That is why we do badly against India in the World Cup, because we only seem to remember our defeats to them in the games showpiece tournaments. These are negative strains. As the matches become regular, Pakistan tend to dominate as it happens in Sharjah. Pakistan are a lambi race ka ghoda in the context of the two teams. What Pakistan did in the Peshawar one-dayer was to expose the Indian batting. I do not think Laxman should be playing one-day game. Instead, they should have played an extra bowler. They need to rearrange their batting line-up. Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif need to come up the order. Kaif is not the sort of batsman who can slog bowlers in the end overs. His technique is good and he needs to bat in the first 15 overs. India now have good sloggers in Ramesh Powar, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan down the order. They can bring more organised batsmen up the order. Most of us must have been surprised to see Shoaib Akhtar taken off the attack when Sourav Ganguly walked into the middle. It is because Shoaib gets exhausted after four overs. Some were also shocked to see him coming around the wicket to Balaji. But his intention was not to hurt the tail-ender. It was to cut down on the angle so that his edges did not run down to third-man for fours. 			Indeed, Shoaib and others should have done the same to Ganguly. He should not have been afforded that room on the off-stump, the fast bowlers should have come round the wicket to him. The Indians ran into Shabbir Ahmed in this game and it was only expected. Indians struggle on wickets which have bounce and Shabbir, with his height and high arm action, was able to get good lift from the pitch. Indians are very good when the ball is swinging or wickets are flat  but when it bounces, it is a different tale. Indians were able to put up a good total on the board finally. But Yasir Hameed put them on the backfoot with his sparkling play. I do not think any batsman on either side can hit cover drives with so much of elan as Yasir does. If Zaheer Abbas was Asian Bradman, Yasir has it in him to be Pakistans Tendulkar. But Indians did not bowl him the right line. They also needed an extra fielder on the off-side to curb him. I was also surprised to see Indians take off slip fielders when Malik was dismissed. Yasir straightaway was relieved to see a ball fly through the vacant slips. Ganguly really needs to fire for his team now. As the wickets kept falling and fast bowlers looked menacing, he kept pushing himself down the order. You do not send right message to your team with this attitude. It would affect the team. Captaincy is all about leading from the front. At present the Indians look down whereas Pakistan appear like a hound which has tasted blood. The umpiring was a bit dodgy in this game. Powar and Inzamam-ul Haq could feel done in by poor judgement of the umpires. My MoM is Abdul Razzaq. This man proves his worth with the bat or ball in every second or third match he plays. His runs were critical and when Indians were batting, he got Ganguly out when the Indian captain looked set for a century. (PTI)  Copyright

Jakarta: Another Indonesian boxer has died after a fight, the state Antara news agency reported today. Jack Ryan died in hospital early on Thursday, four days after a bout. He is the eleventh Indonesian boxer to die of injuries sustained in a fight since 1990. Ryan was taken to hospital on Sunday after he vomited following an eight-round lightweight bout at Purwokerto in central Java province, Antara said.				 																																	Last month another Indonesian boxer, Antonius Moses, died in hospital six days after he was knocked out in a junior flyweight bout with a Thai boxer.				 																																	Brussels: Belgian world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne has withdrawn from the Antwerp Diamond Games due to a respiratory problem, organisers said on Thursday.				 																																	She is not playing, I just learned it from the WTA, tournament organiser Bob Verbeeck said.				 																																	Henin-Hardenne had been due to play her opening match against Czech Denisa Chladkova in the second round on Thursday after being given a late start to help her recover from a throat infection. Defending champion Venus Williams, the third seed, pulled out of the event at the weekend with a knee injury. Henins withdrawal leaves her second-seeded compatriot Kim Clijsters as the favourite. 				 																																	Moscow: Natalya Nazarova came within nine hundredths of a second of breaking a 22-year-old world indoor record, clocking 49.68 in the 400m at the Russian national meet on Wednesday.				 																																	Nazarova, the reigning 400m indoor champion, just missed the mark of 49.59 set by the great Czech runner Jarmila Kratochvilova in 1982. Nazarova set a world indoor best over the seldom-run 500m last month.				 																																	Berlin: German Formula One star Ralf Schumacher claims he is ready to burn rubber in 2004 and put aside his respect for sibling and six-time world champion Michael Schumacher, in a bid to win a first Formula One championship.				 																																	Despite being one of the leading drivers in formula one, Ralf Schumacher, 28, has been forced into the gigantic shadow cast by his elder brother Michael.				 																																	However, Ralf vowed to emerge from the darkness and write his own chapter in Formula One history when the season starts in Melbourne on March 7. Enough with the jokes, I am not going to brake for Michael any more, Ralf told the German daily Bild. I am not going to take my foot off the pedal for my brother.Madrid: The Kings Cup final between Real Madrid and Real Zaragoza will be held at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium in Barcelona on March 17, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) said on Wednesday.Sport on Screen Cricket, SA in NZ: Third ODI, live from 6.27 am on STAR Sports Basketball, NBA: Philadelphia 76ers vs LA Lakers, live from 9.00 am on ESPN

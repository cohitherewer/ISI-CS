 Mohun Bagan face the Salgaocar test 
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Rennedy, Maria doubtful starters  Barreto still holds the key Margao: Having lost the last three matches, Salgaocar would look to start the new year on a winning note when they take on Mohun Bagan Friday in the eighth National Football League (NFL) at Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, Margao. After doing well against East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting, the Goan team faltered as it lost three successive matches against Vasco Sports Club, JCT Mills and Mahindra United. Salgaocar, on eighth place with seven points, have been hamstrung by playmaker Tomba Singhs injury and will have to raise the level of their game to match Mohun Bagan who are playing well and are placed third with 11 points from six matches. The Goan team will have the full support of its fans, expected to turn out in large numbers to witness what promises to be an enthralling match. The return of Dharamjit Singh after a one-match suspension will bolster their attack. However, for now, poor finishing continues to be the bane of Salgaocar as coach Savio Madeira will hope for a much better showing from his boys. His counterpart Aloke Mukherjee has his own set of worries as apart from Manitombi Singh, who will miss the key clash owing to double booking, both Rennedy Singh and Sanjeev Maria are doubtful starters due to injuries. With Ashim Biswas, Eduardo Ribeiro and Jose Ramirez Barreto, Bagans attack looks sharp, but it has to be seen whether their jittery defence can withstand the pressure if Salgaocar midfield plays well and mounts the sharp attacks. For Salgaocar, Barreto remains the danger man as he is not only an incisive scorer, but can create chances for other players as well.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Hand of Koji
 Nakatas controversial goal on Saturday Beijing: It may not reverberate around the world in quite the same way as Diego Maradonas Hand of God, but Koji Nakata effectively won the Asian Cup for Japan  and broke Chinese hearts  with a clear handball. Japan beat hosts China 3-1 in Beijing on Saturday. Nakata scooped a Shunsuke Nakamura corner over the line in the 65th minute to give Japan the lead for the second time after the teams had started the second half level at 1-1. Replays showed the midfielder had used his right hand to force the ball over the line, infuriating the Chinese players, coaching staff and a raucous crowd of 65,000. The Hand of Koji could fuel as much heartache in China as Maradonas infamous goal at the 1986 World Cup has in England. China coach Arie Haan claimed that all three Japanese goals were questionable.

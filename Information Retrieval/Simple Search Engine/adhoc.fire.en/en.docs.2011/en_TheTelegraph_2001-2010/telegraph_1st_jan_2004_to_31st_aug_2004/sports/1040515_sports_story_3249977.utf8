 Complacency biggest worry for us: Sarwan 
Kingstown: The West Indies captain Ramnaresh Sarwan said Bangladesh are an improved team and should not be taken lightly as the two prepare for a three-match ODI starting on Saturday. They keep improving, Sarwan said at the series launch in St. Vincent on Thursday. Im sure they are not going to be any pushover. The biggest concern would be getting complacent against Bangladesh. Its something that we dont want to happen throughout this series, Sarwan said. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore is realistic as he looks forward to his teams first international tour of the West Indies. He added that he wanted his team to be given credit should they upset the odds, citing improvements, including Bangladeshs recent victory over Zimbabwe.  (AP)  Copyright

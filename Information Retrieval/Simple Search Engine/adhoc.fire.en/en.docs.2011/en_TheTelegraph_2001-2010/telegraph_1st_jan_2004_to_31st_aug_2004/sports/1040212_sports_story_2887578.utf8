The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengal win to finish second
 - NATIONAL ONE DAY MEET 
 - Mumbai emerge champions with 13 points  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ranadeb Bose (6/35)  is congratulated by teammates after the fall of a Tamil  Nadu wicket at JU campus ground, Salt Lake, on Wednesday.  Pictures by Santosh Ghosh  Subhomoy (84) held  the innings together Calcutta: It turned out to be a tale of comeback of sorts for two Bengal cricketers  Subhomoy Das and Ranadeb Bose  at the Jadavpur University Campus ground on Wednesday. While Subhomoy was dropped after an indifferent run in the Ranji Trophy, Ranadeb had faded under the glowing performance of Shib Shankar Paul this season. The former struck a solid 84 off 81 balls while the latter returned figures of six for 35 as Bengal snatched a 20-run win over Tamil Nadu in their final National one-day meet match. The visitors fell for 260 after evoking hopes off pulling off a thrilling victory. The result left Bengal placed second after failing to gain the bonus point. Mumbai emerged champions with 13 points. Both Bengal and Delhi finished on 12 but the hosts nosed ahead on the head-to-head count. The loss against Mumbai made all the difference. We had everything going in our favour but still lost it. It will haunt us for sometime, captain Devang Gandhi was left to lament in the end. The Bengal skipper was all praise for the youngsters in his side. The youngsters did well Arindam performed consistently, Ranadeb made good use of the limited opportunity, Manoj Tewari was the find of the tournament, Anirban (Chatterjee) also bowled well in Deodhar and here, he explained. It was this young brigade that came to the fore once Bengal were put into bat. Deep Dasgupta left early but Arindam and Devang took control. Arindams 63 off 84 balls was built around some superb strokes on both sides of the wicket but it was Subhomoys innings that propelled Bengal to 280. A bad patch had sidelined the righthander for sometime and he seemed determined to make full use of the opportunity. Subhomoy was not taking any undue risk, just making full use of the wayward Tamil Nadu bowling. His driving was fluent and the nine boundaries included some delectable shots behind square leg. As Subhomoy held the innings together, Tewari provided the right support with 68 off 56 balls. The youngster, who has been drafted into the senior side from the under-19 level, showed promise of developing into a good allrounder. His clean hitting gave the team the momentum needed in the slog overs and included six boundaries and two sixes. The last two overs of the innings yielded 31 runs, Tewari doing the bulk of the scoring. Tamil Nadu were down in the pits from the outset as Ranadeb laid them low with three wickets in consecutive overs. The medium pacer who has played just three Ranji games this time bowled a steady line and constantly troubled the batsmen with his pace and movement of the pitch. The 24-year-old returned again to dismiss three more batsmen and demolish the visitors hopes after a 67-run seventh wicket stand between S. Ganesh Kumar (64 off 50 balls, 3x4, 3x6) and R. Ram Kumar (39 off 29 balls, 4x4, 1x6) had threatened to take the match away. Bengal needed to restrict Tamil Nadu within 224 to earn the bonus point but the pair dashed all such hopes. Ganesh Kumar, who has played for Assam and East Zone, played a scintillating knock, hitting the spinners to all corners of the ground. Southpaw Ram Kumar also joined in the party and Bengal were struggling at one stage until Ranadeb removed both. It meant curtains for Tamil Nadus chances.  Copyright

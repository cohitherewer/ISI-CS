The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak crush India by 66 runs
 - Tri-series opener - Malik named Man-of-the-Match in rain-truncated tie  Shoaib Malik after reaching his 50 against India at the VRA Cricket Club in Amstelveen on Saturday. (AFP) Amsterdam: Pakistan gave a rollicking start to tri-nation cricket series after powering their way to a challenging 192 for six in a truncated 33-over-a-side match against India here on Saturday. Middle order batsman Shoaib Malik struck 68 off 67 balls and shared a hurricane 64-run partnership for the fourth wicket with vice-captain Yousuf Youhana as Pakistan made the most the batsmen friendly conditions at the VRA ground. Abdur Razzaq and Moin Khan provided the late charge with a whirlwind 56-run stand for the unbroken seventh wicket that lifted the team from 136 for six in the 27th over to the final score. Razzaqs unbeaten 35 came from 27 balls and contained two sixes and a four while Moin Khan needed only 20 balls for his 27 not out. The last two overs cost India 32 runs including an Ajit Agarkar over that went for 20. Laksmipathy Balaji was the pick of the bowlers with three for 27 from seven overs. Irfan Pathan was taken to the cleaners by the belligerent Pakistanis as he returned none for 57 from seven overs. A four-hour delayed start, due to rains overnight and in the morning, meant the series opener was reduced to 36 overs a side. A 20-minute interruption by another spell of sharp shower midway through the Pakistani innings resulted in another three overs deducted. Indian captain Sourav Ganguly won the toss and opted to bowl first, hoping to exploit the moisture in the track. But with a slow-paced low-bouncing track and boundaries measuring 57-yards, the VRA ground at the picturesque suburb of Amstelveen was a perfect belter. Shahid Afridi (19) set the tempo by hoisting Pathan over long-on in the very first over. He then slammed two boundaries off Ajit Agarkar but the Mumbaikar had the last laugh as the cavalier batsman fell in the same over, top edging a full length delivery for a well judged catch to Mohammad Kaif at cover. Yasir Hameed did not stay long but Malik and Youhana put the bowling to the sword with their effortless strokemaking. Youhana, who made a run-a-ball 28, was unlucky as his bat got stuck in a wet patch and was caught just short of the crease by a Virender Sehwag direct hit from long on.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indo-Pak opener on August 21
Karachi: Pakistan and India will play the opening match in the tri-series which will bring big-time cricket to The Netherlands on August 21, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced Wednesday. Australia will also play in the tournament. The Netherlands Amstelveen stadium hosted one match in the 1999 World Cup. Australia will take on India on August 23 and two days later square off with Pakistan. The final will be played on August 28. India won an exciting five-match one-day series 3-2 and grabbed the three-match Test series 2-1, their first ever wins in both forms of the game in Pakistan. The traditional rivals are also due to lock horns in the six-nation Asia Cup in Sri Lanka next month and will play before an already sell out crowd at Edgbaston, England when they meet in the 12-nation ICC Champions Trophy on September 19 this year. Pakistan is due to tour India to play three Tests and five one-day matches early next year. THE SCHEDULE Aug. 21: India vs Pakistan Aug. 23: Australia vs India Aug. 25: Australia vs Pakistan Aug. 28: FINALNot this year The BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya has ruled out the possibility of a one-day series against Pakistan later this year, saying there was no time to squeeze in new fixtures, adds a report from Dubai. We are hard pressed to keep our own commitments, Dalmiya said, putting to rest speculations in a Pakistani daily that the PCB is keen on an ODI series against India this year.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

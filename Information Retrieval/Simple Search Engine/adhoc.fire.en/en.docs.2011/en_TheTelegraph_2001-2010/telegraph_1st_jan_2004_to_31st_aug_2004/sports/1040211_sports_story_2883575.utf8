The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Defeat in finals still rankles 
 - Sourav Ganguly pleased with performance of youngsters Down Under  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly  is still trying to come to terms with the defeat in the  final of the tri-series Down Under. He is searching for  clues that might lead him to the reasons behind the disaster  at the final hurdle after a highly satisfying series Down  Under. We were outplayed in the final, he admitted after landing in the city on Tuesday mor- ning. The Indian skipper did not agree that it was the effect of the long and arduous tour that had taken its toll on the players. We always knew it was going to be a long tour and were aware about the physical and mental demands. Its just that we are not being able to play well in the finals. I dont know the reason why this is happening, he explained. The loss was Indias third in a row to the world champions after losing the finals in the World Cup and the tri-series in India last year. Sourav also did not agree that the loss to Australia on a bouncy Perth wicket in the league engagement had demoralised the team.  It was not that the Aussies enjoyed any psychological advantage. We just failed to get our act together Despite the defeats in the one-dayers, Sourav termed the Test series which ended 1-1 as Indias best ever. This is the best-ever tour by an Indian team to Australia. I havent seen any team dominate the way we did in the Test series. Asked if injuries to his main bowlers had cost them dearly, he said: The injuries did affect our chances somewhat in the ODIs. We still did put in our best efforts. But we have to admit that they are a superior one-day outfit. The success of the youngsters also left the skipper satisfied. As far as youngsters are concerned its been an outstanding series. Irfan (Pathan) and (Laxmipathy) Balaji both bowled well. But their inexperience came to the fore when they gave away too many runs in the finals, Sourav said, hoping they will get wiser by the experience.  Copyright

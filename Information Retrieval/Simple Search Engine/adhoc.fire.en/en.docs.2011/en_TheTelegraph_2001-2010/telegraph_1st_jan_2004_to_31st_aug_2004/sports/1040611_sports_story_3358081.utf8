				 																																	New Delhi: World amateur snooker champion Pankaj Advani and national champion Alok Kumar moved into the semi-finals of the Asian snooker championship at Aqaba, Jordan. Yasin Merchant, however, bit the dust.				 																																	Advani rallied twice to beat Keith Boon of Singapore 5-3 while Alok Kumar beat Alex Puan Yi-Wei of Singapore 5-2.				 																																	But former champion Merchant could not find his rhythm and went down to Habib Mahmood of Bahrain 2-5 in the quarter finals, according to information received here.				 																																	The 19-year-old advani made a nervous start losing the closely fought first frame and the players were on par till the fourth before the indian raced away to a 4-2 lead.				 																																	London: Bolton Wanderers have finally given up their audacious chase to bring Brazils Rivaldo to the premier league.				 																																	I think that as far as we are concerned the Rivaldo situation is finished, chairman Phil Gartside told Boltons website on Thursday, adding it was clear the player was pursuing the money aspect while seeking a new club. Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who has proved a master at tempting notable internationals to the unfashionable north west of England club, held talks with Rivaldo in April before the clubless 2002 World Cup winner returned home to mull over a move. Rivaldo has been linked with a move to Scottish champions Celtic as well as clubs in the Middle East.				 																																	He indicated by talking to people in Qatar that hes looking at the money rather than the pure football aspect, Gartside added. At that stage our interest dropped.				 																																	London: World marathon record-holder Paula Radcliffe of Britain intends to make her first appearance on the track for two years at the European Cup final in Poland.				 																																	A hernia operation has kept Radcliffe out of recent competition but she is in high-altitude training in the French Pyrenees in preparation for a sixth appearance in the Cup, which takes place from June 19-20.				 																																	With the Athens Olympics just nine weeks away, Radcliffes injury has caused her no problems during a hard few weeks training and the news from her coaching camp is that she is feeling good.				 																																	Halle: Three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten will miss this years Wimbledon Championships because of an injury to his right hip, the Brazilian said on Thursday.				 																																	Kuerten, who has never been past the quarter finals at the All England Club event, which begins June 21, said he wanted to be fit for the North American Masters Series at the end of July, the Athens Olympics and the US Open. 				 																																	My goal now is to fully recover and to be in great shape I need, at least, six weeks of intense work, Kuerten, 27, said in a statement.				 																																	I am motivated, playing tennis at a very high level and I know that (after) easing the pain, I will be among the best players again, he added.				 																																	London: Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has dismissed Tim Henmans chances in this years tournament on the day Britains No. 1 crashed out of the championships warm-up event at the Queens Club.				 																																	Becker said Henman would get as far as the semi-finals on the Wimbledon grass his preferred surface, only on his very, very best day.Hes not No. 1 in the world but he plays above his level when Wimbledon comes, Becker said. On his very, very best day, hes going to reach the semis.Sport on Screen Formula One: Inside Grand Prix: Canada from 10.30 am on TEN Sports Cricket: New Zealand vs England, third Test Day II live from 3 pm on STAR Sports Soccer: Euro 2004 lead up from 4.30 pm on ESPN

 SAs new strategy

(AP) Colombo: South Africa are set to unveil a new one-day strategy when they start their five-match series against Sri Lanka on Friday. The tourists are trying to regroup from the disappointment of their first-ever Test series defeat to Sri Lanka, following their 313-run loss in the second match last Sunday. Skipper Graeme Smith criticised his team afterwards for lacking hunger, commitment and passion, but South Africa coach Eric Simons believes the side will respond well. It is going to be a very tough series, but we had a long team meeting on Monday to discuss some hard truths and the squad has responded well, Simons said. We are going to make some changes from the strategy we have used in the past, he added. When you go off the boil you can get nervous about experimenting. Uncapped left-hander Jean-Paul Duminy is expected to play in the middle-order. Duminy won selection after a prolific first-class season. Andre Nel is likely to sit out the first game with Martin van Jaarsveld and Nicky Boje. Sri Lanka will be without Muttiah Muralidharan, who has been ruled out for five months following shoulder surgery. Sri Lanka are likely to stick with a similar line-up to the one that won the Asian Cup earlier this month. TEAMS South Africa (from): Graeme Smith (captain), Mark Boucher, Nicky Boje, Alan Dawson, Jean-Paul Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Jacques Rudolph, Lance Klusener, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Robin Peterson, Andre Nel, Martin van Jaarsveld. Sri Lanka (from): Maravan Atapattu (captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Saman Jayantha, Avishka Gunawardene, Farveez Maharoof, Chaminda Vaas, Upul Chandana, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Zoysa, Dilhara Fernando.

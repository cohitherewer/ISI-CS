 No praise too high for Otto
 - Milan Baros showed the benefit of freshness  BY GERARD HOULLIER  Otto Rehhagel is a German version of Bobby Robson To stay in charge of the Greek national team for three years is an achievement in itself. So no praise can be too high for what Otto Rehhagel has done for a country which, until it caused the first shock of the tournament by beating Portugal three weeks ago, had never won a match at this level. I know Otto and he is a German version of my friend Bobby Robson: enthusiastic, knowledgeable, a driving force behind his teams. He will be 66 next month but doesnt look his age. The game is Ottos passion and his record in Germany speaks for itself. Having won the Bundesliga twice with Werder Bremen, he went to Bayern Munich and was on the brink of the title when he fell out with Franz Beckenbauer and lost his job two days before the end of the season. Next he went to Kaiserslautern and won the title there. Now Otto has proved himself on the international stage. He has given the Greeks precisely what they needed. They were always technically good but lacked physical strength  mental, too, at times  and tactical discipline. That discipline has been fundamental to their success here. They have stifled their opponents game and prevented individuals from expressing themselves by man-marking strikers and offensive midfielders: the likes of Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry in the France match, then Jan Koller, Milan Baros and Karel Poborsky in the semi-final against the Czechs. It is an old-fashioned system, with Traianos Dellas acting as the libero or free player, but it works. Greece have been content to suck in the opposition and hit on the break because they have enough skill to counter-attack quickly. Whatever the outcome of the final, lets give Greece full credit for a marvellous contribution. When I hear people say their presence in the final is a sign of the tournaments weakness, I think how silly an argument that is. It is one of footballs eternal strengths, surely, that you get teams progressing farther than expected. The tournament has reached high standards of intensity, tempo and so on. As for outcomes of games, they can always be affected by marginal things such as  to take the Czechs case on Thursday  Tomas Rosicky hitting the crossbar and Koller and Baros missing chances. Karel Brueckner and his squad, which performed so well, will not require a reminder of the importance of the set-pieces after Dellas header from a corner put them out. Nor will Holland  for both of Portugals semi-final goals came from corners, the second a short one. Why does the dead ball seem to matter so much more these days? The delivery is better, for a start. The movement in the box is better, too, because before and during a tournament the coach has time to rehearse it. When contests are so tight, these are the things that decide the outcome. Set-pieces and individual brilliance. We havent been over-fed on individual brilliance here  usually 15 per cent of goals come this way  but midfields have been retreating very quickly, blocking space so it is very difficult to execute a one-two. Milan Baros has, nevertheless, scored some brilliant goals, showing the benefit of freshness after missing so much of the season with Liverpool. When someone told me Milan had been quoted as hoping he would have more chance with the new manager, I was surprised and wondered if he had forgotten he was in my team when he got injured! May be he was misquoted. Milan certainly didnt appear to have any hard feelings when I dropped in at the Czech training camp before their match against Germany  he came over and hugged me. And on Thursday his agent rang to keep in touch, saying how happy Milan was and thanking me for helping with his recovery and so on. Early in the season, he suffered a broken ankle against Blackburn. On returning in the spring he did well but, as is usual in these situations, dipped afterwards. By the time he was ready to go again, it was late in the season, the team was doing well and I preferred not to make changes. Next season, Milan will have to earn his place ahead of Michael Owen or Djibril Cisse and, on the basis of what we have seen in this championship, it could happen. But that is a matter for Rafael Benitez, not me. My responsibilities in Portugal have been towards the Uefa technical study group and, like a lot of people, I have become concerned about the tendency of countries such as Italy, Spain and France  who have players involved in top leagues and the Champions League making an early exit. We also saw it in the World Cup and may be we need to find a way of rekindling the freshness of these players. They insist it is mental, not physical, so the search is for new means of team-bonding.

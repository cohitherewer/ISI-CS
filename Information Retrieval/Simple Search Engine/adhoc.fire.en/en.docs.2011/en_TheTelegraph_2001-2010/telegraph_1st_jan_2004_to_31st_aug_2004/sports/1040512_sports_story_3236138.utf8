 Schumi bags top honour, again
 - Sorenstam World Sportswoman of Year, Wie best Newcomer  Luis Figo and wife Hellen arrive at Lisbons Belem Cultural Centre for the Laureus Awards on Monday. (Reuters) Lisbon: Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher was named Laureus World Sportsman of the Year for the second time on Monday. The German Ferrari driver won a record sixth world title last season and looks certain to make it seven in 2004 after claiming his fifth win in five races with a victory in Barcelona on Sunday. Swedish golfer Annika Sorenstam was named World Sportswoman of the Year, and Englands World Cup-winning rugby squad scooped the Team of the Year prize. Schumacher beat five-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, Wimbledon tennis champion Roger Federer, American swimmer Michael Phelps, world motorcycling champion Valentino Rossi and England rugby player Jonny Wilkinson to the award. Sorenstam won the 2003 British Open and the LPGA championship, helped Europe to victory in the Solheim Cup and became the first woman to play in a mens US PGA tour event for over 58 years. The other nominees for the womens award were tennis players Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium and Americas Serena Williams, athletes Maria Mutola of Mozambique and Briton Paula Radcliffe and Dutch swimmer Inge de Bruijn. The award for Comeback of the Year went to Austrian skier Hermann Maier, who returned from a horrific motorcycle accident to win a fourth World Cup title. Newcomer of the Year was Michelle Wie, the 14-year-old Hawaiian golfer, while Canadian athlete Earle Connor, who broke four world records in 2003, won the award for Disabled Sportsperson of the Year. A panel of more than 400 sports journalists from around the world came up with the shortlist and 41 sports personalities, including former cyclist Miguel Indurain, tennis player John McEnroe and athlete Edwin Moses, selected the winners.

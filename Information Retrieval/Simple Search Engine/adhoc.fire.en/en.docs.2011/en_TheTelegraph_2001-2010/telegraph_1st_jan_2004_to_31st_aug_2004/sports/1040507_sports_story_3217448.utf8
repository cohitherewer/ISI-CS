The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutias money on France
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia at a press conference in a city hotel on Thursday. Picture by Pabitra Das Calcutta: East Bengal star Bhaichung Bhutia puts his money on France to retain their European soccer championship. Mohun Bagans Rennedy Singh feels England will turn the tables on all, and that David Beckham will be the superstar of the Euro 2004 show, to be held from June 12 to July 4 in Portugal. Bhutia feels France have really talented players and the team has incredible potential. If you ask me choose a World XI today Ill probably choose France. For Rennedy, England will be the team to watch, and my hero Beckham will be the superstar. He follows Beckhams life story closely, and is prompt in saying that he likes every aspect of it, on an off the field. I like all of it, said Rennedy. The two were at a press conference of ESPN-STAR Sports where it was announced that Bhutia will be the analyst for the channel combine when Euro 2004 gets underway. Bhutia will be in the Singapore studio of ESPN for the entire duration of the championship. Bhutia and Rennedy will also feature in the channels promos to Euro 2004 as soccer fever is ramped up. Matches being in Portugal, will be held at viewer-friendly timings, hence the expected growth in enthusiasm. To make the best of this aspect, the channel combine is also bringing in Hindi commentary feed for the championship. I believe Hindi commentary will only boost the popularity of the sport in the country, especially from this high-profile event, said Bhutia. A lot of people who have stayed away from the usual English programmes will tune in. The discerning viewer, of course, will hope the regular English feed will also be available to keep quality stuff on air.  Copyright

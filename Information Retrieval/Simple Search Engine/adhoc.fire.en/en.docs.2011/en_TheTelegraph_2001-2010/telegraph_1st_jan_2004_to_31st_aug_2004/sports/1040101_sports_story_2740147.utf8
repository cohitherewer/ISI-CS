 Kunte held once again 
Hastings: Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte played out a cautious draw with top seed GM Vladimir Epishin of Russia in third round of the Hastings international chess congress here. The draw, however, did not help Kunte improve his position, as he remained joint seventh in the 10-player contest. GM Vasilios Kotronias emerged as the new sole leader following a brilliant victory over Alexander Cherniaev of Russia. Kotronias, now on 2.5 points, is closely followed by defending champion GM Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark, GM Mark Hebden of England and Epishin who all have 2 points apiece. Next in line are GM Jonathan Rowson of England and Cherniaev on 1.5 points while GM Stuart Conquest amp; IM Daniel Gormally of England and Kunte are close behind with one each. Youngest participant Kateryna Lahno of Uzbekistan came under firing line of Nielsen and was pushed to the last place in standing list on just half a point. Six more rounds remain in this category 13 event. Kunte (rated 2535) is more than 100 points behind Epishin (2658) in the Elo rating list and that certainly played on his mind as he settled behind white pieces. The result was rather a safe and sound approach against the Semi Slav defence where Epishin had little troubles in maintaining the balance. The game lasted only 18 moves. Kotronias played a fine attacking game to crush Cherniaev who suffered his first loss in the tournament. The opening was Rossolimo attack where the Russian, white, did not even get a semblance of advantage and found his pieces relegated on the wrong side while Kotronias made merry. The end was picturesque as Kotronias delivered checkmate on board on move 38. The game between Nielsen and Lahno was yet another one-sided affair, as the Dane proved superior in all departments. The variation in the English opening was at one time a favourite of Russian GM Vladimir Kramnik and Nielsen got a huge spatial advantage with his white pieces in the ensuing middle game. Nielsen romped home in 46 moves after sacrificing an exchange. Daniel Gormally, playing white, was finding the going tough so far. And he could not have hoped for a better occasion to open his account. He downed compatriot overnight leader Hebden.Gormally opted for the same move order that gave Kunte a good position in his first round game against Hebden and went for a thematic exchange sacrifice that gave him a stronghold in the centre. Hebden tried for some complications in the later stages of the middle game but his efforts went in vain as Gormally wrapped the issue in 42 moves. The game between Conquest and Rowson was an exciting draw after 47 moves. (PTI)  Copyright

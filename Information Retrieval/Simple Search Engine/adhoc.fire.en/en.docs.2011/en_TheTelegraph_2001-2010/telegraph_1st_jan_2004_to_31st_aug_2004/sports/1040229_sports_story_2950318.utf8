 Warne joins squad in Lanka
Colombo, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Shane Warne was reunited with the Australian squad on Saturday for next months three-Test tour of Sri Lanka after completing a 12-month drugs ban. Warne was suspended last year for taking a diuretic and missed the World Cup but was immediately recalled to the national team after playing just one first-class match. Warne arrived at the team hotel with other members of the Test squad during the early hours of Saturday to be greeted by his one-day teammates, who are already in action in Sri Lanka.  Copyright

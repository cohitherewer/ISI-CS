The Telegraph - Calcutta
Logie blames it on mental weakness
- Windies coach feels lack of discipline also a reason behind recent defeats
 Its no secret that Lara (right) and Logie are not the best of friends Bridgetown: Coach Gus Logie says that a lack of mental strength and discipline are the biggest obstacles to the West Indies fulfilling their potential. In Jamaica (where West Indies collapsed to 47 all out and lost by ten wickets), I think we were probably prepared better than ever before, Logie said. But its not just about training and preparation, we have to ask ourselves are we mentally strong enough? Can the bowlers bowl the right line, can the batters make the right choices? Its not down to a lack of information  information is everywhere. We can use a psychologist, show players a lot of things, but at the end of the day its down to the players. They must have a passion for the team and a responsibility for themselves. Logie, who has an uneasy relationship with captain Brian Lara, and his West Indies side came under intense criticism for their poor performance in the first two Tests against England, who lead the four-match series 2-0 and are on the verge of a first series triumph in the Caribbean since 1968. The third Test starts in Barbados on Thursday. The West Indies have failed to stick to basic disciplines on or off the pitch. Four players, including vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, reportedly attended a party in the stand at Sabina Park in the wake of the ten-wicket defeat in the first Test, actions which led to the resignation of team manager Rocky Skerritt. Unlike the coaches of most Test-playing nations, Logie is not on the West Indies selection committee, something he knew when taking the job but which clearly rankles. I dont think a coach of the West Indies team is solely responsible for what happens on the pitch, he said. If we want to say the buck stops with the coach then we have to make him have some responsibility. It is no secret that Lara and Logie are not exactly the best of friends. I am not going to say that we go to the pub together at the end of the day  we have two different lifestyles and I think everybody knows that, Logie said. But the relationship with the captain is a very good, professional one. We do whatever is necessary for the team to go forward.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

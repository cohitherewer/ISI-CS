The team  also comprising Rupesh Roy, Sanaa Bhambri and Tara Iyer and coached by Arun Kumar  will play in three Grade I and one Grade IV events besides the two Grade A Grand Slams. While Divij and Tushar, with ITF rankings of 29 and 33 respectively, have a direct entry at the French Open in Paris from May 29, while the others have to go through qualifying rounds. Sixteen-year old Sanaa and Sania Mirza created a sensation last year by becoming the first Indian girls to reach the doubles semi-finals of a Grand Slam. The players first event would be a G1 event on clay court in Belgium from Monday. After competing at Roland Garros, they would proceed to Germany where they would play in some more G1 and G4 events. Another G1 grass court tournament in Roehampton, London, would serve as the tune-up for Wimbledon before they return home. (PTI)  Copyright

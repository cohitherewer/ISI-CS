The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak eye hattrick vs India
 Woolmer is all praise for Malik Amsterdam: With two wins in a row against India, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer is hoping to continue the run of success against the arch-rivals in the Champions Trophy in England next month. We hope to continue this run of success against India all through, said Woolmer after his side beat India by 66 runs in the opening game of the tri-series here on Saturday. Pakistan earlier defeated India comprehensively in the Asia Cup last month. It seems unlikely the two teams will run into each other before the Champions Trophy clash on September 19. We have just played two games against them and won both but I would rate todays performance as better than others, said the coach giving his bowlers and fielders the credit for the discipline they showed. Nobody is mentioning we gave away just five extras. The pitch was also not easy to bat on. It held a little bit for the medium-pacers and quick bowlers had a tendency to run on to the bat a little more. Woolmer was delighted at the induction of Shoaib Malik at No. 3 and the super value which Shahid Afridi provided to the team. Shoaib Malik is a class act. Being promoted to No. 3  he has to thank his captain for it. Inzamam came up to me and said he quite liked Shoaib Malik at No. 3. I didnt have much choice, I didnt know him. But I watched him in the nets, he is a high quality player. Gul for SA treatment Pakistan pacer Umer Gul has been sent to South Africa for treatment on a career-threatening back injury that has kept him out of action since April, says a report from Karachi. According to a PCB official, trainer Murray Stevenson and physio Darryn Lifsun suggested Gul should go to Cape Town for consultation and treatment. Gul is expected to be fit for the tour of Australia later this year. (PTI)  Copyright

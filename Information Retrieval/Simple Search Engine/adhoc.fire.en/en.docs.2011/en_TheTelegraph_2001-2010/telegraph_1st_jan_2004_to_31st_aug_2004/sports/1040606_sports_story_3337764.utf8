The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Myskina writes Russian history in 59 minutes
	 - I think I was just too nervous: Dementieva  Anastasia Myskina waves to the crowd after her win over Elena Dementieva on Saturday. Myskina won 6-1, 6-2. (AFP) Paris, June 5 (Reuters): Named after a Russian royal, Anastasia Myskina took her place on the throne of claycourt tennis Saturday, thrashing Elena Dementieva in an all-Russian French Open final. The dark-haired Muscovite, often tempestuous, at times brilliant, controlled this one-sided title match from the moment the old friends stepped on court, winning 6-1, 6-2 to become the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, all over in 59 minutes. The Russian national anthem echoed around the Roland Garros stadium but it was a coronation lacking fanfare as sixth seed Myskina won by the biggest margin since Steffi Graf beat Belarussian Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 in 1988. I cant believe it, the 22-year-old said as she collected her trophy and cheque for 838,500 euros. Im really very happy. But it was hard to control my emotions in a Grand Slam final against a player who is also a friend. Dementieva found it harder. I think I was just too nervous today. I have wanted this all my life but I couldnt handle the pressure... I couldnt play my game, she said with tears in her eyes. My dream was to win Roland Garros and Im sorry to have lost today. The last Russian to have reached a Grand Slam final was Olga Morozova, who lost in the final here and at Wimbledon in 1974. Morozova is now Dementievas coach and her charge could do no better. I just made too many mistakes, I couldnt do anything, Dementieva said. At one point early in the second set she screamed at herself in Russian. I shouted I hate myself...which is true, she explained, before breaking down in tears. Fittingly, for a first Grand Slam final between two Russians, both players had chosen to wear red. There the similarity ended. Myskina is a firebrand with short, dark hair. She is famed for her on-court spats with coach and ex-boyfriend Jens Gerlach. Dementievas long blonde locks hang in a pony-tail. She towers above Myskina and is more softly-spoken and demure. She is also the more nervy character. This led to her downfall. While Myskina appeared to revel in the final-day atmosphere, her 22-year-old friend simply froze. In total, Dementieva hit 15 double faults. Myskinas game plan appeared simple. Make the ninth seed play the ball and wait for the nerves to kick in. It was a simple plan, but did the trick. Dementieva tried to be aggressive, tried to take the initiative on many occasions but too often she tightened, either sending the ball into the net or shovelling it deep over the baseline. Myskina herself was not entirely immune to nerves. However, she managed to control herself at key moments, preferring the simple, rolled crosscourt shot rather than the high-risk efforts Dementieva seemed bent on. Malisse-Rochus wins The mens doubles crown was lifted by the unseeded Belgian pair of Xavier Malisse and Olivier Rochus who upset sixth seeds Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro of France 7-5, 7-5.

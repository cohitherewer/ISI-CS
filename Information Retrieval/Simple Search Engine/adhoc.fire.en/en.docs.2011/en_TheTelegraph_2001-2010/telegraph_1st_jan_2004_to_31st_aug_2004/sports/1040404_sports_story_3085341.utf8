 Taibu named captain as Streak resigns
 - Zimbabwe veteran quits all cricket after ultimatum to ZCU backfires  Tatenda Taibu becomes the youngest skipper ever Harare: Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak has resigned from his post after losing a battle of power with his national cricket body. Streak quit following a disagreement with the ZCU over selection policy, according to reports, which also said he had quit all cricket. Streak, who resigned on Friday, was immediately replaced as skipper by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu, who will become the first black to lead Zimbabwe, and at 20, the youngest in Test history. The state-controlled Harare Herald reported on Saturday that Streak had been fired by the ZCU. Streak was unavailable for comment on Saturday because he was captaining for Matabeleland in a Logan Cup domestic first-class match against Mashonaland in Bulawayo. When Taibu leads against Sri Lanka, arriving here in two weeks for a two-Test and five one-day International series, he will overtake the record currently held by Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, who was 21 years and 77 days old when he first captained India in the West Indies in 1961-62. According to the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, Streak gave it an ultimatum to restructure the national selection panel or he would resign. The ZCU rejected his demands, and Streak resigned from playing at all levels in the country. Streak wanted the panel trimmed from five members to four, and for all to have played first-class or Test cricket. He said he had no confidence in the teams being selected, and was also unhappy at the team management, led by coach Geoff Marsh. Streak was first appointed captain in 2000, but resigned when it affected his form. He was re-appointed in 2002. Since his debut in 1993, he has played 59 Tests and last month became the first Zimbabwean to take more than 200 wickets. He averaged 23 with the bat with one century against the West Indies last November. Streak also played in 183 one-day Internationals. Streak raised a number of issues and demanded that they be met by Monday or else he would resign from all forms of cricket, ZCU said in a statement. Instead of accepting his demands, the ZCU board unanimously accepted his resignation from all forms of cricket with immediate effect. Streak said he had no confidence in the teams being selected and was under stress as he was doubling up as the players representative since the players were continuously presenting grievances to him, the cricket body said. ZCU said earlier in the week that Streak had expressed lack of confidence in Marsh accusing him of misrepresenting him to the selectors. The directors expressed anger at the move taken by Streak, saying that one of the conditions of his assuming the post was that he would captain any side selected, said ZCU. The directors also considered Zimbabwes poor performance against Bangladesh early this year. Streak led his side to a laboured 2-1 victory over Bangladesh in a one-day International series last month. Streaks actions could herald the start of a wave of resignations among Zimbabwes senior players. Streak had recently signed for English side Warwickshire as one of their overseas players for the coming county season.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

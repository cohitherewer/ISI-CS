The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India take 2-1 lead
 - Bhupathi-Paes proves too much for NZ pair  Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes after winning the doubles rubber against New Zealand in Invercargill on Saturday Invercargill, Feb. 7 (AP): As expected, India were back on top again, taking a 2-1 lead over New Zealand as the ace pair of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi beat Mark Neilsen and Matt Prentice 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) on Saturday in their Asia-Oceania Davis Cup Group 1 first round tie. It was evident that the former world No. 1 doubles combination retained a great deal of its understanding as they went through New Zealands untried duo. India had drawn back from a 0-1 deficit as on the first day when Paes beat Nielsen, after New Zealands Simon Rea had beaten Harsh Mankad in the opening singles. That first-day deadlock was broken on Saturday. It was an almost instinctive combination between Paes and Bhupathi. It proved too much for Nielsen and Prentice, who was making his Cup doubles debut. Bhupathi is ranked fourth in the world in doubles and Paes 13th. At 23, Prentice, who is studying at the University of Oklahoma in the United States, made his debut in the Davis Cup and gave a good account of himself but was helpless against the aggressive play by the Indians. There was just one break of serve in the first set. Prentice, who had won his first game on serve to love, was broken in the seventh as the Indians went up 4-3. The newcomer was broken again in the first game of the second set as the Indians easily held serve thereafter to take the set. Nielsen had a chance to force the match to a fourth set when serving on 4-3 in the tie-breaker, but he dropped both points to allow the Indians a 5-4 advantage. Paes decided the set with two classy points, including a crisp, unplayable volley at match point. The reverse singles will be played on Sunday. The winner of the match plays either Japan or Indonesia in the second round in April.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sting operation may hit London bid
	 - The IAAF has a responsibility on doping offences: Rogge  MIHIR BOSE IN ATHENS  IOC chief Jacques Rogge tries his hand at a game of pool in the Olympic Village on Monday. (AFP) Londons bid for the 2012 Olympics could be damaged by members of the International Olympic Committee associating it with the recent Panorama investigation to uncover IOC corruption. Reporters claiming to be businessmen from a bogus London company said they were willing to bribe IOC members to get the Games to London. Though it was made clear they were not connected with London 2012, one IOC member inclined to London told me: What the BBC has done is unbelievable. What we now need is for London 2012 to be fighting back against this guilt by association but so far I have not heard from London 2012 in the IOC hotel. They need to move quickly to limit the damage. Bob Scott, who led two unsuccessful Manchester bids for the summer Olympics, said: I feel sorry for London. I dont think Panorama is going to do any favours to London. The problem is that IOC members will be asking themselves if we give London the 2012 Olympics will we have to put up with such undercover investigative reporting for seven long years leading up to 2012? Do we want that? Mike Lee, the London bids director of communications, put on a brave face, saying: We dont have any sense this is affecting the London bid. However, he added: There is a certain amount of irritation in the way Panaroma went about its investigation. In many parts of the world such undercover investigations, whether by police or journalists, would not be allowed. Panaroma efforts bore immediate fruit as this weekend the IOC executive board suspended the one member featured on the programme  Ivan Slavkov, from Bulgaria. This is despite the fact that the IOC Ethics Commission have not completed their investigations and are yet to receive additional information they have requested from Panaroma. All this is part of what one IOC member called the new philosophy of the president, Jacque Rogge. He says preachers should be impeccable. Rogges rigorous stance with his own IOC members is in contrast to potential drug cheats and no one can be certain that those who have failed drug tests before they get to the Olympics will not take part in Athens. Rogge said: The IOC accepts athletes who are legitimately entered by the international federations and the National Olympic Committees. It is not for the IOC to make a judgement on a potential doping case that has not happened during the Olympic Games. That is the responsibility of the International Association of Athletics Federations. If the IAAF say they cannot participate then they will not. If they say they can participate, they will participate.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

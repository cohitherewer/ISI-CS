 OKeeffe salutes Anil Kumble
Melbourne: Anil Kumble has been rated as the best slow bowler to tour Down Under in the last quarter century by former Australian leg-spinner Kerry O Keeffe. O Keeffe was certainly not the most successful of spinners to have played for Australia, taking 53 wickets from 24 Tests, but is hugely respected in his country and works as a leg-spin coach at the Australian cricket academy. It is one of the most cleverly orchestrated campaigns of leg-spin bowling in this country that I have ever seen, O Keeffe said of Kumble, who took 24 wickets in the three matches he played in the four-Test series. Kumble has used that 101-102 km slider, his two-three variations of googly which either opened the gate or had batsmen hitting back catches. O Keeffe looked deep at Kumbles methods and said he saw a very crafty bowler at his peak. When Lee came in late on the third day (in Sydney), Kumble bowled him a 100 km yorker and followed it up with a 78 km wrong un, wide. When everybody was thinking he would york him the last ball, he bowled a bleepy wrong un, he said. When he got Ponting with that spearing stuff, he found the batsman looking to work him on the on-side. He just kept slowing a couple up, setting it up, and then the 101 km slider just got his man. O Keeffe said he noticed Kumble hates being cut yet he used this as a ploy to get Steve Waugh. (PTI)  Copyright

 Reyes is Arsenals latest weapon 
 - North London club raises title stakes with 20m deal  BY JOHN LEY AND SID LOWE  Huge step ahead for my career, says Reyes Arsenal Wednesday completed the 20 million capture of one of the games most exciting prospects when Jose Antonio Reyes, Sevilles highly-coveted 20-year-old forward, signs a four-and-a-half-year contract at Highbury. Chelsea and Liverpool were both courting Reyes, but the Spaniard flew back to London with David Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman, Tuesday after agreeing personal terms and, providing he passes his medical, will sign inside the January transfer window. Arsenal will pay an initial 8 million for Reyes, but that figure could rise as high as pounds 20 million depending on the success he enjoys during his time in north London, easily eclipsing the club record pounds 13million Arsenal paid for Sylvain Wiltord. It is a huge coup for Arsenal and there could be further good news for their fans shortly, with the club expected to announce that all obstacles to building their new home at Ashburton Grove have been lifted. Manager Arsene Wenger has been limited in his transfer dealings whileArsenal secure finances for the pounds 400 million project but the club are now hoping to start life at their new stadium in time for the 2006-2007season. Arsenal lead the Premiership with an unbeaten League record; if they avoid defeat against Manchester City on Sunday they will equal a club record start to the season. The fact that Wenger was allowed to invest so much on Reyes confirms that the stadium project can go ahead, a fact that is sure to tie the manager and key players such as Patrick Vieira, the captain, and striker Thierry Henry, to the club. Reyes, at Seville since he was nine, said: I am the happiest man in the world, but at the same time Im the saddest. Im leaving the best team in Spain to go to the best in England. Theres no doubt that this is a huge step for me in my career, but I wont forget the club that I love with all my heart. Between me and the fans there is something special and I hope they dont forget me. Ive given everything to this club and I hope to return one day. Wenger admitted he has followed Reyes progress for more than a year and that the club first made an approach in July. Wenger added: Jose is a fantastic signing for Arsenal, a great asset to our squad. He has played for Sevilla up front on his own, as a supporting striker and he has played on the left recently. He can be adaptable; he can even play on the right. This player is an investment. He is 20-years-old and he is already an international. The one minor problem is that Reyes may be suspended for the visit of Manchester City, if his one-match ban is transferred from Spain to England. The Arsenal manager made light of the problem though, joking: That just makes me think he has all the qualities to be an Arsenal player! Importantly, Reyes is eligible to play in the Champions League and that could mean a hasty return to Spain for the forward with Arsenal playing Celta Vigo, in Spain, on Feb 24 in the first leg of the quarter finals. Jose Maria del Nido, the Seville president, refused to confirm the exact fee involved but said: This offer was out of this world. Barcelona made an offer for Reyes on Sunday and it was only slightly over half of what Arsenal offered. We have made a pact of confidentiality on the price and we cannot say. But I can tell you that it is greater than any other offer.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

Islamabad: The top brass of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), including chairman Shaharyar Khan, has been summoned again by the senate committee for a new round of grilling next week over the home series loss to India. Zafar Iqbal Chaudhry, chairman of the senate standing committee on sports, culture and women affairs, said that the head of the PCB, chief executive Ramiz Raja and chief selector Wasim Bari have been asked to attend the meeting in Islamabad on July 19. We will also be asking the then coach Javed Miandad and captain Inzamam-ul Haq to appear before the committee, Zafar was quoted as saying by local daily Dawn. The meeting is a follow-up to the one held on May 29 in which the cricket administrators were questioned on matters relating to running of the PCB and Pakistans Test as well as one-day series defeat to India in March-April. Pak hire new physio The PCB has hired South African Darryn Lifson as the physiotherapist of the national squad which already has a foreign coach and trainer.

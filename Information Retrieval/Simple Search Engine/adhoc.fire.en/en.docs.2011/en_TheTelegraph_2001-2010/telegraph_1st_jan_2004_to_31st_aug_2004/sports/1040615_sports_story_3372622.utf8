 Zidane destroys England in 2 mins
 - Beckham misses penalty as Erikssons men lose match despite leading till the fag end  BY PAUL HAYWARD  Zinedine Zidane bends a free-kick which beat the English wall to give France the equaliser in their pool B match in Lisbon on Sunday. Zidane went on to convert a penalty moments after to complete a miraculous win. (AFP) Genius does what it must. A classic display of English stubbornness was undone in a couple of minutes here last night when the stadium clock was already locked on 90 minutes. The perpetrator? The worlds greatest player, Zinedine Zidane, who had looked for much of the night a shadow of his former self. For Manchester United-Bayern Munich in the European Cup final five years ago, read France against England now. An opening victory in Euro 2004 Group B was snatched by a curling Zidane free-kick and a penalty (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). At times in the heaving Estadio Da Luz, it felt as if Zidane was on the long slide to retirement. He seemed less quick, less sharp, less domineering. Then his true nature showed itself. Englands resilience was broken. They trouped into the dressing room in deep shock. Still an opening-day win in a European Championship eludes them. When the pain has subsided, there ought to be a recognition that this was a decent English performance. Above it all, it looked like a proper, championship-quality exercise in tactical sophistication. Call it the Wayne Rooney principle: skill and determination in equal measure. This would have been a lucky win, but one England would have felt no need to be ashamed of. If they play like this in their remaining two games, they will deal with Switzerland and Croatia. If there was an English town or city not represent by a flag draped over a railing, this newspaper has yet to hear of it. Englands travelling clan grows more populous by the day. We knew the shires would send a vast delegation, but nothing could have prepared the players for the sweet surprise that awaited them here. The Cross of St George outnumbered the French cockerel four or five to one. The English have become the world leaders in sports tourism. We knew that. Still, the breadth and fervour of the support for Sven-Goran Erikssons men spoke a deeper shift  towards benign patriotism, and unqualified respect for this generation of England players. Soon, though, Patrick Vieira, Zidane and Thierry Henry were ramming home an old message. A barbecue is no good without the meat. The standard England aspire to is the one Les Bleus set in winning the 1998 World Cup and the most recent European Championship. For half an hour at least, there was the grim sense that England were being given a seminar by a superior team; the country, in fact, that has sprinkled the Premiership with so much stardust, taught so many lessons. The riposte came through a combination of Beckhams favourite party trick, the curling free-kick, plus old-fashioned English muscularity. For the 38th minute header that gave England an unlikely 1-0 lead at half-time, Frank Lampard burst into a throng of blue shirts and somehow managed to glance Beckhams cross past Fabien Barthez. No England player could object to us wheeling out the old standby, against the run of play. The celebration inside the stadium lacked the natural vigour of an England post-goal knees-up. The rejoicing was borne mainly of relief. The sun-fried English masses had been wrestling with their deepest fears when Lampards yeoman forehead connected with Beckhams banana ball. Stoicism is the unbreakable English virtue. But faced with such a formidable array of physical strength and skill, any team would be entitled to feel their confidence dip. England withstood the rigours of the first half hour. Moments after Lampards goal, Rooney pulled off a 360-degree spin, complete with ball, right in front of the master Zidane, who could do more than admire and give chase. During the break, England fans roared their appreciation when Lampards header was replayed and doubtless bombarded the barbecue brigade back home with calls and texts. Thierry Henry, youre having a laugh, they sang, just as Arsenals chief musketeer raced past Beckham and flicked a cross beyond Gary Neville. Dangerous. Like punching the old Mike Tyson early in a fight. Makes him angry. The siege of the earliest phase resumed, with Vieira wrapping his tentacles round any Englishman who dared to dwell on the ball, Makelele trying to enflame Scholes and Zidane, who is going through one of the quieter passages in his rich career, trying to feed Trezeguet and Henry. Not unreasonably, given the frequency of the French attacks, English boots began clipping longer passes to the front men to escape the corral. It was from a desperate counter-attack that Rooney sprinted into the penalty area to be felled by Mikael Silvestre. Result: Beckham penalty saved. It was never straightforward for England in a tournament. So maybe Beckham was merely fulfilling the two-yearly drama quota by missing. It was turning into a night of traumas. There was encouragement for England, at least, in the sterile 0-0 draw between Croatia and Switzerland. At first sight  and these can be deceptive  Group B is hardly the one of death. Any Premiership fan who has seen Ivica Mornar labouring up and down the right flank for Portsmouth will not fear for England against the Croatians. Mornar does well to the get on the pitch for Pompey. Here, he is a starter for Croatia. The standard was set, instead, by Spain, who beat Russia 1-0 on Saturday evening. The lightning pace of Valencias Vincente, and the cleverness of Juan Carlos Valeron, when he came off the bench, lit the first big imaginative flares. But Sunday was the first clash of the giants: a compelling blend of English spirit and French ingenuity. Yes, this England team have matured together. Yes, they have progressed beyond inferiority complexes, yes they now have the necessary footballing intelligence to put this right. As long as they can stay away from Zidane.

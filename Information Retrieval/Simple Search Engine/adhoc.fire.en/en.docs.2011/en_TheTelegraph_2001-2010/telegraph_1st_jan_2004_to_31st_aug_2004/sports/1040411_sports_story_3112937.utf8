 Debutant Belarus storm into semis
 - DAVIS CUP WORLD GROUP - Roddick neutralises Bjorkman victory  Juan Carlos Ferrero after defeating Raemon Sluiter in Palma de Mallorca. (AFP) Minsk: World Group debutants Belarus became the first team through to the Davis Cup semis after winning Saturdays doubles against Argentina in their World Group quarter-final tie. Max Mirnyi and Vladimir Voltchkov, who had won their respective singles rubbers against Guillermo Canas and Agustin Callerie on Friday, rolled past Calleri and Lucas Arnold 6-3, 6-4, 6-1 to give Belarus a 3-0 lead. In Lausanne, Nicolas Escude and Michael Llodra defeated Roger Federer and Yves Allegro 6-7, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 to give France a 2-1 lead over Switzerland. The win was some kind of revenge for Escude, who was swept aside by world No. 1 Federer in straight sets on the opening day. In Mallorca, Spaniards Tommy Robredo and Rafael Nadal were leading Dutchmen John Van Lottum and Martin Verkerk by two sets to one when rain abandoned play for the day. The match will resume on Sunday morning before the reverse singles. Spain took a 2-0 advantage on Friday with both Carlos Moya and Juan Carlos Ferrero winning comfortably (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). Moya beat Martin Verkerk 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 victory Martin Verkerk, while Ferrero whipped Raemon Sluiter 6-2, 6-2, 6-4. In New York, Andy Roddick hauled the United States back into their quarter final with Sweden with a 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Thomas Enqvist on Friday. Jonas Bjorkman, the pillar of Swedens surprise win over holders Australia in the first round, had given his team a positive start at Delray Beach, Florida, beating Mardy Fish 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 in the opening rubber. But world No. 2 Roddick overcame shaky serving to leave the tie finely balanced ahead of the doubles between Americans Mike and Bob Bryan and the Swedish pairing of Bjorkman and Thomas Johansson. With the Bjorkman-Fish match interrupted three times by rain, Roddick and Enqvist had a lengthy wait to engage their rivalry.

(Reuters)Both made a slow start, exchanging two breaks each before Roddick held for 5-4 and broke again in the 10th game to claim the first set. The turning point was at 5-5 in the second when world No. 62 Enqvist squandered two break-points, allowing Roddick to move 6-5 ahead. The American took the initiative, grabbing the second of his two break-points in the next game. Enqvists resistance effectively ended when he failed to capitalise on two more break-points at the start of the third set. In the first rubber, Fish, recalled by US captain Patrick McEnroe, began confidently against Bjorkman with an immediate break of serve. After the first of the three rain delays, the players returned for Fish to close out the first set. But after an early exchange of breaks in the second, Bjorkman broke again for a 4-2 lead. A struggling Fish was broken twice in the third set and, although he saved one match-point on his serve at 3-5 in the fourth before holding and breaking back for 5-5, Bjorkman was unmoved. The world No. 27 took his Davis Cup record to 34-14 by breaking Fish in the 11th game and made no mistake closing out the match. (Reuters)  Copyright

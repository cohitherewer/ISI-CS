The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Eves to avail of NCA facilities
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: There is no sign of a merger between the mens and womens cricket bodies in India as yet, but some encouraging signs can be seen. Shubhangi Kulkarni, secretary of the Womens Cricket Association of India (WCAI), met Jagmohan Dalmiya on Wednesday and said the BCCI chief has promised help on technical fronts. We have been assured that women coaches and cricketers will be allowed to avail of facilities at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore on a regular basis, said Kulkarni. This will be a big help, since womens cricket in India lacks infrastructure and advanced coaching facilities. Kulkarni informed that the present coach of the national team, Sudha Shah, is the only woman in India to have done a coachs course from the NCA. We need many more trained coaches, physical trainers and physiotherapists. The NCA exposure should help us on this front. The WCAI secretary informed there hasnt been much talk on the merger and added that she did remind Dalmiya that the ICC and the IWCC will come under the same umbrella in 2005. Merger is one issue, not the only one, Kulkarni said. Right now, we want to improve the standard of our game. To that end, the association with NCA should help. Also, we talked about what can be done regarding sponsorship. Sponsorship details were not available, but Kulkarni mentioned that things have started getting better. Demand for a merger of the two bodies has been in the air for some time now. In fact, in countries like England and New Zealand, mens and womens bodies are run from the same headquarters. Asia Cup in Lanka Kulkarni added that India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will take part in the first-ever womens Asia Cup in Sri Lanka in April. This will be the first meeting between India and Pakistan as well, so we are all excited about it. The Indian team will be very busy over the next few months, preparing for the World Cup in South Africa in February-March. The Indians recently played a Test and five ODIs against New Zealand. After the Asia Cup, Australia will tour India in November followed by a series against South Africa in India in December.  Copyright

 Sourav: We dont need a Gordon for Pak tour
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Sourav believes Sourashish is in the reckoning for the Pak tour Calcutta: Sandy Gordon was a much-sought after man during Indias recently-concluded tour of Australia. But Team India captain Sourav Ganguly feels his boys wont need the help of the psychologist when they tour Pakistan next month. This is a very important tour for us but we dont have any additional pressure. Therefore, the services of Gordon wont be needed, he said. Sourav was talking to reporters at the Eden Gardens after a workout Sunday afternoon. BCCI has decided against the hosting of the conditioning camp, and the captain endorsed the view. There is no need for conditioning camp as domestic cricket is on, he said after a 45-minute warm-up session. The skipper will be having nets from Monday. Though it may be a remote possibility, Sourav felt Sourashish Lahiri of Bengal is in the reckoning for the berth of an off spinner in the squad. The selectors are considering a number of players like Railways Kulamani Parida, Sarandeep Singh of Delhi and Lahiri for the tour, he said. Sourav also opined that the batsmen have to deliver the goods if India have to make a mark. Yes, were in the best of form. But batting will hold the key to our success. He also sounded happy with the itinerary that was finalised on Saturday. The fact that the one-dayers are preceding the Test matches is good for us. Also the deferment would give much-needed rest to the players, particularly Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Ajit Agarkar and Anil Kumble. He dismissed suggestions of any security concerns saying: We want to concentrate on cricket only and not anything else. Sourav has always done well against Pakistan and hopes to carry on with the good work in the coming series. I had done well in the past against Pakistan. But having said that, its a new series and all of us have to do well. The team is well aware of that. He also reposed faith in the capability of Irfan Pathan. He had delivered against the Aussies, the best team in the world. It will help him do well against Pakistan as well.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick misses media session
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Chandan Das and Mike Okoro during practice at Central Park, Salt Lake, on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: There was an unexpected absence at the official pre-match media session ahead of Wednesdays AFC Cup match between East Bengal and Geylang United of Singapore. While the visiting delegation was there as per norm, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was missing, following a mis-communication. That, at least, was the official explanation. The team manager told me the media session will take place at the team hotel (at Salt Lake), so I stayed there, said Bhowmick. The session actually took place a central Calcutta hotel. One of his major weapons, Bhaichung Bhutia, was preparing for a tough battle. Geylang is the toughest of our oppositions in this group and we just cant afford to relax (after sealing the National Football League title). Geylang coach Scott ODonnell was quite impressed by the Salt Lake Stadium turf. Its better than what we have back home in Bedok. The Australian praised East Bengal and added he didnt expect the India champions to beat them in the first-leg match in Singapore. We fared well, considering the state of our preparations, but I think East Bengal were deserving winners in that match, said ODonnell, who is in his second year as Geylang coach. I think they were pretty sharp, as they should be, in all departments. We could have drawn even after being 1-3 down, but their goalkeeper saved a certain goal. The captain of the visiting team, Alexander Duric, also rated East Bengal highly. They were good in the previous match. We expect another tough match here, said the naturalised Australian, with roots in Yugoslavia. Duric claimed he played for the Yugoslav youth side before moving to Melbourne eight years back and among his teammates in that side was Savo Milosevic, who shot to fame with a wonderful display in Euro 2000. In an unprecedented and touching gesture, the organisers have kept a request from the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy and decided to allow 18 handicapped boys and girls inside the stadium to watch the match. These boys and girls will draw the lots for a lucky draw.  Copyright

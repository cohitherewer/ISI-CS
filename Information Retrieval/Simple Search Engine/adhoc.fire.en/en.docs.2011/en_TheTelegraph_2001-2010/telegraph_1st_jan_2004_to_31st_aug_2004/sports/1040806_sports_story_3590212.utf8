 Pak need to be more professional, says Greg
Islamabad: Former Australian skipper Greg Chappell believes that Pakistan could emerge as the top team of the world if they exercised 100 per cent professionalism and achieved physical and mental toughness. Chappell, who arrived on Wednesday on his second 10-day assignment with the National Cricket Academy, said professional attitude in all departments of the game was essential for building a strong team. Central contract system was also a step towards professionalism and it would make the player feel more secure, he was quoted as saying in The News. Chappell said Australians dominated the game because not only were they talented, but also 100 percent professional. They can dominate for next three to five years although it will not be an easy task, he said. On the NCA, Chappell said the academy was necessary but it could only be beneficial when supported by a strong domestic system, flawless cricket structure and ideal atmosphere. NCAs role should be (limited to) giving finishing touches to boys and all the national team members should also go through it, Chappell said, adding that since Australia had a strong domestic structure, the academy there had been producing talented players. He also called for consistency in all the areas of the game and said that a players responsible attitude was very important without which no coach could do anything. (PTI)  Copyright

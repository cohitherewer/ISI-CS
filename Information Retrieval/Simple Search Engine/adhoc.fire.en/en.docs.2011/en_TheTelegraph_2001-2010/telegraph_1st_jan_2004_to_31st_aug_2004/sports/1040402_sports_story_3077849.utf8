The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand leaps to 3rd spot
 - MONACO CHESS - Indian GM inflicts double blow on Ivanchuk  Viswanathan Anand beat Vassily Ivanchuk in the blindfold game in 47 moves Monaco: World rapid champion Viswanthan Anand took full advantage of his opponents mistakes to give a double blow to Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk in the tenth and penultimate round of Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament to jump to sole third position. The victory helped Anand in narrowing the gap from Russian joint leaders Vladimir Kramnik and Alexander Morozevich as both squandered away a full point lead and lost their rapid games against compatriot Peter Svidler and Evgeny Bareev, respectively. As things stand with just one round to go both Kramnik and Morozevich, with 13 points each, are one point ahead of Anand. Hungarian Peter Leko shares the fourth place along with Bareev on 11.5 points while another half point behind are Svidler and Ivanchuk. The last round could be anyones gain as both Morozevich and Kramnik have tough opponents in the form of Svidler and Topalov. Anand continued to be at the helm on seven points out of a possible ten in rapid section followed by Bareev, who is half-a-point behind. In the blindfold section, Morozevich maintained his sole lead on eight points out of a possible 11, while Kramnik continued to be half point adrift. Anand moved to joint fifth in this section behind Ianchuk and Leko, both having six points each.He finally got his winning touch in the blindfold after missing out for last six games albeit with a little help from lady luck. The opening was a closed Ruy Lopez wherein Ivanchuk saw himself in trouble in the endgame after blundering away a superior position. Anand went for the tactical complications which caught Ivanchuk off-guard. The Indian won an exchange for effectively no compensation and romped home in 61 moves. In the rapid too, Anand did not get anything desirable with his white pieces against the French Defence. The game was fought on even keel and Anand even proposed a draw in the middle game that was spurned by Ivanchuk. Ivanchuk blundered on the 46th move and resigned on the very next, giving Anand two points in as many games.  (PTI)  Copyright

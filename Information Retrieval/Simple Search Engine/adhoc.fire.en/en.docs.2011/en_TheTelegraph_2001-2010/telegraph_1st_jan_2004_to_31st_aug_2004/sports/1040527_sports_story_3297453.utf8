The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ziege for injured Rahn
 Ziege is expected to start on the bench in the friendly vs Malta Gelsenkirchen: Defender Christian Ziege has been included in the Germany squad for Euro 2004 after Christian Rahn had to pull out with injury. The German football association said on Wednesday that Hamburg SVs Rahn, 24, had been withdrawn from the squad because of a thigh injury. A member of Germanys 1996 European championship-winning team, Ziege has been released by English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur and is looking for a new club. The 32-year-old left back won the last of his 71 caps in Germanys 0-2 defeat against Brazil in the 2002 World Cup final in Yokohama. Serious injury worries followed, notably a career-threatening thigh problem, and Ziege needed two operations and hardly played for 14 months. Ziege is expected to start on the bench when Germany play Malta in a friendly on Thursday in Freiburg. The three-time world and European champions will then play Switzerland and Hungary before heading for Portugal, where they have been drawn with the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Latvia in a tough group D. Southampton defender Michael Svenssons knee injury will not heal in time for him to play for Sweden, adds a report from Stockholm. Coaches Lars Lagerback and Tommy Soderberg replaced him with Alexander Ostlund from Swedish first division club Hammarby. Sweden are in Group C with Italy, Denmark and Bulgaria.

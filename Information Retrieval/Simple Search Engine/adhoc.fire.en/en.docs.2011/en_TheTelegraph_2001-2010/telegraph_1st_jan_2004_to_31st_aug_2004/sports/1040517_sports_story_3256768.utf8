The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jimenez clinches 3rd European Tour title
 - ASIAN OPEN GOLF - Jyoti, Jeev finish joint third  Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez kisses the trophy after winning the Asian Open in Shanghai on Sunday. (AFP) Shanghai: Spains Miguel Angel Jimenez stormed from six strokes back to clinch the BMW Asian Open Sunday, his third European Tour victory of the season. Jimenez, who has an ongoing love affair with Asia, had a dramatic chip-in eagle at the 13th hole on his way to a 67 and a total of 14-under-par 274. He finished three strokes ahead of runaway overnight leader Simon Dyson of England, who closed with a four-over-par 76. Two Indians, Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh, improved on their overnight scores, returning two-under 70 last-round cards. They were both tied at tenth position, on an aggregate tally of 282 with Greg Hanrahan of the US and Marcus Both of Australia. Thailands Prayad Marksaeng, who led early on the back nine before stumbling with four bogeys in five holes, ended a further stroke adrift in third place after a 71. The triumph, his tenth on the European Tour, won Jimenez a cheque for $ 250,000 and saw him jump to second in the rankings behind South Africas Ernie Els. He has also virtually secured a spot in Bernhard Langers European team for the Ryder Cup in September. Jimenez clinched the victory with a birdie at the last hole, as the title challengers stumbled, and gave his local female caddy a hug of celebration. I thought Simon (Dyson) was going to win as he had played so well for three days but I was fighting from the beginning of the round, said Jimenez, who lit up his trademark Cuban cigar after signing his card. It was a case of keeping committed and playing well. The 13th hole was the turning point (with the eagle). I hit a beautiful chip from 30 m and saw it had a chance to go in the hole...then it disappeared. It is amazing (to win), I surprised myself. Jimenez said the win, his third of the season after triumphs at the Johnnie Walker Classic in Bangkok and the Algarve Open, would consolidate his position in the top 50 of the world rankings, ensure him a start in the Majors and clinch his Ryder Cup spot. I will be in the US Open (in June) and if I play like this, I can win anything, said Jimenez, who is nicknamed The Mechanic. At the moment I am hitting the ball well and feeling good on the golf course. I do not think I have to worry about (getting into) the Ryder Cup team now  I will be there (at Oakland Hills in Michigan). The Spaniard credited some of his good form to his love of the Asian continent and its people. I like this part of the world  the people are so kind, so nice, he said. I feel very relaxed coming and playing here.  (AFP)  Copyright

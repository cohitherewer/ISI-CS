 Indian boys in second place
New Delhi: The Indian boys came up with an impressive show to take second spot behind South Korea on the opening day of the Asia Pacific junior golf championship in Jakarta. According to an Indian Golf Union release on Wednesday, Ajeetesh Sandhu carded a par round and was ably supported by Gaganjeet Bhullar, who scored a four-over. Fatehbir Dhadiwals three-over helped India finish five strokes behind South Korea. However, the Indian girls team failed to impress and were at the bottom of the table with only Vaishnavi Sinha playing a good round, carding a four-over. In the individual category, Raghav Wahi led the pack in group B with a one over par.  (PTI)  Copyright

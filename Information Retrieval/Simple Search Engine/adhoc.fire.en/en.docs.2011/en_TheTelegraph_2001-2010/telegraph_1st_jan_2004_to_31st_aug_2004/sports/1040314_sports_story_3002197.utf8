 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Tollygunge goal falls through torn side-netting  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge Agragami scorer Gauranga Dutta being challenged by Mohammedan Sportings Amjad Ali Khan at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The pre-match interest, if there was any, boiled the Mohammedan Sporting-Tollygunge Agragami match to a battle for survival in the countrys premier club tournament. In the end, the two National Football League (NFL) relegation-strugglers gained nothing as they played out a tedious 1-1 draw at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Syed Rahim Nabi put Mohammedan Sporting ahead in the 11th minute. But Tollygunge Agragami came back strongly in the second half and duly equalised through a Gouranga Dutta cracker in the 60th minute. The verdict left debutants Mohammedan Sporting on 15 points from as many games and Tollygunge, playing a game less, with 14. There were, however, a few stray incidents which brought life to an otherwise sleep-inducing match. Take Nabis goal. How did Tollygunge defender Kabijit Khotel fail to connect an absolutely innocuous Syed Hossain cross was beyond explanation. And Mohammedan Sporting No. 8 gleefully received the ball clear at the other end and glided it past the goalkeeper Samit Debnath, who came up in vain to close the angle. Then six minutes into the second session came the Tollygunge equaliser, only to be ruled out by the referee Walter Perraira within minutes! Having received a loose ball inside the box, Akeem Abolanle drove powerfully and the ball crashed into the net. Perreira initially interpreted it as a goal. But Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Amar Deb and other players rushed to him, drawing his attention to the fact that there was a big hole in the side-netting and the ball had actually gone through it. The referee had a long discussion with his assistant S. Suresh and the goal was subsequently disallowed. But Tollygunge drew level soon, thanks to a classic Gauranga strike. Akeem released him on the left and the midfielder unleashed a left-footed volley from an acute angle which beat a hapless Amar. Chidi Edeh also deserves a special mention for letting Mohammedan Sporting down. He spoiled too many good moves, by standing in off-side positions. He once selfishly refused to square a pass to Dipendu Biswas when the duo broke free on a counter attack and later failed to beat Debnath from handshaking distance.

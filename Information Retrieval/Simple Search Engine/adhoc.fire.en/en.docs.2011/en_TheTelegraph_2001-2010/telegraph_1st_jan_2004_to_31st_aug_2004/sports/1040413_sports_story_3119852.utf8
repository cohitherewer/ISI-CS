The Telegraph - Calcutta
India must not go on the defensive
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasIt is really difficult to say which side has more momentum going into the decider in Rawalpindi. Following the Lahore victory, conventional logic would suggest Pakistan to be the more comfortable of the two sides. But the topsy-turvy way this tour has gone on, conventional wisdom has often been relegated to the proverbial backseat. India came back in the one-day series when Pakistan could have sealed it with a match to spare and, then, the Indians struggled in the second Test when they could have ridden the momentum generated in Multan.There is reason to put enough doubts in the Pakistanis minds to not allow them the luxury of feeling at ease. By the same token, there is enough for the Indians to take strength from, and not let their shoulders droop. The playing surface wont be a factor. We have seen two tracks of divergent nature in Multan and Lahore, but neither of them had much of a say in the proceedings. So we can surely take that factor out of the equation.That may sound strange, for the playing surface is a key element in cricket. But, as I said earlier, conventional wisdom has been a bewildered bystander in this series so far. There were many who talked about the toss in Lahore and found Rahul Dravids decision to bat a bit too attacking. To me, it represented a positive mindset. The Indians had floored the Pakistanis in Multan and the manner of victory must have boosted their confidence. Yes, the Indian top-order struggled to make an impact. But the Indian camp would do well to realise the fact that the failure of the top order in one match should have no bearing on the positive mindset the Indians have acquired. The plan in Lahore was to stay at the wicket  knowing that the track will ease out after a couple of sessions  and bat Pakistan out of the match. They showed heart in assessing that the team was good enough to face the bowling and come out on top. The start of Sehwags innings was no different from what he did in Multan, and Yuvrajs century was another proof that there was nothing wrong with the decision. The Indian camp will be better off concentrating on how not to let it happen again instead of going on the defensive. If they get defensive, they would begin to lose the competitive edge they have acquired in the recent past and which is based so heavily on a positive mindset and self-belief. With Sourav Ganguly back in the side, I guess it would be more positive and not less. Gangulys return has caused a selection problem for the Indians, but these are the kind of problems one rather enjoys. The side with stronger nerves would be the one making it big. Copyright

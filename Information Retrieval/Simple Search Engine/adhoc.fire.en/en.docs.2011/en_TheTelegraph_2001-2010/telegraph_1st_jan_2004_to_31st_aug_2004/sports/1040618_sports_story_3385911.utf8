Harbhajan working on the magic ball 
- Offie looks forward to Asia Cup, after six-month lay-off
 Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble at the fitness camp in Bangalore on Thursday. (AFP) Bangalore: After an injury-induced lay-off of six months, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh declared on Thursday that he was 200 per cent fit and working on a magic ball that would take his opponents by surprise. I have been working on a magic ball. I wont tell you (anymore on that). You will see it definitely... It is going to be a surprise, he said here on the sidelines of the fitness camp for Asia Cup probables. Harbhajan said he had been engaged in a rehabilitation programme suggested by physio Andrew Leipus and doctors to strengthen his spinning finger and now he was 200 per cent fit. I have started bowling since the last one month or so. I am feeling confident the way its going. I have been working on fitness. Lets see how it works. I just cant wait getting into the middle. I am waiting for the matches to start, he said. Harbhajan said every single match he had to sit out because of injury was frustrating. Not only Pakistan tour. Australia was the most frustrating. I wanted to do well there. Unfortunately, I could not play the full series. I just played one Test and got injured, he said. It was frustrating to sit out and watch. But whatever has happened has happened. I just want to continue with fitness and hard work. I am looking forward to Asia Cup and Tests, Harbhajan said. Asked if he felt he had justified the expectations reposed on him after the 2001 series against Australia when he tormented Aussie batsmen and took 32 wickets, Harbhajan said: After the Australia series, I was No. 2 bowler in the world continuously for two years. I had taken 63 wickets in one season and 64 wickets in the next season which is good, he said but added that now he would have to start from scratch again. Now I have to start everything again. More like an under-19 boy, who wants to play for India. Whatever I had done, thats gone. Now I have to start my career again, and hopefully do the same thing as I had been doing for the country (before the injury). On Team India captain Sourav Gangulys comment that he was keen to see Harbhajan fit before the series against Australia, the spinner said it was a matter of pride for him that the captain wanted him in the team.

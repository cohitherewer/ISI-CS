The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Boro win a step towards progress
Cardiff: The result of this seasons League Cup final could be the making of Middlesbrough. The north-east club won 2-1 at the Millennium Stadium on Sunday to lift the first major trophy in their 128-year history and book a place in the Uefa Cup next season. I said to the chairman (Steve Gibson), to go to the next level you have to win things, Boro manager Steve McClaren recalled saying at the start of his reign at the club in 2001. We cant stand still, we need to progress and this victory is a great stepping stone to do that, added the coach who made his name as Alex Fergusons No. 2 at Manchester United. McClaren singled out his captain Gareth Southgate, one of his first signings, for special praise, calling the England central defender who won the same trophy with Aston Villa in 1996 his talisman. Now its down to us to take it a stage further, Southgate agreed. I said before the game, winning would raise the expectations of the club. We are now a team thats won a trophy and weve qualified for Europe. Now players coming will have to raise the performance of the club to be the best Middlesbrough team ever, to enable us to go a step further. Brazils Juninho, winning his first trophy with Middlesbrough after being on the losing side in the 1997 League and FA Cup finals in his first spell with the club, also sees them building on the success with largely the same squad of players. I think we have enough experienced players, most of them have played in Europe. The pressure is off now that Middlesbrough have achieved their objective by winning a trophy... Its all in our favour to go upwards now. Striker Joseph-Desire Job, who scored the first goal and was fouled for the penalty from which Boudewijn Zenden scored Middlesbroughs second, epitomises the progress players have made at Middlesbrough under McClaren. The first year I was struggling a bit but once he came here he gave players a chance so I really wanted to thank him for that trust, said Job. Bolton, for all the gifts of their leading players like Jay Jay Okocha and Youri Djorkaeff, missed out on a first major trophy since the 1958 FA Cup and are left with mid-table mediocrity in the Premier League, or worse. Manager Sam Allardyce was gutted to have come away empty-handed and had to watch McClaren rather than himself become to first English manager to lift one of the major trophies since 1996. Weve got absolutely nothing out of it... well just have to try and get back another time and turn the corner, Allardyce said. Boltons Brazilian defender Emerson Thome was left to contemplate the job that remains to be done this season. Theres still 12 games to go in the Premiership and we still have a job to do, he said. This seasons been very good for the club and we just need to regroup... and keep the club safe from dropping down into the relegation places but I dont think this will happen this year, we have a very good group of players.

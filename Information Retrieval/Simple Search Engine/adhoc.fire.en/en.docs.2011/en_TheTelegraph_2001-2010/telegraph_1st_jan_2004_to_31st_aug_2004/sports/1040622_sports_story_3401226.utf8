The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sweden out to clip Denmarks wings
 - Larsson amp; Co. call the idea of Scandinavian conspiracy Machiavellian  The unpredictable genius of Zlatan Ibrahimovic is Swedens biggest asset Porto: Denmarks fine wing play and Swedens gifted strikers should determine the result of the Euro 2004 group C decider on Tuesday being played in the rarefied atmosphere of Italian-generated conspiracy theories. The Swedes fear Denmarks unusual style for a Scandinavian team with Jesper Gronkjaer and Martin Joergensen switching wings, and surprise ploys at set pieces. But they believe strongly in the capacity for a surprise of their own from pedigree striker Henrik Larsson and the unpredictable genius of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored a brilliant late equaliser against Italy on Friday. Swedens 1-1 draw with the Italians left them and Denmark, who beat Bulgaria 2-0, top of the group with four points each. Italy have two and Bulgaria none. Italians are worried that Denmark and Sweden could end up with a draw of 2-2 or more that, assuming Italy beat Bulgaria, would leave all three on five points and knock Italy out on goals scored. Denmark drew 0-0 with Italy on Monday. The Swedes called the idea of a Scandinavian conspiracy Machiavellian. Were just going to go out there to try and do our best to win, Larsson said on Sunday. Swedens scout Benny Lennartsson, a key associate of joint coaches Lars Lagerback and Tommy Soderberg, thinks Denmark are the best team in the group. The Danes are very dangerous coming inside with Gronkjaer and Joergensen. We are wary of their switch play which is not typical of the Nordic countries, he said. I cant see any better wing play in the tournament apart perhaps from Spain with Vicente and (Joseba) Etxeberria. Ibrahimovic, however, can do the unexpected. Zlatan scores like (Netherlands striker Ruud) Van Nistelrooy, out of nothing. I dont see the Danes scoring out of nothing. Sweden are still without injured right back Teddy Lucic, so midfielder Mikael Nilsson will probably continue in defence with Christian Wilhelmsson remaining on the right of midfield. Midfielder Tobias Linderoth is suspended and Kim Kallstrom, who came on against Bulgaria and Italy, is the likely replacement. Otherwise, they will probably start with the team that took the field against the Italians. Denmark could use Gronkjaer from the start for Dennis Rommedahl. Gronkjaer, just back with the squad after the death of his mother and short of practice, had to come on sooner than planned against Bulgaria because Rommedahl was injured but maintained the pace and scored a good stoppage-time goal.

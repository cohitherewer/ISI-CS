 I need more control: Pathan
 Irfan Pathan being felicitated in Ahmedabad on Thursday. (PTI) Ahmedabad: Irfan Pathan has put on hold his aspirations of becoming an allrounder. He wants to concentrate on improving his bowling right now. Though with a few confident scores including a resilient 49 in the Lahore Test under his belt, Pathan would rather work on acquiring more control in his bowling. One has to keep improving in the game. I need more control in my bowling... I have a lot to learn in this area, he said. I have got a chance in the Indian team as a bowler and I have to play as a bowler. Presently, I am not thinking much on the lines of being an allrounder, Pathan said on the sidelines of a function organised by the Gujarat Cricket Association to felicitate him and Parthiv Patel on Wednesday night at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera. Whenever I get time in the nets I do practice batting and even devote extra time to it sometimes. But I am focussing more on bowling, he said. The 19-year-old seamer added that if he started playing regularly for India, he would nurture his batting abilities. Pathan attributed his good show against Pakistan to the immense confidence he gained by playing against Australia on his debut series. Australia series helped me a lot. I was lucky that my first tour was against the world champions. I got a lot of experience there and the confidence I gained sustained me on the Pakistan tour, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

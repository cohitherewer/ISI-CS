		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
 Czech javelin thrower Jan Zelezny announced on Sunday an end to his sparkling career after a disappointing ninth place in Athens, his fifth Olympic Games. Zelezny, 38, said: I may take part in several exhibitions or smaller events but the world championship or even the Olympic Games, that is not for me.				 																																	In Athens, Zelezny was seeking a fourth successive Olympic gold and fifth successive Olympic medal, but finished ninth with 80.59 metres, lagging well behind his season best of 86.12. I enjoyed many successes in my career so I feel rather sorry for my team about the ninth place, Zelezny said.  Hundreds of thousands of Olympic athletes and visitors began what Greek media termed the Great Escape from Athens on Monday, an exodus that has so far run as smoothly as the Games themselves.				 																																	After a spectacular closing ceremony on Sunday night, up to 200,000 visitors were set to leave for overseas destinations by late Tuesday.				 																																	Thousands of Athenians who delayed summer holidays until the end of the Games were also expected to head for the beaches of the Greek islands and to family reunions across the country. 				 																																	Greek media said the Great Escape is the biggest mass departure Athens has had to handle.				 																																	On Monday alone, about 70,000 athletes, officials and foreign visitors will board 900 flights, and almost as many will leave on Tuesday. A US Olympic volleyball player was arrested and charged with hitting a pregnant woman during a scuffle in Athens on Monday, a judicial source said. Clayton Stanley, 26, was also charged with resisting arrest, the source said. Police said Stanley got into a scuffle with a motorcyclist early on Monday morning in a central square and during the argument he allegedly hit the drivers eight months pregnant wife, who was riding pillion. He was charged with causing unprovoked serious bodily harm to the woman, resisting arrest and causing bodily harm to the police officers who tried to arrest him. 				 																																	He was taken for an immediate hearing at a court of first instance, where he can ask for a postponement to prepare his defence.  Greek sprinter Costas Kenteris did not know he was expected for a doping test, his lawyer said after the disgraced athlete testified to a public prosecutor probing a scandal that rocked Greece on the eve of the Games.He met with a great number of Greek and foreign sports officials and no one informed him that he was called to take a doping test. No one, not one of them, his lawyer Mihalis Dimitrakopoulos said on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Parthiv gets away with 60 per cent match fee penalty only
 - Team India keepers track record influences Madugalle as also Dravids attitude; Poor umpiring on Day II  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Lahore: Taking a somewhat lenient view, given that Parthiv Patel hadnt been booked before, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle just docked 60 per cent of the Team India wicketkeepers match fee for a Level 2 offence under the International Cricket Councils Code of Conduct. Under the provisions, besides a monetary penalty, Match Referees are empowered to ban the offender for one Test or two ODIs. According to The Telegraphs sources, the hearing was called (late on Tuesday) after all three umpires  Steve Bucknor and Simon Taufel on the field, plus Nadeem Ghauri complained against Patels use of an expletive when Inzamam-ul Haq wasnt given out caught-behind off Lakshmipathy Balaji. The call was Bucknors. Apparently, Patel muttered ******* hell when that appeal was turned down. At the 45-minute disciplinary hearing, in a boardroom at the Pearl Continental, the wicketkeeper is understood to have apologised for that objectionable remark. Moreover, he maintained it wasnt addressed to Bucknor. Madugalle accepted that. One learns that Rahul Dravids co-operative attitude also influenced the Match Referee. Incidentally, at the outset itself, the stand-in captain pleaded: Do anything, but please dont ban Patel. If you do, Ill have to keep in the next Test! Besides the umpires, Patel and Dravid, the hearing was attended by manager Prof. Ratnakar Shetty. Madugalle, it may be recalled, fined Moin Khan 75 per cent of his match fee in the Multan Test. Sources informed that the Match Referee extended the hearing by about ten minutes so that Patel understood why he was being fined and, more important, appreciated the manner in which he ought to be behaving specially as the stump mikes pick up everything. Meanwhile, the Indians (with good reason) are quite cut up with Messrs Bucknor and Taufel. Both Inzamam and Yusuf Youhana benefited from dubious decisions  more than once at that  on the second day of the Gaddafi Test.  Copyright

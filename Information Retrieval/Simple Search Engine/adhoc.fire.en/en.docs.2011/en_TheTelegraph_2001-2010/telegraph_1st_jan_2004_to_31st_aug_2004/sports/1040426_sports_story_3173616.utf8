(Reuters) London: Arsenal wrapped up their 13th English title with four games to spare after a 2-2 draw with north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Needing only a point to secure the title, Arsenal laid down a perfect foundation with a delightful first-half display, capped by exhilarating goals from French stars Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires. But they were tested by a determined Spurs fightback in the second half and after Jamie Redknapp had scored his first Premiership goal of the season, Robbie Keane converted a stoppage time penalty to snatch a much-needed point for the home side. The draw meant Arsenals multitalented, multinational generation of 2003-04 emulated the achievement of the legendary 1971 double winning side, who also clinched their championship at the ground of their nearest and fiercest rivals. Keanes late penalty, conceded after he was manhandled by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, took some of the edge off the celebrations. But it was still an afternoon to savour for an Arsenal side who have displayed remarkable mental strength and determination this season to bounce back from the trauma of the late collapse which saw them gift the 2002-03 title to Manchester United. The title is the third Arsenal have won in eight seasons under the shrewd guidance of their manager, Arsene Wenger. Wengers previous Premiership triumphs were achieved in seasons  1997-98 and 2001-02  in which Arsenal also won the FA Cup. The current side still has a chance to earn a place in history by becoming the first English top flight side to go through an entire season unbeaten since Preston North End achieved that feat in a 12-team first division in 1888-89.Sundays draw extended Arsenals unbeaten run since the start of the league campaign to 34 games. Chelseas defeat at Newcastle earlier in the afternoon meant Wengers side kicked off needing only a point to move beyond the reach of their London rivals. (AFP)  Copyright

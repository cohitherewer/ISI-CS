The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Justine pulls out of Big W
 Justines pull-out was under physicians strict order Brussels: World No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne will miss the Wimbledon championships later this month. I am sad and disappointed to announce that I will not be able to participate in Wimbledon this year, the Australian Open champion said in a statement on Tuesday. Question marks over the Belgians health were raised after she was knocked out in the second round of the French Open last month. Before arriving in Paris to defend her Roland Garros crown, Henin-Hardenne had not played a tournament since early April having suffered from a viral infection. My physicians have given me strict orders that several more weeks of rest are necessary to ensure a full recovery, Henin-Hardenne said. Since the day I walked off the court after the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year, I have been looking forward to competing on the grass again. Unfortunately, my dream of holding the Wimbledon trophy must wait another year. I look forward to an early and complete recovery. Kim may skip US Open Her fellow Belgian, world No. 2 Kim Clijsters, withdrew from the tournament on Monday with a wrist injury. She will have surgery to remove a cyst on her left wrist and could miss the US Open too, the Belgian said on her official website. No date was given for the surgery but Clijsters expects to be sidelined for the next three months, which would rule her out of the US Open starting on August 30. This is not really a great birthday... I have to be operated on on that cyst, that is a fact now, said Clijsters, who turned 21 on Tuesday. (Reuters)  Copyright

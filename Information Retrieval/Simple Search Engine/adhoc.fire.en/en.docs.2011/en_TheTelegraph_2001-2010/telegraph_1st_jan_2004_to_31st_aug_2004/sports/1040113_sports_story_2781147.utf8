The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Now the McEnroe confession
 - Close on the heels of the Rusedski controversy...  Sydney: John McEnroe has reportedly admitted  he unknowingly took steroids during his tennis career. For  six years I was unaware I was being given a form of steroid  of the legal kind they used to give horses until they decided  it was too strong even for horses, McEnroe was quoted as  saying in the Daily Telegraph newspaper in Sydney  on Monday.  McEnroe, 43, did not say who gave him the steroids  or for what reason. The three-time Wimbledon champions admission followed revelations by Greg Rusedski that he tested positive to nandrolone last July. The Canadian-born British player said he was innocent and the steroid must have been contained in supplements dispensed by ATP Tour trainers. McEnroe said the Rusedski case and the handling of other recent doping cases showed tennis hierarchy needed an overhaul. McEnroe was implicated in a doping scandal two years ago when his former wife Tatum ONeil claimed the former No. 1 had used steroids late in his career. Mcenroe later called Tatums statements ridiculous.  Drug testing in tennis started in the late 1980s,  conducted by the Mens International Professional Tennis  Council. The testing at that time was for recreational drugs  only and not for those that were considered performance-  enhancing. (agencies)  Copyright

 A fusion of football styles on cards 
	 - Italy are favourites but it remains to be seen if they are relaxed, says Danish defender Thomas Helveg  Italys (from left) Christian Vieri, Alessandro del Piero, Stefano Fiore, Francesco Totti and Cristiano Zanetti during training at the Afonso Enrique Stadium in Guimaraes on Sunday. (AFP) Lisbon: Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni expects Mondays group C opener against Denmark to be a fusion of football styles rather than a culture clash. The Italians, known for tight defence and short passing, have successfully introduced a swifter approach under the 64-year-old, while he says Denmark have more than just the typical Scandinavian attributes of hard work and long balls. The Danes have a Nordic mentality and many of the qualities associated with Scandinavian teams throughout the years but they have also got a Latin touch, Trapattoni said this week. They have learnt from other countries and they have a lot of players who have played elsewhere in Europe and they bring in another influence. Indeed four of the likely Danish starting line-up have experience of Italys Serie A with Inter Milans Thomas Helveg at right back, Udineses Martin Jorgensen in midfield and AC Milan forward Jon Dahl Tomasson up front as well as former Milan and Verona defender Martin Laursen. Italy start as favourites for the opener after finishing runners-up four years ago in Belgium and the Netherlands when they were unbeaten in normal time throughout the tournament before falling to a French golden goal in the final. The Azzurris won the European championship on home soil in 1968 but the Danes have more recent memories of success, having triumphed against all expectations in 1992. Italy are notoriously slow starters in tournaments. Those psychological weaknesses, evident in Italys early exit from the World Cup at the hands of South Korea two years ago, give Helveg hope of a surprise result. Italy are favourites but it remains to be seen if they are relaxed because it is not enough to be in ideal shape and form, to win  you also need to have your head right as well as some luck, said the Danish defender. Trapattonis starting line-up has been virtually settled for weeks with Argentine-born Mauro Camoranesi expected to start on the right flank with Alessandro del Piero on the left and Francesco Totti playing behind target-man Christian Vieri. Denmark will be missing experienced duo Thomas Gravesen and Jesper Gronkjaer. Midfielder Gravesen is suspended, while Chelsea winger Gronkjaer is at home in Denmark after the death of his mother on Thursday.

 Bhupathi, Paes in quarters
 Andre Agassi after defeating Thomas Johansson 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 at the Cincinnati Masters on Wednesday. (AFP) New Delhi: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi clinched a thrilling three-set victory over Leos Friedel and Frantisec Cermak of the Czech Republic to advance to the quarter finals of the $2.4 million ATP Cincinnati Masters on Thursday. The eighth seeded Indians overcame a first set loss and a break down in the decider to win 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 in a second round match. Up 5-4 in the third set and serving for the match, Cermak and Frantisec cracked under pressure while the Indian Express pounced on the opportunity to break back and even the scores. Bhupathi then won his next service game on love, finishing it with an ace, to go up 6-5. The Indians broke once more in the next game to seal the match. On Wednesday, Andre Agassi continued to confound those who believe his 18-year career is almost over, by beating former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson to reach the last 16 of the Masters Series on Wednesday. The American showed a fair deal of patience to register a 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 success in a match completed close to midnight after an hour-long rain delay. In other matches, Britains Greg Rusedski rallied to defeat French Open champion Gaston Gaudio 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, Marat Safin eased past Jeff Morrison 6-4, 6-4 and Spaniard Tommy Robredo upset his seventh seeded compatriot Juan Carlos Ferrero 7-6, 4-6, 6-4. Fifth-seeded Briton Tim Henman rallied past Moroccan Hicham Arazi 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. Defending champion Andy Roddick beat Germanys Nicolas Kiefer for the third time in ten days. The second-seeded American next plays Paradorn Srichaphan, the 15th seed, a 6-3, 6-4 winner over Sjeng Schalken. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

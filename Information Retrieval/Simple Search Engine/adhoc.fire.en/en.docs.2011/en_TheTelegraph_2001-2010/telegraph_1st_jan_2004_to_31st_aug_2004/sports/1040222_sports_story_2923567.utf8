 Tolly to lodge complaint
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Feb. 21: Tollygunge Agragami are set to lodge an official protest against Churchill Brothers for playing Somathai Shaiza on Saturday. Following their loss against the Goan team, Tollygunge Agragami secretary Montu Ghosh said: Shaiza was taken on lien by Churchill Brothers from Mohun Bagan during the 2003-04 season. But Churchill couldnt have taken him from Bagan, as he was not a registered player of the team. Tollygunge Agragami may face a players mutiny in the near future. Some of the seniors alleged that the coach is not fielding them following the pressure from some officials. Lawrence buried Nigerian footballer Lawrence Enyilord was on Saturday laid to rest at a city cemetery. Earlier, accompanied by around 50 footballers and friends the coffin bearing his body was carried to the Assembly of God Church where a funeral service was held. Bernard Operanozie, Christopher Kem, Jeremaya, Habib Adekunle and Mike Okoro were among others present.  Copyright

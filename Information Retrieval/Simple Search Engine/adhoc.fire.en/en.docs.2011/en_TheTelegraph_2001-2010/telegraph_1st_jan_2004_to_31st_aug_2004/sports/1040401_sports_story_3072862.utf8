The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer to miss 2nd Test
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Multan: Left-arm quick Zaheer Khan, suspected to have had a recurrence of the hamstring problem which made him miss so much of the action in Australia, is out of the second Test. He has become casualty No. 2, after regular captain Sourav Ganguly. Unlike Sourav, though, Zaheer (who didnt bowl in the second innings) isnt going home to consult specialists  not now, at least. An MRI will be done in Lahore on Friday morning, after which the picture is going to be clear, informed manager Prof. Ratnakar Shetty. According to The Telegraphs sources, no replacement is being called for as Ajit Agarkar is already in the squad. The second Test, in Lahore, begins on April 5. As announced, Sourav will leave for Lahore (en route to New Delhi and Calcutta) on Thursday morning. Incidentally, in a nice gesture, Imran Khan recommended Dr Amir Azizs name to Sourav, once he learnt that a top orthopaedic specialist was being sought. Dr Aziz is based in Lahore. Sourav, however, has decided to only consult known doctors in Calcutta. Heavy fine on Moin Meanwhile, former captain Moin Khan has been fined 75 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent on being given out leg-before by Simon Taufel. The hearing, with Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle in the chair, was held at the team hotel late on Wednesday.  Copyright

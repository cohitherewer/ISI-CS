The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak XI lose tie, win hearts
 - India and Pakistan must play against each other more often: Anwar  FROM GAJINDER SINGH  Saeed Anwar leaves the ground in Patiala on Thursday. (Reuters) Patiala: They came, they played and won the hearts of thousands of people. Every run that the men in green scored was greeted with cheers. Every boundary was welcomed with applause that this tiny city has never witnessed before. Even the historic stadium clock, which had stopped functioning during Partition, suddenly began chiming. Touted as a Friendship Match, a Pakistan Invitation XI, led by former Test cricketer Ijaz Ahmed and featuring stars such as Saeed Anwar, Mushtaq Mohammad and Manzoor Elahi, arrived here Thursday to play against Punjab Chief Ministers XI. The Dhruv Pandove Stadium was dressed up for the occasion. We are here to entertain. We have come here as a gesture of goodwill and love. Winning or losing doesnt matter. We want to win the hearts of the people and assure everybody that the Indian team would be welcomed in every house in Pakistan, Ijaz said to loud cheers from the stand. All roads to the stadium were blocked with traffic since morning as people, dressed in their best, turned up at the stadium. It was a riot of colours. The district administration, as a gesture of goodwill, had declared free entry. The atmosphere was electric. Young and old jostled for a glimpse of the stars. Saeed Anwar, who incidentally scored a duck, got a rousing welcome. I never expected this kind of reaction, he later admitted. That the Indian team won by eight wickets with Dinesh Mongia scoring 108 and Ajay Jadeja enthralling the spectators by a scintillating 67 not out, was just an aside meant for the record books. Mohinder Amarnath, who led the Indian side, said it was a great occasion for the country. This is really the feel good factor that the country is talking about these days, he said, adding that todays game would send the right feelers not only in India but Pakistan as well. Saeed Anwar regretted that India and Pakistan had not played much cricket. The ill-will must end. Both nations must realise that the more they play against each other the more they involve the people. Peoples participation will help remove the ill-wills, he said. The Pakistani team, despite losing the game, did a lap of honour, waving hands towards the stands. The thunderous applause the gesture earned was electrifying. Ashraf Ali said he would never forget the experience. We came here with a message. We will go back carrying thousands of messages, he said. For Zubed Hayat, the trip had been an eye-opener. It is a very moving experience. I do not have words to describe my feelings, was all he managed to say. Even after the award ceremony was over, the Pakistani cricketers kept discussing their interaction with the spectators. The one on the fine-leg boundary was the loudest. He kept on shouting why we are still separated, said Shakeel Khan. For the record, while the Pakistanis after winning the toss scored 243 for 7 in 45 overs, the Indian XI replied with 245 for 2.

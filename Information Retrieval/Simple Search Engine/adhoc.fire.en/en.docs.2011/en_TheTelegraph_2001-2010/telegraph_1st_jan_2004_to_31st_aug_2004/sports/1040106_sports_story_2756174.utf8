 Cruzeiro bring Rivaldo back home to Brazil
 Rio de Janeiro: World Cup winner Rivaldo has  ended speculation about his future by joining Brazilian  champions Cruzeiro. Cruzeiro said on their official website  on Monday that the former Deportivo La Coruna, Barcelona  and AC Milan striker had signed a one-year contract which  brings him home after seven years in European club football.  The Foxes, who are based in Brazils city of Belo  Horizonte, said a local pharmaceutical company was helping  to sponsor the signing of the 31-tyear-old who spent most  of the last 18 months warming the substitutes bench at  AC Milan. Rivaldos signing is a tremendous boost for Brazilian domestic football which has become used to seeing nearly all of its top players depart for wealthier European clubs. Brazilian media said the deal was settled at a meeting on Sunday involving Cruzeiro coach Wanderlei Luxemburgo, president Alvimar Perrela and Rivaldos agent Carlos Arini.  The former Fifa World Player of  the Year, who at the weekend was linked with a move to Saudi  club Al Ittihad, had been a free agent since last month.  (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Russia set up US tie-break
Perth: Marat Safin muscled his way past Jiri Novak 6-7, 7-6, 6-3 on Thursday to give his Russian side victory in their Hopman Cup tie with the Czech Republic. Anastasia Myskina had earlier put the Russians ahead with a 6-3, 7-6 win over the tournaments surprise package Barbora Strycova, before Safin downed Novak. But the 17-year-old Strycova and Novak still had a major part to play at the A$1 million ITF mixed team competition as their 3-6, 7-6, 11-9 super tie-break victory in the mixed doubles left Russia needing a clean sweep against the US on Friday. In fact, Safin and Myskina can now not afford to lose a set against Lindsay Davenport and James Blake if they are to pip the Americans into Saturdays final and a clash with Australia. In later action, Australia lost 1-2 to Slovakia after Alicia Molik quit her singles and decided not to play in the mixed when she had a scare with an old foot injury. Molik retired leading Daniela Hantuchova 6-3, 3-0 when she felt the warning signs. Tournament director Paul McNamee said the player had decided to rest so she would be ready for Saturdays final. However, Lleyton Hewitt continued his winning run this year by beating Karol Kucera 6-2, 6-7, 6-3. (Reuters)  Copyright

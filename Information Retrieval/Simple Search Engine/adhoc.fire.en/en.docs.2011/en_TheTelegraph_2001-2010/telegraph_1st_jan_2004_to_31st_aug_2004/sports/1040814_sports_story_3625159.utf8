The Telegraph - Calcutta
 One-shot lead for Darren Clarke
	 - US PGA championship  Fijis Vijai Singh walks to the 14th tee in Wisconsin on Thursday. (Reuters) Kohler (Wisconsin): Britains Darren Clarke birdied the first four holes on his way to a one-shot lead in the US PGA Championship first round on Thursday while Tiger Woods struggled to a three-over-par 75. Clarke, who had described the 7,514-yard Whistling Straits layout as brutally difficult, took advantage of surprisingly calm conditions and a favourable course set-up to fire a course-record 65, seven under. Helped by a red-hot putter, the Northern Irishman reeled off nine birdies in all, plus bogeys on nine and 13, to forge clear of the chasing pack. I didnt expect to play this well but I was very pleased to get off to such a good start, said Clarke, who missed the cut in five of his previous six US PGA Championships. World number two Ernie Els and American Justin Leonard, who won the 1997 British Open, carded matching 66s. Fijis Vijai Singh, the 1998 US PGA champion, Briton Luke Donald and Americans Scott Verplank and Briny Baird opened with 67s. South African Els, who could replace Woods at the top of the world rankings if he wins the tournament, mixed seven birdies with a bogey while Leonard finished in style, picking up five shots in the last nine holes. Its a good start, but theres a lot of guys that have played well today, said three-time major winner Els after a day of hazy sunshine and occasional light rain. Among the bigger names, US Masters champion Phil Mickelson fired a 69, British Open winner Todd Hamilton a 72 and Spaniard Sergio Garcia and Canadas Mike Weir 73s. But Woods, under pressure to end a run of nine majors without victory, battled for consistency and accuracy and struggled on the greens. I didnt hit the ball all that poorly, but I sure putted bad, said the 1999 and 2000 PGA champion after ending the day in a tie for 105th.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

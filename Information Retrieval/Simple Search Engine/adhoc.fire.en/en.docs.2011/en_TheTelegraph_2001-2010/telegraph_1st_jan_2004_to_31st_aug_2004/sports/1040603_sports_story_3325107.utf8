The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shukla for neutral umpires
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Laxmi Ratan Shukla, selected to represent Bengal in the Ranji Trophy captains summit in Mumbai on Friday, will put forward that neutral umpires should be made mandatory in all matches. Shukla pointed out that North Zone umpire Jasbeer Singh officiated in the Duleep Trophy final between East and North last season. Not that we didnt agree with any of his decisions. Still, we must have neutral umpires so that nobody gets a chance to raise a finger, said the allrounder on Wednesday. Shukla will also suggest that Bengals Ranji Trophy matches be scheduled in the second half of November, since the players hardly get to train outdoors for almost the whole of October.  Copyright

 Azhar wont get BCCI pension
New Delhi: Mohammad Azharuddin, who is in dispute with the board and has been banned for life, wont be eligible for BCCIs monthly pension of Rs 5,000 for life starting from this month. Azharuddin has been barred from the list, which includes all 174 Test players and umpires who have officiated in Test matches. Overall the board would be spending in excess of Rs 1 crore per year as part of its platinum jubilee celebrations. The cheques to these beneficiaries will be delivered on April 30. The list, however, does not include cricketers who have represented India in one-day Internationals alone, such as Reetinder Singh Sodhi or Ramesh Powar.  (PTI)  Copyright

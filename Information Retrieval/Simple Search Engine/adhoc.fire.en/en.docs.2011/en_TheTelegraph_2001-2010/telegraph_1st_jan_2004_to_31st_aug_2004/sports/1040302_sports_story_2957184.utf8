The Telegraph - Calcutta
Well follow horses for courses, says Bari
 Bari says someone not in the national camp may also be picked Islamabad: Pakistan would follow a horses for courses policy while naming the 14-member squad for the one-day International series against India, chief selector Wasim Bari has said. According to Bari, a player could be picked for the five-match series against India even if he has not been selected for the ongoing conditioning camp in Lahore, being attended by 22 probables. It is not necessary that we restrict our selection to only those who are in the camp. We are also watching players who are performing well in domestic cricket. We will basically follow a horses for courses policy, Bari was quoted as saying by media on Monday. That means veteran fast bowler and ex-captain Waqar Younis, who is not among the probables, could still be picked for the series starting in Karachi on March 13. The team for the first two ODIs will be picked on Friday. On the same day (March 5), we will announce the teams for the warm-up game against India (in Lahore on March 11) and Pakistans practice match (on March 10 in Karachi), Bari said. The chief selector also sought to play down the controversy surrounding his differences with coach Javed Miandad on hiring a professional trainer. There is an impression being created that I and Javed have different views on having a physical trainer for the Pakistan team, he said. We agree there is the need for a physical trainer but Javed just feels there is little time now left to bring one before the India series, Bari said. Miandad has already rejected the idea and he has the backing of Imran Khan, who feels it is for the players themselves to maintain their fitness. Reports here said Bari and Miandad have been warned by PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan to refrain from making public statements which would give the impression they were operating on different wave-lengths. Bari said there was nothing wrong if he and Miandad had different views on some matters relating to cricket. It is my personal opinion that we do need a physical trainer even now. But the final decision rests with the PCB. Bari said he was satisfied with the training and preparations at the national camp in Lahore. We will all be having a meeting with the chairman on Monday in Lahore to discuss the final phase of preparation, Bari said, adding that the meeting would be attended by the selectors, captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Miandad, manager Haroon Rashid and chief executive Rameez Raja. PCB, ad firm in row Meanwhile, the PCB and countrys top advertising agency Interflow communications are locked in a legal battle over the rights to hold promotional activities of the Indian cricket team, adds a report from Lahore. Interflow signed a contract with the PCB last year enabling them to hold off-field promotional activities of the Indian team from their landing to departure for a sum of Rs 30 lakh. But that contract has been jeopardised after a revamp of the PCB three months ago. The company has sued the PCB over their rights and the matter is in the Sindh high court.  (PTI)  Copyright

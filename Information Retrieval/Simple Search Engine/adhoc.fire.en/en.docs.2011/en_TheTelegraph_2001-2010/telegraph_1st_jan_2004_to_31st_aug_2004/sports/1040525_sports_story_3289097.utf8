 Real Madrid sack Carlos Queiroz
 - Camacho given job of restoring glory days  This will be Camachos second stint as Real coach Madrid: Real Madrid president Florentino Perez announced on Monday that coach Carlos Queiroz had been dismissed and will be replaced next season by former Spanish national coach Jose Antonio Camacho. Queiroz joined Real last summer, after being the assistant of Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, but the Spanish giants finished this season without a trophy for the first time in five years. Perez had few of the consoling words normally uttered in praise of departing coaches. If you ask me whether we made a mistake contracting Queiroz, than I have to admit, we made a mistake, said Perez, with brutal honesty. Its a sad day for us. It was a disappointing end to the season. We are a reference for football around the world and we cannot endure another season like this, added the construction magnate. Camacho, capped 81 times by Spain, comes to Madrid from the Portuguese side Benfica whom he guided to victory in the Portuguese Cup final two weeks ago. With the signing of (Argentine international defender Walter) Samuel and Camacho, we are opening a new era, added Perez. Perez promised that he would allow Camacho to bring in new blood after Reals demoralising end to the season, which saw them lose a club record five consecutive games in the league. Camacho will be have a large amount of input into new signings. He been a player here, he knows this club and hes got the attitude and authority to make things work, commented Perez. It will be Camachos second stint as coach at Real Madrid. The former Spanish international, who played for Real Madrid for 16 seasons between 1973 and 1989, spent 23 days in charge in the summer of 1998 before falling out with former president Lorenzo Sanz. Camacho has been given a contract until the end of June 2006.  (AFP)  Copyright

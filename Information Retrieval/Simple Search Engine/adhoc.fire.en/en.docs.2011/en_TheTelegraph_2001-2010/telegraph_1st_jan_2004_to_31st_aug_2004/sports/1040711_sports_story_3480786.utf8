 No pressure on us: Rajinder 
 The Holland defeats dont unduly concern Dhillon New Delhi, July 10 (PTI): The Indian hockey teams performance may have deteriorated in recent months but coach Rajinder Singh is upbeat about their chances in Athens. There is no pressure on any player or coach. The moral of the team is also high, he said, before departing for Germany early this morning. The Indian team left for Germany on a training-cum-competition tour. India will participate in a four-nation tournament starting July 16 and also play against some European clubs in the tune-up for the Athens Olympics. Apart from India, hosts Germany, France and England will take part in the tournament which will serve as the basis for selection of the final team for the Olympics. The Indian team was sent for a special training to the US last month. But a dismal show in the four-nation event in Holland after the camp resulted in sacking of two members of the teams support staff  assistant coach Harender Singh and goalkeeping coach M.R. Negi. Rajinder, however, was not willing to read much into the defeats in Holland, saying one should not give much importance to them. In modern day hockey any team can beat the other on a given day and hence one should not be overtly worried about the defeats in Holland. Experienced forward Baljit Singh Dhillon was also not prepared to give much importance to the performance in Holland.  We were playing together after a long time and hence the combination could not work properly. But now we will be playing many matches against the club sides and also in the four-nation tournament which will help us get into the rhythm before the Olympics. Star striker Gagan Ajit Singh, however, admitted that the defeats in Holland, where India lost all its matches, had a depressing effect on the members of the team. But after the break and the encouragement received from the IHF president and supporters we are all feeling refreshed and raring to go.  Copyright

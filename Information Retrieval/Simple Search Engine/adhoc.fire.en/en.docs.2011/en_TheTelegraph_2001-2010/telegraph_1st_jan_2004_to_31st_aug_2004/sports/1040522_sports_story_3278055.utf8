The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Why the Bangaloreans heart beats for Calcutta
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Born in Muscat, resident of Bangalore, lives out of a suitcase. Thats Mahesh Bhupathi for you. Now, one may add a fourth point in his CV: heart beats for Calcutta. This eastern state has, of late, seen a lot of the worlds No. 5 doubles player. Be it visiting new tennis academies or meeting corporate bigshots, Bhupathi has not missed a chance of spending time in this state. His latest visit, which ended on Friday evening, spanned three days. A trip to Siliguri  to be chief guest at the launching of Jaidip Mukerjeas Himalayan Tennis Academy  apart, Bhupathi met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, caught up with Sourav Ganguly, called on top officials of Peerless for whom he will soon become a brand ambassador and had meetings at some leading corporate houses as well. Theres something big in the pipeline for Calcutta I cant disclose details yet, but Globosport in collaboration with the state government will organise a big sporting event in the city in 2005, Bhupathi said. He had a very fruitful meeting with the CM (much beyond my expectations) who has promised every kind of cooperation. Most importantly, he will help in mobilising funds which are so crucial for a big event, said Bhupathi. The meeting with the cricket captain, at a city hotel, concerned another sporting project involving Globosport. A lot of work has still to be done on this one, but we are working seriously towards it. But why this special inclination towards Calcutta? Why not? Bhupathi retorted. Firstly I made my Davis Cup debut here... I have been touched by the warmth of this place. Then, this city is full of sporting tradition. The other metros have their share of big events, why should Calcutta be left behind? He has got a point. Barring cricket and the occasional football match, the sports-crazy people of the City of Joy hardly get the chance to soak in live international sport action. But why does Bhupathi have to take time off from his busy schedule to try and set things right? Does it reflect well on the government and our several associations/event managers?  Copyright

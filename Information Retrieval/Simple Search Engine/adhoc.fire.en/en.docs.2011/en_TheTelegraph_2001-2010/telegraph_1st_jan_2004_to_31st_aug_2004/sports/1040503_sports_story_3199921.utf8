 Mbangwa sacked, reinstated
Harare: Former Zimbabwe international Mpumulelo Pommy Mbangwa, covering the Sri Lankan tour as a commentator, was reportedly sacked and reinstated by the chairman of the ZCU marketing committee Ozias Bvute. The incident occurred during the final ODI last Thursday. According to the terms of the ZCU contract with TV company Octagon, Bvute has the power to fire commentators. Bvute told Mbangwa, according to TV personnel present, that he took exception to the latter criticising the Zimbabwe team. Later that day, Mbangwa wanted his dismissal reconsidered and Bvute relented, according to an Octagon senior staff. (AP)  Copyright

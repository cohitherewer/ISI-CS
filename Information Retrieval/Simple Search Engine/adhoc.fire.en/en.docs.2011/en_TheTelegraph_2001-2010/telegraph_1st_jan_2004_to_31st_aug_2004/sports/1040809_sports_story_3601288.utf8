The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB players attend medical
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Eight East Bengal players, including India captain Bhaichung Bhutia, on Sunday attended the medical examinations of the ongoing national camp for the LG Cup in Vietnam and World Cup qualifier versus Japan at home. However, after the first of the two-day medical and physical fitness tests, Jo Paul Ancheri was ruled out for selection. The former skipper suffered an injury on his right knee during a practice session at the SAI Eastern Centre on Friday. Indian team doctor Manab Bhattacharya said that following his MRI scan, Ancheri had no chance of early recovery. Bhattacharya, however, said Bhaichung would be fit in time for upcoming engagements. The India captain twisted his right ankle during East Bengals practice on Friday and has been advised a weeks rest. The joining of East Bengal players assumed significance in the wake of the clubs refusal to release them for the camp. The club insists that the players would be released once their sessions under British physical trainer Peter McKnight end on Wednesday. The probables (32) underwent medical examinations at a city clinic here while another set of physical tests will be conducted under Dr. Vece Paes supervision on Monday. Meanwhile, All India Football Federation secretary Alberto Colaco and four national selectors  Prasun Banerjee, Brahmanand Sankhawalker, Henry Menezes and V.P. Sathyan  are expected to visit the camp on Monday.  Copyright

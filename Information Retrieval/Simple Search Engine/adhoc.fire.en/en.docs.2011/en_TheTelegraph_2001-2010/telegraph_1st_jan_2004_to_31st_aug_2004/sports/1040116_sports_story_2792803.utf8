 EB eye win vs Md. Sp.
 - Bhutia returns after ban, defence remains a problem for holders  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick discusses a point with Cristiano Junior (left) and Alvito DCunha on Thursday. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Not many will give Mohammedan Sporting a chance, but East Bengal are being cautiously optimistic for their National Football League encounter at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. The 1-1 draw against lowly-placed Indian Bank has upset their plans a bit, though, coach Subhas Bhowmick believes they are still very much in the championship race. East Bengal have 15 points from nine games while Mohammedan Sporting have six from as many matches. More than their opponents it is the long list of injured players that is bound to keep Bhowmick worried. Douglas da Silva, Suley Musah, K. Kulothungan, Sur Kumar Singh have all been ruled out because of injury. Dipak Mondal will also have to sit out on Friday because of the red card booking in the previous game. Bhowmick, however, tried to put a brave face. Im not worried about who is available or who is not in the fray. The bottomline is we will play for a win. Despite all the handicaps, it is the arrival of Brazilian Cristiano Junior that has given Bhowmick some hope. Juniors strike rate has been amazing  six goals in six matches. His form has often been able to put to shade the none-too-impressive showing of Bhaichung Bhutia and Mike Okoro. Coach Bhowmick believes scoring is important for the Nigerian to get back into his rhythm. Juniors striking abilities has impressed him but he is yearning for more. Its the job of a striker to score goals and he is just performing his duties. But he shouldnt be just satisfied with what he has achieved and instead aim to score more than one goal in every match, Bhowmick said after practice on Thursday. Bhutia will be back after missing the last game and that will also add some strength to the forwardline. He may operate from a little deep though. Bhowmick is not taking Mohammedan Sporting lightly. They are a very good side and one should not make the mistake of treating them with disdain, he said. For the black-and-white brigade, there have been very few positives to show this season, except for making the Federation Cup title-round. Even the arrival of a new coach in Jamshed Nassiri and technical advisor P.K. Banerjee have not been able to sort out matters. The forwardline has failed to deliver time and again and that has put them in a spot. Added to that has been a almost non-existent midfield and the pressure has been too much for the defenders to tackle. Nigerian Okoli Odafa Onyeke and Chidih Edeh will be in charge upfront and a lot will depend on how they handle pressure and come up against a formidable defence. Dipendu Biswas has been impressive when he has started as a withdrawal centre forward and Mohammedan Sporting may continue with the same approach Friday too.  Copyright

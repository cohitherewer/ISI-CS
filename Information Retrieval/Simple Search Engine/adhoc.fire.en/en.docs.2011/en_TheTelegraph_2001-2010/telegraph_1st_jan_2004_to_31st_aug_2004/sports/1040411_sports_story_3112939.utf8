The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dempo held 
Margao: Dempos title hopes suffered a severe jolt Saturday when they were held goalless by JCT in their National Football League match at the Nehru Stadium, here. Dempo, who had beaten JCT in the first leg, now have collected 32 points from 17 matches, running a distant second from current leaders East Bengals 34 points from 16 matches. JCT remain at sixth place with 26 points from 17 matches. One point of confidence for Dempo is state team Churchill Brothers losing to Mohammedan Sporting, keeping them at third, but down at 29 points from 17 matches. That means Dempos runners-up position isnt threatened, yet. Dempo next will face Mohun Bagan on Tuesday while JCT will host Tollygunge Agragami on Friday. JCT played a cautious game throughout, keeping in mind the fact they were playing an away tie.  (PTI)  Copyright

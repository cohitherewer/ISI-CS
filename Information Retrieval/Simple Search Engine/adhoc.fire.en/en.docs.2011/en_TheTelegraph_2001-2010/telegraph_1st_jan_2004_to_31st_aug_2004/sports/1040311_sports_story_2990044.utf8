 ICC sticks to tough stand
London: A new agreement approved by the ICC Tuesday endorsed Indias stance on touring Pakistan while empowering the world governing body with greater powers to protect international tours. The ICC executive board, which met over the last two days in Auckland approved the future tours programme agreement under which the teams refusing to tour would face a minimum of $ 2 million and a possible suspension from international cricket. But, significantly, the agreement also provides specific conditions under which a country could withdraw from a tour without punishment including safety and security concerns or where a countrys government provided clear direction not to tour. The board also reaffirmed its policy that countries should not be drawn into making political decisions when assessing their future tour commitments. The outcome of the two-day meeting puts the ECB under pressure with regard to a decision on its scheduled tour of Zimbabwe while endorsing Indias inability to honour its commitment to Pakistan due to a government policy in the past. The ICC recognises that in certain circumstances, politicians may exercise their right to use sporting sanctions as a foreign policy tool, ICC president Ehsan Mani said.  (PTI)  Copyright

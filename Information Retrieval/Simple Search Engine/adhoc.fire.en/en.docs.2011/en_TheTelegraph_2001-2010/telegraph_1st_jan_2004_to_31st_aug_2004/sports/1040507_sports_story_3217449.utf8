The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahindra lose 2-4
Dubai: Mahindra United lost 2-4 to Omans Dhofar FC in an exciting AFC Cup match in Salalah, Oman, on Wedensday. In the first leg in Margao, Mahindra had beaten Dhofar 2-1. Trailing 4-0, Mahindra came back strongly in the second half as Felix Aboagoe and Raphael Patron scored one each to narrow the victory margin for the hosts. Some poor decisions by the referee marred Mahindras prospects as the visitors were denied a penalty in the second half. The referee had earlier awarded a dubious penalty to Dhofar FC. The defeat dented Mahindras chances of reaching the quarter finals.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Sacking no solution, says Pratima
New Delhi: Pratima Kumari, who had accused two coaches of conspiring and victimising her, on Wednesday said termination of their services by the government would not help remove the blot on her career. The 28-year-old also said she wanted to meet sports minister Sunil Dutt and apprise him of her plight but that repeated attempts to contact him had gone in vain. They have terminated the services of the two coaches but thats not going to remove the blot on my 10-year career, Pratima said on Wednesday. Now (Leonid) Taranenko will go back to Belarus and (Pal Singh) Sandhu will sit at home, but what do I do? she asked. I want to meet the sports minister and tell him my plight. I have sent him a fax and am trying everyday to contact him for an appointment, but all in vain. If he wont meet me, I will go to the President and the Prime Minister, she added. (PTI)  Copyright

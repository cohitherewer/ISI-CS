The Telegraph - Calcutta
 US set up date with Belarus
 - DAVIS CUP - Roddick surpasses himself with a 152 mph serve  Andy Roddick reacts after clinching the first set against Jonas Bjorkman on Sunday. (Reuters) London: Andy Roddick led the US past Sweden and into a Davis Cup semi-final against newcomers Belarus, while France and Spain set up a meeting between past champions. Roddick hit a record 152 mph ace on the final point of his straight-set victory over Jonas Bjorkman, which gave the Americans a 3-1 edge in the best-of-five series on hardcourts on Sunday. Mardy Fish made the final score 4-1 by beating Thomas Johansson 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. Roddick rallied in a gruelling first set, then wore down a weary Bjorkman to win 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 6-0. Roddick broke his own serving record of 150 mph (241.4 kmph) on match-point, Bjorkman managing to get his return in play but then hit a backhand in the net, giving the Americans victory. Roddick celebrated with one final forehand, throwing his racket to the crowd. He climbed into the stands to trade high-fives with the US team, then returned to the court and took an American flag on a victory lap with his teammates. France advanced 3-2 over Switzerland when Nicolas Escude defeated Michel Kratochvil 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 7-6 (7-6) in the fifth and deciding match (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). It was all the more creditable for Escude who won despite hurting his ankle in the second set. World No. 1 Roger Federer gave the Swiss a chance, winning Sundays first reverse singles match over Arnaud Clement 6-2, 7-5, 6-4. Spains Juan Carlos Ferrero rallied to beat Dutchman Martin Verkerk 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 4-6, 7-5 6-1 in a rematch of the 2003 French Open final, clinching a Davis Cup semi-final berth for Spain. Carlos Moya defeated Sjeng Schalken 6-3, 6-4 for a 4-1 triumph. Belarus completed a 5-0 sweep over Argentina with singles victories on Sunday for Max Mirnyi and Vladimir Voltchkov. Belarus reached their maiden Davis Cup semi-final on Saturday, taking the doubles for an insurmountable 3-0 lead. The United States will host Belarus and Spain host France in the September 24-26 semis. France have won the Davis Cup nine times, most recently in 2001, while Spain were the 2000 champions and 2003 runner-up. The United States have won a record 31 Davis Cup titles, but none since 1995. In Mallorca, Moyas victory was the icing on the cake. But the real work was done by world No. 3 Ferrero, who had a more difficult time than expected. Despite the fact Verkerk had played eight sets in two matches lasting five hours the previous two days, Ferrero was pressed to the limit. The Spaniard had to come from behind to tie Verkerk at 2-2, eking out a 7-5 win in the last set of a four-hour marathon. At Roland Garros, I got my rear end kicked. He (Ferrero) is like a nightmare, Verkerk said. I wanted to show him I can beat him. I think I did that today, almost. Earlier Sunday, Verkerk and John van Lottum won their doubles match, which was washed out on Saturday with Spain leading 2-0. The Dutch came back to defeat Tommy Robredo and Rafael Nadal 2-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. In Lausanne, Escude won 7-6 (3), 6-4, 7-6 (6) and dashed the hopes of the sellout Swiss crowd who had earlier seen Federer bring them back into the competition with victory over Clement. Kratochvil  selected by captain Marc Rosset to play the reverse singles instead of Ivo Heuberger  broke Escude to level the score and take the first set into a tie-break. But Escude was too strong, taking six points in a row on way to winning the set. In the second set Escude had only one break-point and that was the only one he needed. Escude served for the match at 5-3 in the final set, but Kratochvil was not ready to give in. He took the game to love and then held his own serve to even the score again. He had four set-points in the tie-break but was unable to capitalise on them. Escude won on his first match-point.

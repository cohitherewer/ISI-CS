 Britain threaten boycott 
London: Britain would consider pulling out of this years Athens Olympics if the security of their team cannot be guaranteed, British Olympic Association chief Simon Clegg has warned. Last weeks train bombings in Madrid which left more than 200 people dead have raised fears that terrorists may target the Olympics. Clegg said he was prepared to take the ultimate sanction. We will not compromise the security arrangements for our team where we have responsibility for managing that team at the Olympic Games, he told BBC Radio Five Live. If the security situation demanded a change to the position of the BOA with the ultimate sanction of not sending the team to the Games then obviously as a responsible organisation that is something we would have to consider, Clegg said. But I dont envisage that situation to occur. Meanwhile, a record 202 nations, including Iraq and Afghanistan, will send teams to Athens. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 TFA graduate medio Gourmangi Singh Tuesday signed up for Mohun Bagan, but the IFA has made it clear that this signing isnt the final word on the players availability for the club. The state body will forward the issue to the All India Football Federation since Singhs inter-state transfer was after August 16, the last date for inter-state transfers.				 																																																	The problem began when he was approached at the academy by Mohun Bagan and offered money which Singh and Habibur Rehman took. Thereafter, considering the poor administrative condition of the green-maroon club, the two took up a Dempo offer, to which Bagan went to the city civil court.				 																																																	The court has allowed this signing, but Rehman has gone to court again, against this. Singh decided to sign up, but no registration will be done by the IFA before the AIFF clears his case.				 																																																	In another development, Mohammedan Sporting have signed up their first foreigner, Ajayi Michael. The Nigerian stopper used to play for State House Club of Uganda. His international transfer certificate (ITC) came through Tuesday and was signed up, according to a club official.				 																																																	The official said that two more Nigerians ITC was awaited. One is for striker Chukwukere Henry, who used to play for Fleming FC of Lagos, and the other is for Sestus Anyanwu Stanley. 				 																																																	 This years Mir Iqbal Trophy national under-16 meet of the AIFF will have its preliminaries in Bihar. The East Zone comprises Sikkim, Jharkhkand, Bihar, Orissa and Bengal. September will be the month, but the exact dates are yet to be finalised. The final round will be in Goa.

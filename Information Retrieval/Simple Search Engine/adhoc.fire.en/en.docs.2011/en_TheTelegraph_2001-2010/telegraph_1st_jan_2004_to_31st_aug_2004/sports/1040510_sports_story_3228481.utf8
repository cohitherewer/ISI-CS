The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BTA to honour city Davis Cuppers
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Naresh Kumar Calcutta: To commemorate the first anniversary of its coaching programmes, the Bengal Tennis Association (BTA) will organise a felicitation function for all the living Davis Cup players of the city on May 16. The BTA will also show respect to the players who have passed away. The players to be feted are Sumant Mishra, Naresh Kumar, Akhtar Ali, Premjit Lall, Jaidip Mukerjea, Shyam Minotra, Gaurav Mishra, Chiradeep Mukerjea, Zeeshan Ali, Syed Fazaluddin and Leander Paes. We wanted to hold our felicitation programme on May 5, the date on which our tennis programmes commenced, but due to the elections we had to postpone it, a BTA functionary told The Telegraph on Sunday. The association will also remember the services rendered by the late Krishna Prasad, Chiranjiva, Madan Mohan, S.L.R. Sawney and Dilip Bose. It will reflect Bengals heritage in the game, he said. Some of the players invited will be not be present because of personal commitments. Naresh Kumar has already expressed his inability to be there as he is leaving the city on May 14. Also, Gaurav and Chiradeep are abroad and they are unlikely to come, he informed. Invitations, though, have been sent to all.  Leander PaesThe trainees will also get to see these players from close and the promising ones will receive accolades, he said. For our felicitation programme, we have collected some old photographs of the players and we will be showing those photographs and slides through multimedia presentation, he added. Though the BTA Complex was inaugurated on March 21 last year, the coaching programmes started in May. Now we have more than 300 trainees and cannot accommodate more, the functionary informed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Henman swims in unknown territory
 Henman will be making an unexpected quarter final appearance Paris: Tim Henman will go where no Briton has gone in the last 31 years on Tuesday when he takes on Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela in the quarter finals of the French Open. The last cross-Channel invader to reach such heady heights on the slow, red claycourts at Roland Garros was another serve-and-volleyer Roger Taylor who lost to eventual champion Ilie Nastase in 1973. Its all a bit unexpected from the 29-year-old Henman who usually uses the French Open to hone his groundstrokes in preparation for the annual pilgrimage to Wimbledon. But instead of heading home early to open his campaign on the London grasscourts, Henman will be mixing it with the kings of clay, whose season reaches its climax with next Sundays final. Can he take it any further and perish the thought, actually win here? Henman is non-commital. You know, Im playing well, but to talk of winning it is totally the wrong way to approach it, he said after his thrilling come-from-behind, five-set win over the last remaining Frenchman Michael Llodra. If you start thinking down the road, then youre not going to concentrate on your job. So who knows whats going to happen. But I do know that I need to play better on Tuesday. I need to be more committed to my style. Style has always been the problem here, though, for Henman as the last serve-and-volleyer to win the title was Frances Yannick Noah in 1983 when he defeated baseliner Mats Wilander in the final. Since then such attacking greats as Pete Sampras, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg have all tried and failed as Spaniards and South American baseliners have dominated the tournament. Henman is not in their league and there had been question marks over his durability after he arrived in Paris suffering from a mystery virus that left him feeling low on energy. But the way he held together both physically and mentally against Llodra to come from two sets down and win have allayed those fears for the moment. For one hour and 49 minutes, I played the wrong way. Thats not a great sign, but to come through a match like that and find a way to win, I think that is kind of character building, thats for sure. Henman will have one more incentive to reach the last four on Tuesday  to better his grandfather Henry Billington. Billington made the last eight in the French Open back in 1939 as the drums of war beat ever louder in Europe, but he lost in straight sets to Elwood Cooke.  (AFP)  Copyright

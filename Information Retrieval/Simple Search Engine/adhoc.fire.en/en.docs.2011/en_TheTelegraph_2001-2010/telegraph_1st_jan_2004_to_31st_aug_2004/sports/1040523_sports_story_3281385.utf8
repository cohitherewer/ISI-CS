 Trulli races to pole position 
Monaco, May 22 (Reuters): Renaults Jarno Trulli threatened to bring the curtain down on Michael Schumachers record start to the season after blasting to pole position for Sundays showpiece Monaco Grand Prix. Ferraris six-time world champion has won the last five races but he faces a tough fight from fourth place on an unforgiving street circuit . Italian Trulli celebrated his first Formula One pole at the 117th attempt in 1:13.985 seconds, while Briton Jenson Button slotted into second place for BAR. Trulli and Button were also involved in a car crash just minutes after claiming their places. As the pair were driven back to the paddock after completing their laps, a Renault Espace they were passengers in collided with a Renault course car at the Rascasse corner. Trullis Spanish teammate Fernando Alonso will be third on the grid with Michael Schumacher alongside. It will be the first time this season that the German has not been on the front row after four poles in the past five races.  Copyright

China on course for a double 
 Lin Dan of China during the Thomas Cup semi-final match against Lee Hyun-Ii of South Korea in Jakarta on Friday. China won 3-0. (AP) Jakarta: China stayed on course for their first Thomas and Uber Cup double in 14 years on Friday as their mens team romped into the final with a 3-0 blitz of South Korea. Their women had already qualified for the Uber Cup final with an effortless 3-0 victory over Japan. World No. 1 Lin Dan came through a tough opening game to beat top Korean Lee Hyun Il 15-11, 15-2 before Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng, the worlds second-ranked doubles pair, triumphed 15-13, 15-11 against Lee Dong Soo and Kim Dong Moon. Tall left-hander Bao Chunlai, the world No. 4, then battered Shon Seung Mo into submission 15-2, 15-5 with his trademark heavy smashes and pinpoint drops. The mens top seeds, who are all unbeaten here, will face the winner of Fridays hotly anticipated second semi-final, Indonesia against Denmark, for the Thomas Cup on Sunday. It doesnt matter whether its Indonesia or Denmark  well be ready to play them, said Chinas head coach Li Yongbo. China has only won the Thomas Cup four times, which isnt much compared to Indonesia, but hopefully we can win it this time, he added. If you look at the team performing you can see they believe they can win it. Elsewhere, South Koreas coach admitted his womens team have little chance of dislodging Uber Cup champions China and said it was a miracle his players had reached Saturdays final. The South Koreans won a thrilling semi-final against Denmark late on Thursday thanks largely to the heroics of 18-year-old Lee Yun-Hwa, who delivered both a singles and deciding doubles victory after being picked to play twice at the last minute. Lee later insisted she had not felt any pressure despite the big occasion. But coach Kim Joong-Su did not give his team much chance against the mighty Chinese, hot favourites for a fourth consecutive title. We think well lose against China because China are very good, he said. Its a kind of miracle that we even got to this stage. He said he was not sure whether the exhausted Lee would have the energy to play twice again after the marathon five-and-a-half-hour semi. Shes very tired and she might not play twice on Saturday because she cant force herself to play well, Kim said. South Korea start as massive underdogs against red-hot China, who waltzed through to the final without a single player losing. In contrast with South Koreas gruelling semi, China were largely untroubled by Japan on Thursday as the world No. 1 and two singles players Gong Ruina and Zhang Ning, and second-ranked doubles pairing Gao Ling and Huang Sui delivered another clinical victory.

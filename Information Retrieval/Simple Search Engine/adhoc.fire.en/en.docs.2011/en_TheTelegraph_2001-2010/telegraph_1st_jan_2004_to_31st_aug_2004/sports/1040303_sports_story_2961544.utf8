 Pride first, not bonus: Shaharyar
Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is not in favour of introducing performance-based incentives for players for the crucial series against India as it feels national pride and not money should be the motivation for beating the arch-rivals. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said in Karachi the board has no plans to announce incentives as the players are well paid and supposed to do well for the team and country. What bonuses or incentives? They are professionals and playing for the green cap and national pride. Isnt that good enough? Shaharyar said. We have no plans to announce any incentives for winning the series against India. They are supposed to do well for the team and country. Yes, if they do well and if we feel they deserve rewards and acknowledgement we will reward them sufficiently. But there is no question of having a performance-related incentive for any player. They have to play as true professionals because they are well paid in fees for their services, he was quoted as saying by The News. The PCB chairman was one of the few who had differed with the former PCB chief Tauqir Zia when he announced bonuses and incentives for the team and arranged a grand farewell for them before the 2003 World Cup. Pakistan players earn handsomely from match and tour fees and a senior player like Inzamam-ul Haq earns around Rs 2,50,000 per ODI and 2,75,000 for a Test match. The PCB has recently introduced a central contract system for the players which guarantees them a monthly salary apart from match and tour fees.  (PTI)  Copyright

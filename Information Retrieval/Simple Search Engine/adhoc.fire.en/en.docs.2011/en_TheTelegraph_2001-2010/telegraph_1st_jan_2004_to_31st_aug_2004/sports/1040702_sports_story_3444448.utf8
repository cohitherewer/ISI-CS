Sachin: We should start with a bang 
 Sachin feels the players will remain focused Chennai: Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar said on Thursday that it was important for the team to remain focussed and start the Asia Cup tournament with a bang in order to extend their good form into the new season. India will try hard to start with a bang in the Asia Cup. It is a fresh season, Tendulkar told a press conference here. Asia Cup gets underway in Sri Lanka from July 16. The star batsman said the players, who had a nice and useful camp in Bangalore, would try to remain focused on the job at hand just as they had been during the tours of Australia and Pakistan. We had a nice and useful camp in Bangalore and we will take it forward to be focussed in the limited overs tournament in Sri Lanka. The highest run-getter in one-dayers, Tendulkar said the Chennai camp, to be held from July 3 to 8, was important as the weather condition in Sri Lanka is akin to what we have here. Praising the probables for the tournament, he said: The probables announced after the Bangalore camp are excellent and the team for the Asia Cup to be selected here will also be strong. He described as noteworthy the changes brought about by physical trainer Gregory King to improve the fitness levels of the players, and pointed out that each player had been given a specific fitness programme. We were made to play kho-kho as this sport requires a lot of physical fitness, Tendulkar said and expressed hope that the Chennai camp would also have such regimen to help the team achieve optimum fitness levels. Asked about the number of pace bowlers to be included in the team for the Asia Cup, Tendulkar said, it is the selectors job but the teams combination would be decided on the kind of wickets that are prepared. Asked whether there was a need for a specialist wicket-keeper in the one-dayers, he said: There is no point in holding a debate on this. Fifteen players will give different opinions. It is the selectors who are the best judges and I will leave it to them. It would not be prudent to sit here and make an assessment and plan things in respect of the composition of the team and specialist wicket-keeper. Asked whether he prefers motorsports to cricket, he said: Cricket is my life. I will not sleep, if I do not perform. But motorsports will not dampen my spirits and affect my life. (PTI)  Copyright

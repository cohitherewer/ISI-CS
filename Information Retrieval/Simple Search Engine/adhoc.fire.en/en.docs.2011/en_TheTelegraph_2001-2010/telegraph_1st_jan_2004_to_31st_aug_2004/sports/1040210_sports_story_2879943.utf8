The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roma thrash Juventus 4-0
 Juventus Antonio Conte takes a tumble trying to block Olivier Dacourt of Roma during their Serie A match in Rome on Sunday. (Reuters) London: Chelsea kept in touch with the top two in the Premier League after Jimmy Floyd Hasselbainks first-half penalty secured a laboured 1-0 home win over Charlton Athletic on Sunday. Hasselbaink struck in the 28th minute but, bar a late flurry of Adrian Mutu misses, there were few other chances at either end as fifth-placed Charlton were also operating below their best. After the excitement of Saturdays programme, Sundays fare was dull in comparison, the low-key Stamford Bridge game following an even more dreary goalless draw between Manchester City and Birmingham City. Chelsea remain third behind Arsenal and Manchester United, on 52, with Newcastle United, 3-1 winners over Leicester City, fourth on 37 and ahead of Charlton on goal difference. Liverpool and Fulham both have 35 points. Hasselbaink broke the deadlock from the spot after Mark Fish was ruled to have hauled down the Dutchman. The South African defender claimed Hasselbaink had been backing in but Fish had wrapped his arms around him, giving the referee an easy option. Charlton improved slightly after the break but there remained little danger until the last 10 minutes, when Mutu had three good chances. After the fireworks of midweek, when Manchester City came from 3-0 down with 10 men to beat Tottenham Hotspur 4-3 in the FA Cup, it was back to reality at the City of Manchester ground. The hosts had the better of the few chances but were denied by Birmingham goalkeeper Maik Taylor. In Spain, Deportivo La Coruna also stayed in touch with the top two with a 2-0 win away to Albacete on Sunday, while Ronaldinho scored a spectacular goal to send Barcelona up to fourth with a 2-1 victory away to Osasuna. Deportivo took control of their game in Albacete in the second half with two goals in two minutes from Lionel Scaloni and Albert Luque. Javier Iruretas side were soon in trouble when Hector was sent off for bringing down Carlos Aranda in the area with 66 minutes gone but Jose Molina saved from the Albacete strikers penalty and Deportivo clinched a comfortable victory. The result kept Deportivo in third place with 46 points from 23 games. Real Madrid lead the standings with 52 points, with Valencia staying second, two points behind, after a 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Barcelona moved into the final Champions League slot with a determined victory over Osasuna, clinched with a moment of brilliance from Ronaldinho. Javier Saviola had put Barcelona ahead from Xavis astute through ball late in the first half but Osasuna hit back when Victor Valdes brought down Valdo in the box and gave away a penalty that was converted by Patxi Punal. Osasuna, level on points with Barcelona going into the game, poured forward in search of a winner but Ronaldinho secured Barcelonas third successive league win in the 77th minute. In Italy, AS Roma beat Juventus 4-0 on Sunday, with two goals from Antonio Cassano, to leave Juventus trailing leaders AC Milan by eight points. Milan, who beat Perugia 2-1 thanks to a stunning free-kick from Rui Costa and an Andrea Pirlo penalty, lead with 51 points followed by Roma, five behind, and Juventus third on 43 points. Inter Milan, in fourth, fell further off the pace with a 2-2 draw at Sampdoria, after leading twice through Christian Vieri. Frenchman Olivier Dacourt put Roma ahead with his first goal in Serie A, firing home from the edge of the area on 13 minutes. Francesco Totti then hit the bar with a superb volley from over 20 metres out but the Roma captain got on the scoresheet eight minutes after the break, slotting home a penalty after Juventus defender Paolo Montero had brought down Cassano. Montero lost his head and was sent off for a crude kick at Totti on the touchline three minutes later, an unnecessary foul that left Juventus with ten men. Cassano made it 3-0 in the 71st minute with a neat side-footed finish to a low cross from Mancini. Juventus were given hope with a penalty three minutes later but David Trezeguet fired straight at Roma keeper Ivan Pelizzoli. Cassano completed a miserable night for Juventus with a well-taken angled header from another Mancini cross.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

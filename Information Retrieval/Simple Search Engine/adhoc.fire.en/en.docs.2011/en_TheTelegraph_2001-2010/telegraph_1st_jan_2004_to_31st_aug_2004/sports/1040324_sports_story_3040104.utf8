The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A Real threat for Spaniards 
Madrid: Real Madrid hope Monaco striker Fernando Morientes will not feel too much at home when he returns to the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Strong in the air and quick to pounce in the area, Morientes is just the sort of player capable of exploiting weaknesses in Reals defence in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Loaned out at the beginning of the season to Monaco, Morientes has played down talk he has a point to prove in a match between two sides which have allowed large leads in their domestic leagues to melt away. In another first-leg quarter final, Chelsea take Arsenal and a battalion of statisticians at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal have won all three of the meetings between the two clubs this season and it is 16 games and more than five years since Chelsea managed to conquer their London rivals. (Reuters)  Copyright

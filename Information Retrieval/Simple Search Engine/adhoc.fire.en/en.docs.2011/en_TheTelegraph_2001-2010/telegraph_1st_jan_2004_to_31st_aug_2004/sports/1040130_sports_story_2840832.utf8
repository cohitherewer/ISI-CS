 Pollock blows derail WI 
 - SECOND ODI 
 - We threw it away by losing wickets carelessly: Lara  Teammates converge on Shaun Pollock after one of his four wickets in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. (AFP) Port Elizabeth: Exemplary seam bowling by Shaun Pollock helped South Africa to victory over the West Indies in the second ODI on Wednesday. Pollock took four for 26 as South Africa won by 16 runs to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. South Africa made 179 for seven but dismissed the tourists for 163 in 42.4 overs. Batsmen of both teams struggled to come to terms with a capricious pitch and the West Indies did themselves no favours with suicidal running between the wickets that led to three run outs. The home sides best batting came from Boeta Dippenaar, who fashioned a workmanlike 83 off 123 balls with eight fours before falling in the final over, off Corey Collymore, who took three for 25. Openers Herschelle Gibbs and Graeme Smith fell cheaply and the phenomenal run of Jacques Kallis came to an end when he top-edged a hook off 19-year-old fast bowler Ravi Rampaul. Only Pollock gave Dippenaar good support in a brisk sixth-wicket stand of 54. In reply, the West Indies slumped to 29 for three in 8.2 overs with Pollock removing Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Chris Gayle and Ricardo Powell. Brian Lara was run out for nine in the 16th over and Ramnaresh Sarwan followed him four overs later. Lara blamed the defeat on the run outs. We threw it away by losing our wickets very carelessly, in particular those three unnecessary run outs, he said. Sarwan and Jacobs really got set and should have taken the opportunity to take us home.  No change in SA squad South Africa have kept their victorious squad intact for the remaining three one-day Internationals against West Indies. Graeme Smiths team won the first game in the five-match series by 209 runs in Cape Town on Sunday, and the second by 16 runs in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

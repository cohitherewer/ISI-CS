 Woolmer wants Mahmood
Islamabad: Forgotten Pakistan allrounder Azhar Mahmood could be back in reckoning. Coach Bob Woolmer indicated that he wants Mahmood to join the Asia Cup training camp in Lahore. Woolmer, who will be taking charge on July 2, has reportedly spoken to Mahmood about his future plans in London where the allrounder plays for Surrey. Woolmer is meeting PCB officials in London next week and he might ask them to consider Mahmood for the Asia Cup camp, sources were quoted as saying by a Pakistan daily on Thursday. Incidentally, Woolmer was the South African team coach when Mahmood scored three Test centuries against them in the 1997 and 1998 series. Meanwhile, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation has decided to utilise the services of Wasim Akram in setting up a cricket academy in Manchester.  (PTI)  Copyright

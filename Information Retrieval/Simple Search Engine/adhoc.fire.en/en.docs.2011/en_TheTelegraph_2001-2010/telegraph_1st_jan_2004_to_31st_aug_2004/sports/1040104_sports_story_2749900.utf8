 Police raid on SLC office
 Colombo, Jan. 3 (AP): Police  have raided Sri Lankas cricket headquarters, seizing accounts  and other documents as part of an investigation into allegations  that the countrys top cricket official altered a passport  for an alleged gangster, an investigator said on Saturday.  Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) president Thilanga Sumathipala  is accused of violating immigration rules to send Dammika  Amarasinghe, who is wanted by police, to watch the 1999  World Cup in England. He is also accused of releasing 1,500  from the boards accounts for Amarasinghes trip to England.  We conducted a raid in connection with some alleged illegal  transactions of the cricket board, said Nimal Kulatunga,  the criminal investigations department officer, who led  Fridays raid. Amarasinghe faces trial over several killings  and attempted murders, including the attempted assassination  of a newspaper editor in 1998. Sumathipala denies any involvement  with the alleged gang leader. Fridays raid came in response to a court order to seize documents pertaining to SLC accounts at the time of the World Cup.

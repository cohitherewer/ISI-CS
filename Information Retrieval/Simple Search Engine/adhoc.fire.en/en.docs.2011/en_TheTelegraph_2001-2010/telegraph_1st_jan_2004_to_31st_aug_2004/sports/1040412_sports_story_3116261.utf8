The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No review of teams security
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Islamabad: Despite Saturday nights murderous bomb blast in Karachi, outside a club where Sonu Nigam was the star performer, Team Indias security isnt being reviewed here. Theres no information that Nigam was the target. In any case, we regard this as the safest city and the protection isnt being reviewed, the teams chief security liaison officer, DIG Dharmendra Kumar, told The Telegraph. While the third and final Test will be in neighbouring Rawalpindi, both teams have been put up at the Islamabad Marriott. The Test begins on Tuesday.  Copyright

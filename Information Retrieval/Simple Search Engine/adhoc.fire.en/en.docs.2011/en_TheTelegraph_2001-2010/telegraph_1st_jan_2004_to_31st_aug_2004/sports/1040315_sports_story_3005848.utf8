The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wright worried over bowling blues
 - Second ODI - Laxman, Powar may replace Badani and Kartik; Shabbir tipped to play  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul Haq with (from left) Asim Kamal, Imran Farhat and Yasir Hameed offer prayers in Rawalpindi on Sunday Islamabad: V.V.S. Laxmans sore left ankle has improved considerably and he is likely to be back for the day-night one-dayer at the Rawalpindi Stadium on Tuesday. Laxman had nets on Sunday evening along with Irfan Pathan, Parthiv Patel and Ramesh Powar. We anticipate Laxman to be available for Tuesday. He doesnt have any problems while batting but is feeling a bit uneasy while fielding. Lets see how it goes and may be well get a clearer picture tomorrow, Team India coach John Wright said. Laxman, once he passes the fitness test, will come in for Hemang Badani. Its learnt that Team India may effect another change to the side from the one that played in Karachi. Murali Kartiks performance has hardly been inspiring and he may have to make way for rookie off spinner Powar. The bowling blues have kept Wright worried. It was excellent batting in Karachi but in the end it was too close for comfort. It was more a feeling of delight and relief, the coach summed it up well. The pitch here is expected to have some carry and will assist the bowlers in the initial stages. Run making will also be difficult in the second half as the dew factor will also come into play in the cooler climes of the city. There seemed to be a fair sprinkling of grass on the pitch but has been shaved off under instructions this evening. The greenish tinge, though, still remains. Pakistan had some good news as well. Shabbir Ahmeds finger injury has healed and he may replace Rana Naveed-ul Hasan. While the Pakistan bowlers still seemed they havent yet recovered from the Karachi nightmare, Moin Khan is focussing ahead. He is ready to forget the episode as a closed chapter. The post-mortem will, however, suggest that the experienced campaigner, known for his strokemaking abilities, should have taken a lot more initiative in getting those nine runs. His failure has taken away the sheen out of Inzamam-ul Haqs glorious century as Pakistan tried to recover from the shocking loss in the first one-day International. Trying to hide his disappointment, Moin gave full credit to Ashish Nehras disciplined bowling and his ability to keep his nerves in the over of death. Its to Nehras credit that he managed to restrict the runs, Moin said on Sunday. Inzamam-ul haq, too, defended his teammate. This happens sometimes to the best of batsmen, the skipper remarked. Pakistan coach Javed Miandad also shared Inzamams views, refusing to put the blame entirely on Moin. Poor guy was under tremendous pressure. That must have finally got to him. As Moin walked up to have a look at the wicket, one of the groundsmen quipped, How many runs will this track produce? A smiling Moins prompt reply was nothing less than 425 in each innings. That seems to have become the order of the day. Meanwhile, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle has fined both teams 10 per cent of their match fees for bowling two overs short in Karachi. As per the ICC rules, the captains were fined 20 percent each. Sourav had yesterday termed it as ridiculous.  Copyright

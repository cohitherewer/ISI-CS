The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PSB, Signals in semis
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sandeep Singh (left) of PSB runs into BSF goalkeeper K.M. Subbaiah in their Beighton Cup match at the CC amp;FC ground on Friday. PSB won 1-0. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Punjab and Sind Bank (PSB) booked a semi-final berth at the Indian Oil-Servo 109th Beighton Cup hockey tournament after beating defending champions BSF Jalandhar 1-0 at CC amp;FC on Friday. The bankmen will lock horns with Punjab Police on Saturday for a place in the final. Corps of Signals was the other team to make the semi-finals from group A, following a 2-2 draw against Eastern Railway. They meet Army XI. The PSB-BSF match started with the bankmen dominating and ended the same way. But in the 70-minute affair, only one goal was scored as Baljit Singh Sainis team created and missed many chances. PSB broke the deadlock as late as in the 67th minute, through their ninth and last penalty corner. This time, Sandeep Singh sounded the board with a firm hit. The bankmen got their first penalty corner in the second minute and within the first ten minutes, they managed three, only to squander them all. Also, a few good set-piece movements created by Saini, Kulwinder Singh, Baljit Singh Chandi and Davinder Singh were not taken full advantage of. In the 13th minute, Rajwinder Singh, after getting a ball on the right crossed it to Kulwinder, who forwarded it to Ravi Pal, whose hit was off the target. It was just before the breather when Parminder Singh after a solo effort got inside the striking zone and scooped the ball, but goalkeeper K.M. Subbaiah came in the way. Even the second session started with PSB putting pressure on the BSF defence, but they kept on wasting chances. BSF were largely on the defensive and tried to score only after conceding the goal. But that was just too late. Earlier in the day, Corps of Signals made BSFs task harder after their match against Eastern Railway ended in a 2-2 draw. Signals finished second in the group with four points. An upset seemed a possibility in the days first match as the local outfit opened up a 2-0 lead at the breather. The railwaymen went ahead in the 20th minute when Pitrus Ekka latched on to a pass from Yahsveer Yadav and dribbled past two defenders to hit the board. They boosted their lead four minutes later as Nishar Ahmed converted a penalty corner, but the script changed in the second half with G. Dass flicked in a Jagdev Singh free-hit in the 62nd minute. It was Dass again who got the equaliser, a minute from the hooter, when he intercepted an angular penalty corner hit by N. Lakra and put the ball home. SEMI-FINAL LINE-UP Army XI vs Corps of Signals

 Iraq eye history 
Athens: Iraq and Argentina will have different motives but ultimately the same goal in the semi-finals of the mens Olympic soccer tournament on Tuesday. For brave Iraq, the Athens Games have become a crusade and they have overcome extreme odds to reach the last four, bringing a ray of hope to their war-ravaged country. They will face another stern examination of their resolve when they take on Paraguay in Thessaloniki, northern Greece. Iraqs 1-0 victory over Australia in the quarter finals sparked delirious scenes in Baghdad, with people firing guns into the air, honking car horns and waving Iraqi flags. We hope we are able to soften the pain for the people of Iraq, who have suffered war and made so many sacrifices, said coach Adnan Hamd. Our families are very sad. At this difficult time the least we can do is try to bring them some happiness. A weightlifting bronze at the 1960 Rome Games was the only time Iraq have previously troubled the Olympic engravers but they are now one win away from a historic second medal. Paraguay survived a late fight back but still looked impressive in their 3-2 victory over South Korea at the weekend.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

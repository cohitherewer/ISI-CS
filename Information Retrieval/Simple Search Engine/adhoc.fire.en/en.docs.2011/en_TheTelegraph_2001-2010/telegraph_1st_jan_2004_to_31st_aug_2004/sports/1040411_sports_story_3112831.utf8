The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Waqar happy he doesnt have to bowl at Sehwag
 - The several comebacks will rank as my top achievement  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Waqar says he hasnt yet thought about becoming a bowling coach Islamabad: The other evening, Sourav Ganguly saluted Virender Sehwag by equating him with God. On Saturday, Waqar Younis remarked hes happy not having to bowl at the flamboyant Team India opener who is in sublime form. Im glad my days have passed... Bowling to Brian Lara on song was the most difficult proposition... Had I still been in the thick of action, it would have been tough evicting Sehwag of the present times, Waqar, who formally announces retirement on Monday, conceded. Speaking to The Telegraph over his cellphone, Waqar (who returned to Lahore from New Delhi late on Friday) added: Actually, Sehwag reflects the changed face of Indian cricket. Nowadays, your side plays aggressively and theres a purpose. Indian teams of the past werent hungry, this one is... This lot wants to win... A former Pakistan captain, Waqar lost his own hunger  of course, it didnt help that the selectors kept ignoring him after World Cup 2003. Yet, he insisted he had no regrets. Somewhat emotionally, Waqar pointed out: Its too late in the day for me to think of what could and should have happened... Its not that yet another comeback wouldnt have been possible, but that urge stopped... In any case, there comes a time when one moves on in life. Waqar (who formed a legendary partnership with the other W, Wasim Akram) has finished with 373 wickets in Tests and 416 in ODIs. And, in doing so, the 32-year-old has assured himself a berth in the bowlers Hall of Fame. Asked to list his No. 1 achievement, he chose the comebacks made over 14 years. I managed more than one in Test cricket... Irrespective of the wickets taken, that will rank at the very top. Though theres speculation he may be appointed Pakistans bowling coach, Waqar maintained he hadnt thought about it. Look, Ive got to be clear about what is good for me and what is going to be good for Pakistan cricket... Sure, I want to give something back, but Im not committing myself to anything right now. Waqar, by the way, felt that the third and final Test (in neighbouring Rawalpindi from Tuesday) could be the most exciting in years. The stage is set for a terrific finish... Personally, I dont care who wins as long as the game continues till the final session or even the final hour... However, he cautioned: If some grass is retained, there will be considerable life early on... After that, the batters should have a ball. Waqar, though, didnt comment on the current generation of quicks packing up after just one Test  a case in point being Umar Gul, who broke Indias back in the first innings at the Gaddafi. Now, he himself has a back problem. Incidentally, speaking about Sachin Tendulkar, who made his debut in the same Test as he did (Karachi, 1989), Waqar said: Being a batsman, hes definitely going to continue longer... I suppose he will be around till the next (2007) World Cup, if not beyond... The question is: What is Waqar going to be doing then? For now, he is keeping options open.  Copyright

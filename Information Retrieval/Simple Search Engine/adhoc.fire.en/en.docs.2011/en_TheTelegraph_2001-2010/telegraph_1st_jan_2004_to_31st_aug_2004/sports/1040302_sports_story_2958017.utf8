The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India take on Belgium today
 - It is not so much about winning this tournament, but to first qualify for Athens, says Rajinder  Rajinder says India will take it one match at a time and that Pillays absence will not be felt Madrid: A resurgent India begin yet another long journey on Tuesday in quest of the Olympic hockey gold they won 24 years ago. They lock horns with Belgium in their opening game of the Olympic qualifying tournament here on Tuesday. Coach Rajinder Singh put it quite succinctly when he said the first target in this 12-team competition would be to finish in the top seven bracket that would ensure them a berth in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. That is our priority. So, it is not so much about winning this tournament, but to first qualify for Athens. I am happy that all the players are fit and confident, though the unusually cold weather that greeted us on our arrival here last week did affect our training. But then, with the sun finally coming out, the players are more at ease now, Rajinder said, on the eve of the 12-day tournament. Last week didnt turn out to be too happy for the Indian team as their baggage was lost in transit. It was found after 48 hours. Further, the team doctor Joginder Singh, who arrived here from Germany, had his pouch containing passport and money stolen at the time of checking in at the team hotel. But the Indians have put all that behind them. Today, we were happy that it was bright and sunny, and if the weather stays this way, then our boys will be able to do as well as expected, team manager K. Krishnamurthy, a former national-level player from Karnataka, said. Looking ahead to the tournament, Rajinder added: Every match will be tough and we need to play consistently. Overall, I am quite confident that we will qualify for Athens, though at this moment, we would prefer to take one match at a time. The Madrid tournament will be Indias third qualifying event, a far cry from the days when their presence in the Olympics as also a medal was assured. India, without the injured Dhanraj Pillay have no other fitness problems at the moment. They would be pinning their hopes on their forwards to score more goals than miss. Given the high stakes, the Indians are required to be at their best right through the tournament. After all none of the teams are pushovers, least of all Pakistan. Pakistan, trained by Dutchman Roelant Oltmans, have opted for a rather defensive posture with accent on ball-holding and counter-attacks, a style of play that has put their customary aggression on leash. Nevertheless, the discipline in their play has only strengthened them as was evident in Kuala Lumpur in January when they finished runners-up to Australia in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup tournament. Thus, India will be wary of Pakistan, especially their penalty corner specialist Sohail Abbas whose powerful drag-flicks are among the best in world hockey today. Rajinder mentioned this aspect when he spoke about Indias game against Pakistan scheduled for Saturday. Of the other teams in the group, Malaysia, Canada and New Zealand could prove to be difficult. The Malaysians, coached by German expert Paul Lissek, have been showing signs of progress and historically, they have always proved a handful, and it would be no different this time around. The Canadians need no reminder of the Barcelona qualifying tournament. Moreover, they have played the Indians with a vengeance since then. As such, the Indians need to exercise great caution when they take on Canada in their concluding league fixture on March 9, less than 24 hours after playing New Zealand. The Kiwis have struggled to be among the top six ever since their gold-medal winning performance at the 1976 Montreal Games, where astro-turf made its international debut. Yet, on their day, they have shown a special ability to trouble the best of teams.However, India and Pakistan are expected to top group B and that would guarantee both the teams a ticket to Athens. The other group has 1988 Olympic gold medallists Great Britain, reigning Olympic champions Holland, hosts Spain, Poland, South Africa and Japan.The Dutch, under former Australian great Terry Walsh, appear all primed up for the event and are favourites to top the group, leaving Spain and Great Britain to fight it out for the second spot.

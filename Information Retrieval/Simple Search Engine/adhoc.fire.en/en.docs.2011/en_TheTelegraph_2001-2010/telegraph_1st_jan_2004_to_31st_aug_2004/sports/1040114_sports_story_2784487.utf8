The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan desperate to beat Dempo
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rennedy believes Bagan can do without Barreto Calcutta: A win, believes coach Aloke Mukherjee, will lift Mohun Bagan out of crisis in the face of a disgruntled Jose Ramirez Barretos move to stay away from the teams activities. I desperately need just one win, because this is one thing that will do a world of good to my team at this critical juncture. Mukherjee said on Tuesday, the eve of Mohun Bagans 10th round match against Dempo SC in the National Football League. The former champions are woefully lying low with merely 11 points from nine matches and the problems facing the team seem so deep-rooted that the rhythm of a resurrection is hardly heard among the players. Captain Rennedy Singh, however, tried to play down the crisis. Barretos absence is certainly a huge loss. But in the past, we have played without him and won. Lets take it this way as if we are missing him because of double booking. The situation is demanding and we have to deliver the goods without him, he maintained. We all know its a difficult situation were in. But we also all realise its time for us to take the initiatives, the captain added. In absence of the Brazilian ball-charmer, a lot will also depend on Ashim Biswas. The forward seems to be out of touch since his hattrick against Indian Bank on December 15. Ashim admitted such fact but hastened to add Wednesday might witness a turnaround in his slump in goal-scoring form. Its not that Im playing badly. But I fully know a forwards job is to score and when you are not doing that you should take the responsibility, was how he described his role in the teams current run of flop shows. Echoing similar sentiments, Mukherjee felt the situation is bound to improve today or tomorrow. We didnt play against JCT (in the last match at home) as badly as losing three points. Yet we lost. Its just that we are going through a phase when nothing is falling into place. The coachs desperation for a win  or rather a change in the current trend  could easily be captured. Sanjeev Maria is set to return while an indisposed Eduardo is unavailable. But most importantly, Barreto will once again figure in the XVIII. I sincerely hope for the issue to be resolved before the match, he said.  Seen from a realistic perspective, Mohun Bagans job is truly cut out on Wednesday since their opponents are the current leaders with 20 points. As Armando Colaco, the Goan teams coach, said: Mohun Bagan are always a threat. But well try to keep the momentum going. He attributed the teams unbeaten run to the fact that the same combination of players was fielded almost in all matches and a sense of understanding had developed among them. Colaco further pointed out that his teams bench strength is also very good, but added that setting a target on the title was a distant plan. The injured Majek Bolaji will return to man the defence in place of Phillip Gomes.  Copyright

 Tiger missing wood for the trees
 FROM MARTIN JOHNSON IN AUGUSTA  Tiger may be missing coach Harmon It is nigh on impossible to pick up a golf magazine without being informed that  for the modest outlay of  399.99 on one of those trampoline-effect plutonium drivers with a head the size of a wok  you too can hit it like Tiger Woods, and the front cover of this months Golf Digest features a picture of Woods with the headline: Take Control Of Your Tee Shots. As Woods is currently ranked 119th on the US PGA Tour in driving accuracy, with an average of four out of every 10 fairways missed whenever he reaches for the driver, this is taking golfs traditional reader gullibility factor to new levels. Although it has to be conceded that a front cover picture of the tours No. 1 fairway finder  Fred Funk  wouldnt have caused much of a stampede at the newsagents. Woods inability to find the short grass with anything like the regularity he once did may or may not be connected to his decision to part company with his long-time coach, Butch Harmon. But if a stroll round Augustas practice areas this week is anything to go by, Woods is now just about the only golfer NOT coached by Harmon. It is one of the quirks of the Masters that there is a far bigger ticket allocation for practice days than for the tournament itself, and such is the cachet of making it through the Augusta National front gates that someone I bumped into near the putting green Wednesday had just driven seven-and-a-half hours through the night from Memphis for the privilege of watching, among other things, Harmon giving a putting tutorial to the not quite legendary Steve Flesch. There was almost as big a crowd watching Harmon nodding sagely as the left-handed Flesch rolled a series of 10-footers towards a practice hole than the one following Woods around the golf course. And just around the corner on the chipping range, Sergio Garcia held at least 100 people spellbound as he explained to Paul Casey how his short game had benefited from shaving a bit off the bottom of his lob wedge. All riveting stuff, as the caddie whose job for the morning was to retrieve Fleschs balls from the hole and roll them back again would undoubtedly agree. But for the practice day spectator, there is nothing out there that is not worth travelling seven-and-a-half hours from Memphis for. The biggest gallery of all Wednesday was following a 74-year-old fossil who would regard it as a miracle if he manages to break 80 over the next couple of days. However, there is also something rather splendid about Arnold Palmer still spreading so much pleasure around a golf course, and it embraces his playing partners just as much as the spectators. The practice day pairings are almost always two or more friends together, such as Justin Rose and Ian Poulter, or Eduardo Romero and Angel Cabrera. Not that the crowds always know who these non-Americans are. Romeros nickname of El Gato, for his feline body movement, once prompted an American reporter to ask him why he was known as the Cake, and Poulter was confidently identified by one member of the crowd Wednesday as that amateur guy who beat Tiger in the Walker Cup. You know. Whatsisname. Gary Wolstenholme. Thats it. Poulter and Rose are very close chums. Rose is a little more self-effacing than Poulter, whose response to an inquiry about whether hed ever employed a pyschologist, was: Do me a favour. Why should I pay someone to tell me how good I am, when I already know that myself?  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

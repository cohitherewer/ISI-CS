 ATP task force to allay doping fears
London: The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) said on Monday it had set up a task force to tackle players fears about contaminated supplements. The aim is to develop short and long term solutions designed to help players manage the risks associated with taking vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements, the ATP said in a statement. The ATP said British No. 2 Greg Rusedski, who failed a random test for the steroid nandrolone last July, had said he was the victim of a contaminated substance. He has insisted that he was a victim of a contamination and claims that six players were found with elevated levels of nandrolone with the same analytical fingerprint, the statement said. Rusedski, who faces a ban up to two years if found guilty, is waiting for the result of a hearing held in Montreal last month. Seven players were exonerated last year after an independent inquiry ruled that they had taken contaminated substances handed out by ATP trainers. Former world No. 1 Andre Agassi, Britains top player Tim Henman and 2002 French Open winner Albert Costa are three of 10 players who will serve on the task force. Last month Agassi said players were scared about what they could or could not take and called on the ATP to take action. Jan Leschly, once ranked 10th in the world and currently chairman and chief executive of a healthcare company, will chair the group.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

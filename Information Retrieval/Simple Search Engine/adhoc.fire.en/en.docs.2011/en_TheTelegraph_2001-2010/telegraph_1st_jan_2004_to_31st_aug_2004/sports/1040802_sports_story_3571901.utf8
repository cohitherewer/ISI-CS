The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gill optimistic
Jaipur: Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K. P. S. Gill is confident that the induction of two German coaches will certainly bring about a difference in the performance of the Athens-bound hockey team. Indian team is shaping up well and with German coaches Oliver Kurtz and Gerhard Rach in charge, we can expect more from the lot, Gill said. Dispelling fears that the timing of Rajinder Singhs removal might affect the morale of the team, Gill said that chapter is closed. He also denied that some of the younger players in the side do not like the presence of mercurial striker Dhanraj Pillay and some other senior players. (PTI)  Copyright

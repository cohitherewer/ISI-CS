 Ricardo PORTUGAL  Maniche, Jorge Andrade and Ricardo are the only Portugal players to have played every minute of their countrys Euro 2004 matches.  Portugals reserve goalkeepers, Quim and Jose Moreira, defender Beto and midfielder Tiago are the only members of the squad who have yet to see any action at Euro 2004.  Luis Figo is the top scorer amongst Portugals Euro 2004 squad with 31 goals. He is second on the countrys all-time top scorers list, trailing leader Eusebio by 10 goals.  Nuno Gomes will celebrate his 28th birthday on July 5, the day after the Euro 2004 final.  Portugal have scored at least one goal in their last nine European Championship finals matches equalling the competition record held by France.  Portugal have scored in their last 13 internationals. The last time they failed to find the net was in a 0-3 defeat by Spain in September 2003. Portugal have never lost more than one match at a single European Championship finals. Their four defeats have been against France (1984), Czech Republic (1996), France again (2000) and Greece (2004).  Portugal have equalled their best achievement at a European Championship finals by reaching the semi-finals. They also reached the last four in 1984 and 2000.  Four of Portugals six goals at Euro 2004 have been scored by substitutes.  Portugal are one of only seven countries who qualified for the knockout stages after losing their first group match along with Denmark (1984), The Netherlands (1988), Czech Republic (1996), Turkey (2000), Spain (2000) and England (2004).  The only country to win the European Championship after losing the first game, was The Netherlands in 1988.  Portugal have lost two of their nine matches in 2004. The first was a 1-2 defeat against Italy and the second was their opening Euro2004 defeat against fellow semi-finalists Greece.  Portugal have never been awarded a penalty in the European Championship finals after 17 matches.  Nine of the squad were at Euro 2000 and all of them played at least one game in that tournament. Three of the squad also played at Euro 96  Fernando Couto, Rui Costa and Figo. THE NETHERLANDS  Andy van der Meyde, Roy Makaay will be suspended from a possible final if they receive a yellow card in this match.  With four goals at Euro 2004, Ruud van Nistelrooy is joint-second in the top scorers list with one goal less than the Czech Republics Milan Baros.  Van Nistelrooy is now 10th on the Dutch all-time top scorers list with 18 goals. He needs two more to overtake Leen Vente in ninth place. Patrick Kluivert tops the list with 40.  Edwin van der Sar and Philip Cocu will equal Dennis Bergkamps Dutch record of 13 European Championship finals appearances if they play against Portugal.  The three most experienced Dutch players ever are all at Euro 2004  Frank de Boer with 112 caps, Edwin van der Sar (88), and Marc Overmars (85).  Frank de Boer is likely to miss this match and will probably end his international career with a record 112 caps.  Philip Cocu was the only Dutch player to miss a penalty in their shootout against Sweden in the Euro 2004 quarter final. It was his second miss in a shootout at a major championship after the one against Brazil in the 1998 World Cup semi-final.  Cocu, Jaap Stam, Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Edwin van der Sar have played every minute of their countrys Euro 2004 matches.  Kluivert is the only outfield member of the squad who has not yet played in Euro 2004 after being the only one to play in all 10 qualification matches.  Kluivert is third on the all-time European Championship finals top-scorers list with six goals. Michel Platini, with nine goals, and Alan Shearer (7) are ahead of him.  Kluivert and Van Nistelrooy will be celebrating their 28th birthdays the day after this match.  Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder made their international debut against Portugal in a friendly in April 2003.  The Dutch have never lost more than one match at a European Championship finals. Their five defeats were against Czechoslovakia (1976), West Germany (1980), Soviet Union (1988), England (1996) and the Czech Republic (2004).  The Dutch starting line-up against Sweden was their oldest ever at a major championship. (Reuters)  Copyright

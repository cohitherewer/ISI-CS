The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lewis sees Sanders as heir to his throne
 Vitali Klitschko hopes he and brother Wladimir will be champions New York: Boxings heavyweight throne sits empty with Lennox Lewis retirement, but a host of fighters are trying to put themselves into the picture of picking up at least a piece of the Englishmans crown. Esteem earned by years at the top had lifted Lewis into a spot as a favourite among equals in the championship picture, a scene now left a muddled mess by lacklustre champions, ageing stars and losses by key contenders. There sure as hell arent any Muhammad Alis, veteran trainer Lou Duva commented. Its really bleak right now. The heavyweight picture is getting worse and worse. Vitali Klitschko and South Africas Corrie Sanders are negotiating for an April 24 bout for the World Boxing Council crown left behind by Lewis, who is part of the promotional group backing Sanders. Corrie Sanders is the next champion, Lewis said. Corrie has been working very hard for a long time and deserves this opportunity. I think hell make a fine champion. Sanders knocked out Wladimir Klitschko last March in Germany but has not fought since. Lewis knocked out Vitali Klitschko last June in Los Angeles but trailed on scorecards when the Ukrainians bleeding facial cut halted the fight. I am disappointed there will not be a rematch, Vitali Klitschko said. The important thing is for me and my brother Wladimir to reach our goal of being heavyweight champions, he said. Roy Jones, 35, defeated John Ruiz for the World Boxing Association title last year, making a historic rise from the light-heavyweight ranks to win the crown. But a weak heavyweight realm pushed Jones to defend his light-heavyweight crowns and the American will likely give his WBA heavyweight title back to Ruiz and seek more money at a lighter weight  a sure sign of heavyweight woes. American southpaw Chris Byrd beat Fres Oquendo last September to keep the International Boxing Federation crown, but has sparked little interest from fans or rival fighters. Mike Tyson has not fought since stopping fellow-American Clifford Etienne in 49 seconds a year ago, but the 37-year-old former undisputed world champion is talking with promoters about a June 5 date. Hes ready to get back, Tyson advisor Shelly Finkel said. A Tyson-Jones matchup is heavyweight boxings only major pay-per-view event, but Jones is looking at a light-heavyweight title rematch with Antonio Tarver in May or June. Tyson needs the money. Papers filed in us bankruptcy court showed him down to $ 5,553 when the year began with more than $ 10.2 million in debt and reports he has lost more than $ 300 million. Tysons big fight could be a court battle against Don King, his former promoter. Tyson is sueing for $ 100 million for breach of contract. The heavyweight ranks are so thin that George Foreman has announced plans for a comeback at age 55, intent upon a title bout.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nehra is set to replace Agarkar
 - Kaif has problem, Karthik in contention  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Ashish NehraCalcutta: Better cricket was at the top of captain Sourav Gangulys agenda when he left for Holland. Yet, nothing changed in the opening match of the tri-series there, on Saturday, as Pakistan inflicted another humiliating defeat. Now, of course, Team India is confronted with one more must-win situation  this time, versus world champions Australia. If Sachin Tendulkars tennis elbow ailment came as terrible news in the lead-up to the game against Pakistan, Ajit Agarkar woke up with a side strain on Sunday. According to The Telegraphs sources in Amsterdam, the problem aggravated at the fielding-specific workout later in the day. Some hours on, it got confirmed Agarkar is going to be rested (on Monday) and his place will go to Ashish Nehra, who has just about recovered from a strength-sapping viral. Clearly, this Agarkar development is awfully discouraging. After all, it was earlier this year that he returned his best ODI figures (six for 42), versus Australia, in the opening match of the tri-series Down Under. Even otherwise, the Australians have enormous respect for the lithe Mumbaikar who can surprise both with bat and ball. Mohammed Kaif, too, isnt in the pink of health  only, given his form (a paltry 72 in the last six games, beginning with the recent Asia Cup), its unlikely that many foreheads are going to be creased. Kaif, it may be recalled, suffered a shoulder injury against Pakistan. He is still in pain, but could make the XI for Mondays match. If he doesnt, wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik will get his maiden India cap. Actually, when the seven-batsman formula isnt working, it wont be a bad idea to field Karthik at the expense of one of them, thereby allowing the-under-pressure Rahul Dravid some breathing space. Moreover, with challenger Mahender Singh Dhoni having excelled for India A in Kenya, Karthik should make the most of his first opportunity. INDIAN XI Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S.Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif/Dinesh Karthik, Rohan Gavaskar, Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra.

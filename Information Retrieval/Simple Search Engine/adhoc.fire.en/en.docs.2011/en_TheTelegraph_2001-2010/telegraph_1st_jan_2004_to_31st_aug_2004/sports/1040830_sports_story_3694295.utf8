The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Time for many goodbyes
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: As the volunteers at the Olympic Games get ready to pack up and leave  and many come from far away countries like Australia and Italy, and Britain and even the US, there is a feeling of deja vu in some. Some who have been volunteers in other events. For others, this has been a very educative experience. They dont need the money, they need the goodwill. As Katerina Kokkori, supervisor volunteer at the Main Press Centre, said: We wanted to give everybody a good time, like welcoming guests at home. The sorrow is there. We have been subject to a lot of bad-mouthing by countries like Australia and the US, saying we were poor and could not organise this and that there was a security risk. It has done our tourism industry in, it needs to be rejuvenated. The general feeling of jubilation (gold medals and a fine organising, though with obvious and expected hitches) abounds, equally with the apprehension that a good deal of taxation is on the way, as a method to pay back huge debts. The Paralympics follow, but the big story is ending and its time for many goodbyes.  Copyright

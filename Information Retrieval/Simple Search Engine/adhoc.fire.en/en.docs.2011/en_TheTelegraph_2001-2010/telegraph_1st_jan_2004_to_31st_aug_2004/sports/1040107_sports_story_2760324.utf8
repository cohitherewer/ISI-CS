				 																																	London: Wimbledons famous Centre Court will be covered by a retractable roof under plans unveiled by the All England Club on Tuesday.				 																																	After years of rejecting the idea, organisers of the grasscourt Grand Slam finally agreed it was necessary to shield the most famous venue in tennis from Londons rain to satisfy the demands of television.				 																																	The roof should be in place for the 2009 championships after a redevelopment plan which will also increase the show courts capacity to 15,000 from 13,800.				 																																	It (Centre Court) is the jewel in our crown and what we are trying to do is to make it more precious than it already is, said club chairman Tim Phillips at a news conference.				 																																	Rain has completely washed out play on five days since 1991. During the 2003 championships, players were repeatedly forced to retreat to the locker rooms after showers halted play during the second week. 				 																																	Nairobi: The Kenyan government has stepped in to help the national team participate in the African Nations Cup in Tunisia after soccer chiefs said they would not be able to go because of a lack of funds.				 																																	Following a request made last Saturday, President Mwai Kibaki has on Tuesday authorised a government donation of 15 million shillings ($197,100) to the team ahead of the African Nations Cup, a statement by the Presidential Press Service said on Tuesday.				 																																	The cash injection will help the Harambee Stars, as the team is known, prepare for the tournament which kicks off on January 24 and also offset costs in Tunisia, the statement said.				 																																	Philadelphia: Former All-Star reliever Tug McGraw, who rocketed to baseball fame with his You Gotta Believe slogan while with the New York Mets died of brain cancer on Monday.				 																																	McGraw, who was also on the mound when the Philadelphia Phillies won their only World Series championship in 1980, was 59.				 																																	A family spokesperson announced that the eccentric McGraw, who was known for his demonstrative antics on the mound, passed away at the home of his son				 																																	Valencia: BMW Williams launched its new car amid hopes it will end Ferraris dominance in Formula One.				 																																	The FW26, the first new single-seater to be unveiled this year, is smaller and lighter than its predecessor  the FW25  and has a shorter nose, Spanish news agency Europa press reported on Monday.				 																																	Both the teams drivers, Colombias Juan Pablo Montoya and Germanys Ralf Schumacher, were present at the launch at Valencias Ricardo Tolmo track, raising questions about the duos relationship following Montoyas recent decision to join the McLaren team in 2005.				 																																	Phnom Penh: Cambodias disabled athletes are blaming their relatively poor showing at a recent regional paralympic games on old and outdated artificial legs.				 																																	The deeply impoverished nations team of 13 men and two women won 10 medals at the Second ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) Para Games in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi last month.				 																																	However, the squad was disappointed to fall short of the 13 medals, including six golds, notched up at the inaugural Para Games in Malaysia in 2001.				 																																	We earned fewer medals because the athletes used more than three-year-old artificial legs, Yi Veasna, head of the National Paralympic Committee, was quoted as saying. Despite contributions from Cambodias revered King Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun Sen, athletes had to make do with old legs worth only $1,000, compared to modern $8,000-limbs for competitors from neighbouring countries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Truth will prevail, says Montgomery
 Montgomery continues his fight for a chance to fulfil dreams Athens: Tim Montgomery told the US Anti-Doping Agency he has done nothing wrong and ridiculed all possible drug evidence against him. The truth will prevail, he said. Montgomery also identified banished sprinter Kelli White as the one who is providing information against him. Its not on paper. Its all someone saying something, Montgomery said. Who? He was asked. Kelli white, Montgomery responded. She dont live with me, so I dont know how she would know. White, the world champion in the womens 100 and 200m last year, has relinquished those medals and accepted a two-year suspension for using steroids and other banned substances. Montgomerys lawyer said the sprinter will continue to fight for the chance to fulfil his dreams and participate in the 2004 Olympics. After his sixth-place finish in the 100m at Saturdays Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, Montgomery accused the USADA of making up rules. Montgomery and three others  Chryste Gaines, Michelle Collins and Alvin Harrison  had until Friday to respond to the USADAs formal notice. Now, a USADA review panel will decide  perhaps by early this coming week  whether to recommend bringing drug charges against them. If they are found guilty of doping, they would face minimum bans of two years. Harrisons attorney, Ed Williams, said on Saturday that his client only received the formal notice from the USADA on Tuesday and did not respond by the deadline. Attorneys for Gaines and Collins could not be reached. Montgomerys girlfriend, three-time Olympic champion Marion Jones, also is under investigation by the USADA but has not received a formal letter that the agency is pursuing a case against her. Montgomerys attorney, Cristina Arguedas, said almost all of the USADAs allegations about Montgomery come from the files of Victor Conte  the founder of BALCO, and one of four men who have pleaded innocent to distributing steroids to top athletes.

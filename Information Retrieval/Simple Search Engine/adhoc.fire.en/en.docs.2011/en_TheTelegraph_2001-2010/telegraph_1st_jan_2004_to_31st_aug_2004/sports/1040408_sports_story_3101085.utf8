The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Javed job not under threat
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Lahore: Contrary to reports in the local Media, coach Javed Miandads contract isnt going to be reviewed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) at the end of the India series. Strictly speaking, Javed hasnt completed even one of the two years of his contract. At the moment, theres no question of reviewing it, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph on Wednesday. He added: Obviously, a lot of things will be reviewed at the end of this series, but not what has been reported... In fact, as far as I know, manager Haroon Rashids contract wont be reviewed either. Both Miandad and Rashid, one-time teammates, got the job after a disastrous World Cup 2003 campaign. This isnt innings No. 1 for either of them. Meanwhile, Rameez confirmed that former captain Waqar Younis has finally decided to quit. Weve assured a fitting farewell, possibly involving a lunch or dinner... But, if he wants to make the announcement during this Test itself, time is short, he said. Waqar, among the all-time greats, hasnt been picked after the last World Cup. Incidentally, he was Pakistans captain in that 2003 edition.  Copyright

 President snubs PCB chief
Islamabad: In an apparent attempt to convey his displeasure over the way cricket was being managed in Pakistan in the aftermath of the India series, President Pervez Musharraf reportedly snubbed cricket board chairman Shaharyar Khan by declining to meet him Saturday. Khan, a former foreign secretary, who was appointed for the top post by Musharraf earlier this year, was reportedly kept waiting at the Presidents official residence in Rawalpindi and the PCB chief was told towards the end of the day that the appointment had to be rescheduled for next week. To scorch rumours, Khan himself said in a press release issued late evening that he would shortly meet Musharraf. I have requested for a meeting with President General Musharraf. I am hoping that the meeting will take place in the coming week, Khan said in the statement. Khan, who lives in Karachi, said he has come to Islamabad to attend a seminar. On Monday, I will meet former diplomats and government officials before travelling to Lahore Tuesday, he said. The Pakistan media, however, described the delay in getting the appointment as a snub for Khan, especially the way he managed the affairs of the PCB. A disappointed Khan later met Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali and briefed him about the affairs in the PCB. Khan wanted to meet Musharraf to get his approval to major decisions including about the future of chief executive Rameez Raja who, he said, should chose between his job as CEO and television commentator. Raja, who was also appointed by Musharraf, wanted to keep both the posts. It appears that Musharraf was deeply upset over the way the Pakistan team lost to India in both the one-dayers and Test series and the subsequent controversy in which fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and other senior cricketers were asked to prove their injuries before a medical inquiry commission.

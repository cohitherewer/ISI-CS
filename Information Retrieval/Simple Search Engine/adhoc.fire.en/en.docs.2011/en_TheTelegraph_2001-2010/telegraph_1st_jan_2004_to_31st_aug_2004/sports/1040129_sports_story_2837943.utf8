The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Just one blemish in Barretos career
 FREE-KICK / P.K. Banerjee Barreto has taken a wrong  step Bhowmick must be lauded  for his choice of players The first phase of the National Football League has gone along predictable lines. Teams tipped to do well have done so, in varying degrees of success and failure, and the deserved ones occupy the tops slots. It was widely anticipated that the Goan outfits, East Bengal and Mahindra United would be among the top contenders and the completion of the initial half didnt see too many incidents against what was predicted. In a story largely following the script so far, there has been one climax, major to say the least. And though it happened a few days back, its ramifications will be realised in the time to come. No marks for guessing that we are talking about the great exit of Jose Ramirez Barreto. What a wonderful ambassador of football this Brazilian had been! From countless moments of sublime skill on the pitch and an impeccable track record off it, Barreto was on his way to attaining immorality in the lore of Indian football. Very few of those to have played this game in this country were known to have possessed this unique ability to enthral and terrorise at the same time. Barretos skill, dedication, integrity, vision and craftsmanship were exemplary and it delighted friends and foes alike. And alongside being the epitome of hope among Mohun Bagan fans, he was widely respected and liked by rival fans for his deeds on and off the field. Here was a hundred per cent team man, who stood for the values the game treasures and remained committed to one team. At the same time, he was a devout family man and an individual who drew much of his inspiration from his faith in the almighty. The summation of these virtues reflected the image of man Indian ethos describe as the ideal one. Barreto had no parallel. Unquestionably, he was the most exceptional foreign player to have plied his trade in India. As player, he would surely rank among the best ever to have played here and the other traits make him the perfect role model. Emeka Ezeugo, Chima Okerie, Majid Baskar were all players of calibre with some character, but didnt possess such an unblemished reputation like Barreto. But then, as if to show he is human, Barreto erred. His decision to quit Mohun Bagan, breaking the contract he had, was hasty to say the least and the question of unprofessional behaviour has to loom large. Doesnt matter how isolated, insulted and hurt he had been. Doesnt matter that administrative efficiency in Mohun Bagan is not getting better by the day. Barreto has most probably taken a wrong step by leaving his team in unprecedented manner mid-season. If rules of the game warrant punishment for this, he deserves it, much like the praise he does for his exploits on the pitch. You can be a great player, may even be the greatest of them all, but cant be greater than the laws defining professional conduct. Barreto, its a massive loss to see you go, for you had most of those things a sportsman should and yet, left a question mark over your commitment to a cause. We will miss you, but at the same time, say with conviction that the laws of the game should give you a good look while determining your fate. It seems that you have committed a foul and the referee here should not weigh your reputation before choosing the colour of his card. Coming back to the NFL, East Bengal, Dempo and Mahindra United look the likes to be able to have a crack at the title. The other Goan teams can also come close and I dont think Mohun Bagan can make up for what they have lost. Realistically, East Bengal have a good chance because of three reasons. One, they have best reserve bench in the country. Even if their substitute players perform to potential, East Bengal can be the best team in the country. A major share of the credit here goes to Subhas Bhowmick. The coach should reap the rewards for choosing his men in the manner he did. And if East Bengal succeed in fielding their first team, with all the foreigners, they will be clear 2-0 favourites even against the Indian team. This is no mean force. Second, the factor of home matches should also go in East Bengals favour as they play just two away matches in the second phase. With the kind of ammunition they have, they should win 90 per cent of these matches, which should be big boost in their quest for supremacy. I dont think the winners this time will score more than 40-44 points and if East Bengal maintain their good record at home, they will be difficult to catch. Last but not least, a major advantage for East Bengal is the fact is that they will play the AFC Championship matches during the break in the NFL. This would keep their team in match practice and also allow Bhowmick the chance to experiment and work on the right combination.  Copyright

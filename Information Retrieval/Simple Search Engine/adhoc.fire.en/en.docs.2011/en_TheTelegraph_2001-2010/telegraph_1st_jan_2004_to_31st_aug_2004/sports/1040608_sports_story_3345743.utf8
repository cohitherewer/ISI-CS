				 																																																	 Bengal lost the national under-21 football final 1-4 to Punjab in Jamalpur Saturday and the joint coaches (Sishir Ghosh and Mihir Bose) have slammed the players for being unruly. Now, the IFA has banned all 22 in the squad from the transfers market. This includes players like Syed Rahim Nabi and Madhab Das.				 																																																	IFA secretary Subrata Dutta indicated Monday that the coaches and managers reports will be placed before appropriate bodies of the association before any relaxation on the ban is made. It is learnt that the coaches had claimed that the players did not listen to them. The association will soon decide on its future course of action.				 																																																	 Rishi Kapoor and Sanjeev Maria withdrew in favour of Mohun Bagan in the IFA transfers. And, as expected, goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar got his inter-state clearance, to play for East Bengal. Tollygunge Agragami picked up Mohammed Rafique from Ever-Ready, Supratik Aind from Wari and junior Ramen Basak. Tapan Giri withdrew in favour of Ever-Ready, so did Amit Das.				 																																																	 Sidhu Dutta, organiser and official of top institutions in the Maidan, was remembered on his birth centenary at the Union Sporting Club on Saturday. Dutta was a top administrator in the 1940s and 50s, involved with the BHA, the IFA and the Bengal Gymkhana (before the CAB). He resigned as Union Sporting treasurer in 1980. He died in 1986. 				 																																																	 Eastern Railway and Peerless won their matches in the Khadims Trades Cup. The railway team beat Bata, through a goal by Manojit Sarkar, while Peerless beat FCI via a goal by Henry.				 																																																	 A meeting to condole the death of state kabaddi player Maidul Tarafdar (who died at SSKM hospital on June 3 after being injured during play) will be held at Chakda Stadium (the players hometown) on Sunday. This will be organised by the Nadia District Kabaddi Association.				 																																																	AQUATICS: Age-group state championships, third day at Subhas Sarobar pool from 11am.

				 																																	London: Road running and road walking performances can be officially classified as world records, athletics governing body the IAAF confirmed on Thursday.				 																																	Under new guidelines agreed at the 44th IAAF Congress in Paris in August, world records will now be recognised in mens and womens road races from 10km to 100km, including the marathon, and 20km and 50km race walking. Until now records in these events had been officially acknowledged as world bests by the IAAF.				 																																	Paula Radcliffe, who set a new best for womens marathon in London last April of two hours 15.25 minutes and who can now boast the 10km and 20km road world records, said the decision will help to raise the profile of road running. I think this is a big step forward, the British runner said on the IAAFs website.				 																																	Polands Robert Korzeniowski becomes the inaugural world record holder at the mens 50km race walk. 				 																																	Kozhikode: Lack of sponsorship was preventing India from hosting more number of international chess championships, despite it receiving bids for major events, fide vice-president P. T. Ummer Koya has said.				 																																	While our country has been able to win several international bids, unfortunately we dont find sufficient sponsors to conduct the mega tournaments, Koya said.				 																																	The world youth Olympiad and world junior championship would be held in the country in July and September this year, he said, adding the All India Chess Federation (AICF) was yet to identify a state for sponsoring the games.				 																																	London: World Cup-winning flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson could be back in action within weeks after being reassured about a shoulder injury he suffered in a club match last weekend. 				 																																	Newcastle director of rugby Rob Andrew said Wilkinson had seen a specialist who had confirmed there was no long-term damage.

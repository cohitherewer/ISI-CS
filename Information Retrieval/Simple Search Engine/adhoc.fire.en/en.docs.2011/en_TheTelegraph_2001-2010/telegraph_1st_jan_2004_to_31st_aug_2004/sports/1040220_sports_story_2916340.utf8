 ICC lines up new measures
Dambulla: The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday it was taking new measures to deal with suspect bowling actions. The ICC announcement comes on the eve of the first one-day International between Sri Lanka and Australia, the two countries which share a contentious history over the action of spinner Muttiah Muralidharan. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said that he understood the concerns within the game about bowlers with illegal actions and underlined the commitment of the ICC to deal with the issue openly and directly. Muralidharan, Sri Lankas top wickettaker and third most successful bowler in the world, was plunged into a chucking controversy during the 1995-96 Australian series when home umpires Darrell Hair and Ross Emerson called him for throwing. Muralidharan was not reachable for comment, but a Sri Lanka cricket official called the timing of the ICCs statement unfortunate. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the board hopes that the Muralidharan issue is not re-opened. After the 1995-96 incident, the ICC thoroughly examined and exonerated Muralidharans bowling techniques. The ICC is working at both the international level through its reporting, reviewing and suspension procedures and at the domestic level, where it is ensuring that each country is developing an effective system to address any concerns before players emerge on to the international stage, Speed said in the statement. The ICC has identified Jermaine Lawson of the West Indies, Sanwar Hossain of Bangladesh and Shabbir Ahmed of Pakistan with suspected bowling action. While much of the focus has been on fast bowlers, spinners were now coming under the spotlight. The ICC are commissioning new research relating to spinners so that we have a clear, fact based understanding of what actually takes place in a spinners action rather than solely relying on the naked eye or on TV replays which have proven to be deceptive, Speed said.

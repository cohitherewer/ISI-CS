 Humpy wins first game
 - WORLD WOMENS CHESS - Indian GM a draw away from semis berth  Humpy beat Xu Yuhua with attacking chess Elista (Kalmykia), May 29 (PTI): Playing attacking chess, Grandmaster Koneru Humpy beat World Cup champion Xu Yuhua of China in the first game of the Womens World Chess quarter finals on Saturday. With this win, Humpy inched closer to the semi-final berth as she needs just a draw in the return game on Sunday, in which Xu will have white pieces. The day witnessed exciting chess with not even a single draw in three matches so far. Former world champion Maia Chiburdanidze of Georgia was in her elements as she outplayed Viktorija Cmilyte of Lithuania, while Ketino Kachiani-G of Germany beat Russian Ekaterina Kovalevskaya. Humpy stole the limelight with an exemplary display of attacking chess that saw Xu Yuhua crumbling. It was a Queens Indian defence and Humpy was well-armed. I prepared the middle position extensively as she had played something similar against Zhu Chen (reigning World Women champion), and, in fact she played the opening very precisely and got a very reasonable position but her planning went awry thereafter, said Humpy. The middle game was a delight to watch once Yuhua made a mistake on her 16th move as that only added more power to Humpys eventual exploits as she went for a double pawn sacrifice to initiate the decisive onslaught. Yes I thought that she had left many holes and weaknesses in her position, the pawn sacrifices were not really planned but the situation demanded it and once my pieces got going all her pawns fell one after another, Humpy said. Once the material balance shifted in Humpys favour, it was just a matter of time before the inevitable happened. Xu, who had beaten Humpy in the semi-finals of the World Cup at Hyderabad in 2002, called it a day on her 36th turn. Chiburdanidze defeated Cmilyte from the white side of another Queens Indian albeit with a positional approach. The Georgian, who has not been playing much, opted for a safe but less played system and allowed Cmilyte to get an easy game. However, as the endgame surfaced after some routine exchanges, Chiburdanidze did a class act, penetrating the queenside with her queen and allowing an attack against her own king. Cmilyte found that her attack was only optical and even though she had an extra piece to boast off, white was ready to promote a pawn to the queening square. The game lasted 42 moves. Kovalevskaya played some harmless chess with white pieces against Kachiani and yet got a double-edged position thanks to the ambition shown by her opponent. The complexities that ensued were mind-blowing but Kovalevskayas calculations proved wrong, as she failed to get any desirable compensation for her sacrificed rook. Kachiani finished the game in style through a fine combination that won her whites queen on the 39th move.  Copyright

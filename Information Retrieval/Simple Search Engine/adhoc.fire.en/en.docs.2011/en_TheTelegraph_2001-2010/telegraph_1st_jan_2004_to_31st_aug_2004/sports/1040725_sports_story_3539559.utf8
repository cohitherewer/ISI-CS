 - PARIS MEET l Ill be fine in Athens, says Olympic champion  Portugals Francis Obikwelu (left) crosses the 100m finish line ahead of American Maurice Greene during at the Golden League meet in Saint Denis on Friday. (Reuters) Paris, July 24 (Reuters): Nigeria-born Portuguese Francis Obikwelu upset Olympic champion Maurice Greene on his 30th birthday in the mens 100 metres at the Paris Golden League meet on Friday. Obikwelu, a member of the minority Ibo tribe who emigrated to Portugal in 1994 and became a citizen three years ago, clocked 10.06 seconds to Greenes 10.14. Greene, who will defend his Olympic title in Athens next month after finishing first in the US trials, finished second in 10.14. His reaction time was the slowest of the eight men who finished the race. Greene, who will now remain in Europe until September, promised to run a sub-10 second time at the London Grand Prix on Friday but said he was uncertain whether he could compete in Zurich a week later. Obikwelu, European silver-medallist two years ago in 100 and 200, said it was only two weeks since he recovered from a pulled hamstring. He showed no ill-effects on Friday, returning to the track to win the 200 in a national record 20.12. The five athletes  Felix Sanchez, Tonique Williams-Darling, Hestrie Cloete, Christian Olsson and Virgilijus Alekna  still in contention for the $1 million jackpot, shared by competitors who win each of their designated Golden League events, all won at the third of the six elite European meet- ings. World champion Sanchez of the Dominican Republic, unbeaten over the 400 hurdles for three years, drew level with American champion James Carter at the fifth barrier and strode away to win in 47.99 seconds. Williams-Darling of the Bahamas clocked the fastest time of the year when she won the womens 400 in 49.15 seconds by five metres from Romanian Ionela Tirlea-Manolache. Her time was also a national record. The three field event contenders for the jackpot, South African womens high-jumper Cloete (1.99m), Swedish mens triple-jumper Olsson (17.41) and Lithuanian mens discus thrower Alekna (70.21), all won comfortably. In other events, Kenyan Bernard Lagat set a seasons best with the first sub-3:30 time of the year in mens 1,500. Lagat clocked 3: 29.21 seconds. American Jerome Young returned to the track where he won the world 400 title last year to jeers and whistles from some sections of the crowd of 63,851. During the championships an American newspaper revealed Young tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in 1999 and this month the IAAF annulled the result of the 2000 Sydney Olympic 4x400m final because Young had competed in two early rounds for the champions. Young, who has failed to qualify for Athens, finished sixth out of seven on Friday.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Parthiv will not open again in Tests: Sourav
 - India skipper all praise for teamwork, especially Pathan and Balaji  BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS  Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble on their arrival in Bangalore on Sunday Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys homecoming early Sunday morning was a quiet affair. A few curious onlookers at the airport, but no show of political strength as witnessed in New Delhi on Saturday, greeted the Team India captain on arrival by a Sahara flight. Sourav, too, seemed to enjoy the ambience. He posed for photographs and met every request from the large contingent of print and electronic mediamen present at the airport who made the bulk of the gathering, apart from a couple of CAB functionaries and his family members. Later, more relaxed at home, Sourav made it clear that Parthiv Patels opening the innings in Rawalpindi was a one-off affair. Parthiv will not open the innings in Tests. Either Yuvraj Singh or Akash Chopra will do the job alongside Virender Sehwag, he said. He remarked that Parthivs batting was one of the positives from the Pakistan tour. The emergence of Parthiv as a batsman and the bowling of Irfan Pathan and Lakshmipathy Balaji are the biggest gains. Parthiv has done a good job behind the stumps as well as with the bat. Sourav was also all praise for Yuvraj. This was the first time he played in Pakistan and his performance was quite outstanding. And more so, because he has been a non-regular on the Test circuit. Despite having created history in Rawalpindi, Sourav does not regard the innings victory as the best during his reign. I will rate the Adelaide victory as the best followed by the win against the Aussies at Eden Gardens. Rawalpindi will rank third among my favourites, he said. He felt defeating the Australians in their own backyard was a greater achievement. They are the best side in the world, he remarked, in the company of wife Dona and daughter Sana. Even in his para in Behala, few were around to welcome Sourav home. A huge bouquet of flowers was presented by a local well-wisher. The posse of securitymen had a fairly easy and smooth outing at the airport and at his residence. Sourav felt the absence of frontline bowlers Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh was not felt because of the team effort. All the others stepped in to bridge the gap, which is a good sign for India cricket, he said. Once these guys are back our attack will be formidable. Asked if he ranked the current side the best-ever, Sourav said: I dont know, because I havent played in the earlier teams. All I can say is that this team comprises a bunch of good players, who are individually very talented. I cant tell you the date from which we became Team India. Its a process through which a team is built over a time. Sourav is now focussing on the hard-earned break. Its been a long series. Indo-Pak matches are always high pressure games and its good to be on the winning side. Im looking forward to the break. For now it will be rest for a couple of months.  Copyright

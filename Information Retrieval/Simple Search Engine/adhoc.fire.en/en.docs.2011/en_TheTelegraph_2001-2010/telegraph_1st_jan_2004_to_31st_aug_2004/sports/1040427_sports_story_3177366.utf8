 Rebel players dispute ZCU mediation claim
Harare: The Zimbabwe Cricket Unions (ZCU) claim that it has agreed upon a mediation procedure with the 15 rebel players has been disputed. The ZCU has furnished to Heath Streak and the players a proposal that they make themselves available immediately for selection and that if this is done, a mediation procedure will be immediately established for the players outstanding grievances, to be ventilated before an independent mediator, a ZCU statement said on Monday. Agreement has been reached upon who the mediator will be and it is sincerely hoped that the impasse will be resolved on this basis, hopefully by the end of Tuesday. Vince Hogg, ZCU managing director, said the mediator was Much Masunda, a professional arbitrator in Zimbabwe. Hes very well respected by both parties, Hogg said. However, a player, who declined to be named, disputed that the mediation process had been confirmed. There has been talk about mediation and about this process leading to arbitration, because we believe it will lead to arbitration, the player said. But we are still not up to date with regard to confirming mediation. We think it is Much Masunda, but were not sure because we havent voted on Much Masunda. Hogg said The players need to come back to work, mediation and discussion can continue. Im expecting them back at work on Wednesday. They should be available for Thursdays match (the fourth one-day International against Sri Lanka), if theyre fit, and for the Test matches if the selectors choose them. The player said the rebels would refuse to make the first move. The ZCU is telling us to go back to practice before mediation takes place, and we believe it should happen the other way around, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

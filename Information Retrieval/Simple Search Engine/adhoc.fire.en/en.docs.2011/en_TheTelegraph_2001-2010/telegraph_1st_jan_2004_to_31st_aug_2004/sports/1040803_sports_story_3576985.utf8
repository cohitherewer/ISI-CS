 Advani finishes 2nd in group 
New Delhi: World IBSF snooker champion Pankaj Advani suffered his first loss in the world under-21 snooker championship in Ireland to finish second in group D . The Indian, who had only lost four frames in his earlier six matches in the event, looked a bit out of sorts in the last group encounter going down to Tiang Pen Fei of china 2-4, according to the information received here. Advani lost the first two frames relatively poorly but came back in the third. Even as he looked like regaining his touch, the Chinese kept his cool taking the frame 62-36, 70-39, 14-73, 73-47, 0-109, 81-0 to top the group with a cent per cent win record. The opponent of Advani in the first round of the knock-out stage will be decided after the completion of all the league matches later tonight. Meanwhile, Aditya Mehta kept alive his hopes of making it to the knock-out stage by beating David Little of Ireland 67-2, 52-48, 83-8, 70-35 in group F.  (PTI)  Copyright

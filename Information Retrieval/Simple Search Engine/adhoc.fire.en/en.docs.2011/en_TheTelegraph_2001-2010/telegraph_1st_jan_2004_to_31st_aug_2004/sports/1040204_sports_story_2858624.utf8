 Reyes absence relief for Real
Madrid: The absence of Jose Antonio Reyes from Sevillas Kings Cup semi-final line-up will come as a relief to Real Madrid when they play the first leg at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Sevilla thrashed Real 4-1 in their league meeting earlier in the season, thanks largely to a devastating attacking display from the 20-year-old Spanish international. That form persuaded Arsenal to pay as much as 25 million euros ($31 million) to take him to the English Premier League last week. Sevillas chances of a place in the final, against either Alaves or Real Zaragoza, have been hit as a result. Sevilla lost in the league away to Deportivo Coruna on Sunday after a harsh penalty decision went against them and coach Joaquin Caparros is calling for even-handed refereeing on Wednesday. Its a very important game and Im worried about the attitude of the referee, Caparros said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

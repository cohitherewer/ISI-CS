 Windies stay alive
 Lance Klusener in action in Centurion on Sunday. (Reuters) Centurion: West Indies opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul struck a whirlwind 92 to pave the way for a seven-wicket win over South Africa in the fourth ODI and keep the five-match series alive on Sunday. Chanderpaul hit 10 fours and two sixes in only 75 balls and, with Ramnaresh Sarwan and Brian Lara contributing brisk half-centuries of their own, West Indies overhauled the victory target with five overs to spare. Sarwan finished on 77 not out while captain Lara smashed six fours and a six for an unbeaten 59 off just 37 deliveries as the tourists reached 300 for three. The final match will be played in Johannesburg on Wednesday. South Africa, who had led the series 2-0, piled on 297 for four after winning the toss, Jacques Kallis and Lance Klusener sharing an unbroken century stand for the fifth wicket against a lacklustre attack. Kallis, who scored hundreds in all four Tests against the West Indies and in the first ODI, made 95 not out off 97 balls while Klusener was 41 not out off 38 balls. Kallis hit seven fours and two sixes in his 46th international half-century as he and Klusener hammered 107 runs off 93 balls. Captain Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs shared 53 runs off 65 balls for the first wicket before Gibbs mistimed an on-drive to a ball from Mervyn Dillon and was caught by Dwayne Smith at mid-on for 18 in the 11th over.

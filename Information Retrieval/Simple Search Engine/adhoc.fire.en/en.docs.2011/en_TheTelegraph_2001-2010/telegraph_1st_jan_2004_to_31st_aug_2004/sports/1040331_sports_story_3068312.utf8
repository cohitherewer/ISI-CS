 Ex-Windies allrounder Perry retires
Kingston: former West Indies Test and one-day allrounder Nehemiah Perry has retired from first-class cricket. Perry played all four of his Tests in 1999, with his best effort on debut at his home ground at Sabina Park, when the lanky right-arm offspinner took a second innings five for 70 in a ten-wicket, second Test win over Australia. He helped the West Indies draw that series 2-2, then made his last appearance in the second Test defeat in New Zealand. Perry captured ten wickets for the West Indies at an average of 44.60 and scored 74 runs, average 12.33. Perry also played 21 one-day Internationals over 1999-2000. In all, he played 99 first-class matches following his debut for Jamaica in 1987, and last played for his country against Barbados in last weeks final of the Carib Beer Shield. The 35-year-old has been dogged by a persistent back injury that limited his appearances to just three first-class matches this season.  (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real put it across Bayern
 - Champions League - Arsenal, AC Milan, Monaco also reach last eight  Zinedine Zidane displays some of his immaculate skills against Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid on Wednesday. (AP) London: European champions AC Milan flirted with elimination before crushing Sparta Prague 4-1 Wednesday to reach the Champions League quarter finals. They were joined in the last eight by Real Madrid, who beat Bayern Munich 1-0 with a goal from Zinedine Zidane for a 2-1 aggregate win. Their success was marred by a flare-up between the players at the end of injury time but no one was booked. Real have now qualified for the last eight of the Champions League for the seventh successive season to equal Manchester Uniteds record. The Red Devils lost the chance of making it eight in a row as they were eliminated by Porto Tuesday. Also through from the first knockout round are Arsenal, who beat 10-man Celta Vigo 2-0 with two first-half goals by Thierry Henry for a 5-2 aggregate victory. His two goals set a new European scoring record by a French player with 39 goals  one more than the all-time record previously held by Jean-Pierre Papin. Celta, behind to begin with after losing the home leg 3-2, finished with 10 men after Pablo Contreras was sent off 16 minutes from time for a second offence. Monaco played most of their match against 10 men, beating Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0 to squeeze through on the away goals rule after losing the first leg 2-1. Croatian Dado Prso, who scored four when Monaco beat Deportivo La Coruna 8-3 in November, got Monacos winner after 60 minutes to make amends for a first-half penalty miss. Wednesdays winning quartet will go into Fridays quarter final draw with Porto, Chelsea, Olympique Lyon and Deportivo La Coruna who all qualified Tuesday. Milan are in the draw but were briefly heading towards the exit when Sparta substitute Tomas Jun scored two minutes after coming on to put the Czechs level at 1-1 in the match  and ahead on away goals after the 0-0 first-leg draw two weeks ago. Milan then endured a nervous seven minutes before Andriy Shevchenko put them 2-1 up with a well-taken header. Thirteen minutes later he made it 3-1 and Gennaro Gattuso completed the scoring five minutes from time. Filippo Inzaghi had scored Milans opener on the stroke of halftime. Real recorded a slender 1-0 win over Bayern. The only goal at the Bernabeu was scored on the 32nd minute when Zidane fired home unopposed after Michel Salgado made the most of a hesitant Bayern defence. The match ended with the players pushing and shoving each other but Zidane was not too bothered and walked off with a Bayern shirt draped in triumph across his shoulders. Arsenal had no problems reaching the last eight. Manager Arsene Wenger, whose team, like Real Madrid are chasing a treble of domestic cup and league as well as the European Cup, was modest about the victory afterwards.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

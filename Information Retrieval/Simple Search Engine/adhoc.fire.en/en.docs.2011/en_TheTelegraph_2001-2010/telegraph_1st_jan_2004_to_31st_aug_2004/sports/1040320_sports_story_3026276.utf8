 Styris keeps NZ in business 
 Scott Styris after reaching his third Test century in Auckland on Friday Auckland: Scott Styris shone with the bat and Chris Martin with the ball as New Zealand dominated the second day of the second Test against South Africa here. Styris blasted an unbeaten 118 as New Zealand reached 201 for three at close on Friday after recalled medium-pacer Martin had ripped through South Africas batting. The Proteas, commencing the day on 231 for two, were bowled out for 296 as Martin took five to return career-best figures of six for 76. Craig McMillan was giving Styris company with 31, the pair having added 64 for the fourth wicket in a little over 11 overs. The New Zealand reply began shakily when they lost Michael Papps and skipper Stephen Fleming cheaply to be struggling at 12 for two before Styris joined Mark Richardson and started the fightback. Papps wicket was a significant one for Shaun Pollock, who overtook Allan Donald as South Africas leading Test wicket-taker with 331. Im really chuffed about it, Pollock said. When you start your career you concentrate hard on getting your first wicket. Now Ive beaten someone like Allan Donald. The belligerent Styris and the methodical Richardson hauled the home side out of trouble with a record third-wicket partnership of 125, beating the 50-year-old mark against South Africa of 94 set by Matt Poore and Bert Sutcliffe in Cape Town. As the partnership progressed, Styris provided the big hits and Richardson the deft touches, although the left-handed opener went out to an aggressive shot. He had hit Jacques Kallis off the back foot through the covers for four and off the next ball attempted the same shot, but slashed it straight to Herschelle Gibbs at gulley to be out for 45. Styris went on to score his third Test century off 121 balls in 173 minutes, hitting 16 fours and two sixes. Earlier, the tourists lost eight wickets for 65 runs in a dramatic collapse.

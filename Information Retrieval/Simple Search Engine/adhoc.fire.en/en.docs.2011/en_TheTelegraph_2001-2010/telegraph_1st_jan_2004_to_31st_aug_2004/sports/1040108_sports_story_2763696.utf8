 Brian Lara applauds Dwayne Smith effort
 Dwayne Smith after his century on debut in Cape Town on Tuesday. (Reuters) Cape Town: West Indies captain Brian Lara hailed Dwayne Smith as a model young cricketer after the 20-year-old scored a century on debut to help his side draw the third Test against South Africa on Tuesday. Smith hit an unbeaten 105 at a run-a-ball as the West Indies batted through the final day before reaching the close on 354 for five. It was the innocence of youth and all credit must go to him for the way he played, Lara said. Its good to see the young guys coming in and being very positive  they seem to have the passion for the game. Thats been missing for quite some time. What Ive seen from young Smith so far is tremendous. His work ethic is great and that is what you need. You need to prepare yourself properly for Test cricket. Smith did not even have a first-class fifty to his name before the Newlands Test, but became the first West Indian to score a century on debut since Basil Williams against Australia in Guyana in 1977-78. The young Barbados allrounder said he had tried to play his natural game, despite the pressure of the situation on the last day. I told myself to be positive and not let anything worry me and if I could bat to the end, I could come close to a hundred, he said. Its an achievement for me and Im happy. South Africa captain Graeme Smith was fulsome in praise of his own team after the draw meant the hosts have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Im very happy, he said. We started the series with two fantastic wins. Its always tough to keep your focus during the festive season but the boys were terrific. Im really proud of the way they stood up and were counted. I thought we played really well. (Reuters)  Copyright

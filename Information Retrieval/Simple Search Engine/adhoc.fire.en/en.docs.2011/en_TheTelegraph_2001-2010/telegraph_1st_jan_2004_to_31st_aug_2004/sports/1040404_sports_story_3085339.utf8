The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Comeback crown for Serena
 - MIAMI MASTERS - Roddick to clash with Coria in final  Andy Roddick celebrates his victory over Vince Spadea in Florida on Friday. (Reuters) Miami: Andy Roddick dismissed fellowAmerican Vince Spadea 6-1, 6-3 on Friday to secure a place in the Miami Masters final against Argentinas Guillermo Coria. I pretty much dominated the match from start to finish, which is what I wanted to do against Vince, Roddick said. It was a good performance. Roddick, seeded second, appeared to be able to break the Spadea serve at will early on and was he was barely tested in the first set. After losing his serve again at the start of the second, the unseeded Spadea battled in vain to keep the scoreline respectable before Roddick wrapped up the match in an hour and five minutes. Before running into Roddick, Spadea had won 11 of his last 12 matches and picked up his first ATP tour title in Scottsdale last month at the age of 29, but he was no match for the US Open champion. Earlier, third seeded Coria pulled off a miraculous comeback against Fernando Gonzalez, saving four match points to beat the Chilean 4-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1 and book a place in Sundays final. When I was on court I never gave up, I continued to fight because the match is never over until you shake hands with your opponent, said the Argentine, through a translator. For all Corias grit, his win owed plenty to the attack of nerves Gonzalez suffered when he served for the match at a set and 5-4 up. He missed two match points in that game, allowing Coria to level. I went on court a little flat because he doesnt give you any rhythm, Coria said. Luckily, I was able to react at the right time. Gonzalez seemed to have the match in the palm of his hand again in the second set tiebreak when he mustered another two match points, only to find himself again paralysed by nerves. He surrendered the set on a double fault and, having been handed a lifeline, Coria ran away with the third set as Gonzalez became increasingly dispirited. I know exactly what happened but Im very disappointed, Gonzalez lamented. After four matchpoints, its tough to come back, especially when you are playing against Guillermo, who is such a good fighter. Its the first time it ever happened to me. Everybody is nervous but you have to play good when youre nervous. It happens to all of us, and I just hope to get some experience from this. The 22-year-old Coria is better known for his prowess on clay than on hard courts. Of his seven career titles, six have been on the slower surface  his victory indoors in Basel last October being the exception. Roddick has beaten Coria on their two previous meetings.

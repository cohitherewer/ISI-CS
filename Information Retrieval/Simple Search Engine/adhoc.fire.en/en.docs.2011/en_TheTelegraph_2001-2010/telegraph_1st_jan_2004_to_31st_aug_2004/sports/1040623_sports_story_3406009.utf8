 Hari holds Ivanchuk
 Harikrishna has forced another tie-break Tripoli: GM P. Harikrishna drew yet again with GM Vassily Ivanchuk and forced the match into tiebreaker in the second round of the world chess championship on Tuesday. IM Neelotpal Das also continued with his good form and held GM Ashot Anastesian to a draw for the second time in succession in the two-game mini match. Neelotpal will also play a tie-break now. Top seeded GM Veselin Topalov proceeded to the third round with back to back victories over compatriot Alexander Delchev. Also moving to the next round was Romanian Liviu-Dieter Nisipainu, who drew his second game against Dutch GM Sergei Tiviakov after winning the first game. Harikrishna was in for a pleasant surprise in the opening as Ivanchuk went for the the exchange varition of the Slav defence, playing white. Slow and steady manoeuvres ensued from both sides and subsequent exchange of pieces led to a level minor pieces endgame where Harikrishna had difficulty in securing the balance. The draw was agreed to in 47 moves. Neelotpal gave an ouster threat to Anastesian as he held a much better position for the major part of the game that witnessed the Caro Cann defence. Playing white, the Indian won a pawn in the opening itself but did not succeed in controlling his opponents counter play with the bishop pair in the endgame. After 41 moves, there was not much left to play for and the peace was signed. Earlier, the most dramatic game involved Commonwealth champion Nigel Short who suffered what is called chess blindness as he dropped his rook in the final stages of his match against Michael Krasenkow. Short, who had been nursing an exchange up position for a long time in the game, apparently lost concentration and left his rook on a square controlled by Krasenkows knight. The last one to end in the day, the game last 122 moves. GM Kritz Leonid of Germany, who beat Indias best bet Krishnan Sasikiran in the first round failed to live up to expectations against Brazilian GM Rafael Leitao and went down with his white pieces. GMs Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark and Alexander Graf of Germany drew with Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Vladislav Tkachiev of France, respectively. (PTI)  Copyright

 Five to face medical commission
Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday appointed a four-member medical commission to probe the spate of injuries to its players during the India series. The players have been asked to appear before the panel by this week. The commission will examine Shoaib Akhtar, Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul. The commission has not been constituted to find a scapegoat. It will try to find why so many players got injured, and what can be done to prevent so many injuries in future, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said in a statement. Although he warned that strict action will be taken if anyone is found guilty of feigning injury, Rameez added the inquiry will also help answer accusations that cricketers faked injuries. The other objective is to help the players get their names cleared from the general perception that they faked injuries, if they were genuinely injured. I must make myself very clear that if it is proved that some players did fake injuries, they will be taken to task. Shoaib, who is currently shooting for a commercial in Mumbai, has been asked to appear before the commission on Sunday. Others are expected to appear before that. The commission, announced by PCB chief Shaharyar Khan, includes Pakistan team doctor Riaz Ahmed and is headed by orthopaedic surgeon Dr Abdul Wajid.  (PTI)  Copyright

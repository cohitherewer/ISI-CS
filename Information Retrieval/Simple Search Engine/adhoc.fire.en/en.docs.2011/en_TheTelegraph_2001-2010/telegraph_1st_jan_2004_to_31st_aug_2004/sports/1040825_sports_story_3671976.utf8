The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav, Ponting play mind games
 Shane Warne will make the difference, feels Ponting Amsterdam: India and Australia may be slated to clash in a Test series only later this year, but mind games are already on with Ricky Ponting declaring that Indians wont find Shane Warne an easy proposition when they tour the sub-continent in October. Shane has not done well on the last two tours to India but I know for a fact he was battling a few niggles. But now he is in top shape, the ball is coming out right from his hands and he sure would be a factor when we tour in October, said the Australian captain. He was speaking to reporters after the tri-series match against India was abandoned due to rain. Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly acknowledged Warne to be a big enough factor in world cricket but felt his batsmen would take a lot of confidence going into the series because of how they have done in the past against the leg-spinner. He is obviously their key bowler. He would make a difference to any side. But we have played him well over the years. Still, he is the kind of bowler who can win matches any day, he said. Warnes return to international cricket after a one-year ban for a positive dope test before the 2003 World Cup has been nothing short of sensational. He caught up with Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan as the leading Test wicket taker for a while and is now poised to overtake him. Muralidharan has been ruled out of action for six months owing to a shoulder problem. Sourav, who led his side to a Test win in Australia in the last season during the four-match series which resulted in a 1-1 draw, accepted that his side would have to be up for it especially in the wake of Australias 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka recently. They indeed did well in Sri Lanka and we have to be up for it. Still, we would now be meeting them three times in a year and thats enough, frankly speaking. Indeed, Australians proved that they had adapted brilliantly to the sub-continent conditions of Sri Lanka where Shane Warne made a remarkable return to Test cricket with 26 wickets at 20.03 from the three games. We have performed well in Tests over the last two years. We hope to do it again when they come to India, said Sourav. Australia have not won a series in India since 1969-70 and the burning ambition of their former captain Steve Waugh to conquer the last frontier remained unfulfilled. We have to really play them to know how it is going to be any different in the absence of Steve Waugh. Steve was a legend and people in India respect him. Its going to be a new side for them with young boys. But you can never take Australia lightly, Sourav said. Sourav believed that the four-Test series in October-November would be the biggest series of the year. (PTI)  Copyright

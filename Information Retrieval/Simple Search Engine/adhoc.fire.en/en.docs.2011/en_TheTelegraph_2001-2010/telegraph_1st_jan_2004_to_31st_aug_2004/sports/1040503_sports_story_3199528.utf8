 Beckham to stay on at Real, say reports 
 Unless Real want to sell him, Beckham will stay London: Real Madrids director of football Jorge Valdano has no doubts England captain David Beckham will be playing at the club next season, British press reported on Sunday. The former Manchester United midfielder has reportedly been targeted by Arsenal and Chelsea but Valdano said he expected Beckham to remain at the Bernabeu stadium at least till the summer of 2005. Valdano, reported to have met Beckham at a funeral last week, told The Observer: Nothing has changed. I have spoken to him and he is calm. That view was backed up by comments from the midfielders personal assistant Terry Byrne. He told The People: Unless Real want to sell him, hes staying. The truth is, we dont know where the stories about him leaving are coming from, but its not us. Real told me they dont want to sell him. The situation remains the same because we always said we would review the situation after two years and he hasnt even finished his first season. Hes happy in Madrid and hes staying. Obviously we have talked about what would happen if he came home but there are only a few clubs he could go to. We will sit down with Real at the end of the season and discuss his future, but the bottom line is that David loves playing for Real Madrid.  (AFP)  Copyright

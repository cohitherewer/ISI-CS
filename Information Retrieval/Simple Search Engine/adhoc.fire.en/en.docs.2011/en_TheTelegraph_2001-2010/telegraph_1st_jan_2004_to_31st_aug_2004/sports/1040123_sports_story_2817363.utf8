 Agassi like a son to me: Trainer
			Melbourne: Andre Agassis personal trainer Gil Reyes says the bond between the pair is so close that Agassi is like a son to me. When asked in Melbournes Herald Sun tabloid if Reyes, who has been with Agassi since 1990, would protect Andre to the absolute, he said he would. If someone approached me and said, listen, I want to hire you to take a bullet for somebody, Id say youve got the wrong guy, said Reyes. But if a friend came to me, especially a dear, close friend like Andre, and said he was in danger, he was scared for his life, and would you help me, the answer would be automatically yes.  Towards the light  Languages, fashion design, computer programmes, music.  Venus Williams says she likes to learn new things, but tennis  remains the central focus despite her lengthy off-court  list. Venus said on Thursday that her mother Oracene at times worries that she tries too much. She doesnt want me to lose my focus on the tennis, which I wont, the four-time Grand Slam winner said. Its like my lighthouse. Im always going towards the tennis. But she said there were things that also took her in other directions and for me, its important to be well-rounded in order for me to do my best at the tennis. Venus said she plays the guitar and the bass, but also wants to learn keyboards. What else is on my list? I have things on my list that are like life goals, goals for 2004, she said. Theres a lot of things Id like to do. You know, I write. I write poetry in my spare time. Just different things that I try.  Putting a foot right  Kim Clijsters may come from faraway Belgium but her  links with Australia are strong. Not only is she engaged  to Australias Lleyton Hewitt, but she has developed a liking  for Australian Rules Football. Hewitt, a former world No. 1 and two-time Grand Slam winner, is an enthusiastic follower of the Adelaide Crows team from his home-town. Clijsters, not surprisingly, has also started to support the Crows after becoming friends with a number of the teams players. I know all the rules now, Clijsters said at the Australian Open on Thursday. I cant wait to come here and watch a few of their games. Its really the kind of sport that I really enjoy watching, its always busy, always a lot of stuff going on. I do like soccer as well, but you can have nil-nil matches and not really have seen that much, Clijsters said. She was then asked if she had a choice about which team she followed. Sure, Ive got my own leanings, too.  (AP)  Copyright

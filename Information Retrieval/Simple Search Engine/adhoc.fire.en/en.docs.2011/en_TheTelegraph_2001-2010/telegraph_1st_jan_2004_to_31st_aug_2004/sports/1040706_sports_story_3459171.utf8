The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zagorakis named best
Lisbon: Greece captain Theodoros Zagorakis was named the Player of Euro 2004 on Monday, the day after Greeces shock 1-0 win over Portugal in the final. The choice was made by Uefas eight-man technical study group plus one vote from fans who had named their preferred player on the organisers website. A hard-working midfielder Zagorakis was also named Man of the Match for the final which completed a remarkable success for Greece, who had been 80-1 outsiders before the tournament. Zagorakis will be presented with his trophy at a gala in Monaco on August 26. The 32-year-old AEK Athens midfielder was one of five Greek players named in an All-Star Squad by the panel.

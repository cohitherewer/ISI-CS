The Telegraph - Calcutta
 End of a bleak tale
 SUJIT BHAR  Sobha was courageousAthens: It was touted to be the strongest Indian Olympic contingent ever. That meant it was good enough for multiple-medal performances. By the end of the Athens Games, one finds little by way of explanation as to the disgraceful result shown by most of our athletes, a silver by Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore in double trap notwithstanding. That too had been tarnished by the double-doping scandal that hit Sanamacha Chanu and Pratima Kumari. The tennis duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi also raised hopes, losing the bronze match after a marathon fight that went into the wee hours of the morning. A look at the different squads will clear up the picture. The archers kicked off Indias efforts. In the categorising on Day I, Dola Banerjee was ranked 13th, Reena Kumari 43rd and Sumangala Sharma 20th. The men were ranked Sawaiyan Majhi (22), Tarundeep Rai (32) and Satyadev Prasad (48). As the individual elimination rounds got going, the Indians began slipping. The team events were no better, neither the men nor the girls. The women were into the quarters but lost a close match to France. In athletics, there wasnt much hope to start with. Anju Bobby Georges pre-Olympic form didnt make her a medal-favourite. Only when recent long jump marks were studied and with a tip from the heptathlon long jumps, one thought she would be there. She made the final in style, jumping 6.69m, where the qualifying mark was 6.65, but in the final her nerves gave away after, again, the first jump. The first was 6.83m, her best-ever legal jump and a national record. But thereafter she dipped. By that time Bahadur Singh had disgraced the Indians by throwing three fouls of the putt. The huge shot-putter claimed the conditions at ancient Olympia were slippery but that wasnt an excuse. Heptathletes J.J. Sobha and Soma Biswas, especially the former, did some decent individual performances, but failed in the long run. So did sprinter Saraswati Saha. K.M. Binu reached the semi-final of the mens 400m and finished sixth, with only the womens 1,600m relay team showing any thrust in reaching the final. In the final they too capitulated, especially after best runner Manjeet Kaur reported sick. In boxing, Jitender Kumars bout with Ukrainian Andriy Fedchuk was an RSCI in round 2, because an old cut of Jitender started bleeding again. In badminton, Aparna Popat won the first round, before losing to The Netherlands Mia Audina. Hockey now. India managed to stave off the worst finish, and has called upon itself a bad reputation as a quarrelsome team too. The FIH has an Indian company as its global partner today, that clout is being clearly misused. Following a decent start vs Holland, the form stayed on the incline and even Pakistan now find India not challenge enough. In rowing, Paulose Pandari Kunnel did go a distance but failed at the semi-final stage, finishing fifth. Shooting was one of the strong points for the Indian squad, or so all were made to understand. Anjali Bhagwat was 20th in 10m air rifle qualifier, Suma Shirur made it to the final, but fared poorly. The men, except Rathore, failed too. Rathore, the only true Indian with an individual silver, was a class apart. Mouma Das exposure was short, lasting just one match, while Sarath Kamals challenge went to the second round where he lost to Hong Kongs Lai Chak Ko. Pratima Kumari and Chanu in weightlifting forced the Indians to hang their heads in shame. Kunjurani finished fourth and Sydney bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari could not even lift her weight knee-high. It was a total disaster, and a shame at that. Coach Leonid Taranenko was sacked, but the officials still persist.  Copyright

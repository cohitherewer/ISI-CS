The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A scare for Bhupathi before the French
 - Bangalorean picks up double-injury during clash vs Paes  BY AMITAVA DAS GUPTA Calcutta, May 13: A double-injury in the same match has come as a bolt from the blue for Mahesh Bhupathi less than a fortnight before the French Open championships. The moments of misfortune came in a second-round match of the $2.45 million Hamburg Masters Series meet late on Wednesday evening, when Mahesh and Max Mirnyi were involved in a high-voltage clash against Leander Paes and David Rikl. I pulled my right groin while serving at 1-1 in the second set, Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Thursday. It was quite painful, I had to call the ATP trainer for courtside attention I didnt want to continue, but Max was reluctant to throw in the towel as he was returning very well. Bhupathi and Mirnyi, who had captured the first set, resumed their battle against the Indo-Czech pair. It wasnt a wise decision. Not only did the third seeds go on to lose 6-4, 4-6, 4-6, the Indian compounded his misery by picking up a calf problem. With the right foot hurting, I transferred all my weight to the left leg and damaged the calf later in the match Conditions arent at all good for tennis here, its absolutely freezing, Bhupathi informed. Doctors had initially suspected a torn muscle which could have led to at least a fortnights lay-off. An echography, however, has revealed there is no internal bleeding. Right now, it feels really bad, Bhupathi said. But the echography result has come as a bit of relief. The doctors feel I should be able to get back on court in about 10 days. Im staying back here for two days to complete all tests and investigations. That straightaway rules Bhupathi out of any tennis before the French Open. And, if he recovers well, he may be in a position to launch a bid for a third French Open crown. His first two French conquests were with Paes (1999 and 2001). The injuries couldnt have come at a more inopportune moment for the Bangalorean as he and Mirnyi were showing signs of overcoming a lean patch. We were hitting form at about the right time I could have done without this, rued Bhupathi. He and Mirnyi compiled a miserable 5-4 win-loss record in four tournaments before conquering Rome on Sunday, winning their seventh crown since forging a strong partnership two years ago. The clash with Paes got totally overshadowed by Bhupathis injuries. For the record, it was the seventh time the once-inseparable Indians met across the court with Paes taking a 4-3 lead.  Copyright

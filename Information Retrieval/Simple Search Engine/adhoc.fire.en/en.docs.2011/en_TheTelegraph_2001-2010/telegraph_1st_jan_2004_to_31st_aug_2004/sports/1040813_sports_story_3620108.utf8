The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Erratic start by Tiger Woods
Kohler (Wisconsin): Britains Darren Clarke raced into an early two-shot lead in the US PGA Championship first round on Thursday as Tiger Woods made an erratic start. Clarke took advantage of relatively calm conditions at Whistling Straits to move to seven under par after 12 holes. The Northern Irishman reeled off birdies at the first four holes, and picked up two more shots on seven and eight before collecting his first bogey at the par-four ninth. Out in 31, the 35-year-old then birdied 10 and 11 to stay clear of the chasing pack. World No. 2 Ernie Els, who could replace Woods at the top of the global pecking order if he wins the tournament, was at five under after mixing six birdies with a bogey in his first 11 holes. South Koreas K.J. Choi, who had set the early pace with five consecutive birdies, was a further shot back in a tie for third, having slipped to three under after bogeying eight and nine. Level with Choi was American Justin Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion, also after 12 holes. Woods, however, was battling for consistency at two over after nine. The 1999 and 2000 PGA champion, who teed off at the par-four 10th, had made a fast start with an opening birdie, hitting his wedge approach to just four feet after an accurate drive. Standing on the tee at the monster 618-yard par-five 11th, he was forced to abort his backswing after being disturbed by a photographer. The eight-times Major winner then pulled his drive into the left rough, from where he was unable to find the fairway with his second shot. He pushed his third into thick fescue on a mound to the right of the fairway and, after punching out to the left of the green, three-putted for an ugly double-bogey seven.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

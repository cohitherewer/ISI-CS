 Dravid, Sachin hail team effort
Bangalore/Mumbai: Rahul Dravid on Sunday attributed Indias historic Test series victory in Pakistan to team effort. We played as a team right through the series, Dravid, accompanied by Anil Kumble, said at the airport. Whenever we needed a good performance from one of the bowlers or one of the batsmen, somebody came good. So, I think it was really a good team performance as everybody contributed right through the series. Asked if he ever thought that bowlers like Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan would contribute to such a great extent in Pakistan, Dravid said: They (Balaji and Pathan) came into the team in Australia as young boys and its nice to see their support to experienced people like Anil (Kumble). Anil had lacked a bit of support earlier and its nice to see that he got support and thats why we were able to win the series. Asked whether India are learning to make winning a habit, Dravid said: I hope we continue this way. Its just the first series we won. We have a long way to go. Kumble said the series victory has been a fantastic achievement. Its been first time ever that a team (from India) has won in Pakistan and I think its time to celebrate and spend some time with the family. Sachin Tendulkar too identified team effort as the key. We were concentrating on playing good and entertaining cricket and we knew if we could get our act together we would come out triumphant. On the young ones, he said: Pathan, Balaji and Yuvraj Singh, all contributed immensely and it was the total effort of each and every player which made it possible for us to win comprehensively. Tendulkar was all praise for the hospitality they got. It was great. Everywhere we went we were received warmly and people appreciated good cricket. In Chennai, Balaji said he has set his sight on becoming an allrounder. The need of the hour is to concentrate on improving my abilities in all departments of the game, like batting. V.V.S. Laxman said he was hurt by the negative comments on his form. It is sad at a time when we needed positive and morale-boosting words. Such remarks did hurt me but the only way to fight them out is to perform and I have done the same.  (PTI)  Copyright

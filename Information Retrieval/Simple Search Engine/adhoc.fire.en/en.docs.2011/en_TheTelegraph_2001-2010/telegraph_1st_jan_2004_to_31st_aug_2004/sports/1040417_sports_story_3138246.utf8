 Shoaib appears headed for trouble
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Islamabad: Controversial spearhead Shoaib Akhtar appears to be in big trouble  it came through during Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haqs Media conference in Rawalpindi on Friday afternoon. Questioned about Shoaibs attitude, Inzamam indicated its an issue that would be discussed with the Board. Among other reasons, the captain is miffed that the quick reportedly complained to (another controversial character) Rashid Latif about not getting the field of his choice. As is his style, Latif went public in a TV programme the other evening. In fact, Inzamam went to the extent of saying he was surprised at the way Shoaib batted on what became the last day of the decider. The quick, of course, lashed 28 off only 14 deliveries  an effort which wouldnt have been possible if somebody had a major injury. Shoaib, it may be recalled, went off on the second afternoon and didnt take the field at all on Day III. To say the least, his absence cost Pakistan dear. Intriguingly, while the quicks stated problem was a swollen left wrist, overnight a suspected side muscle tear got added. According to The Telegraphs sources, not everybody is convinced about the seriousness of Shoaibs injury. However, its to be seen if the Board attempts to formally solve this mystery. Pakistan lost the decider by an innings and 131 runs.  Copyright

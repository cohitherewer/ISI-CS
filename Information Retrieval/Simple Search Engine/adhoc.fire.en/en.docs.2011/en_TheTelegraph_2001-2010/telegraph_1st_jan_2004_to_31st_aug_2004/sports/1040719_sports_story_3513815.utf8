The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saudis held by Turkmenistan
Beijing: Turkmenistan snatched a dramatic 2-2 draw against three-time champions Saudi Arabia, while Iraq were beaten 1-0 by Uzbekistan at the Asian Cup on Sunday. Meanwhile, Frenchman Philippe Troussiers reign as coach of Qatar could end on a sour note after the Gulf side was upset 1-2 by Indonesia. Saudi Arabia, runners-up in Lebanon four years ago, were denied three points in Chengdu by a stoppage-time free kick from Begenchmuhammed Kuliyev. A goal down to a sixth-minute header from Nazar Bayramov, injury-hit Saudi struck back moments later through a Yasser Al Qahtani penalty. Turkmenistan defender Gochguly Gochguliev missed from the spot in the 53rd minute and when Al Qahtani scored with a looping header soon after it looked as if Saudi Arabia had survived against the former Soviet republic. But in stoppage time, Kuliyev curled a free kick into the bottom corner to secure a point for Turkmenistan on their Asian Cup debut. Uzbekistan seized the initiative in Group C against in a pulsating game decided by a superb free kick from captain Mirdjalal Kasimov in the 22nd minute. Iraq chased the equaliser but could not find a way past Uzbekistani goalkeeper Evgene Safanov. Indonesia, meanwhile, went top of Group A on three points thanks to goals from Budi Sudarsono and Ponaryo Astaman in a game played at a virtually empty stadium.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

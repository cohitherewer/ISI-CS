 Woolmer stops Inzy-Shoaib spat
 Shoaib is always in the news Lahore: New Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer got his first taste of tempers in the mercurial Pakistan team before flying out for England on a short personal trip. Witnesses said captain Inzamam-ul Haq and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar had a heated exchange in the conditioning camp on Tuesday before Woolmer intervened and brought things under control. It was a misunderstanding but Woolmer and I got the matter settled, team manager Haroon Rashid said. The Pakistan team is united and there are no differences between Shoaib and Inzamam, said Woolmer. Rashid and Woolmer had a session with both players and advised them to refrain from such activities in the interest of the team. Shoaibs relation with Inzamam turned sour after Pakistans home defeat against India earlier this year. The bowler was accused of faking injury and had to appear before a medical commission. Shoaib reportedly alleged that Inzamam had maligned him through statements in the media, to which the captain reacted sharply. As a consequence, Rashid said that players will not be allowed to speak to the media without his and Woolmers permission. The Pakistan selectors on Wednesday announced a 14-member squad for the Asia Cup. The squad is largely built around the team that lost to India and includes Shoaib. The selectors picked veteran wicketkeeper Moin Khan but speedster Umar Gul was left out. Middle-order batsman Younis Khan and opener Imran Nazir were recalled to the squad which has five fast bowlers and two spinners. The six-nation Asia Cup will be the first assignment for Woolmer, who took over from Javed Miandad last month. THE SQUAD Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Yusuf Youhana (vice-captain), Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Imran Nazir, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq, Moin Khan, Mohammed Sami, Shoaib Akhtar, Shabbir Ahmed, Danish Kaneria, Rana Naveed-ul Hassan.

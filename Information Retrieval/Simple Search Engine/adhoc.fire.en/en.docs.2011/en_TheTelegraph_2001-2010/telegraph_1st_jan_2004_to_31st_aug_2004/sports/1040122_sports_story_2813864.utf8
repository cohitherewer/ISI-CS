The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Prince and jester reunite at Rio club 
 Romario has delighted and exasperated fans Rio de Janeiro: It all began with a toilet door. Four years ago, Vasco da Gama lined up what they thought would become one of the most successful partnerships in Brazilian soccer history  Romario, one of the deadliest strikers in the game, and Edmundo, nicknamed the Animal. Instead, the pair fell out and spent the following six months sniping at each other through the media. Now two of Brazils most gifted and temperamental players have been reunited at Fluminense in what appears to be a huge gamble by a club that narrowly avoided relegation last year. The players, who will have a combined age of 70 by the end of the month, are older, balder, greyer and claim to be wiser. But it is still hard to avoid the feeling that coach Valdir Espinosa has been handed a time bomb by the club directors who made the signing. The 34-year-old Romario, who led Brazil to their fourth World Cup win in 1994, has delighted and exasperated his followers in equal measure with his goal-scoring feats, his dislike for training and his enjoyment of the good life. The man who once insisted he plays better after a good night on the town has been granted special privileges at Fluminense. He is allowed to travel to away games on his own, never has to train the day after a match and has his own physiotherapist. Edmundo, at least in his heyday, had explosive pace and an explosive temperament to go with it. Fluminense are the third club  all based in Rio de Janeiro  who have attempted to bring the pair together. Flamengo were the first to try in 1995 but repeated injuries to Edmundo followed by Romarios decision to join Spanish club Valencia prevented the fireworks from igniting. At that time, the pair, who shares their love of Rios beach culture and were regular partners at foot-volleyball, were chums. But they fell out when Romario opened his Cafe do Gol bar in 1998. Romario decided to decorate the doors in the mens toilets with caricatures  one of which pictured Edmundo sitting on a deflated ball. Another depicted a girlfriend and model from whom he had just separated. Romario insisted it was a joke. Edmundo was not amused. Then... First, Edmundo was stripped of the captaincy before a game and it was handed to the newly-arrived Romario. The Animal stormed out of the dressing-room and went home. Next came another infamous incident when both players stepped up to take a penalty, Romario was given the nod  and missed. The King decided his Prince should take it, said Edmundo at halftime, referring to club president Eurico Miranda and Romario, respectively. After scoring in Vascos next match, Romario sniped back: Now, everyone in the kingdom is happy  the King, the Prince and the court jester. The partnership was finally put out of its misery when Edmundo fell out with the directors over his wages and left for Santos. (Reuters)  Copyright

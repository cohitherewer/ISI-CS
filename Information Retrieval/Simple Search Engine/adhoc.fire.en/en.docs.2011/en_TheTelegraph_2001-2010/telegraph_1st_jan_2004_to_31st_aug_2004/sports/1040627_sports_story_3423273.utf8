The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Assam takes the initiative
	 - Creating a special post for Dalmiya  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, June 26: The Assam Cricket Association (ACA) has taken the lead in ensuring that Jagmohan Dalmiyas association with the Board  in an official capacity  doesnt end with his completion of three years as president. Dalmiyas innings, which began rather dramatically in Chennai 33 months ago, gets over in September. His has been the most dominant voice within the Board for over a decade. That a post is almost certain to be created for him only was, it may be recalled, reported first by The Telegraph  on June 5. The ACA acted three days later. Through a letter to Board secretary S. K. Nair, the ACA has called for amending the constitution (if needed) and honouring Dalmiya in a befitting manner. As reported in these columns, that could be done by appointing him as the Boards permanent representative at the International Cricket Council (ICC). In fact, the ACA has specifically mentioned Dalmiya may be entrusted with the responsibility of representing the Board at the ICC. Incidentally, Dalmiya is a former ICC president and, even now, has considerable influence in the global body. At the ACAs request, Nair has circulated its letter to all affiliated units, seeking their views on the issue. The replies, one understands, have begun to reach the Board secretarys office in Thiruvananthapuram  the first, it seems, coming from the Bihar Cricket Association. Predictably, the ACA initiative has been supported. Whether the constitution is amended or not, the specially-created post will have to be pushed through at a Special General Meeting, ahead of the AGM in September. Apparently, theres going to be considerable discussion on the modus-operandi during the next working committee meeting, in all probability around the middle of next month. Dalmiyas position is clear: He wont shy away if the Boards affiliates are convinced his guidance (in whatever form) will be necessary after September as well.  Copyright

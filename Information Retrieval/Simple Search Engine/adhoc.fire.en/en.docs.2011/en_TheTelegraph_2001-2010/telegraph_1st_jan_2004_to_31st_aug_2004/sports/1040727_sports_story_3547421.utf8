 Iraq knock out Saudis
Chengdu: Iraq knocked Saudi Arabia out of the Asian Cup with a 2-1 victory over the three-time winners on Monday, a result that cost Saudi coach Gerard van der Lem his job. Substitute Younis Mahmoud scored an 87th-minute winner as the Iraqis finished second behind Uzbekistan in Group C and advanced to the quarter finals. Dutchman Van der Lem was dismissed minutes after the game, becoming the 13th manager to be sacked by Saudi Arabia in the last ten years. Van der Lem became involved with a heated exchange with Saudi journalists at his post-match news conference. As one reporter told him to resign, Van der Lem shouted: Now you show your true colours. Iraq will play hosts China in Beijing on Friday while Uzbekistan face Group A runners-up Bahrain in Chengdu. Saudi Arabia were eliminated from the Asian Cup for the first time after reaching the last five finals. Nashat Akram put Iraq in front with a clinical left-foot finish in the 51st minute. Defender Hamad Al Montashari gave Saudi Arabia a life-line six minutes later, arriving at the back post to head in a flick-on from Ibrahim Sowed. But Mahmoud pounced three minutes from time to give Iraq a deserved winner, sliding the ball into an empty net after Saudi goalkeeper Mansour Al Naje had parried a shot from Qusay Munir. Uzbekistan beat Turkmenistan 1-0 in a clash of former Soviet republics to finish with a perfect nine points. Saudi Arabia finished bottom of the group with one point.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

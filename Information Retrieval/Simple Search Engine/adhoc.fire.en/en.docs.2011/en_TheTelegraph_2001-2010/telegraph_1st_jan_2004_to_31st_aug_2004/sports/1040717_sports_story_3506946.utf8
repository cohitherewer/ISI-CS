 IWF names team for Athens
New Delhi: Olympic bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari will lead the Indian challenge in the Athens Olympics slated for next month. Tonga Commonwealth champion Kunjurani Devi (48kg), Sanamacha Chanu (53kg) and Prathima Kumari (63kg) were the other lifters in the four-member team, announced by the Indian Weighlifting Federation (IWF) general secretary Balbir Singh Bhatia on Friday. While Malleswari has switched to 63kg weight category from 69kg, in which she had claimed the bronze at the Sydney edition of the Games in 2000, the other three will continue in their usual weight categories. Malleswari has decided to contest in lesser weight category because of some injuries. But she is confident about her performance in 63kg weight category. It is reachable, Bhatia said. The team is currently training in Belarus from where they will return on July 31. Before leaving for Athens on August 6, the four lifters will have a week-long camp at the national capital. The Indians have their events on August 14, 15 and 18. There will be no representation in the mens category.  (PTI)  Copyright

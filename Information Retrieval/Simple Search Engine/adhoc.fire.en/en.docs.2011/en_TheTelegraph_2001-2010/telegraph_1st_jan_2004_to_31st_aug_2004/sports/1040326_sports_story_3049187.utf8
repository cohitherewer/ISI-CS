The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, March 26, 2004  Evangeline may come good 
 BY STAR RACER Bharath Calcutta: The Bharath Singh-trained filly Evangeline gets the first call against her six rivals in the 1,400m Midnight Cowboy Cup, the main event in Fridays race card. A winner of four races from her five starts this season, Evangeline has been maintaining her good form. The end-March heat could have worked against the interest of the filly but the scheduled start of the race around sunset may help the Excaliburs Lake-Glowing Tribute daughters cause. S. Rajesh partners the filly.				 										Incidentally, the RCTC stewards are hardly feeling the scorching heat. They have announced two extra fixtures on April 13 and April 15 despite the fact that fields have been shrinking in the past three weeks.				 										Race card and selections				 										1.

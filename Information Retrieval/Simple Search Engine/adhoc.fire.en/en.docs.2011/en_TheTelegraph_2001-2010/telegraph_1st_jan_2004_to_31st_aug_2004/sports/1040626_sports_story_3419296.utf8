 Times up for unfit players: Lehmann
Adelaide: Darren Lehmann has bowed to the times and says he is the last of the smoking, drinking, overweight era of Australian cricketers. Lehmann admits he likes his drink and is not the fittest cricketer around, but he credits his trimmer figure to less beer and plenty of cricket with Yorkshire. Weve been playing a lot cricket over the last six months and obviously Yorkshire play every day, the 34-year-old Lehmann said on Friday ahead of next months two-Test series against Sri Lanka. So, its been really busy and I feel in really good nick, so hopefully I keep that (weight) off for a while and keep the beers out of the cupboard for a bit. Lehmann said Yorkshire skipper and his brother-in-law, Craig White, was partly responsible for his weight reduction. He keeps chucking me the ball, but I enjoy bowling, it breaks the day up, and I wish I took it up earlier, obviously, it would have been good. Lehmann said times were changing in Australian cricket. To be perfectly honest, Im probably the last of that bunch that played a little bit overweight and enjoyed a beer and a cigarette, which is good, he said. Thats the way its changing, its turned into a more professional sport.  (AFP)  Copyright

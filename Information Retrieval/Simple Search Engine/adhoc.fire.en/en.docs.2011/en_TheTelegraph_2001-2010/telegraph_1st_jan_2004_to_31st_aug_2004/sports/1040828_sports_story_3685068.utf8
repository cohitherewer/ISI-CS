		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
 Booing from the crowd which held up the mens Olympic 200 metres final on Thursday night was music to the ears of Greek sprinter Costas Kenteris, who withdrew after missing a drugs test days earlier.				 																																	It was the best thing I have heard in the past few years, said Kenteris after sections of the 75,000-strong crowd delayed the race for five minutes by jeering and chanting his name in frustration at his absence. Kenteris, Greeces 2000 Olympic champion in the event, pulled out of the Games after missing a drugs test in mysterious circumstances the day before the opening ceremony.				 																																	The behaviour of the public and my fellow athletes vindicates me, Kenteris told TV Mytilini from his family home on the Greek island. Kenteris said he was determined to make a comeback. All this love gives me the strength and the courage to fight under adverse circumstances and be present on the track once again, he said. Egyptian heavyweight Mohamed Elsayed was disqualified from his Olympic boxing semi-final on Friday because he failed the medical examination, organisers said. Elsayed did not pass the test because of an arm injury sustained in his quarter final win over Australias Adam Forsyth. He leaves the tournament with a bronze medal. The Egyptians scheduled semi-final opponent, Viktar Zuyev of Belarus, goes through to Saturdays final on a walkover and will win at least a silver medal.He will meet Cubas Odlanier Solis or Syrian Naser Al Shami in the gold medal contest.  Chinas womens hockey team finished a highly creditable fourth at the Athens Olympics and have now set their sights on winning gold on home soil when the Games go to Beijing in 2008. It is a far cry 2000, when China only just qualified for the Sydney Games in a sport played by a few hundred people in a country of more than one billion.				 																																	Hockey  or bent stick ball as it is called in Chinese  comes well down the pecking order as the sportswomans choice and many of Chinas players only picked up a hockey stick because they did not make soccer or basketball teams. Hockey needs greater support, said coach Kim Chang-back. Our big problem is that its relatively unknown among Chinas huge population.Russian 400m runner Anton Galkin was expelled from the Athens Games on Friday after testing positive for steroids, the countrys senior Olympic official said.				 																																	Galkin tested positive for stanozolol after his August 21 race in the 400 semi-finals, IOC vice president Vitaly Smirnov said. Galkin finished fourth in the race and did not make the finals. The IOC executive board disqualified him and revoked his accreditation, Smirnov said. Galkin is the 20th athlete of the Athens Olympics caught for a doping violation, a record high, and the third Russian to test positive. In ancient Olympia, the poet Pindar praised winning athletes in complex, rhythmic victory odes. Twenty five centuries later, an Oxford scholar is reviving the Pindaric ode to sing the praises of the Olympic host city.				 																																	Pindar was the greatest poet of his time and was often commissioned to write victory odes for the ancient Games, said Armand dAngour a classics fellow and tutor at Oxfords Jesus College. He composed the 25-line Ode to Athens in Ancient Greek at the request of long-time International Olympic Committee member Mary Glen-Haig.

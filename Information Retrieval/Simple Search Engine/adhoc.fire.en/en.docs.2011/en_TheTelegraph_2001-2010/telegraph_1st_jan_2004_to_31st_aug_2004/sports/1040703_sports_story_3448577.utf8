The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Czechs bounce off Greek post
 - Traianos Dellas fires silver bullet to help Rehhagels team set up final clash with Portugal  FROM HENRY WINTER IN PORTO  Greeces Traianos Dellas (No. 5) scores the winning goal in the Euro 2004 semi-final against the Czech Republic at the Dragao Stadium in Porto on Thursday. (Reuters) A silver goal worth its weight in gold from Traianos Dellas, a defender once of Sheffield United, lead the Greeks out of this labyrinth of a semi-final and into the promised land of Sundays final (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). When Dellas swooped to head in Vasilios Tsiartis corner, the poor Czechs had no chance to recover and, extraordinarily, now the first game of Euro 2004, Greece-Portugal, will be the last. The regulation 90 minutes was notable only for the relentless, occasionally ruthless man-marking job on Milan Baros by Georgios Seitaridis and the sad sight of Pavel Nedved injuring his knee and leaving early. The clever Greeks had laid out the most complicated of tactical puzzles for the Czechs, whose mission had hardly been assisted when Nedved limped away with a damaged knee after 40 minutes. His teammates were struggling to lift the blue blanket thrown so ruthlessly across them. Nedveds loss deprived them of a talismanic leader against well-organised opponents. Panathinaikos mobile right-back, Georgios Seitaridis, was deputed to stop Baros, a duty he accepted so enthusiastically that he soon earned a booking for pulling the Liverpool striker over. Shirt-pulling was another dark art employed by Seitaridis at corners, at one point almost stripping Baros. Greeces 4-3-2-1 formation had been chosen astutely: the two support-strikers, Angelos Charisteas and Georgios Karagounis, dropped back constantly to provide numbers in midfield when the Czechs sought to enliven proceedings with their elegant use of possession. The attacking threat of Charisteas and Karagounis also distracted Poborsky and Nedved, who kept having to track the Greek pair. Otto Rehhagels strategy made the Greeks look the stronger side in a scoreless first half and Karagounis almost exploited a rare Petr Cech fumble. Yet the counter-attacking verve in the Czech ranks could never completely be stifled. Tomas Rosicky, all neat touch and smooth movement, despatched a shot against the upright. Marek Jankulovski, a busy raider of a left-back, brought a sprawling save from Antonios Nikopolidis and then went close with a half-volley. Bruckners men suffered further frustration when the fates claimed Nedved again. Nedveds wretched semi-final record continued when the player, suspended for the 2003 Champions League final, injured himself trying to convert an inviting cross from Rosicky. Instead of connecting with the ball, the Juventus midfielder hit Konstantinos Katsouranis in the backside and jarred his knee. He eventually hobbled to the bench, clearly distressed, to have an ice pack applied to his right knee. His scream of anger told its own vocal, pain-filled story. Nedved is due to retire after this tournament and international football will be a poorer place without the energetic running of this technically-blessed, team-minded individual. Vladimir Smicer sped on but the Czechs lacked focus without Nedved. Even the huge Jan Koller was dispossessed. Tomas Galasek, normally so assured in deep midfield, began to be assailed with mistakes. The Czechs craved someone to take control, to take responsibility and drive them forward. Anger briefly coloured their thoughts, understandably so when Koller was denied a clear penalty after having his shirt pulled by Dellas. Koller was hauled to the ground but Collina waved play on. Kollers miss in the 80th minute will haunt him; with the goal gaping, he shot wildly wide. The Czechs kept probing but could not find a way through the Greek maze, so carrying the game into extra-time. Twice Giannakopoulos almost scored but the man Bolton fans know as Stelios was thwarted by Cech and then the feet of Rene Bolf. Then a free-kick from Vasilios Tsiartis was met by a flicked header from Dellas but Cech came to the Czechs rescue. But then came Dellas.

 Justine, Roddick named top seeds 
 Henin-Hardenne  Andy RoddickMelbourne: World No.1 Andy Roddick took his place on Thursday at the top of the draw for next weeks Australian Open while his female counterpart Justine Henin-Hardenne was named top seed in the womens field. Roddick, a semi-finalist at Melbourne Park last year, had a sparkling 2003, becoming the youngest American, at 21 years and two months, in the history of the ATP rankings to finish the year as world No.1, and winning his first Grand Slam at the US Open. Defending champion Andre Agassi was named fourth seed. He is aiming to win a fifth title in Melbourne, having won in 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2003. At 33 years and eight months, Agassi is the oldest direct entry in the mens draw and still the man to beat. Seeded second is Wimbledon and Tennis Masters Cup champion Roger Federer, followed by French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero, a quarter-finalist here last year. Two Australians made the seeds, Mark Philippoussis at 10 and number 15 Lleyton Hewitt. Neither has been past the fourth round at Melbourne Park. Philippoussis was a Wimbledon finalist last year and Hewitt will be desperate to add his home Grand Slam to the US Open and Wimbledon titles already under his belt. In the womens draw, French and US Open champion Henin-Hardenne will top the seedings for the first time. Her Belgian compatriot, Kim Clijsters, is seeded second. Clijsters finished runner-up to Henin-Hardenne in both Paris and New York last year and her chances of going one better have not been helped by an injury which forced her out of Perth and Sydney. Returning from an injury, which kept her out of the game since the Wimbledon final in July she lost to sister Serena, is Venus Williams. Last years runner-up has been vaulted from her world ranking of 11 to number three seed under a WTA plan. She will be keen to keep the Williams name in the winners circle and add the Australian Open to her US Open and Wimbledon successes. Frances Amelie Mauresmo is fourth followed by 2000 champion Lindsay Davenport at five. The draw will take place at Melbourne Park on Friday. The two-week Grand Slam begins on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PCB may earn $20 million
Islamabad: The cash-strapped PCB could make a whopping $20 million from the upcoming home series with India, PCB CEO Rameez Raja has said. I dont want to quote exact figures in terms of revenue generation because the series still has to be marketed. But keeping in mind the guaranteed earnings from sale of TV rights ($11 million), I would say the figure could reach $20 million, Raja said at a press conference in Karachi. The interest in the series is already sky-high and we are getting regular offers from Indian and Pakistani companies including leading banks and international consumer brands. But we still have to market it carefully and in a transparent manner, he was quoted as saying by a Pakistani newspaper. Raja said this was PCBs first real opportunity in more than a decade to post handsome profits. India have confirmed they would be touring Pakistan from March 1 to play five ODIs and three Tests, their first full tour of Pakistan since 1989. Raja said major Indian firms were already showing unprecedented interest in the series. But we would like to have a neutral title sponsor. We cant allow the series to be completely dominated by Indian brands but at the same time we have to ensure that Pakistani companies are able to match Indian offers and we dont lose money. He said PCB was considering hosting the India matches at Karachi and Peshawar.  (PTI)  Copyright

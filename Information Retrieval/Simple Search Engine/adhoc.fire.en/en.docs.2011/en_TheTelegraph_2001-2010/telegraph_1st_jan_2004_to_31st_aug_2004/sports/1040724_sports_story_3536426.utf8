 Players urge nation to let them focus on Athens
 Leave us alone: Pillay Leverkusen: Under the scanner for various reasons, members of the Indian hockey team Friday appealed to critics back home to support them as they continue their preparations for next months Athens Olympic Games. The selection of the team as well as the sacking of coach Rajinder Singh has sparked off stringent criticism from former players and fans of the game, but the players urged to one and all to let them focus on the all-important task at hand. Former Olympians, including Pargat Singh, had slammed the Indian Hockey Federation for ignoring experienced defender Kanwalpreet Singh and midfielder Bimal Lakra in favour of some rookie players. But captain and veteran defender Dilip Tirkey tried to justify the composition of the team, saying: This is the best available squad on current form. At the end of their training session at RTHC Sports Complex here, Tirkey said: William Xalco and Harpal Singh relieved me of extra pressure in the Dusseldorf. Star striker Dhanraj Pillay said there was unity in the team and there was no need to panic. For gods sake, leave us alone. We are a well-knit, harmonious and happy family now. Please let us continue with our Olympic focus, the 36-year-old veteran said. Two other senior forwards  Baljit Singh Dhillon and Gagan Ajit Singh  said the team was improving under the new coaching crew. After all, the IHF has selectors who have all been past captains and have played at least two Olympics each. How can you doubt their credentials or capabilities? Dhillon asked. The selectors Gurbux Singh, B. P. Govinda and Aslam Sher Khan were at Duesseldorf, watching India play in the four-nation tournament. Gagan Ajit added: We have had an instant rapport with the foreign coaches and are fine-tuning many skills. They are remarkable and we wish we had this opportunity earlier. Assistant coach Jagbir Singh urged former Olympians to wish the team all success in Athens instead of criticising it just days before the mega event. The squad is fit and fine. This is the best combination and the blend of the coaches is super, he said. I dont know why the ire is directed towards foreign coaches, he said adding that when we dont do well there is a hue and cry for bringing overseas trainers, but now when it has happened and at the right time, some of my old colleagues are unhappy.

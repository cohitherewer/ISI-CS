The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United back on top despite draw
London: Champions Manchester United went top of the Premier League on Sunday, but only by a point after being held to a 0-0 draw by Newcastle United at Old Trafford. Both sides rued decisions by referee Paul Durkin, with Newcastle skipper Alan Shearer having a solid penalty appeal turned down in the first half and Uniteds defender Ikael Silvestre having a goal disallowed in the second. But the draw was good news for both Arsenal, who had been overnight leaders on alphabetical order, and Chelsea, who hammered Leicester City 4-0 earlier on Sunday and reduced the gap separating them from United to five points. Chelseas Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink claimed two in the first half, Romanian substitute Adrian Mutu ended a two-month goal drought in the 88th minute and Nigeria defender Celestine Babayaro rifled in their fourth in stoppage time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tour may be delayed by a week
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta:Indias tour of Pakistan will be delayed,  by a week beyond the March 1 start as announced earlier  if a BCCI request is agreed upon, and by a few days if a  PCB request is granted. The BCCI wants its players to get a few extra days of rest after they return from the tour of Australia. The PCB wants the deferment because of Muharram (likely March 2 and 3). The BCCI on Tuesday sent a formal request to the PCB, saying that the tour be deferred by a week. Later, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja also said in Islamabad that they want the visitors to arrive in Pakistan after Muharram. It has been learnt that the BCCI feels players will be too tired after the long tour of Australia and can do with some extra days before another high-voltage series abroad. The ongoing tri-series Down Under will run into February, with the best-of-three finals scheduled to end on February 10. If India do qualify for the finals, as is expected, and a third final is needed, Sourav Gangulys men will not get much rest before leaving for Pakistan. We want to give them at least 20 days between the two trips, said a BCCI source. A camp before the Pakistan trip is unlikely.  [PTI adds: In Islamabad,  Rameez in a statement said: We have requested them to delay  their arrival by a few days because of Ashura (Muharram)  which is expected to fall on March 2 and 3.] Tests first? While sources hinted that the tour could begin with the three-Test series, followed by five ODIs, BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya maintained in Calcutta that the itinerary is yet to be finalised.

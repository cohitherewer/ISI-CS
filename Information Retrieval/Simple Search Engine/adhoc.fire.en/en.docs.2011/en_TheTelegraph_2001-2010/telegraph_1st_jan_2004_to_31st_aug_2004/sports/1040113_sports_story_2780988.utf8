 Jaded Lee needs a breather: Ponting 
 - Aussie captain believes the quick can still play a part in tri-series  Lee has sought help from Lillee over reducing his recent splurge of no-balls Sydney: Australian skipper Ricky Ponting on Monday said fast bowler Brett Lee is physically worn out but is capable of overcoming the toughest period of his international career. Lee, regarded as one of Australias leading fast bowlers, was overlooked for Australias opening two wins in the triangular one-day series against India and Zimbabwe. While Lee was watching from the stands, Brad Williams gained the Man-of-the-Match honour with five for 22 in Australias 99-run win over Zimbabwe on Sunday. The West Australians career-best spell has entrenched him in Australias line-up for the time being, but Ponting believes Lee can put his recent troubles behind him and still play a part in the series. Its been a tough week for him but hes been pretty upbeat, Ponting said. Im sure youll see his performances turn around in the next few games. Lee, who has 137 wickets at 21.43 in 73 ODIs, has admitted seeking specialist help from pace great Dennis Lillee, particularly over reducing his recent splurge of no-balls. But Ponting believes Lee  who has bowled 205.5 overs in four first-class matches and a domestic one-day game over the past five weeks  just needs a breather. No, its physically more than anything, Ponting said when asked if Lee was left out of the opening tri-series matches to help him recover mentally. Hes done a lot of bowling since hes come back to Sheffield Shield cricket and then back in the Test team, hes had to work very hard in every game hes played and hes bowled a lot of overs. We just thought he was a little bit flat so we gave him a couple of days off to get him to liven up again. Ponting said Lee would be aided by the return of Glenn McGrath and a fitter Jason Gillespie for next months tour of Sri Lanka, which would allow the blond speedster to bowl first change  the role in which he has produced his best performances. His actual role in the Test team will change, the new Test skipper said. When we get Gillespie and McGrath back, things will be different for him. Things could also be different for Australias bowling attack with the return of Shane Warne, who is less than a month away from resuming after his one-year ban for taking banned diuretics. Warne, whose ability to keep batsmen under pressure for long spells was sorely missed in the Tests against India, has a chance to return immediately to Australias one-day side in Sri Lanka. But Ponting said the leg-spinner would need more than just nine days to prove he was ready to resume when Australia play Sri Lanka on February 20. I imagine its going to be pretty hard for him to be picked straight into the one-day squad without having played any cricket, Ponting said. Id love him to play one-day cricket again. Id love to have him back in my one-day team  hes a world class bowler in both forms of the game and Id love to have him back in the Test side as well, lets just hope he gets back there. Warne will play for Victorias second XI as soon as he is eligible, on February 11.  (AFP)  Copyright

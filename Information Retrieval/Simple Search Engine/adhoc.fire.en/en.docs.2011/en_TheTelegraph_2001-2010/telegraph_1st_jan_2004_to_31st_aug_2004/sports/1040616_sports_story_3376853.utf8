 Hail Zidane the Great
	 - It needs acknowledging England were slain by one of the greatest footballers ever  BY HENRY WINTER  Zidane qualifies effortlessly for the great epithet Zinedine Zidane nicked my lift. About to enter the elevator of my Lisbon hotel in the early hours of yesterday morning, I was caught out by a late run from Frances captain. Attempting to follow him into the lift, a large bodyguard appeared and blocked my path. The message was clear: Zidane Lift Only. Englands footballing nemesis and ace lift-stealer at least had the good grace to smile apologetically. And that is one small reason why this French team are so special. Because of Zidane, who exudes a sense of nobility. England fans lurked around the hotel close to the Stadium of Light, most politely seeking autographs, a minority taunting the French players as they strolled past. The Real Madrid midfielder smiled at the pleasant fans and ignored the disrespectful others. One Liverpool follower amused himself  but no one else  by shouting, You will be in Gerrards back pocket to Patrick Vieira, the worlds most accomplished midfielder, on Saturday. Vieira shot him a dismissive glance. So did Thierry Henry when heckled by England fans. And so when Markus Merks final whistle brought to an end one of the most dramatic turnarounds in footballing history on Sunday night, the Arsenal pair of Vieira and Henry stood in front of Englands supporters and savoured the moment. Zidane was different. Zidane does not crow. In victory, he shows only magnanimity. Rare acquaintance with reversals simply stirs him to more intense effort. This is a special, special footballer, the Real deal in every sense. Amid all the Birmingham disturbances and breast-beating over defeat to France, it needs acknowledging that England were slain by one of the greatest footballers ever. The debate about who in football deserves the adjective great is long, heated and inevitably subjective. To this observer, those players worthy of the great epithet must show grace on and off the field. Pele, all clever feet and twinkling eyes, clearly merits the description. Always smiling, always doing good work for charity, Pele is footballs finest ambassador for the memories of his achievements with Brazil and his post-playing contributions. Pele lights up every World Cup simply through his personality and pedigree. Compare and contrast with Diego Armando Maradona. Undoubtedly a sumptuous footballing talent, Maradona patently lacked any form of grace. He has fired a rifle at people, polluted his body with narcotics and cheated on the field of play with that notorious Hand of God. That Azteca meeting with England characterised Maradona: the genius of that second dribbled goal was eternally stained by the fisted calumny of the first goal past Peter Shilton. Maradona possessed skills to make you smile and morals to make you weep. No grace there. If the railroad to greatness has to go via grace central then the journey has definitely been made by the Dutch forward, Marco van Basten, an unfailingly polite man as well as one of the most all-round striking talents to beat a goalkeeper. Bobby Moore had grace. Sir Bobby Charlton has it in abundance. Franz Beckenbauer definitely qualifies as great under the grace rules. The Germans friendship with Charlton and Moore reflected his ability to play the right way while always deeply competitive. Michel Platini, a famous predecessor of Zidane, exuded grace and greatness. Those privileged enough to have watched or known Sir Stanley Matthews will campaign passionately for his inclusion among the pantheon of those who suffused their talent with grace. Zidane qualifies effortlessly. Yesterday he preferred to praise Fabien Barthezs penalty save rather than his own match-winning contribution. Such selflessness is a sign of greatness. It was interesting to hear the tributes to Zidane flowing from Sir Bobby Robson, whose career as player and manager has always been touched with a sense of dignity. Robson was hurt by Englands loss but he could appreciate Zidanes class. Zidane managed to stay calm when all those around him were panicking and he delivered the victory to his team, the former England manager said. Zidane snatched victory from the jaws of defeat in a manner nobody expected. He would never let his head drop. Hes not that kind of player. Gutsy, strong and exuding so many technical gifts, Zidane is the ultimate role model. England fell to a man who combines footballing greatness and graciousness and that is no shame. He can pinch my lift anyday.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

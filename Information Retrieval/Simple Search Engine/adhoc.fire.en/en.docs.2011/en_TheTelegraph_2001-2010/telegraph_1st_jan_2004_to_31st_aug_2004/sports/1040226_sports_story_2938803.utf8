The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real lucky to salvage draw
 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - Arsenal down Celta Vigo 3-2; Milan held goalless by Sparta Prague  Bayern Munichs Willy Sagnol in a tussle with Real Madrids Zinedine Zidane in Munich on Tuesday. (Reuters) London: A schoolboy howler by goalkeeper Oliver Kahn cost Bayern Munich an almost certain victory as they drew 1-1 with Real Madrid in the glamour tie of the Champions Leagues first knockout round on Tuesday. Holders AC Milan also had to settle for a draw in a goalless first leg at Sparta Prague, but there were wins for Arsenal, who beat Celta Vigo 3-2 in Spain, and Lokomotiv Moscow, who held on for a 2-1 home win over Monaco. The night will be one to forget for Germany captain Kahn after he allowed a long-range free kick by Reals Brazil wingback Roberto Carlos to slip under his body when he seemed to have the ball well under control. Voted Fifas player of the 2002 World Cup, Kahn made his blunder with just seven minutes to go at the Olympic Stadium after Dutch striker Roy Makaay had headed the hosts into a well-deserved lead in the 75th minute. Its bitter for Kahn, but thats destiny, said Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld while goalscorer Makaay refused to blame the keeper. We played super, we created a lot of chances, we were waiting to go ahead, we went ahead and then we suddenly conceded the goal. Oliver shouldnt be blamed for it, it happens, Makaay said. However, Kahn said: You just have thoughts of escape on your mind. You simply want to get out of the place. I should be able to stop a ball like that, period. It was one you could stop without arms and legs, added Kahn, who left the stadium without speaking to reporters on Tuesday. A defiant Kahn, however, said he would be at his very best in the second leg on March 10 in the Spanish capital when Bayern will have to score at least once. Whoever knows me realises that I will rise above it in the return leg... So I will win the match in Madrid on my own, added the 34-year-old. Real star David Beckham said the match was only the first half. Were happy. We didnt deserve to lose, the England captain said. Real coach Carlos Queiroz preferred to look on the bright side of a distinctly lacklustre performance from his expensively-assembled team. You could say I am more satisfied with the result than with our performance, Queiroz said. The away goal means Real, seeking their 10th European Cup, will fancy their chances of making the quarter finals when they face the Germans at the Bernabeu in a fortnights time. Milan will rue a couple of missed chances by Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko in Prague but are confident of improving at the San Siro. I feel we are on the way to the quarter finals, said coach Carlo Ancelotti, whose team have scored just five times in nine European games since last seasons quarter finals. The away goals rule will keep Monacos hopes up after their consolation strike by Fernando Morientes in a snow-swept game in Moscow. Goals from Marat Izmailov and Vladimir Maminov looked to have secured a convincing win for the Russians, but the Spaniards header and a bad miss by Lokomotivs Nigerian substitute James Obiorah kept the French Ligue 1 leaders well alive. The away goals rule will give little encouragement, though, to Celta Vigo who were outgunned by in-form Arsenal. Twice behind to goals from Brazilian midfielder Edu before losing to a late winner by France winger Robert Pires, the Spaniards know Arsenal can afford to lose 0-1 or 1-2 at Highbury and still reach the last eight. The Premier League leaders coach Arsene Wenger will be expecting an improvement from his defenders, though, after slack marking allowed Celta to score from a free-kick and a corner. Every time we seemed to have done the most difficult bit, we conceded a goal in areas where usually we are very strong, he said. You dont come to Spain and expect to concede two goals on set pieces. We showed our mentality again, said Arsenal striker Thierry Henry. We always wanted to go forward to score goals.  (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Friday, July 02, 2004 EURO DIGEST
 Lisbon: The Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy for insulting Swedish referee Anders Frisk after the final whistle of Wednesdays Euro 2004 semi-final against Portugal. Its disciplinary committee will deal with the matter on Friday. The two men reportedly had a heated argument after the game. The Dutch said he believed Frisk had favoured the hosts. Its unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favour of Portugal. He was a real home whistler, Van Nistelrooy said. He buried rumours linking him with a move to Rael Madrid and said he will stay with Manchester United. Lisbon: Dutch forward Patrick Kluivert expressed his bitter disappointment after seeing The Netherlands crash out of Euro 2004. Kluivert was the only outfield player in the Dutch squad not to see action at the tournament as coach Dick Advocaat doggedly used only Ruud Van Nistelrooy. Kluivert was seething. I am frustrated. I am Hollands top scorer (with 40 goals to Van Nistelrooys 18). I feel as if I am in form and yet I did not play a single minute, said the Barcelona star. The Hague: A generation of talented Dutch players have lost their last chance to win a major international title, the nations press concluded on Thursday. What a pity for the Orange, said a daily newspaper. Its over. The Dutch players can pack their bags. The team was easily beaten. It said. The paper predicted that Frank de Boer, Phillip Cocu, Jaap Stam and Marc Overmars would not figure in the plans for the 2006 World Cup. Lisbon: The front pages in Portugal turned red and green on Thursday. After a night of country-wide celebrations which even spread to the Azores islands in the Atlantic, the nation was buoyant. The unstoppable force, blared the front page of a daily. We are at the gates of glory. Superb, said its rival. Another great game and were in the final. What a team and what supporters. We have made history.

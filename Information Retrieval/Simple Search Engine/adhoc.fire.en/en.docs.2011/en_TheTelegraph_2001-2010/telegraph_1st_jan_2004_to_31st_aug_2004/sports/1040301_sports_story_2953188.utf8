The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian women go 2-0 up
Jamshedpur: A fine spell of spin bowling by Neetu David and a brilliant 145-run first wicket partnership between Anju Jain (55) and Jaya Sharma (78) propelled India to a seven wicket win over the West Indies in the second womens one-day International match here today. After skittling out the visitors for 161 in 49.4 overs, the hosts reached 162 for three in 41.3 overs for their second win in the five-match series. The tourists failed to negotiate the bowling of David who returned with figures of five for 20. The visitors suffered a batting collapse after Nadine George (48) and Nelly Williams (28) added 84 runs for the first wicket.

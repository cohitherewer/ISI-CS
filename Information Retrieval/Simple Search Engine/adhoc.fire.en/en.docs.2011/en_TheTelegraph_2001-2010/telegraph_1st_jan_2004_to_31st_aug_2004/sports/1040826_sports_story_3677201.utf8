The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Graf honour
Berlin: The centre court where Steffi Graf won more tournaments than anywhere else in her 17-year career will be renamed after the retired tennis great. LTTC Rot-Weiss Tennis Club announced on Wednesday the court will be re-christened Steffi Graf Stadion on September 25 in honour of the 35-year-old former champion. Graf will play an exhibition during the ceremony, one of her rare appearances on court since retiring in 1999 with 22 Grand Slam titles. (AP)  Copyright

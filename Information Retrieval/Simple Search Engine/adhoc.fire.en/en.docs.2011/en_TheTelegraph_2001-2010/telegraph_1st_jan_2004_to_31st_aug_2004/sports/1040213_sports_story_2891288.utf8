 Beggs rallies to win
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: South African Norman Beggs came back from the dead to beat Sujjan Singh on the second play-off hole in the third round of the Eveready All-India Amateur Golf Championships at the RCGC on Thursday. The second-seeded Beggs, who was five-down after 10 holes and three-down with three holes to play, won the last three to force a tie-break. Both golfers halved the first hole with pars. On the par-three second hole, Beggs made a regulation par while Sujjan managed a bogey. Defending champion Manav Das, Sri Lankan B.G. Lalithakumara, Briton James Smith and South African Matthew Kent all advanced, pushing the top five seeds to the pre-quarter final. Das overcame Amardeep Singh Malik 2 and 1, Lalithakumara scored a comfortable 3 amp; 2 win over RCGC Cup winner Girish Virk, while Smith was stretched to the 17th hole before winning 2 amp; 1 against Jasjeet Singh. Kent was the days biggest winner, a 5 amp; 4 margin over Amit Nigam. Surya Prakash, the 15-year-old La Martiniere student who upset sixth seed Harinder Gupta, fought hard before going down 3 amp; 1 to Balwinder Singh Mattu.  Copyright

 EB moving in right direction: Bhaichung 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Bhaichung Bhutia feels things in East Bengal are moving in the right direction. Having rejoined his first club in his career after four years, Bhutia says Subhas Bhowmick deserves a lot of credit too. Q Having come back to East Bengal after four years, what changes have you seen? A The club has grown and is trying to move towards the positive, trying to be professional, which is good. Attitude-wise, the club is moving in the right direction. Everybody is trying to take the club to the next level. What has been the role of the coach? Its very important for players to trust the coach and I think he has done a lot. For a coach, things can be difficult to handle when a team goes through ups and downs. When we were down he was brave enough to bring us back on track and give us the confidence. What about the bad start and how did things start turning around? We didnt start well and before that we were not doing too well. It happens and thats why leagues are important for good teams ultimately the good team wins. You cant always keep the better team down. Bad patches come and that was our bad patch (in the beginning) but we came back strongly. Do East Bengal deserve to look beyond Indian shores now? Indian football is getting respect from other countries, not just Southeast Asia. Its good to see that and East Bengal definitely deserve to look beyond the national boundaries. On the personal front, how good a season has it been for you? It has been good, not special. We have still not won the National League, so the job hasnt been finished yet. I can talk about that only after we win it. But I am really very happy that I have had an injury-free season.  Copyright

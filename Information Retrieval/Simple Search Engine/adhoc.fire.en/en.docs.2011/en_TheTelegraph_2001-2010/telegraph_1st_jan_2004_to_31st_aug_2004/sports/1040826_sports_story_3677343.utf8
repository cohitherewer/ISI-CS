 Kate Allen wins triathlon 
Athens: Kate Allen produced a stunning run to overhaul long-time leader Loretta Harrop in the last 150 metres of the womens Olympic triathlon on Wednesday and win Austrias first gold in Athens. The Australia-born 34-year-old, who became an Austrian citizen only two years ago, was one of the last out of the 1500m swim and completed the gruelling 40km bike leg in 28th place, 2:48 minutes behind Harrop, who had led from the start. Australian Harrop, the 1999 world champion and runner-up this year, appeared a certain winner as she pulled clear of a trio of Americans on the baking three-lap 10 km run. Andre Ward saved the American boxing team from an historic failure and aims to heal his countrys battered pride by pursuing Olympic gold. The light-heavyweights convincing quarter-final win over Russian world champion Evgeny Makarenko secured him at least a bronze and means the US squad will not leave the Games without a boxing medal for the first time. With just another fighter left in the quarter finals, middleweight Andre Dirrell, the Americans are still about to suffer their worst Olympic performance.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

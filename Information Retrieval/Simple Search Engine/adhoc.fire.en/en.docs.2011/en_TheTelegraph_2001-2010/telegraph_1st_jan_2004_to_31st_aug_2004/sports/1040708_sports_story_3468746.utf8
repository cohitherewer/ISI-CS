 Batsmans task more difficult now
 - Going by ones instinct is the best way to bat, says Sachin  Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar do some stretching exercises in Chennai on Wednesday. (AFP) Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar believes advancement of technology has made the task of a batsman quite difficult. Technology has changed the complexion of the game which means players now need to do their homework differently, he said on Wednesday. Surely new things are coming up. There are different ways of doing your homework. Now with the help of technology, from software development to camera improvement, there have been good changes, Tendulkar said in an interview on Wednesday He said bowlers around the world did not have technological facilities 20 years ago but they are now being able to figure out what the batsmen and the captain are trying to do. Overall, the whole complexion of the game has changed. There are going to be further developments in technological aspects of cricket. You only try and make yourself better and try to explore different things. Having tormented bowlers world over, Tendulkar said he only relied on his instincts and did not believe in pre-planning his innings. When you go out to bat, all the bowlers are trying hard to get you out. When they try very hard to do that, I basically go with the same frame of mind like what I have done for so many years now, obviously with little changes here and there. The idea is to score runs without giving away your wicket and minimise the risk factor... Before playing a particular shot, I plan and decide whether to play the shot or not. All these factors are important and that happens once you are in the middle. You cannot preplan ideas, Tendulkar said. I go by my instincts, whether it is to play a shot or leave the ball. Going by ones instinct is the best form of batting. On whether bowling standards had changed since his debut, he said, nobody becomes a great bowler overnight. Wasim Akram took 15 years to get his bearings. Similarly, Waqar played 13-14 years, Imran also played 17-18 years. So no one becomes great overnight. There is a time frame for everything. There is always a start in ones career and if one keeps performing consistently, he becomes a great bowler. It is a process and no one can speed it up. It takes x number of years and after those years the world starts recognising you as a good bowler. Youve got to go step by step. Asked to name some young Indian players who can make it big, he said, it has been a wonderful experience to see the progress of the younger lot in India. You feel proud of the younger lot when they are coming up well. Tendulkar pointed out Munaf Patel and Sairaj Bahutule were good bowlers. Then there are a couple of guys like Sreesanth and Siddharth Trivedi who are also promising bowlers. I can speak more about the bowlers because they come and bowl to us often at camps. I have heard about Tamil Nadus Dinesh Karthik for his wicketkeeping and batting. (PTI)  Copyright

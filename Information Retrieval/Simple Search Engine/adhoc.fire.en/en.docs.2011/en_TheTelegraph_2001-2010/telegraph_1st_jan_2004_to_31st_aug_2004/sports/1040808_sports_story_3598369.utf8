 El Guerrouj says hes fit
Zurich, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Four-time world 1500 metres champion Hicham el Guerrouj will run in Athens after overcoming breathing problems that had threatened his participation at the Olympic Games which get underway on Friday. Everyone knows that I was ill but Im better now and my asthma is under control, said the Moroccan after a Golden League meeting in Zurich.I still want to win gold in Athens. El Guerrouj said in July he was considering not competing at the Olympics because of the mystery problems that were affecting his form and promised to make a decision after this meet. He suffered only his second defeat since the 2000 Sydney Olympics as he was edged into second place by Kenyas Bernard Lagat in Zurich. But El Guerrouj was not concerned by his performance, which ended an eight-year winning streak in Zurich. Hopefully, my daughter will be able to say: I was born in 2004, the year my father became an Olympic winner.  Copyright

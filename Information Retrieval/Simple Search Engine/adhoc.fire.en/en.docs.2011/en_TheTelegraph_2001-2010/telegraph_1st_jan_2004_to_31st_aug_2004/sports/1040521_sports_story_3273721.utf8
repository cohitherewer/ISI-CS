 Australia, England to blame: Murali 
 - Lanka offie says he can live without the doosra, even as Brett Lee offers support  Muttiah Muralidharan Colombo: Pressure from Australia and England fuelled the ban on his controversial doosra delivery, Sri Lankas star spinner Muttiah Muralidharan said on his return home Thursday. Arriving to a heros welcome after the Zimbabwe tour during which he set a new world record for Test wickets, Muralidharan said he could live without the doosra. Even if they insist, I dont mind, I can bowl several others, Muralidharan said. This ban is because of pressure from Australia and England. There is no problem in Asia. No one in Asia has complained about it. The off-spinner said he was moved by the support he received within the country as well as from neighbouring Test playing nations following the International Cricket Councils (ICC) move to outlaw the doosra. Affectionately known as Murali, the 32-year-old drove in an open truck from the Bandaranaike International Airport to the capital Colombo where several receptions awaited him. Prime Minister Mahindra Rajapakse was also hosting a reception to which several lawyers had been invited to mount a legal challenge to the ICC ban on the controversial delivery. Muralidharan got past retired West Indian paceman Courtney Walshs previous world mark of 519 during the first Test of the Zimbabawe tour at Harare and reached 527 by the second and final Test at Bulawayo. Muralidharan, whose unorthodox action has seen him no-balled for throwing in the past, has come under fresh scrutiny because of the doosra and has been told that if he persists with it he could face a year-long ban. Match referee Chris Broad had reported Murali to the ICC after the spinner used the doosra during Sri Lankas home Test series against Australia in March. Murali was then sent to Australia to work on his bowling action with a biomechanical expert. In London, the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said the report forwarded to him by Sri Lanka Cricket, but compiled by the University of Western Australia, meant the doosra could no longer be tolerated. Meanwhile in Singapore, Australian fast bowler Brett Lee, who is back in training after ankle surgery, came in support of Murali, who has been barred from bowling his controversial doosra by the(ICC. Hes a great talent and I cant see any reason why they cant let him keep bowling, Lee said. As far as I see, hes a guy who really enjoys his cricket. I think that he means well. The reason why bowlers are getting more scrutinised these days is because of the technology. So we have to leave that up to the biomechanist to make up their mind with regard to his action, said Lee, whose bowling action has also been queried in the past. Lee, 27, had the operation in March, expects to start bowling again within six weeks. And said he hoped to be fit for the two-Test series against Sri Lanka in Darwin and Cairns in July. I will definitely make sure that I am ready for India though, Lee, who is in Singapore for an awards function, said on Thursday. Australia are due to start a tour of India in September.

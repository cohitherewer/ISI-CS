The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India lucky to make final, says Miandad
 - Improper planning cost us bonus point against arch-rivals  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Javed Miandad in the city on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: India were fortunate to make the Asia Cup final, says Javed Miandad. The former batsman also feels Pakistan failed to make the cut because they didnt try hard enough to secure the bonus point against their arch-rivals. In the city on a brisk promotional trip for a TV news channel, the former Pakistan coach said on Wednesday that his country is not consistently delivering the goods because the players are not getting the time to mature enough. He added that a foreign coach is not a necessity. India were lucky to win (Tuesdays Asia Cup match against Sri Lanka. They had no chance till very late in the match and their body language showed it. They were not aggressive or involved enough. Also, the fielding and bowling was ordinary. India won because Virender Sehwag got the crucial breakthrough and Irfan Pathan bowled a fantastic 49th over. It was he who did the trick, because 11 to defend in the last over is not very difficult. Sri Lanka would have won had Pathan not conceded just four runs in that penultimate over, Miandad noted. The hero of many Indo-Pak duels suggested India should not play with two spinners  as they did on Tuesday  in the final. If needed, field all three left-arm medium-pacers and just one spinner, either Anil Kumble or Harbhajan Singh. This is because Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar are pretty good as part-time spinners. The important thing is, you have to include V.V.S. Laxman and go in with seven specialist batsmen, said Miandad. On Pakistans failure to reach the final despite beating India, Miandad said the team suffered because men entrusted with the responsibility of planning failed to perform their duties. This was certainly a veiled criticism of his successor Bob Woolmer, though Miandad didnt take names. Against India, they should have gone for the kill right after Kaifs dismissal. They knew what the points system is and what score India needed. Planning accordingly is the job of those who are appointed to think of these things. They miscalculated and this is where things went wrong. Miandad evaded queries on whether the appointment of Woolmer would do Pakistan any good, but added that its not necessary to hire a foreign coach. You need men with practical experience, men who have played the game. You need knowledge that cant come from reading books. I dont think there is a dearth of such people in Pakistan. Did we need a foreign coach when we won the World Cup? In Pakistan, local talents are not always recognised. He opined that the current lot is not winning consistently because there are too many players who are not seasoned enough. These players are thrown into international cricket after a few domestic ties and they find it difficult to cope with the pressure. We must remember that a player must have a minimum knowledge base before graduating into the international level.  Copyright

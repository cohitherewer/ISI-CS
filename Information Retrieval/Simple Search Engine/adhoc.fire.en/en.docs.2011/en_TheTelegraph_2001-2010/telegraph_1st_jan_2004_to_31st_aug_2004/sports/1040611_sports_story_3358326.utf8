 A taste of top-level training in the US
New Delhi: The 26 hockey probables, undergoing training in the US in their bid to win a medal in the Olympics, are shaping up well for the mega event, team sources said Thursday. The probables are training alongside top US sports stars including tennis pro Meghann Shaughnessy, American football players and ace baseball player Mark Garciaparra at the athletes performance centre in Arizona. We dont know how helpful the training will be as the stint here is quite short, but one thing is certain that the training is going to make 100 per cent difference to the teams overall attitude, sources said. I hope athletes and players of other games as well in India get to know what extra it takes to win medals at top level competitions. The sources said the high-level of training at the institute, being run by Mark Verstegen and his wife Amy Wilson, along with a team of professional trainers, physiotherepists and psychologists, is not only helping the players, but also the coaches. It is an awe inspiring experience even for the coaches and we are recording each and every exercise which is being done here. The latest hydraulic gymnasium and equipment make the atmosphere more conducive for hard training, the sources said. Once in Arizona, the probables underwent bio-mechanical tests. Soon after, they were divided into three groups with each group being given individual attention. Everything is planned well in advance and all the trainers follow the same set of exercises. Lot of importance is being given to maximise the potential of the athlete by integrating world class facilities and trained staff. The sources said that renowned sports psychologist Jim Afremow from the Michigan University is interacting with the probables and with mental tools and latest skills teaching them how to excel in the heat of competition.

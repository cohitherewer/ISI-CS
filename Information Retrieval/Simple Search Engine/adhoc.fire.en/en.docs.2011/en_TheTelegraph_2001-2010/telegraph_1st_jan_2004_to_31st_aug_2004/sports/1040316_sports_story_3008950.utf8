 Kapils kudos for bowlers 
Allahabad: Legendary allrounder Kapil Dev on Monday lauded the Indian bowlers for holding their nerves during the teams five-run win over Pakistan in the opening ODI in Karachi. The Indian bowlers held their own to carve out a narrow victory despite the fact that the track did not offer any assistance to them, Kapil told reporters here. According to Kapil, the performance of the bowlers would be the key to Indias success during the remainder of the one-day and Test series. Kapil also felt the tracks in Pakistan should be sporting. The pitches should be fair to both the batsmen and the bowlers, he said, referring to the bowlers plight in the Karachi one-dayer. The World Cup winning captain also heaped praise on Mohammed Kaif for his outstanding contribution to the match. Kapil said the 22-year-old proved his worth by scoring runs at No. 6 position, which was always difficult in the shorter version of the game.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Court stays AGM; Rachpal to quit
 BY SUJIT BHAR Calcutta: The Amateur Athletic Association, West Bengal (AAAWB), returns to troubled tracks after seven years of relative peace. Top cop Rachpal Singh, who led the toppling of the last order (in 1997) has decided to stand down from the presidents post, saying: I have had a fruitful innings and I believe two terms are enough. Officials have already decided, it was learnt, on a heavyweight for the top post. At the AAAWB office bearers are chosen by the 26 executives who are elected first. A contest is decided by secret ballot. Former secretary Udoy Sarkar (who had been banned for six years for alleged defalcation of funds) has already been selected (uncontested) as an executive committee member. He wants to be the secretary again. The current disposition wants Debashis Banerjee, secretary of the Howrah District Sports Association. Sarkar, though, felt threatened that the proposed venue (elections were to be held along with the 54th annual general meeting at Howrah Sarat Sadan Sunday) wont be safe, because Banerjee has his way there. Hence, Sarkar said, he rushed to the city civil court and obtained a temporary stay on this meeting from Justice A. Baruahs court. I now have time till July 23, as per the order, Sarkar told this correspondent. Banerjee said he will wait till he receives the court order in hand. The current officials and Singh, it seems, fell out during the BOA elections (on March 21), where B.K. Saha replaced Asoke Ghosh (who is now life president) and where Banerjee, says a source, seemingly went against the wishes of Singh. Singh, who was pushing the case of Dilip Bhattacharya, did not like this. Sarkar, interestingly, is representing Mohun Bagan. Also, it was Singh who took the then officials to task (1997), leading a charge of fresh faces in the association, dislodging Sarkar amp; Co. Nobody speaks to me nowadays, maybe they dont need me any more, Singh told The Telegraph Thursday. I have done my bit, and I have had a good innings. He, however, refused to accept that he was in any way related to the positioning of Sarkar. I have no information on this, he said.  Copyright

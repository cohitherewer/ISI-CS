The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Discussion in Dubai
 - Gibbs-Boje issue not off the Indian and South African boards agenda  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Gibbs Calcutta, June 12: Jagmohan Dalmiya and Ray Mali, who met on the sidelines of Thursdays International Cricket Council (ICC) convened Zimbabwe-summit in Dubai, didnt just discuss South Africas itinerary during the 2004-05 tour of India  the Herschelle Gibbs-Nicky Boje issue came up too. The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA), it may be recalled, has sought an assurance that neither Gibbs nor Boje  accused by the Delhi Police of match-fixing on the 1999-00 trip to India  will be arrested or even questioned if they again make the squad. Logically, both should figure in the Proteas line-up. We did talk about the players I advised Mr Mali to specifically list his apprehensions. After all, before approaching the Delhi Police or anybody else, I must be clear why the South Africans are so apprehensive four years after the probe was launched, Dalmiya, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, told The Telegraph. Mali, the UCBSA chief, said he would communicate after getting home. The BCCI has already announced it cant offer any guarantee on behalf of a government agency. However, while the Delhi Police unearthed the biggest cricket scandal 50 months ago, hardly anything has been heard since. So, even if the investigation hasnt been formally closed  culprit No.1 Hansie Cronje died two years back  its debatable whether anything is actually still being probed. Incidentally, the then chief investigator, Dr K.K. Paul, now heads the Delhi Police. Cronje, Gibbs and Boje apart, the Delhi Police charged Henry Williams and Pieter Strydom. Both Williams and Strydom landed in India as non-entities and, predictably, quickly went out of circulation on returning to South Africa. The UCBSA, of course, banned Gibbs for six months (from international cricket) but Bojes denial under oath (before the King Commission) helped him escape punishment. Meanwhile, Dalmiya informed that the Zimbabwe Cricket Unions (ZCUs) presentation in Dubai was outstanding. Apparently, its going to be repeated before the ICCs Executive Board, in London, on June 30. The Executive Board is slated to appoint an eminent person(s) to probe the rebel players allegation that the ZCU operates on racist lines. According to Dalmiya, who was specially invited for the summit, the presentation dispelled that charge.  Copyright

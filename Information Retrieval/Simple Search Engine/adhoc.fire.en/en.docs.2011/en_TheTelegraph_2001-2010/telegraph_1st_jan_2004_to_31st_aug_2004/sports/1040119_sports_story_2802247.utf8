The Telegraph - Calcutta
 JCT not taking Md. Sp. lightly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  I.M. Vijayan is Mohammedan Sportings main danger Calcutta: The last week had been quite a nightmare for Mohammedan Sporting. After a mauling by East Bengal on Friday, they will be up against a powerful JCT on Monday, who have had a dream run in the city so far. The Punjab side (18 points) has won both matches in the city. They will leave no stone unturned to garner full points and finish the first-leg on a high. However, JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh looked far from complacent on the eve of the match at the Howrah Stadium. I have seen Mohammedan Sporting in a couple of games. True, they havent won, but theyre playing quite well, Sukhwinder said. Mohammedan Sporting are lying low at six points from ten games and a they need a win desperately to have breathing space before the next leg starts. In fact, Jamshed Nassiri, the coach of the black-and-white brigade, said its absolutely essential the boys deliver now. Anything less than full points is going to make things just a little tougherwell do our best, Nassiri said. What has really been bothering the Mohammedan Sporting coach is their inability to score. Ive been harping on this point for quite some time now. How can you get points if you cant score, the coach quipped. Isnt the morale of the boys a little down after the 0-4 hammering against East Bengal? True, we conceded too many goals But we didnt play badly in the first session. Were conceding freak goals and things are going downhill thereon. The coach added that this tendency is something they will have to guard against. He is hoping to have the services of Satish Bharti, who was nursing an injury. If he can play, it will be a boost for us. Nassiri has great respect for the opposition they will be up against. They have quality players in Jo Paul Ancheri and I.M. Vijayan. Well have to keep a close watch on Vijayan. The Keralite has been excellent form, scoring five goals in the ongoing NFL. Mohammedan Sporting can take heart from the fact that JCT will be without the services of Nigerian forward Stephen Abarowei. Either Charanjit Singh or Manjit Singh will take his place.  Noel arrives Zimbabwe midfielder Noel Tafadzwa Kaseka arrived in the city on Sunday to play for Mohun Bagan. Provided his International Transfer Certificate (ITC) comes on time, Mohun Bagan plan to field him for Thursdays match against East Bengal.  Copyright

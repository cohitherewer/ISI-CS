The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indias pride rests on EB shoulders 
FREE-KICK - P.K. BanerjeeBarring a miracle the National Football League title will stay with East Bengal. We will not talk much about why they should become the first team to defend this title, because this we had done in these columns way back in November, when East Bengal were not enjoying the best of times. As predicted at then, East Bengal have gone from strength to strength and recovered strongly from a sluggish start to emerge on the threshold of becoming the first team ever to win back-to-back National League titles. Whats important at this juncture is to see what East Bengal and Subhas Bhowmick can do hereon. Where they can go from here and how they should approach bigger goals. Since Bhowmick has conditionally agreed to a contract renewal, itll be interesting to see how he can go about his task this time. Clearly, East Bengal will carry extra responsibility and expectation on their shoulders each time they take the field in the upcoming season. Apart from facing this task, East Bengal will also carry the national flag because they will most certainly play more international games than the national team, and they are better than the Indian team anyway. East Bengals strength revolves around their foreigners, who are decisively ahead of their Indian counterparts. Apart from Bhaichung Bhutia, other Indian players have seldom matched the consistency of these foreigners like Mike Okoro, Douglas da Silva and Cristiano Junior. I am not saying Indian players like Debjit Ghosh, Surkumar Singh, Mahesh Gawli, M. Suresh cant perform consistently. They can, but they hardly do. This is where East Bengal have to improve if they are to challenge the better Asian teams. They have to eliminate mistakes. Bhowmick, club officials and sponsors have tried their best to ensure that the players stay fit, so physically, I expect East Bengal players to maintain a high standard throughout. The more I see of Bhowmick, the more impressed I am. He was quite volatile, robust and temperamental. With age, he has matured into such a sensible and careful coach. Well before the start of the season, he had envisaged something, chalked out a plan and worked towards it with utmost sincerity. Never for a moment during the lean phase, when people had started writing his team off, did Bhowmick openly blame his players for failures. He must have given them a piece of his mind in the dressing room, but that never became public. The players responded in befitting manner, by taking the team so close to the title. This reciprocation of faith and confidence between the coach and his wards has been a feature of this East Bengal team. The results are showing. I must admit that I expect more from East Bengal than I do from the Indian team. The East Bengal team is stronger because they have the best of Indian talent with the foreigners giving them the cutting edge. This means added responsibility on East Bengal, Indias pride rests on their shoulders and it is up to them to take it to newer heights. I wish them well, they have shown the urge to make things happen and are trying to bring an air of change in Indian football. I also pray for the ailing wizard of football, the prince of the poor, the genius who brought unprecedented joy to millions  the one and only Diego Maradona. Undoubtedly, he is the best the world has ever seen. I have seen Pele, Beckenbauer, Platini, Rummenigge and Zico in action and heard about Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas. At best, the likes of Pele and Di Stefano can come close to Maradona. There must be something about a man who commands such adulation from millions across the globe without ever being a good PR man. I wish he lives longer. True, he will no longer bring the kind of joy he did as a player. But considering the amount of delight he produced, he deserves a longer life.  Copyright

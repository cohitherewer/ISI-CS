 Loves labour lost on Chinese paddlers 
 Li Nan has been booted from the Chinese squad Beijing: Four members of Chinas top ranked table tennis squad have been axed for striking up romances with teammates, as the countrys paddlers begin intensive training for the 2004 Athens Olympics. The crucial point is whether being in love and being in excessive heat is influencing training and match results, head coach Cai Zhenhua told the China Sports Daily. Presently what we are doing is changing their environment, cooling them down, letting them think a bit, this is good for each player as well as the team management. Players punished included Bai Yang, 19, the girlfriend of world No. 1 ranked mens player Ma Lin and Fan Ying, 17, the girlfriend of world No. 4 player Wang Hao. Also booted from the squad was Li Nan, 21, world number nine and her boyfriend Hou Yingchao. The players all represented China at the 2003 World Championships in Paris in May, where Ma and Wang both disappointed in the mens singles after being eliminated in the quarter finals and the fourth-round, respectively. It was unclear exactly how springtime in Paris affected their play, but by October Ma appeared to have recovered his form, winning the World Cup mens table tennis championships in China, while Wang was eliminated in the quarter finals. Cai, however, said Ma and Wang were not booted from the squad because they have recently had good results, despite the poor showings in Paris. Chinas paddlers have long dominated world table tennis, with the national side winning four of five gold medals on offer at last years world championships.  (AFP)  Copyright

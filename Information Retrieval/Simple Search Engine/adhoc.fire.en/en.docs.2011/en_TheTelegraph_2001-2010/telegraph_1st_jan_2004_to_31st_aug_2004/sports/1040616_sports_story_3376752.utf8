Once ready, though, something memorable will be there for posterity, Rameez remarked. Meanwhile, looking to revamp the domestic structure, the PCB has been studying the set-up in some countries  including India. Chief selector Wasim Bari, who is pretty influential within the PCB, took it upon himself to specifically obtain details of the first-class structure in India. The Board of Control for Cricket in India wasnt approached and the needful, its learnt, was done by a Calcutta-based friend of Bari. Clearly, the cricket brass across the border doesnt just respect Team India, there seems much admiration for a set-up which has contributed to the building of a successful side.

The captain, holidaying in the US, is expected home in a day or two.  Copyright

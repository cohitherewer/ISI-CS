The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tough road for Federer
 - French Open 
- Henin-Hardenne kicks off campaign vs Testud  Roger Federer works out at Roland Garros on Friday. (AFP) Paris: World No.1 Roger Federer faces a potential third-round showdown with three-times winner Gustavo Kuerten in a tough opening week at the French Open which starts on Monday. The Wimbledon and Australian Open champion has never made it past the quarter finals at Roland Garros and the draw made on Friday did not help him this year. In the top half of the mens draw are the winners of the last four finals in Paris, title-holder Juan Carlos Ferrero, fellow-Spaniard Albert Costa and Brazils Kuerten, as well as Federer. Ferreros participation was still doubtful on Friday due to injury and his coach said the Spanish fourth seed would make a decision on Saturday. After a first-round match against a qualifier, Federer could meet Frances Thierry Ascione or German Nicolas Kiefer before a likely clash with 1997, 2000 and 2001 winner Kuerten. Federer also has two other former Grand Slam winners, Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Russian Marat Safin, in his half of the draw as well as French favourite Sebastien Grosjean. I know I can play well on clay, I never had any doubts about it, Federer toldlEquipe.I had good results on it, I won Hamburg twice and its a big tournament on the surface. Thats why I have high ambitions for Paris, if only because I want to defend my world No.1 ranking and that I need good results for that, he added. Federer has lost in the first round in the past two years. By contrast, Andy Roddicks path looks a little less gruelling. The US Open champion will start his campaign against compatriot Todd Martin in a bottom half of the draw comprising past Roland Garros winners Andre Agassi and Carlos Moya. Third-seeded Argentine Guillermo Coria, the most successful claycourt specialist this season, is in the same quarter of the draw as Moya. The other main seeds in Roddicks half are serve-and-volley players like Briton Tim Henman, seeded ninth, and Australian Mark Philippoussis. In the womens draw, world No.1 Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne begins her campaign against Frenchwoman Sandrine Testud. The defending champion will start the tournament after a six-week break because of a virus and said she was not the favourite because of her health problems. To resume playing on clay at the French Open without any reference is not easy. To be fresh could be a bonus but the absence of matchplay could be a problem. As a result, Im not the big favourite but Im coming to defend my chances as far as I can, Henin-Hardenne said. Frances Amelie Mauresmo, the third seed who has won her last two tournaments on clay in Berlin and Rome, was drawn against Slovak Ludmila Cervanova. Serena and Venus Williams, seeded second and fourth respectively, are in the bottom half of the draw with compatriot Jennifer Capriati. Martina Navratilova, who last won the tournament in 1984, will make her Grand Slam singles return against Argentine Gisela Dulko, ranked 61st in the world.  Copyright

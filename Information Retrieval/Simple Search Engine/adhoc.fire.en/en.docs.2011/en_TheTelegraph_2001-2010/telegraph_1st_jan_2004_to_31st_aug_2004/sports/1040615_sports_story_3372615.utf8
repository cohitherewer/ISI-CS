 Garcia bags fifth PGA title
Harrison: Spains Sergio Garcia captured his fifth PGA Tour title on Sunday after he battled past South Africas Rory Sabbatini and Irelands Padraig Harrington on the third playoff hole at the Buick Classic. Garcia stroked in a five-footer for birdie, just after Sabbatini had missed his 20-foot attempt, to land his second Buick title in four years and his second win of the season, both in playoffs. Halfway leader Fred Couples shot a three-under-par 68 to finish tied for fourth on 274 with world No.3 Vijai Singh, who carded a one-under-par 70, and journeyman Tom Byrum (72). Britains Luke Donald double-bogeyed the first hole and never recovered, shooting an even-par 72 to finish alone in seventh on 275 for his third top-10 of the season. First round leader Fredrik Jacobson (69) never came close to his Thursday 64 and finished in eighth place another stroke back. Kenny Perry had the best round of the day, a five-under 66, to move into a tie for ninth with South African Tim Clark, Chris DiMarco, Bo Van Pelt and Cameron Beckman on 277. Neither Ernie Els (70) or Phil Mickelson (73) each finished tied for 16th on 279. Even if I would have not won here, Id still be confident because Ive been playing well, Garcia said. But it definitely helps. Every time you get a win, its that much sweeter. Im really looking forward to next week. I feel like I know what I want to do on the course, I feel like my game is responding quite well. This course has just been really good to me, Garcia said. Im very pleased and very thankful about that.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

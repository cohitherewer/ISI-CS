(AFP) Faro: A classy free-kick from Portugal striker Pauleta earned the Euro 2004 hosts a 1-1 draw with England in an unsatisfying friendly international on Wednesday. Portugal, looking for victory to celebrate Luis Figos 100th international appearance, fell behind at the start of the second half when the ball flew in off a combination of Miguel Monteiro and Englands Ledley King as they jostled to reach a David Beckham free-kick. Missed chances in attack and mistakes from both defences characterised much of the game but Pauleta clinched a draw for his side with a chilly nights one moment of real quality. With 20 minutes to go, he curled a 25-metre shot over the wall, past goalkeeper David James and into the top corner for the equaliser. In Dublin, Brazil were held to a 0-0 draw by Ireland in a friendly on Wednesday and were saved from defeat only by poor finishing from the home side. Defenders John OShea and Stephen Carr both came close to giving Brian Kerrs men the lead in the first half and Tottenham Hotspur striker Robbie Keane put a second-half header over the bar when it looked easier to score. Ronaldo and Kaka had a quiet night up front for the Brazilians and their best effort came from Ronaldinho, who grazed the Irish crossbar with a 74th-minute effort from the edge of the box. Brazils Arsenal midfielder Gilberto Silva was substituted after 14 minutes with a twisted ankle. In Brussels, Louis Saha scored on his international debut as France won their 14th successive match by beating Belgium 2-0 in a friendly on Wednesday. The European champions, who were without their usual strikers Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet through injury, failed to impress against an awkward Belgian side as they started their build-up to this summers European Championship finals in Portugal. Olympique Lyon forward Sidney Govou opened the scoring after 45 minutes when he pushed the ball into the empty net after Belgium goalkeeper Geert De Vlieger failed to block a shot from Saha. The Manchester United recruit doubled the tally 15 minutes from time when he was set up by Zinedine Zidane to slot the ball past second choice goalkeeper Frederic Herpoel. Quick-fire strikes from midfielders Joseba Etxeberria and Ruben Baraja allowed a rusty Spain to fight back from a goal down to claim a 2-1 victory over Peru in Barcelona. Peru took a deserved lead in the 21st minute when midfielder Nolberto Solano scored with a perfectly struck shot from the edge of the area after controlling a cross from forward Andres Mendoza with his chest. Just as Spain looked as though they were about to fold under the pressure they turned the game around with two quick-fire goals. Valencia winger Vicente sent a hopeful cross in from the left, the ball spun off the head of a defender and fell to Etxeberria who cracked in on the volley from close range. Two minutes later Spain were in front, midfielder Ruben Baraja directing a powerful header low inside the far post after club colleague Vicente had supplied a great cross from the right. In Palermo, a superb 89th-minute goal from Tomas Rosicky gave the Czech Republic a 2-2 draw with Italy. Italy looked to have sealed a win in the meeting of two of this years European Championship contenders when Antonio Di Natale put them 2-1 up four minutes from the end with a header. But Rosicky, a class act throughout, found space to beat Gianluigi Buffon with a beautiful shot from the edge of the penalty area to extend the Czechs unbeaten run to 20 matches. The Italians had taken a 14th-minute lead through a scrappy Christian Vieri goal before Jiri Stajner brought the visitors level just before the break with a header. Meanwhile, Arjen Robbens second-half strike gave The Netherlands a 1-0 win over the US in an international friendly in the Amsterdam Arena as the Dutch began their build-up for the Euro 2004 finals. In Split, substitute Carsten Ramelow scored with a last-minute, long-range shot to give Germany a 2-1 victory over Croatia. Ramelows shot from 20 metres took a vicious deflection off midfielder Jerko Leko to beat keeper Stipe Pletikosa. Croatia had looked insecure at the back in the first half and Germany took advantage when Miroslav Klose scored in the 34th minute after a pass from Kevin Kuranyi  the only goal from several good first-half chances for both sides. The hosts levelled on 86 minutes with a header from Mato Neretljak, after piling on the pressure throughout the second half. Swedes, Swiss beaten Albania surprised Euro 2004 finalists Sweden by rallying from a goal down to beat them 2-1. Goals from Ervin Skela and Ardian Aliaj turned the game around after Stefan Selakovic had fired Sweden ahead five minutes into the second half. Morocco, fielding a complete reserve side after their recent African Nations Cup exertions, stunned a disjointed Switzerland 2-1. Second half goals from Ahmed Ajeddou and substitute Mohssine Iajour left the Euro 2004 finalists in disarray, before they saved some face with a last-minute goal from striker Alexander Frei. Jamaica scored early in the first half and late in the second to register a surprise 2-0 win over a strong Uruguay side on Wednesday. With only star attacker Alvaro Recoba missing through injury, Uruguay were outfought for most of the game by the Jamaicans. Striker Onandi Lowe stunned the Uruguayans in the ninth minute when he scored with a blistering left-foot free kick from 25 metres, sending the 27,000 crowd into a frenzy. Jermaine Johnson came off the bench in the second half before skilfully weaving his way past two defenders and Munua to double Jamaicas lead in the 82nd minute. In Athens, Greece extended their unbeaten run to a record 14 internationals on Wednesday after a comfortable 2-0 victory over Bulgaria. Wales striker Robert Earnshaw hit a hattrick to sink Scotland 4-0 in a friendly on Wednesday and help ease the disappointment of missing out on the Euro 2004 finals following their playoff defeat to Russia. In Belfast, Northern Ireland broke their two-year goal drought on Wednesday but still lost 4-1 to Norway in a friendly international. In Caracas, Australia, missing a number of key players including Leeds United striker Mark Viduka, were held to a 1-1 draw by Venezuela in a friendly match Wednesday after the home side equalised in injury time at the end of the game.

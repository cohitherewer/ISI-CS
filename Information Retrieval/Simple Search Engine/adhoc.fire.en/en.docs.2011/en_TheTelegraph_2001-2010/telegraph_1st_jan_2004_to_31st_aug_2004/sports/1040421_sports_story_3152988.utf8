The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Our bowlers didnt use their brains: Waqar
 - Pakistan lacked intensity in series versus India, feels former skipper  Waqar (seen here in New Delhi on Tuesday) says Dravid is the most difficult Indian to bowl at New Delhi: Waqar Younis is disappointed with the effort of the Pakistani bowlers in the series against India. The former great, who announced his retirement recently, said bowling was a big letdown for Pakistan and added he had no idea, why there was no sting in it. Shoaib Akthar, Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed all have great potential but looked like going through motions, probably because of the pressure of playing against India. There have got to be some problems with our bowlers. We have to use our brain while bowling. I think they are not putting their brain behind bowling. They are not thinking about what they are doing, Waqar said. Waqar said that the Pakistani bowlers were not consistent, nor did they bowl well in tandem. If you have to swing, you have to release the ball with timing just as a batsman has to time his shot. Umar Gul swung it so nicely in Lahore because his wrist position and action were right. I would say the same for L. Balaji and Irfan Pathan. You see the seam coming off their hands. Does he think Shoaib has an attitude problem? I dont really know. It will be harsh of me to say anything like this. But definitely the board should look into it. There is something wrong but I cannot say what. Pakistan lacked intensity during this series, which is not good. They were not the Pakistani side I knew. They did not have aggression. They murdered New Zealand and South Africa but probably the tension of playing India got the better of them. Speaking of Pakistans inexperienced batting, Waqar said that either Yusuf Youhana or Inzamam-ul Haq should have batted at No. 3. The feared speedster of the Nineties was all praise for the Indian batting. Indias top six are all capable of making big runs, not 105 or 110 but 280 or 300. India has the batting which can always put 600 runs on the board. Of Rahul Dravid, Waqar said he is one of the few batsmen in the world who are technically so correct. His feet movement, his body, his elbow are all text book. He is a top player but I will not call him great at the moment, he said. I would rather bowl to Virender Sehwag than to Dravid because Dravid is a teaser. He just milks you. If Sehwag and Dravid go into a bad patch, there are more chances of Dravid coming back because he is technically more sound. Even Sachin Tendulkar gives the bowler a little more chance. If I continuously bowl four or five good balls to him I will probably create a chance but Dravid has such good temperament. He does not mind even if you bowl 20 balls in a good area. He will still block you. About Pathan and Balaji, Waqar said they are good bowlers who want to learn. They are nice guys too but please do not overdo them. Indians have made such mistakes in the past. When Ajit Agarkar had done 20 matches everyone in India thought another Kapil Dev had arrived. Kapil Dev comes once in a century. The former captain said team spirit is a hallmark of this Indian team. Look at the incident of the declaration when Tendulkar was on 194. It would have been a huge issue in Pakistan or England. Sachin did not like it, but he came out saying please dont make an issue of it. This brings out the bonding between cricketers. The Indian dressing room was excellent. You win matches from the dressing room. The way you behave in the dressing room is the way you play out in the middle.  (PTI)  Copyright

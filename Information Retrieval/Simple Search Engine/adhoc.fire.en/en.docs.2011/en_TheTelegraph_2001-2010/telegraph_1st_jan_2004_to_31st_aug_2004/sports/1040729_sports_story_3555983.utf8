The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav showed why he is a great captain 
 BY JAWAGAL SRINATH  Jayasuriya maintained a good run throughout the match Indias thrilling victory over Sri Lanka on Tuesday once again highlighted the unpredictability and uncertainty of this great game of cricket. The result of the entire days efforts was decided in the last ball of the match. Teams might have great names and the players might have performed well, but the result is not always in their hands. The Sri Lankan star Sanath Jayasuriya maintained a good run throughout the match, standing in the way of Indias thrust for the final berth. But in the end, Zaheer Khan, who otherwise looked like a perfect villain on the field, bowled the last over to steal the limelight. Though Jayasuriya played another great innings of his life, his team members would be extremely unhappy with his dismissal. The Sri Lankan players, while applauding Jayasuriyas efforts, would suffer in silence, as it was his dismissal that rolled down the curtains on them. Pakistan too, would like to label Jayasuriya as their biggest enemy. Pakistan did beat India, but they have to accept the reality of tournament rules and indeed, the authority of Indian cricket in Asia. Pakistan will have to wait for another opportunity to show their mettle. There is a thin line that demarcates Gangulys great captaincy and an ordinary leadership. In the end, a true leader is the one who often makes the right decisions, be it selecting the right people for the match, winning the toss and most importantly, marshalling his resources on the field. Ganguly has managed it too well. The bowling changes in the last few overs were a testimony of his good leadership. Such close encounters make the perfect setting for the grand finale on Sunday. So far the tournament hasnt seen the brutality of Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar. But the finals are always different. Zaheers last over must have done a world of difference to his eroding confidence. Great bowlers always work backwards while staging a comeback from an injury. It appears that Zaheer is really working hard to find his place in the XI. But when the team management picks him ahead of fit Ashish Nehra or Balaji, it proves that he is still an automatic choice.

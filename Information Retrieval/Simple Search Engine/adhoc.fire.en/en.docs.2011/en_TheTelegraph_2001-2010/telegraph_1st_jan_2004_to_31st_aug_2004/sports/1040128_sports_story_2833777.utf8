The Telegraph - Calcutta
	 The other on-field soccer deaths Teammates try to revive Benficas Hungarian striker Miklos Feher at Guimaraes Stadium on Sunday. Feher died after collapsing during the Portuguese League match against Vitoria Guimaraes. (Reuters) Benfica striker Miklos Feher, who died of an apparent heart attack during a Portuguese league match on Sunday night, was the second international to die on the pitch in seven months. When the 24-year-old Hungarian collapsed to the rain-sodden pitch in injury-time of a televised match at Vitoria Guimaraes, it immediately brought back memories of Cameroonian Marc-Vivien Foes death in Lyon last year.  Following are some of the tragedies:  Marc-Vivien Foe (Cameroon), 2003  The 28-year-old  fell to the ground unchallenged near the centre circle after  75 minutes of the Confederations Cup semi-final against  Colombia on June 26 last. Despite the immediate attention  of medical staff, he was pronounced dead 45 minutes later.  An autopsy in July said he had died of a heart problem.  Marcio Dos Santos (Brazil), 2002  The 28-year-old  striker died of a heart attack just hours after scoring  a goal for Peruvian side Deportivo Wanka.  Geovanny Cordoba and Hermann Gaviria (Colombia),  2002  The duo, of which the latter was a former international,  died after being struck during a training session. A third  player was struck by lightning and died after a match in  Ukraine the previous July.  Stefan Vrabioru (Romania), 2000  The 26-year-old  Astra Ploiesti player died on the way to hospital following  a fall just minutes after being brought on for his first  division debut against Rapid Bucharest.  Sanjib Dutta (India), 1993  The 27-year-old  Railways midfielder died after an on-field collision in  the Santosh Trophy match against Andhra Pradesh in Kannur  on February 14.  Dave Longhurst (Britain), 1990  The 25-year-old  York City striker collapsed in a league match against Lincoln  City and passed away. An inquest revealed he had suffered  from a rare heart condition.  Samuel Okwaraji (Nigeria), 1989  Collapsed  10 minutes from the end of a World Cup qualifier against  Angola in Lagos and died from cardiac failure. An autopsy  found the 24-year-old had an enlarged heart and high blood  pressure.  Oliver Petit (France), 1987  The 20-year-old  brother of French international midfielder Emmanuel Oliver  died during a match playing for amateur club Arques.  Erik Jongbloed (Netherlands), 1984  The DWS  goalkeeper was killed by lightning during a match in front  of his father, the former national team goalie Jan Jongbloed.  Fernando Pascoal das Neves (Portugal), 1973   The Porto player collapsed and died during a league match   in the 13th minute of the 13th game of the season.  Constantin Tabarcea (Romania), 1963  The 26-year-old  Petrolul Ploiesti player died after collapsing during a  first division match.  John Thompson (Scotland), 1931  The 23-year-old  Celtic and Scotland goalkeeper dived at the feet of Rangers  forward Sam English in Glasgow and suffered a fractured  skull. He died later in hospital without regaining consciousness.  Note  One of the most  infamous soccer deaths of recent years did not happen on  the pitch, but as a direct result of what happened on it.  Andres Escobar (Colombia, 1994) scored an own goal  in Colombias 1-2 defeat to the US in the 1994 World Cup  finals and was murdered soon after returning home to Colombia  by a hitman.

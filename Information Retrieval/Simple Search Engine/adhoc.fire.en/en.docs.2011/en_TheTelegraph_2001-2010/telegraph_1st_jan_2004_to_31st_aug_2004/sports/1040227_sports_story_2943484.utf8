 Marshall fashions WI victory 
Dhaka: Xavier Marshall scored a fine century to book the West Indies place in the semi-finals of the under-19 World Cup. Riding his 133-ball knock 106, the West Indies posted 284 for 6 in their 50 overs  a total that proved to be too much for South Africa, who slumped to a 34-run defeat. Tishan Maraj (34) and Lendl Simmons (30) also provided vital supports to Marshall in anchoring the Caribbean innings. South Africas top-order, however, made a positive start. They reached 100 in 19.4 overs for the loss of only two wickets, but from that point onwards wickets began to fall at regular intervals. Their lower-order fought gamely to the end, but they were still well adrift when Ravi Rampaul bowled Mpumelelo Silwana for 42 with the final ball of the match. Rampaul, who made his senior international debut in South Africa last month, had missed most of the West Indies pool matches because of illness. But he finished with three for 41  all three clean-bowled  and had found his rhythm for the first time in the tournament. The West Indies will play the winners of England and Pakistan tie in the semi-final on March 1. Brief scores West Indies 284/6 (Marshall 106). South Africa 250 (Rampaul 3/41). West Indies won by 34 runs.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

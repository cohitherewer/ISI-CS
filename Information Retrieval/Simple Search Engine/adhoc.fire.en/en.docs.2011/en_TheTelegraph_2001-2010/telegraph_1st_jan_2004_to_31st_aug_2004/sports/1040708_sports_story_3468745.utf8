 Miandad offers help to Woolmer
Lahore: Former Pakistan coach Javed Miandad has promised to fully support his replacement Bob Woolmer despite being sacked from the post last month. Woolmer and I share a long-time friendship, and since he sought my advice I invited him for dinner last night. We exchanged thoughts over coaching Pakistan, Miandad said on Wednesday. Our aim is the same  to move Pakistan cricket forward, the batting great said. Miandad said he would be ready to offer his advice in future, if needed. Woolmer has indicated that he wants to keep Miandad as a member of his back-room team. . I am not the coach but I will be there as part of the coaching team, Miandad said. Miandad, who played county cricket in England with Woolmer, wished him success. I hope the players listen to him and (Woolmer) succeeds in coaching because there are no secrets involved, said Miandad.  (AFP)  Copyright

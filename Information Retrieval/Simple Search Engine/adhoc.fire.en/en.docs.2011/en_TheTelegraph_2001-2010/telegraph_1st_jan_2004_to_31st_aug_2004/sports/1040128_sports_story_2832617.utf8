		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 CRICKET ONLINE - RAVI SHASTRI
				 Take plenty of close catches during practice I am a good  fielder in the deep, but not comfortable when fielding close  to the bat. How can I improve fielding at slip, gully or  point?																										(Mayur Tejawat, 17, Rourkela)																										Nothing like practice. Take plenty of close catches and make sure you enjoy it. I am a righthanded batsman  and find it difficult to negotiate yorkers. Please advise. (Hillol Mondal, 21, Barakar; Muddassar  Faiz, 14, Asansol)																										Watch the ball closely and keep an eye on your backfoot as well. I am a righthander and face  difficulties in tackling short-pitched deliveries. As a  result, I often get caught at silly point or slips. Please  help. (Subhasis Chakraborty, 14, Jalpaiguri)																										Get behind the ball. Watch it carefully and ensure that your bat is close to the body when you are playing it. Whenever I try to hit a  full toss, I end up giving a catch to the bowler. Why does  this happen?																										(Arjun Tudu, 12, Jamshedpur)																										You must be lifting your head at the time of making contact with the ball. I am a right-arm medium  pacer and often end up bowling full tosses when attempting  a slower delivery. Please help.																										(Sayan Roy, 11, Shillong)																										Watch the spot you want the ball to land and keep a track of your arm speed when you are delivering the ball. I am a righthanded batsman  and often get bowled when attempting to defend a slower  delivery. Please advise.																										(Anant Goyal, 11, Calcutta)																										You are not watching the ball. Also ensure you get in line of the ball. I am a righthander and often  caught behind when attempting the hook or the pull. Where  lies the problem?																										(Pranab Dutta, 14, Tinsukia)																										You are not getting in the right position. You may not be getting inside the ball enough while attempting the shot. I am a righthander but find  it comfortable when batting lefthanded. What should I do? (Saurav Chakraborty, 12, Karimganj)																										Do what comes naturally to you. If you feel better playing left handed, go ahead and do it. When attempting the flick,  I end up getting caught and bowled. Why does this happen?																										(Shreyas Grover, 13, Calcutta-34)																										You are closing the face of the bat too early. Just wait for the ball a little longer. When attempting the square  cut, I often get bowled off the inside edge. Please help.																										(Ravi Sharma, 16, Calcutta-10)																										You are obviously trying to cut the ball too close to your body. Also, you may be trying to hit the ball too hard, thus getting the bottom-hand into play more than necessary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan down George 
 - Home team rides late goals from Chhetri, Coelho  A STAFF REPORTER  Sunil Chhetri scores for Mohun Bagan in the Super Division match against George Telegraph at the Mohun Bagan ground on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Two late goals helped Mohun Bagan return with full points in their Super Division encounter against George Telegraph on Wednesday. The glamour sides insipid display had left the spectators restless, prompting some stone-throwing incidents, till goals from Sunil Chhetri and Eduardo Coelho restored sanity and brought relief to all. The first half was dull and boring with Bagan struggling to break the deadlock with some unimaginative moves. Strategy and planning seemed to be at a premium and the players jostled for attention in the midfield. In the second-half, as George Telegraph players crowded the penalty area, Bagan found it increasingly tougher to get past the maze of legs in the absence of any wingplay. Amit wasted a golden opportunity when he was in the clear but instead passed the ball to Eduardo, who was ruled offside. Then, Amits grounder rebounded off the goalpost. The first goal came in the 37th minute. Rishi Kapoors pass was well-intercepted by Chhetri, who chest-trapped the ball before placing it to the right of the goalkeeper. The second goal came minutes before the final whistle. Abhay Kumars corner was headed by Chhetri, and as the ball deflected off a defender, Eduardo was at hand to slot home.

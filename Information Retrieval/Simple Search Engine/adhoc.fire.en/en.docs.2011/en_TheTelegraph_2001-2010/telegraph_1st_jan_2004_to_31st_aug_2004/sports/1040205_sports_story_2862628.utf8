The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jadeja credits Indias success to Sourav
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ajay Jadeja and Akash Chopra during practice at the Eden on Wednesday Calcutta: Ajay Jadeja believes that Sourav Gangulys versatile captaincy is the reason behind Team Indias recent success and he has given a new direction to the side. Dada has given the guys a new level of confidence. He has made them play as a unit rather than a bunch of individuals, Jadeja said on Wednesday. The batting order is never the same in two matches and he makes sure that every player gets to bat. He has made the youngsters feel as important as anyone else in the team and that is the reason why they have performed well, he explained. Jadeja felt that Souravs unpleasant experiences at the start of his career have helped him nurture todays youngsters with care. He had seen some rough times in his early days. Hence he made sure that no one goes through the same experience. The newcomers are comfortable since they are made to feel that they belong to the side. The allrounder strongly feels that there is still room in the middle-order. If you look at the tri-series matches, you will find lot of new faces when compared to the World Cup side. It means that there is an opening. What I can do is just play to potential. The rest will depend on the circumstances. As long as there is a place, you can always make it, Jadeja said. He said he has fulfilled his expectations playing for Delhi this season. Personally, though, I believe I can do better. Jadeja feels he doesnt need motivation and it is the love for the game that has kept him going despite the turbulent times. Once inside the ground, you just concentrate and start enjoying the game. That, he believes, has helped him immensely in his comeback. One-day cricket today is more about physical fitness when compared to the Nineties. Earlier, if one got into the side because of fielding, questions were raised about his capabilities. Nowadays, players get in only because of fielding and its okay. He still enjoys playing at any level and that has kept him going.  Copyright

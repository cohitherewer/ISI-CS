The Telegraph - Calcutta
 New Olympic surface at German camp
 - 26 probables leave for Arizona  BY SUJIT BHAR Calcutta: Twenty-six Olympic hockey hopefuls left New Delhi for Arizona this evening, for a three-week intensive training camp. This signals the start of the final preparatory phase of the Indian hockey squad for Athens. Following this camp and an Amstelveen tournament (the Rabobank Trophy, from June 27 to July 4, also featuring Germany, Holland and Pakistan) the players will be back (on July 5) and before they leave again (on July 11), six will fall from the squad. The final 16 will be found just before the squad enters the Olympic Village. The interesting part of the second part of this pre-Olympic tour will be the surface. According to a source in the Indian Hockey Federation the German camp during this second phase (to be attended by 20 players) will alternate between Cologne (the German institute of sports), Leverkusen (the famous football and hockey club Bayer, where the invitation is) and Nuremberg. In Nuremberg, the surface will be the one to be used at the Olympics venue. It is called Elastigrass (manufactured in France by a Swedish company) and is being used for the first time at the Olympics. The material is polypropelene. It is different from Astroturf, which is nylon66, a different synthetic fibre. This new surface not only fits FIH guidelines, it is also nearer to natural surface, being now used in many indoor (and some outdoor) football pitches in many parts of Europe. Meanwhile, the two German specialists (Barcelona gold medallists) who are to help out in Indias training in Arizona have been sent their tickets and they fly to Arizona from Munich. All reach on Tuesday, the Indians reaching in the evening. Incidentally, this squad of 26 has nine who are eligible to play in the India juniors (U-21) squad in the Junior World Cup in Rotterdam next August. India are the title-holders, having won in Hobart, beating Argentina 6-1 in the 2001 final. These promising juniors are goalkeeper Adrian DSouza, full-back William Xalco, Sandeep Singh (penalty corner specialist and defender), Jatinder Pal Singh (another drag-flick guy like Sandeep), V. Gupta (centre-half), forwards Adam Sinclair, Hari Prasad, Sandeep Michael and R. Tirkey.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia rues missing several chances
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: It was a match Bhaichung Bhutia would like to forget in a hurry. The India captain missed a great chance to score a few and secure East Bengals place in the AFC Cup quarter finals. I am not happy at all. It was not a good match on the personal front. I put in a good effort but still couldnt score, said the star striker after Wednesdays match against Geylang United of Singapore. Added to personal disappointment, there was frustration for not being able to win the game as well.  This was a game we surely should have won. But we missed too many chances. Bhutia, who got a yellow card, said he is aware that the team still has some work to do in order to seal a quarter final berth. I know that we are still not through, we need at least a draw against Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia. There was a sense of relief in the visiting teams camp. We know it would be a tough game as East Bengal is a good side. A draw is better than losing, said Geylangs Australian captain Aleksander Duric. We are happy with the result and now stand a good chance of making the quarters. Our last match (against minnows Islands FC of Maldives) is against a soft team, while East Bengal may get a tough last game. Meanwhile, Geylang United coach Scott ODonnell revealed putting Daniel Anthony Hill upfront was part of a tactical move. Hes basically a central defender. But hes been used as a striker on a few occasions, Odonnell pointed out. Her also picked out Bhutia and Mike Okoro for special mention and praised them for their efforts in the match.  Copyright

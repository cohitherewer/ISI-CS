 England have the team to win: Henry
Santo Tirso (Portugal): France striker Thierry Henry says England are strong enough to win Euro 2004 as the two teams prepared to face each other in Lisbon on Sunday. Henry will face a handful of his Arsenal teammates in the England team and said he was well-placed to judge the strengths of the side captained by David Beckham. I respect them and I know better than anyone that they are capable of winning the Euro, said Henry, whose 30 goals led the English Premiership scoring charts last season. The English play with their hearts. In England you give 100 per cent, which is something I learned over there. Tactical or not, they always give their all. I pay tribute to them because I like people who play like that, who show their emotions through their play instead of just talking. Henry, who is almost certain to start Sundays match, said he would be paying special attention to midfielder Frank Lampard, who has forced his way into Englands first eleven after an outstanding season for Chelsea. He has been incredible this season. I voted for him as my player of the year, said Henry, who instead received the honour voted for by his fellow professionals. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Mumbai take charge
 Bahutule scalped 4 Mumbai: Skipper Sairaj Bahutule claimed four for 42 as Mumbai skittled out Hyderabad for 166 in their first innings on Day I of the Ranji Trophy semi-final on Sunday. Bahutule was well supported by paceman Munaf Patel (three for 40) and left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni (two for 45). In reply, Mumbai were comfortably placed at 84 for no loss at stumps. Electing to bat, Hyderabad could not withstand the accurate line and length of the Mumbai bowlers and lost wickets at regular intervals before getting all out 22 minutes before tea. The only resistance came from young Ambati Rayudu (95), who was the last man to be dismissed. The visitors lost their first wicket in the seventh over of the day when opener Arvind Shetty (15) was bowled through the gate by a beautiful Patel delivery. Experienced D. Vinay Kumar, who joined the other opener Daniel Manohar at the crease, failed to open his account and gave a regulation catch to Vinayak Mane at first slip off Patel. Rayudu, however, remained glued to one end. But he started running short of partners with Hyderabad losing wickets at regular intervals. Though Rayudu and Ibrahim Khaleel added 66 for the fifth wicket, it failed to lend respectability to the total. Rayudu gave a simple catch to Manoj Joglekar at extra cover off Kulkarni trying to complete his century. Meanwhile, in the second semi-final in Chennai, Tamil Nadu reached 244 for six against Railways at stumps on Day I. S. Sriram (81 batting) S. Suresh (44) were the major contributors.

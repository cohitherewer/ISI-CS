 - Capriati, Hewitt battle into last 16; Williams sisters have it easy  Gustavo Kuerten celebrates his victory over Roger Federer at Roland Garros on Saturday. (AFP) Paris, May 29 (Reuters): Gustavo Kuerten taught the worlds best player Roger Federer a claycourt lesson on Saturday, knocking the Swiss top seed out of the French Open with a scintillating 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win in the third round. Lleyton Hewitt survived a Dutch bombardment on Saturday to defeat last years beaten finalist Martin Verkerk 6-2, 3-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 and reach the last 16 of the French Open. Seventh seed Jennifer Capriati battled through to the last 16 with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Russias Elena Bovina. The 28-year-old American was made to fight all the way by 25th seed Bovina, one of the large crop of exciting Russian women on the WTA Tour. Second seed Serena Williams had an easy passage to the fourth round, dismissing unseeded Croatian Silvija Talaja 6-0, 6-4. The American, champion in 2002, made 32 unforced errors but was too good for Talaja, the world No. 106, as she won in 67 minutes to set up a clash with Shinobu Asagoe of Japan. Serenas elder sister Venus blasted Frances Mary Pierce out of the Open, thrashing the 2000 champion 6-3, 6-1. Venus will next play Colombian 23rd seed Fabiola Zuluaga, who beat Slovenias Katarina Srebotnik 5-7, 6-2, 6-3. Also advancing to the mens fourth round were Argentine Gaston Gaudio who ousted Swede Thomas Enqvist 6-0, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4 and Russian Igor Andreev who beat Frenchman Julien Benneteau 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3. Wimbledon and Australian Open champion Federer, a first-round loser at Roland Garros in 2002 and 2003, was made to look thoroughly ordinary by the Brazilian, lovingly called Guga. Kuerten, who remains the darling of the Paris crowd after his three title-triumphs in 1997, 2000 and 2001, has been dogged by hip problems in recent years but he dominated from the start. The 27-year-old Brazilian reduced Federers outstanding all-round game to a sorry collection of mistimed shots and wayward placement on the centre court. The Brazilian was quickly into his elegant stride and secured an early break before calmly wrapping up the set when Federer netted a forehand. Federer had been in excellent form on clay coming into the tournament but his performances in reaching the third round were not entirely convincing. The Swiss had seemed rusty in comparison with his normal fluency and on Saturday his trademark feather-light touch and timing, especially on his normally exemplary backhand, were notably absent. Kuerten broke for 2-1 in the second set when he won a lengthy exchange with a stretching backhand volley that left Federer sprawling helplessly in the red dirt. It proved enough to clinch the set, with the Swiss wastefully netting another backhand to leave himself with a mountain to climb. Kuerten screamed with delight, sensing that one of the greatest wins of his career was now within his grasp. Federer briefly raised his level at the start of the third set but Kuertens outstanding serving kept the top seed pinned down. A wild forehand gave Kuerten the decisive break for 3-2. Another ugly mishit by Federer at 5-4 gave the Brazilian his first match-point and he sealed a stunning victory with a withering service delivery. Kuerten will next meet Spaniard Feliciano Lopez who accounted for South Korean Lee Hyung-taik 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 6-0, 6-3. Paes-Rikl out Tenth seeds Leander Paes and David Rikl tumbled out of the French Open following a three-set defeat against Juan Ignacio Chela and Gaudio. The Argentine pair won the second-round match 2-6, 6-4, 6-2. Top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Elena Likhovtseva crashed out in the first round, losing 5-7, 3-6 to Els Callens (Belgium) and Sebastian Prieto (Argentina).  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav wants better show from batsmen
 - ASIA CUP TIE vs LANKA - Indians likely to go in with same XI; We should win title if we play to potential, says Atapattu  BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Muralidharan should relish the slow Dambulla track Calcutta, July 17: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has admitted the side was rusty in yesterdays opening Asia Cup game, but The Telegraph learns that the same XI is set to be fielded versus Sri Lanka. Apparently, there has been some discussion over including Harbhajan Singh but, till late this evening, sources indicated the off-spinner will find it tough getting into the thick of action. Agencies add from Dambulla: Conceding that his frontline batsmen were yet to touch peak form after the three-month break, Sourav urged them to get into the groove quickly if they hope to regain the crown. I was expecting it and thats why I was telling everyone that we have to get into the groove quickly, Sourav said on the eve of Indias final group B league match. You can see that all of them are not at their best and how many of them have turned up for practice, remarked the skipper as he glanced at V.V.S. Laxman, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh padding up for a session at the nets. Sourav said the team has learnt from its UAE experience and felt with boundaries hard to come by at the big ground here, it would require some hard running between the wickets. The wind factor is crucial and the ground is big. We sure would have to do a lot of running, he said. Sourav took heart from the performance of his bowlers. The batting was not at its best, but the bowlers looked in good rhythm, especially the three pacers who bowled quick and swung the ball, he said. The choice of the attack, Sourav said, was dictated by the conditions and the Dambulla pitch definitely helped swing bowling. At the moment, it is not easy to leave out Anil Kumble. He is picking up wickets and probably bowling at his best. There was a minor concern at the nets when a rising delivery from Ashish Nehra hit Sehwag on his knuckles but after an ice-pack treatment, he seemed okay. The India captain didnt read too much into Sanath Jayasuriyas decline in form. Well, all I know is that he scores a lot of runs against us, he said. Jayasuriya has a tally of 1,758 runs from 52 ODIs versus India, including 189 in Sharjah  the joint second-highest score in one-day cricket. But in eight matches this year, the flashy left-hander has made only 116 runs at 16.57. The former captain has an injury and may not be able to bowl tomorrow. Sourav also pointed out the Asia Cup hosts are having a hard time. Its pretty hard on them in a way. They got back from a hard tour of Australia just a couple of days ago, then they travelled all the way from Colombo to Dambulla and are playing back-to-back day-night matches here, the India skipper said. The morrow will see Muttiah Muralidharan, the joint highest Test wickets record-holder, return in Lankan colours. He will be eager to perform well after skipping the two-Test tour to Australia. The off-spinner should relish the slow Rangiri International Stadium track. It will be interesting to see how the strong Indian line-up tackles Muralidharan, who has an impressive track record at this ground, having claimed five for 23 against Pakistan two seasons back. Despite the ban on his doosra, the wily off-spinner has the experience and variety to trouble the Indian batsmen. Maravan Atapattu was quite optimistic about Lankas chances, saying his team had the potential to win the title. We have two very strong opponents in Pakistan and India. But if we play to our potential in home conditions, we will certainly win, Atapattu said. TEAMS India (likely): Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Shewag, V.V.S.

 Somdev clinches ITF crown
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Somdev Dev Barman with his maiden senior ITF trophy at the Saturday Club on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Somdev Dev Barman of India bagged his maiden title at the senior level  in the ONGC ITF Futures meet at the Saturday Club on Sunday. It was a remarkable triumph, because the Chennai-based Barman was a wild card entrant and he beat fifth-seeded Bulgarian Yordan Kanev 6-4, 6-2 in the final encounter that lasted 70 minutes. The victory made Barman richer by $ 1,300 and also earned him 12 ATP points. I am graduating into the senior level and this success should help me do better, he said. The Bulgarian took home $ 900, apart from gaining eight points. Kanev, taller and stronger of the two finalists, started well and looked good to add to his tally of three international titles. Probably, the heat and humidity took its toll as the Bulgarians challenge gradually faded away. The fifth seed started well and was even leading 4-2 before the first set witnessed a complete turnaround. Barman suddenly started moving well and won four games in a row to close out the set. The second set was one sided, as the Indian came up with an answer to almost everything Kanev hurled at him. Barman was moving well and played some fine passing shots down both flanks. My game is well-suited to clay, which is perhaps why I did well here. I hope to do well on hardcourts and synthetic surfaces as well, said Barman.  Copyright

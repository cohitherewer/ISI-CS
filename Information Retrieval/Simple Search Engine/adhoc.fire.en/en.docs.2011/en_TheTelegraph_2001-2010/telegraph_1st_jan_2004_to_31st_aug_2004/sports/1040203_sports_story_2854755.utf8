The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real rally to regain lead 
 - EUROPEAN ROUND-UP - Milan consolidate position in Italy  Real Madrids Brazilian star Ronaldo celebrates after scoring the winner against Valladolid during their Spanish League match in Valladolid on Sunday. (Reuters) Madrid: Real Madrid reclaimed top spot in the Primera Liga on Sunday after fighting back from two goals down to snatch a 3-2 win at Valladolid, thanks to a last-gasp strike from Ronaldo. The result lifted the defending champions two points clear of second-placed Valencia, who recorded a crushing 6-1 victory at Malaga on Saturday. Deportivo Coruna remain a further four points back in third following a 1-0 win at home to Sevilla, striker Diego Tristan scoring the only goal in a tight contest from the penalty spot. Barcelona bounced back from the disappointment of their midweek exit from the Kings Cup and took the pressure off coach Frank Rijkaard by claiming their most convincing win of the season, beating Albacete 5-0 at home. The win pushed Barcelona into fifth place. For Real, Ronaldo scored two goals and Luis Figo the other from the penalty spot, but they were in a spot of bother before that with Valladolids Oscar doing the damage. Real had barely recovered after conceding the lead in the 34th minute when Oscar caught them out again on the break eight minutes later. He had scored the first one too. Former Real goalkeeper Albano Bizzarri hoisted the ball to Sales on the right, the midfielder swept a cross toward the area and Oscar got ahead of defender Michel Salgado to head past Casillas. Valladolid changed tactics after the break and sat back to defend their lead, thereby handing the initiative to Real. The champions rose to the challenge and with Figo at the helm put the home side under severe pressure, pulling a goal back four minutes into the second half when Ronaldo diverted a Zinedine Zidane shot into the net from close range. Real drew level 13 minutes later when Figo scored from the penalty spot after defender Juan Manuel Pena was adjudged to have handled the ball. The Bolivian was sent off for the offence but Real had little time to enjoy their numerical advantage as Santiago Solari followed him down the tunnel after picking up a second booking eight minutes later. In a frantic finish both sides had a chance to snatch victory but it was Ronaldo who once again demonstrated his lethal finishing to earn his side the win. Picking up the ball just inside the area after a slick interchange of passes between Guti and Zidane, the Brazilian turned sharply and cracked a low shot past Bizzarri to take his tally for the season to a league-leading 18.  Shevchenkos 16th In Milan, European champions AC Milan moved five points clear at the top of Serie A on Sunday with a 2-0 win at Bologna. Andriy Shevchenkos 16th goal of the season and a late strike from substitute Jon Dahl Tomasson secured Milans sixth straight win. A tenth-minute goal from Mauro Camoranesi gave champions Juventus a 1-0 win over Chievo, sending Marcello Lippis side level with AS Roma in second place on 43 points. Inter Milan ended a run of three games without a win, beating Siena 4-0 thanks to two goals apiece from Uruguayan Alvaro Recoba and Brazilian Adriano. Milans victory piles the pressure on Roma and Juventus ahead of their clash at the Olympic Stadium and confirms the rich form of Carlo Ancelottis side. Serie As top-scorer Shevchenko provided the decisive breakthrough in the 19th minute with a firm header after he had been picked out by Andrea Pirlo. Brazilian Kaka went close to a second after the break, firing wide from 20 metres out after a dazzling run from midfield. It was Danish substitute Tomasson who finally settled the game with a confident lob after he had chested down a through ball from Serginho. Tomasson, given more opportunities in the absence of the injured Filippo Inzaghi, has scored in each of Milans last four league and Cup games. Coach Ancelotti was quick to play down talk of the five-point gap being a turning point in the season. The team is enjoying an excellent spell, as the results show, but I dont want to hear about us breaking away, he said. It was a balanced game and we suffered a little and found it hard work, at times, to move the ball around. But that is understandable when you are playing a good side like Bologna who are in good form, he added. Juventus defence was under scrutiny after last weeks 3-3 draw at Empoli but the Turin side looked back to their solid, if unspectacular, selves at the Delle Alpi. In a game of few chances at either end, Argentina-born Italy international Camoranesi grabbed the winner, firing home at the back post after David Trezeguet had headed down a high ball into the box from Stephen Appiah.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thai negotiators fly to England
Bangkok: Thai negotiators have flown to England for talks with Premier League side Liverpool and to evaluate other clubs if the talks fail, Thai newspapers reported Sunday. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who emerged as the sole bidder for a 30 percent stake in Liverpool after rival Steve Morgan withdrew on Friday, said Saturday they would pursue other clubs if Liverpool rejected their offer. Negotiations over the 4.6 billion baht ($ 113 million) bid have stalled over the level of Thai representation on the board. Thaksin ordered Pongsak Ruktapongpisal, the chief Thai negotiator, to fly to England on Saturday to negotiate directly with the club, the Thai-language Daily News reported on Sunday. He (Pongsak) said this way would be better than communicating by fax. He said he expected to know an outcome in no more than two days, the Daily News quoted the deputy commerce minister as saying.

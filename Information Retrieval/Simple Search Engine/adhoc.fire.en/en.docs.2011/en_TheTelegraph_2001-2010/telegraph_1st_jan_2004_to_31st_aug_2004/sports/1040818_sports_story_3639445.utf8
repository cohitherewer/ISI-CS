The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Diving duo helps lift doping gloom
Athens: Greece was plunged in national self-satisfaction on Tuesday after their synchronised divers won the host nations first gold medal of the Athens Olympics. This unexpected success in the diving pool gave the Greeks a chance to forget national shame over their two top sprinters  Olympic 200m champion Costas Kenteris and training partner Katerina Thanou  who missed drugs tests. A golden glow in the shadow of shame, a newspaper said of unlikely heroes Nikolaos Siranidis and Thomas Bimis, winners in synchronised three-metre springboard diving. The crowd helped. That was our doping, Siranidis said. Another report described them as two breaths of fresh air after the darkness of recent days, while a third wrote Greece was coming back to the surface. Siranidis and Bimis took the title with a score of 353.34 after the Chinese blew their chance to claim four diving golds in a row at the Games.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

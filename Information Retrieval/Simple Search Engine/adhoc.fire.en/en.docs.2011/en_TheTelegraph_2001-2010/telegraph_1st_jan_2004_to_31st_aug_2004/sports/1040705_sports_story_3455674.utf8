The 22-year-old world No. 1 wrapped up his victory in two hours 30 minutes to clinch his third career Grand Slam crown to add to the Australian Open he won in January. It was the first final featuring the top two seeds here in 22 years and, in between two lengthy rain breaks, it proved to be a treat. Federer was blitzed off Centre Court in the opening set and had to come back from 2-4 down in the third when the second rain break came to his aid before he secured his triumph against an increasingly frustrated Roddick who squandered a host of opportunities in the fourth set. Roddick had struck first breaking in only the third game of the match to lead 2-1 when he set up the winning point with a booming crosscourt forehand which the Swiss could only pat back long. The American then saved four break points to go 3-1 up. Federer held for 3-2 before rain forced the players off centre court after just 16 minutes of action. Play resumed 35 minutes later with Roddick dominating the match even hitting a return timed at 103mph off a Federer serve in the seventh game before going on to take the opener with another powerful forehand after 31 minutes of play. Federer fought off a break point in the first game of the second and then broke for the first time in the final when Roddick served up three double faults. The breakthrough rejuvenated the Swiss star as he carved out another break to lead 4-0 as Roddicks all-out assault threatened to fizzle out. But in a set of fluctuating fortunes, the American hit back to 4-1 held for 4-2 then took advantage of a sloppy Federer service game to break again to trail 4-3 before holding to go 4-4. The top seed, who beat Roddick in the semi-final here in 2003, stopped the rot to lead 5-4 but Roddick stayed with him at 5-5. Federer earned set point, thanks to a lucky net cord, and levelled the match with a sweetly driven forehand down the line with 74 minutes on the clock. The American went to 4-2 in the third set when rain forced the players off again for a 37-minute interval. Federer looked a different player when he returned in bright sunshine to hold and break to go 4-4 when Roddick could only return a sharp volley out. Federers gentle touch at the net returned to give him a 6-5 lead before Roddick took it to the tie-break but the Swiss star clinched it with a breathtaking backhand pass after one hour 56 minutes of action. Federer then fought off four break points in the fourth game of the next set and two more in the sixth as Roddick struggled to find the killer blow, which had come so easy in the first set. There was no way back from there. Roddick, dispirited by his failure to take those golden opportunities, was then broken to love to fall 4-3 down. Federer reached championship point with a gentle backhand down the line and took the title with an ace. Woodbridge record Australian Todd Woodbridge won a record ninth Wimbledon mens doubles title when he and Jonas Bjorkman beat Julian Knowle and Nenad Zimonjic 6-1, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 on Sunday.

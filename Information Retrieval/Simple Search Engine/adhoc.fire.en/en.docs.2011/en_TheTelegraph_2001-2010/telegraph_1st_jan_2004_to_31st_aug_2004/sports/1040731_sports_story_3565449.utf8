The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mike Tyson a touch overweight
	 - LOUISVILLE BOUT vs DANNY WILLIAMS  Mike Tyson with son Amir after his weigh-in on Thursday, the eve of his heavyweight bout against Danny Williams in Louisville. (Reuters) Louisville: Danny Williams jumped at the chance to face Mike Tyson at Freedom Hall Friday and intends to prove the former world champions matchmakers made a big mistake. The British boxer appears to be merely a stepping stone for the 38-year-old Tyson. I was chosen as Tysons opponent because I have a good record (31-3), I am big, I look the part and they obviously think I am going to get knocked out in a few rounds, said Williams, who weighed in at 265 lb Thursday. They think I am a knockover opponent, but they have made a mistake. They wanted me back in 2000 but Im glad it didnt happen then because I wasnt ready mentally. I think if I had fought him then I would have lost it before I set foot in the ring. Tyson (50-4-2, 44 kos) tipped the scales at 233 lb Thursday, marking only the third time in his career that he weighed in over the 230 lb mark. Tyson still has his eyes on a return to the top of his sport and considers Williams a mere tune-up for his blank bank account. I have been a fool not to fight, Tyson said. I have just realised that I missed all this tremendously. I really enjoy the sound of the crowds, the sounds of the gloves hitting the head and my opponent falling to the mat. He weighed 225 lb for his last bout, when he knocked out Clifford Etienne in the first round on February 22, 2003. In June 2002, Tyson weighed in at 234 lb, then was promptly pounded by Lennox Lewis. Williams, 31, has been in an uncharacteristically bombastic mood since arriving in the US to begin his training preparations. But while he insists that Tyson is fading, Williams has failed to convince anybody that he will be the man to throw the decisive punch. A three-knockdown defeat to Sinan Samil Sam on a step up to the European level last year fuelled doubts about Williams mental strength. Tysons trainer Freddie Roach also picked out the issue of Williams bravery after viewing the film. All I can say is that I am ready, Williams said. There is no pressure on me and I am going to raise my game. I know a lot of people think I am going to get knocked out but I am going to prove them wrong. Tyson has been out of the ring for a long time. I want what he has got  big houses and big cars. This is a job and my job is to go in there and out-box him. Tysons camp talk bravely of a challenge to the WBC champion Vitali Klitschko but for the time being he remains just a legitimate fringe contender. (AFP)  Copyright

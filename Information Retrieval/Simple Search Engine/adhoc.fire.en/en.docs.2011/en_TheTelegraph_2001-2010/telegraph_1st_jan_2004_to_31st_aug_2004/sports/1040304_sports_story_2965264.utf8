 Hoddle no to Southampton coachs offer
London: Glenn Hoddle dropped his controversial bid to become Southampton coach on Wednesday, blaming a lack of full support from the clubs directors. Whilst it is clear that there has been a great deal of support for me on the board, it has not been 100 per cent, the 46-year-old former England manager said in a statement carried by Sky Sports News. Therefore I have reluctantly decided to withdraw my name from consideration for the post. Hoddles bid to become manager of the south-coast club for a second time had angered many Southampton fans, some of him who have not forgiven him for quitting the club to take over at Tottenham Hotspur in March 2001. Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe confirmed in a short statement that Hoddle had withdrawn his candidacy but gave no further details. Steve Wigley is Southamptons caretaker manager at present following Gordon Strachans decision to step down in February. Hoddle, who was sacked as England coach in February 1999 over comments he made about disabled people, was Southampton boss from January 2000 until March 2001 before leaving the club to join Spurs.

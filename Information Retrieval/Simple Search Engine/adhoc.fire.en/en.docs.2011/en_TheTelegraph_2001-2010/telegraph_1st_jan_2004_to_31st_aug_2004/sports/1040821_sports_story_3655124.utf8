The Telegraph - Calcutta
Another flop-show by Anjali Bhagwat
- Women archers miss out on semi-finals by a point
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: This has been a harrowing Games for Anjali Bhagwat. The hype that had preceded her to Athens has vanished. In the womens 50m rifle three-position qualifying on Friday, she finished a poor 13th with a total of 575. Deepali Deshpande, another Indian entry in that event, was further down at 19th (572). In prone position Bhagwat hit 193 (97+96) and Deshpande hit 194 (97+97). In standing, Bhagwat struck 193 (97+96), Deshpande fell to 189 (94+95). In kneeling, both hit 189, Bhagwat 92+97 and Deshpande 94+95. Pre-Games images will have to redesigned for the stars when they return home. The women archers, in fact, fared much better. The Indians got the better of Britain 230-228 to move up. In the quarter finals, though, they lost by a point to France (227-228), just missing the semi-final berth. Even in that, the Indian archers hit seven tens, compared to the French womens six. Sikha Tandons poor performances grew by one more on as she finished the womens 50m freestyle heat at sixth spot. She timed 27.04 seconds  0.73 seconds off Lara Heinz of Luxembourg, the top finisher in that heat. The sailors missed the wind, finishing their 49ers seventh race at 18th spot. At this point their overall position is 19th. Agencies add: National shooting coach Sunny Thomas said he was proud about Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores historic silver medal winning effort but was disappointed with the performance of the other shooters. There is a sense of pride because of Rathores silver medal effort but I thought some of the other shooters could have done better, Thomas told reporters after the Indian challenge ended with a whimper in womens rifle 3 position event. Overall I had expected a much better performance by the shooters and I am not completely satisfied. Of the eight Indian shooters who competed in the Olympics only three managed to make the final but the big disappointment was the performance of world No. 6 air rifle shooter Anjali. I expected better results ... But you cannot blame them because the competition out here is very tough, the Dronacharya awardee said. Thomas said all the eight Indian shooters on view here were top class. We participated in five events and three went into the finals. It shows that we are closing the gap at the international level, he said. A few mistakes here and there did not help us but it is a good experience for all of us.  Copyright

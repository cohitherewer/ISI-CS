 Russians hail Marat Safin
 Marat Safin in action against Roger Federer in the Australian Open final on Sunday. (AFP) Moscow: Russian media heaped praise on Marat Safin on Monday following his giant-killing run at the Australian Open which only ended in the final. Undefeated read a front-page headline in the Sovietsky Sport newspaper despite Safins straight-sets defeat by Switzerlands Roger Federer in Sundays final. Safins courageous comeback to the tennis elite overshadowed the sports side of the final. We are still thankful to you, Marat, echoed the countrys other sports daily, Sport-Express. Safin, plagued by injuries for most of 2003 as his rankings slipped to 86th, made a triumphant return at the first Grand Slam of the year. The giant Russian also became a sentimental favourite among the Melbourne crowd with his dramatic run to the final. Considered an underdog, Safin toppled then world No. 1 Andy Roddick in spectacular style on his 24th birthday in the quarter final and followed that with an equally gripping win over defending champion Andre Agassi in the last four. Safin has returned, Sovietsky Sport said. He overcame injuries and two Grand Slam champions in 2003  Roddick and Agassi. He fought for more than 20 hours on the Melbourne courts. He didnt win the Australian Open but he became the champion in courage. Having played 27 sets to get to the final, Safin simply ran out of gas against the stylish Federer. What Marat has done after all his problems last year is nothing short of a heroic feat, its a miracle, said Russian tennis chief and his Davis Cup coach Shamil Tarpishchev. The fact that Safin knocked out five Americans on his way to the final did not escape the Russian press. Safin-USA 5-0, gloated Sovietsky Sports front-page last Friday after Safins epic five-set victory over Agassi, displaying Russias glee at beating their bitter rivals. Safins fairytale comeback in Melbourne also helped ease the pain of Russian fans still in shock following Spartak Moscow captain Yegor Titovs failed drugs test, which jeopardised the countrys chances of playing in the European soccer championship.

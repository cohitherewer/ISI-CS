The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We werent passionate about winning: Rameez
 - PCB has kept open the option of disciplining Shoaib  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Shoaib Akhtar Calcutta: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has kept open the option of disciplining temperamental Shoaib Akhtar, but wont act without giving the speedster a fair hearing. Right now, I cant say whether action is going to be taken Much depends on our medical commissions report as also what the team management says about his attitude. Moreover, Shoaib himself will be heard Obviously, he is going to be given a fair hearing, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph on Tuesday. Shoaib has been under the scanner ever since he went off on the second afternoon of the Rawalpindi Test. He didnt return to bowl  despite an SOS from a senior PCB official to manager Haroon Rashid in the dressing room  and didnt exude the right body language while batting on what became the last day (Friday). Many, of course, believe the speedster deliberately let Pakistan down  largely because of a tiff with captain Inzamam-ul Haq. At this moment, temperatures are high But, depending on how things go, I could call both Inzamam and Shoaib and encourage them to talk face to face in my presence There have been (man-management) problems with Shoaib, but the handling had been fine till Rameez, speaking from Lahore, added. However, he pointed out: Having been a player and captain, I know differences can exist, but theres a limit At no point should a captains authority be undermined Also, youve got to be passionate  specially in a key game I dont think Shoaib showed enough passion in the decider (Rawalpindi) Rameez confirmed having intervened before the second Test, in Lahore, to ensure that Inzamam didnt drop Shoaib. Returning to the decider, he felt the team itself lacked passion  a huge indictment that. Perhaps it had something to do with India being a superior side Or, the huge Indian total (600) demoralised the boys Bottomline is that we werent passionate about winning It hurts and definitely hasnt gone down well with the public, Rameez stated. [Significantly, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan had this to say after the Test series too was won by Sourav Gangulys Team India: My main concern for the present is the manner in which the Rawalpindi match was lost In a recent address to the players, the President of Pakistan, who is also our patron, had talked about the need to fight and the will to win. While some players, like the courageous Asim Kamal, clearly demonstrated that even in a desperate cause, there were others who patently failed the test by their carefree, unprofessional approach in the second innings I have taken serious note of this lack of commitment to national honour] Incidentally, Rameez pointed out that the top players may not be fielded in next months short series in Malaysia, where Sri Lanka is going to be the third team. Ive asked the chief selector (Wasim Bari) if we could do without some of the key players, particularly the ones contracted to the Counties. After all, not much is at stake and, later in the summer, we will be requiring them for the Asia Cup and the tri-nation event in Holland. So he informed. Meanwhile, reacting to reports in the Media (at home) that Shoaib  due at Durham in a few days  had made himself unavailable for Malaysia, Rameez said: We havent been told anything at all Whatever the truth, for now, Shoaib appears destined to make bigger headlines off the field.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick pleased with first-leg points haul
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee blames defensive lapse, lack  of attacking options for 1-2 defeat  BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS  Dipankar Roy is congratulated by East  Bengal teammates for scoring the first goal against  Mohun Bagan at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. Picture  by Pradip SanyalCalcutta: In the end, there was good behaviour. No post-match finger-pointing, no outburst against referee S.M. Balu of Karnataka (a few unusual decisions did happen) and it was all very refreshing, really. As the coaches met the media, probably the long lay-off that lies ahead played on their minds. East Bengal beat arch-rivals Mohun Bagan 2-1 in their National Football League derby at the Salt Lake Stadium Thursday. While Dipankar Roy put East Bengal ahead, Ashim Biswas restored parity, before Mike Okoro got the winner. Satisfied, wasnt a word East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick uses often. He did just that, and then said: I wanted to end the first leg on 20 points, my players gave me a point extra. Thats nice. He even went onto point a deficiency in the rival attack as a relieving factor  another uncharacteristic comment (Wednesday he had refused to admit any Jose Ramirez Barreto factor in his confidence). Of course it (Barreto not being there) made a difference. We could play freely. Barreto is always a threat, even if we have taken a good lead, he said. I had told my boys to be cautious in the first half and not concede a lead. I had said we would then handle the second half. They did just that, said Bhowmick. Though not really saying so, Bhowmick made it clear that the title-defence now looked a distinct possibility. He said the upcoming AFC Champions League is a big challenge and we want to keep the good work going. He refused to say if the gap and the national team stint could in any way hamper his preparations. Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjees despair was understandable. I was handicapped with the shortage of another good attacker in the reserve bench to provide support to Ashim Biswas, he said. There is little I could do about this In the month-long gap that there will be now I will be able to shore up my defensive shortfall (and there were many Thursday, especially by Rishi Kapoor that resulted in the Okoro clincher), but I need a good foreigner in striking position. I will ask my club for this. Regarding the deficiencies that keeper Bilifang Narzary has shown, Mukherjee said he was again helpless. Had Prasanta Dora or Imran Khan been available for this match the end scoreline would have been different, he said. However, I am happy that my boys did play a great game in the first half. We managed to bottle up their top two strikers, Bhaichung Bhutia and Cristiano Junior. That we conceded the goals was through silly defensive errors, but it is also true that they were able to score only off set-pieces, said the coach. While the Mohun Bagan coach promised a refurbishing of the team during the break, his counterpart in East Bengal promised a lot of rest.  Copyright

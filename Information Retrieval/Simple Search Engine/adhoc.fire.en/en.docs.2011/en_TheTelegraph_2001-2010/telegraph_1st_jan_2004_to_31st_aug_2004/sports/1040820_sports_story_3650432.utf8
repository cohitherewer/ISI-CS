 Prasad bows out on last arrow
Athens: Indias challenge in the individual archery competition ended on Thursday. Satyadev Prasad went tantalisingly close to upsetting mens top seed Im Dong Hyun of South Korea before losing 165-167 on the last arrow in a dramatic duel. Prasad, who turns 26 next month, looked in his elements as he led his formidable opponent 139-138 at the end of the fifth and penultimate series. Im displayed superb concentration and accuracy to reverse the course of the pre-quarterfinal in the last series. The Korean, who won the individual silver in the world championship last year, levelled the score at 147 picking up nine points with his first arrow in the last series even as Prasad had to be satisfied with a nine pointer. Both archers then hit ten pointers with the next arrow, as the fight went to the wire at the historic Panathinaiko Staidum. With the fate of the tie depending on the 18th and last shot, the Korean struck a nine, but Prasad apparently became a bundle of nerves and managed only seven points to bow out of the competition. Prasad, who finished a lowly 48th in the ranking round before getting the better of Japans Yuji Hamano and Ron van der Hoff of The Netherlands in the first two rounds, hit seven ten-pointers and also found the bulls eye once in the pulsating contest. The Indian returned impressive scores of 26, 29, 26, 29 and 29 in the first five series, while the Korean scored 27, 28, 26, 30 and 27. The 18-year-old Im had a fairytale fifth series during which he hit the bulls eye with each of his three arrows. The rowing campaign ended as it started with lone entrant P.K. Paulose finishing a lowly 27th out of 29 competitors in the mens single sculls event at the Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre on Thursday. Paulose, ended up third in one the five-man classification E final crossing the finish line in seven minutes 22.43 seconds. Bulgarias Ivo Yanikiev won in 6:52.51 followed by The Netherlands rower Dirk Lippits (7:01.39) and Peruvian Gustavo Salcedo (7:05.08). The Indian sailing duo of Malav Shroff and Sumeet Patel were placed 18th at the end of the fourth race of the 49er (double handed dinghy open). In the fourth and last race, four pairs of sailors from Norway, Japan, Poland and US were disqualified which enabled Shroff and Patel to end up 15th.  Copyright

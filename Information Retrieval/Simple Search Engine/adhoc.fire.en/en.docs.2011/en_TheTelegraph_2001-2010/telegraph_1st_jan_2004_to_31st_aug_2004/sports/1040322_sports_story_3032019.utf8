The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Woods out of contention
Orlando: Australias Stuart Appleby took control of the Bay Hill Invitational in Saturdays third round, with a six-under 66 in breezy conditions to move into a four-shot lead over Chad Campbell. Appleby finished on 16-under 200, while Campbell shot a two-under 70 to settle for a 204 total. Australias Adam Scott sits alone in third place on 206 following a 68 that included birdies on the last three holes, and overnight leader Shigeki Maruyama of Japan stands a further stroke back after shooting a three-over-par 75. Australian Rod Pampling, Steve Lowery, John Daly and Briton Darren Clarke are tied for fifth, eight shots behind Appleby. It was a bad day for four-time winner Tiger Woods, the world No. 1 registering a second straight two-over-par 74 to finish 15 shots behind the leader and out of contention for an unprecedented fifth straight title. Applebys 66 was the best round of the day by two shots. Starting the day with a bogey to fall back to nine-under, Appleby rectified the situation immediately with a birdie on the second hole and continued the trend with a string of four birdies between the fifth and eighth holes. The success at the eighth gave Appleby the outright lead over playing partner Campbell and two more birdies in the round ensured a comfortable margin by the end of the day. The only time he came close to making a bogey was at the par-three 17th, where he holed a 20-foot par put. After falling out of a share for the lead at the eighth, Campbell lost momentum and dropped back to 12-under with three bogeys and two birdies for a one-over-par 37 on the back nine. We played really well on the front nine, me and Stuart both, Campbell said. On the back nine, I missed a couple of fairways and got in trouble a little bit and didnt really finish off the way I would like. But Stuart played a great round and its going to be tough to catch him.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

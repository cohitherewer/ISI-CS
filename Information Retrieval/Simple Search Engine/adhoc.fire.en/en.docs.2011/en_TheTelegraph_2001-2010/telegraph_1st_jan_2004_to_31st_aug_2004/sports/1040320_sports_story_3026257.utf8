 Williams order Ralf, Montoya to behave
 Michael Schumacher of Germany during a press conference after the second practice session at Sepang on Friday. (Reuters) Sepang: Feuding Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya have been told they had better behave in the Malaysian Grand Prix. Team boss Frank Williams told a news conference on Friday he was happy for the Formula One rivals to race hard and bang wheels, but they must not ram each other off the track. The two clashed at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in an incident that led Ralf to threaten Montoya with serious consequences if he tried the same overtaking manoeuvre again. It was a pretty strong move and next time I will have him off the track, he said on Thursday. Williams was confident the two would see sense despite the evident ill-feeling between very different characters who have failed to click since they teamed up in 2001. Under racing conditions they are free to race, and they are free to compete and they are free to bump wheels if its the only way of getting by, said the team boss. What they are not allowed to do is push their teammates off. That is the divide. Words come easily in the heat of the moment, common sense will prevail. Colombian Montoya is leaving Williams for McLaren at the end of the season while Ralf, younger brother of Ferraris world champion Michael, is deep in contract negotiations and could also be departing. Asked just how much control the team could exercise over the drivers, Williams said it was up to the team manager to keep an eye on them. Williams alluded to Ferraris controversial past use of team orders  when one driver is told to give way to his teammate  and said it was hard to satisfy everyone. Montoya brushed aside the incident in Australia. I think he was just a bit too excited, he said. I think the reporter asked the right question and wound Ralf up. They asked the right question to Ralf and he just went over the roof. But I think well be okay. New conflict Meanwhile, a new conflict has broken out between F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and a number of banks over the control of SLEC, the company that owns the commercial rights for the prestigious motor racing event, one of the banks revealed on Friday. The banks, Bayerische Landesbank (BLB) and US firms JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers, which together hold 75 percent of SLEC, have filed a suit at a court in London on the issue, a spokesman for BLB said, without elaborating further. Sources said the banks wanted a greater say in who is elected to SLECs supervisory board, currently dominated by allies of Ecclestone. (Reuters)  Copyright

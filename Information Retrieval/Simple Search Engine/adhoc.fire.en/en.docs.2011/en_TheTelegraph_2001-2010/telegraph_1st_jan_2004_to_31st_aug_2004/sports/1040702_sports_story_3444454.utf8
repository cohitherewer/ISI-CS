 Shoaib yet to join camp 
 Inzamam feels the team should be named soon Islamabad: All is not well with Pakistans camp for Asia Cup probables, which started only two days ago in Lahore, with fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar yet to join the rest of the players and skipper Inzamam-ul Haq resentful over the delay in naming the team for the competition. So, when new coach Bob Woolmer arrives on Friday to take charge of the camp, his hands would be already full. It is ironic and typical of Pakistan cricket that the newly-appointed physical trainer Murray Stevenson has arrived and taken charge while the bowling mainstay, whose fitness is still under cloud, is absent from the camp for 26 probables. Abbaz Zaidi, new media advisor to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), confirmed that Shoaib was yet to join the camp. The Pakistan captain refused to comment on Shoaibs absence. Besides Shoaib, fast bowler Mohammed Sami and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria have not joined the camp. Meanwhile, Inzamam told the media in Lahore that team selection need not wait till Woolmer joined. The team should be named soon so that the new coach could concentrate on it, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Booster for women paddlers
 - Poulami, Mouma feels Doha show will inspire in future encounters with foreigners  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Poulami Ghatak (left) and Mouma Das after returning to the city on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: This was a sort of fairytale  the glorious run of the Indian womens table tennis team recently at the world team championship in Doha. The team comprising Poulami Ghatak, Mouma Das, Nandita Saha, Mantu Ghosh and Anindita Chakraborty topped the second division featuring 24 teams, earning a top-tier berth for the next edition of the championship. It was a dream performance to say the least, even though in the second division, since the teams they overcame were Slovenia, Bulgaria, Nigeria, Austria, Denmark and Spain. A majority of players from these countries were rated above the Indians. We were neither positive, nor negative about our chances, to be frank, said Poulami on Wednesday, after returning home from Doha, via Delhi. We didnt harbour any great expectations and took it one match at a time. Topping the division came to mind only after reaching the final. According to Mouma, hopes of an unlikely triumph started crystallising after beating Bulgaria in the group phase. We were levelled at 2-2 after having taken a 2-0 lead. I won the decider and from thereon, started believing we could go the distance. Poulami and Mouma were the players to have featured in all six rubbers. While Poulami won nine of her ten matches, Mouma made it seven out of seven. The next major stop for the city duo will be the Olympic qualifiers in China from April 9-13. It all depends on how a player fares on a particular day, how her form is. So I am not reading too much into my Doha performance as far as future engagements are concerned, said Poulami. But I will certainly be more confident when I take on foreign players in the future, said Poulami, who was Indias sole woman representative in table tennis at Sydney 2000. She has also played in the main draw of the world individual championships twice, losing in the first round on both occasions. Mouma, who has also been to the world singles meet twice but is yet to reach the Olympics, echoed Poulamis thoughts. Its true that Indians tend to suffer from an inferiority complex when confronted by foreign opponents. This win should help us approach them in a better frame of mind. Both paddlers, who have won five senior national titles between them, gave a principal share of the credit to the new French coach appointed by the Table Tennis Federation of India. He is far more approachable then the previous foreign coach (a North Korean) we had. No. 1, we can communicate with him in English. No. 2, he took a lot of care in correcting our shortcomings, the players said in unison. They admitted having benefited from practising in simulated match situations, with scorers, scoreboards on all sides and all. The duo also praised the coach for correcting their mistakes after viewing video recordings.  Copyright

 Gilchrist mocks ICC methods
Sydney: Adam Gilchrist says bio-mechanical testing of Muttiah Muralidharans action is pointless because clinical conditions cant be compared with the cricket field. I have got to question why they bother doing a test like that whether it is Murali or anyone else in world cricket, Gilchrist said. There is nothing similar between that in a laboratory and what you face in the Test matches. If fault is found with the action, hell be ordered to undergo remedial work. (AP)  Copyright

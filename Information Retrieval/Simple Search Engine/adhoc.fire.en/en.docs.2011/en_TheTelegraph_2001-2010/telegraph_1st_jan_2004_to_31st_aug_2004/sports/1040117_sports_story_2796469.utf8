The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 17, 2004  Star Alone fancied in Bangalore 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore: The 1,400m Hyderabad Silver Vase, the main attraction in Saturdays card, may provide a close and interesting finish in the 11-horse strong field vying for honours.				 										However, the four who stand out are Rio Tinto, Saratoga Sizzle, Castle Park and Star Alone. Among them, the Michael Eshwer-ward Star Alone, with Mallesh Narredu in the saddle, looks to have a razor thin edge at weights and so is likely to win from Rio Tinto and Saratoga Sizzle.

 Powell keeps faith in Anju
Mumbai: World long jump record holder Mike Powell on Friday kept his faith in Indias celebrated women long jumper and his pupil Anju Bobby George. Powell, whos now in Mumbai to flag off the Standard Chartered Mumbai International Marathon to be held on February 15, said Anju was one of the best athletes in the world at present and could cross the 7m barrier in near future. She has not improved in terms of distance but has improved in consistency. She can go places as she is determined to do well and is dedicated in her efforts, he added. Only the best get to compete at the Olympics and Anju is up there. However, she has to be at her best to win a medal there and I dont want to put additional pressure on her by talking about it. All I can say is that Anju has proved herself by winning a bronze at the world championship in Paris last year and the same can happen again, the American, who broke the 22-year-old world record at Tokyo by jumping to a distance of 8.95m, said.

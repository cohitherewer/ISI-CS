The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Streak doubtful
Bulawayo: Zimbabwe will start the second and final Test against Bangladesh on Thursday possibly minus their two main strike bowlers. Andy Blignaut, who took the maiden Test hattrick by a Zimbabwean to set up his teams 183-run victory in the first Test on Sunday, has been ruled out with a strained right thigh and captain Heath Streak is in doubt with a back spasm. Blignaut has been replaced by Blessing Mahwire but batsman Stuart Carlisle, suffering from a quadricep strain, is unlikely to play. (REUTERS)  Copyright

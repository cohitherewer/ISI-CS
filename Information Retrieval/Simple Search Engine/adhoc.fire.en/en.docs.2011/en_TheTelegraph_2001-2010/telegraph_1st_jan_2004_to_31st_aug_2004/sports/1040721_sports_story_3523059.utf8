The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India slip to 5th
London: India have slipped from fourth to fifth place in the latest ICC Test table. Despite not having played a single Test match since their historic triumph in Pakistan three months ago, India have still gone behind their arch-rivals as their 2001 home series triumph against Australia now falls outside the rating period. According to the ICC website, India are at No. 5 with 105 points. Australia (129) continue to head the table, followed by England (107), South Africa (106) and Pakistan (105).  (PTI)  Copyright

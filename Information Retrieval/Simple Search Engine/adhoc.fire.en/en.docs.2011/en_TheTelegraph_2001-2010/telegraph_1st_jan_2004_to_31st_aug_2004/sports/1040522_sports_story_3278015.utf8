 USADA to meet Marion Jones
New York: The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) agreed on Thursday to meet beleaguered sprinter Marion Jones to discuss the drugs furore swirling around American track athletes. Earlier, Jones lawyer Joseph Burton had accused the USADA and the US Olympic Committee (USOC) of creating a witch-hunt in their efforts to send a clean team to the Athens Olympics in August. In a letter addressed to USOC president Bill Martin and USADAs chief executive Terry Madden sent on May 18, Burton said Jones had been forced to defend herself against hypothetical charges. With pressure mounting, triple Olympic champion Jones has asked for a face-to-face meeting with USADA officials to answer all questions they may have about evidence. Jones has also requested that any of her samples be retested by the USADA for the anabolic steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) and any other banned substances. The USADA on Thursday acknowledged her request and agreed to a meeting. USADA has received the written request from Marion Jones attorney, Mr Burton, which he made public today, Travis Tygart, USADAs director of legal affairs said in a statement. As USADA has informed Mr Burton, USADA is available to meet Ms Jones at her convenience. USADA has accepted Ms Jones offer to meet for the purpose of her providing all relevant information she has concerning USADAs on-going investigation. USADA is only commenting on the impending meeting with Ms Jones because her attorney chose to make it public.  (Reuters)  Copyright

 15 m for Wenger to stock armoury
 Wenger has proved a shrewd judge of talent London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been told he will have 15 million to spend on strengthening his English Premiership-winning squad in the summer. Despite Arsenals huge financial commitment to a new 400 million stadium, the Londoners aim to give Wenger the funds to keep the Gunners on top. We wont be able to go for a player who will cost mega-bucks, a 20 million or 30 million player, chairman Peter Hill-Wood said. But there will be enough there for Arsene if he wants to add to his squad. If, for instance, he wants another striker, then the money will be there as long as it isnt too high. First on the list should be Feyenoords Robin van Persie. The 20-year-old Dutch winger is set to plump for a 3 million move to north London this week. Wenger brought in five new players this season  Jens Lehmann from Borussia Dortmund for 1 million, Cesc Fabregas for a 500,000 payment to Barcelona, Philippe Senderos for 500,000 from Servette Geneva, Gael Clichy for 250,000 to French club AS Cannes and a down payment of 6 million on Jose Reyes from Sevilla. That adds up to 8.25 million although the Reyes fee could amount to around 17 million over the next five years. Reinforcements will be needed with the probable departures of French striker Sylvain Wiltord, Nigerian forward Nwankwo Kanu and defender Martin Keown. Arsenal have been unable to agree a new contract with Wiltord while Kanu will move on at the end of his deal. Keown is a West Ham target and is set to sign this summer after his testimonial on May 17. Arsenals budget does not compare with the millions available to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United or the Chelsea boss  be it Claudio Ranieri or whoever is in charge next season. But Wenger has proved a shrewd judge of talent and has used his extensive scouting network to pull off some astute buys. Vice-chairman David Dein emphasised how hard it was keeping the squad together in the face of constant approaches for his star manager and players Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira. It hasnt been easy to fight off suitors who are after Arsene, Patrick and Thierry, Dein told the London Evening Standard. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Enviable record, not bullet-proof, proves Lara
	 - Unfair to overlook Jacobs, who shepherded his skipper to destination 400  BY DEREK PRINGLE IN ST JOHNS  England players queue up to congratulate Brian Lara on Monday. (AP) Brian Lara made cricketing history during the fourth Test against England in Antigua Monday when he became the first player to score 400 in a Test match innings. Lara, 34, overhauled the 380 Matthew Hayden scored for Australia against Zimbabwe in Perth last October to reclaim the record he set ten years ago when he scored 375, also against England in Antigua. The West Indies captain declared when he reached 400 with his team on 751 for five  the highest total conceded by England. The accepted wisdom is that great sportsmen do not believe in coincidences, but even Lara must be mindful of the way they stacked up here when breaking the record for a second time. Same man, same ground, same opponents, same day (Monday), same month. Even the time was almost exact, the clinching four off Gareth Batty coming at 11.43 am, just three minutes earlier than the one he struck off Chris Lewis ten years ago to bring an adoring Caribbean to his feet. Clearly history never repeats unless you are a driven genius. The figures are a close match, too. Ten years ago his 375 lasted 766 minutes and was made from 538 balls with 45 fours. Monday the record-breaking score of 384 took 732 minutes and 546 balls with 42 fours and four sixes. Having scored 400 in a Test, Lara now has a first-class score in every century interval between 0-6, something he lacked before Mondays heady achievement. West Indies cricket supporters are an excitable lot at the best of times, but the tumult that followed Laras reclamation was not simply joy, it was also the release of many years of pent-up frustration in which the left-hander has carried the batting more often than anyone can remember. After a victory jog round the square and a bear hug from batting partner Ridley Jacobs, Lara was congratulated by each England player in turn, pausing briefly to talk to Graham Thorpe, the only person, other than umpire Darrell Hair, to have been present on the field for both world records. The strife of Brian, which had threatened to consume him, had been wiped away in one monolithic innings and, just as he had done ten years earlier after making 375 against England here, he kissed the pitch in gratitude. Antiguas new Prime Minister, Baldwin Spencer, then strolled on surrounded by heavies to add his blessing, the opportunity to make some political capital from the moment too good to pass up. Ten years ago, Lara was given a house by Trinidads Prime Minister, Patrick Manning, after he had declined the peoples request to give Lara his own job. Manning is still in power, and by the look of Mondays knock so is Lara. Before the start of this series, Lara stated that he was a better player now than when he scored his 375. Yet while the figures remain powerful proof that he is right, this was a less perfect innings than the other one. According to those present in 1994, such as Michael Atherton, that one was flawless, at least until a photograph, discovered weeks later, revealed that his pads had brushed the stumps hard enough to raise a bail from its groove when hooking the record-breaking run. Like then, there had been something inexorable about Laras progress since tea on Sunday that had world record written all over it. With the new ball due almost immediately Monday morning, Englands best chance of stopping him lay with Steve Harmison, especially as his new ball partner Matthew Hoggard was still hors de combat with a stomach bug. Harmison has bowled superbly in this match for little reward. On a featherbed track, he again gave Lara a torrid time, though his propensity to run down the pitch in his follow-through saw him barred from bowling for the rest of the innings after Hair gave him a third warning to go with the two he had been given by umpire Aleem Dar the previous day. Harmisons ban left Vaughan bereft of his two opening bowlers, and though he employed a cat and mouse game by tinkering with the field, Lara just toyed with him, biding his time until after lunch to set the benchmark. Englands other option might have been to get players out at the other end, but like a faithful St Bernard, Ridley Jacobs remained unbowed, scoring an unbeaten 109, which on any other day would have warranted a lavish eulogy of its own. A powerful man, he hit several sixes as he shepherded Lara to his destiny, a journey that also saw the pair add 282 for the sixth wicket, a West Indies record. With a spate of Test triple hundreds in the last six months, Virender Sehwag made one two weeks ago against Pakistan, the record is not perhaps as bullet-proof as it once was. As Lara said when Hayden took the record from him last October: A standard has been set which we must strive to pass. Monday he kept his word.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

 Encouraging kids, the Rathore way 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore wasnt overtly excited Wednesday, a day after his history-making, silver-winning feat in the mens double trap in the Olympic Games. If anything, he was even more focused. From what he said informally at the range Tuesday, it was sure that he was working to a plan. The most important part was his plan to use his silver medal to promote sports among kids of the country. That was why he wasnt wearing it around his neck Wednesday. It was in his pocket all right, but he said: See, this medal is for the people of my country, those who helped me get this. In India I plan to give this medal to some agency or responsible person, who would agree to take it around the country to different schools. I wish the kids to see it and if one kid is excited enough with this to join sports ahead of academics, I will believe my effort here has been successful. A great gesture, no doubt, but that is what is to be expected from a great athlete. So what happened after the great day? My wife Gayatri rang me up in the morning, at 3 am, after all the dhamaka had stopped, he said. She said you relax now, be happy with what you have got. His father Lakshman Singh Rathore also phoned. He is a retired fauji. Has life changed for him? No. I will just be happy if sports comes in everybodys mind because of this medal. Professionalism in sports must come in. I am a great admirer of Leander, for example. I love all sports  was in the Madhya Pradesh Ranji selection as a medium pacer, but was rejected for lack of experience. And thank god for that. Then I got a chance at the NDA and was a fauji, fighting with the ninth Grenadiers, in the Kashmir valley. My battalion has killed more than 300 terrorists. In 1998, the Army was making a shooting team and asked for volunteers. I stepped ahead and was in the Army team. That January I first saw a shooting range... I remember we took photographs. There was the trial in July-August and I was in the Indian team, said the star who is now with the Infantry in MHOW. During the championship there was initial concentration, but then I lost it for a while and I whipped myself up. It was my pride as a fauji, as an Indian, working... You see, emotions make you weak. There is no place in me for that as far as shooting goes. He found it difficult though, when he said: I must be doing something which my mom would see and say: Han beta ne achcha kiya.  Copyright

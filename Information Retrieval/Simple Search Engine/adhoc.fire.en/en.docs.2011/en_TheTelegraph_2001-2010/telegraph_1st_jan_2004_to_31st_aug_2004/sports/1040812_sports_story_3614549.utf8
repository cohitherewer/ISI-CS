 3 Russians fail drugs test
Moscow: Three Russians have failed drugs tests and face possible expulsion from the Olympic Games, a top official said on Wednesday. Vladimir Loginov, vice-president of Russias Olympic Committee, did not name the athletes and said they would only be identified if a second test also proved positive. It is good that the positive doping results came at home and not in Athens, he told Ekho Moskvy radio. This is an internal affair of our country but the athletes will be punished, they will not appear at national championships and especially not at international competitions.Izvestia daily earlier reported the two were either weightlifters or field competitors, while one was from the athletics team. It said Russias Olympic officials would name them in the next few days. Russia said in June that all athletes who illegally used drugs would be expelled from the team. Officials promised to send a clean team to the Olympics.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

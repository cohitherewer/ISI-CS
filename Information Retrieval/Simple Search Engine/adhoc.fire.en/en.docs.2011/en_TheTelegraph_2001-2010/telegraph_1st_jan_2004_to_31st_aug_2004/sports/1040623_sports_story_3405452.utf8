PCB nod to Woolmer plea
- Haroon set to take over as assistant coach
 Bob WoolmerIslamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is expected to ask former Test player and team manager Haroon Rashid to double up an assistant coach in the new set-up. PCB chief executive Rameez Raja has indicated that Haroon was under consideration to be appointed as assistant coach, given his expertise and experience. New coach Bob Woolmer has asked us to appoint an assistant coach with him so that he does not face any communication problems and has someone attached with him who can learn from him, Raja said. [That Woolmer has asked for an assistant to, mainly, overcome the communication problem and that Rashid was the man in sight, was reported by The Telegraph on June 18. Woolmer had said: Communicating is definitely the key component (of coaching) My reading is that all the players do understand the language but few actually converse in English.] Since Haroon has already been retained as manager, the feeling is that he should also be appointed as assistant coach to Woolmer because he has the professional background to do both jobs with expertise, the Raja was quoted as saying in a local daily. Haroon, who was appointed as manager after the 2003 World Cup, has also been the coach of the Pakistan senior, A and the under-19 teams on several occasions and is a qualified ECB level-two coach. He had also attended a certificate-coaching course conducted by Woolmer two years ago in Karachi under the aegis of the ICC. Haroon, when contacted, said although he had no inkling that he may be handed a dual responsibility, he would welcome such an offer. If something like this happens I think I am capable enough of handling both responsibilities, he added. Raja said another reason for considering Haroon for the additional job was that the board wanted to avoid having too many people in the team management. Stevenson is trainer Meanwhile, a report from Karachi adds, that the PCB has given South African fitness trainer Murray Stevenson a three-year contract. The board opted for Stevenson after first choice Andy Gray, another South African, expressed his inability to join the team at the moment due to personal problems. The door, however, is not closed on Gray and he could join the support staff in September, Rameez said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: Gerard Houllier said Tuesday he wants a quick return to football management following his departure from English Premiership giants Liverpool. The Frenchman parted company with the Reds on Monday after a six-year spell at Merseyside where he won six trophies. 				 																																	Houllier is off to Euro 2004 in Portugal as part of Uefas technical committee, but he has his sights set on getting back into club management. 				 																																	If I leave with one big disappointment, it is that I feel I leave Liverpool with unfinished business, the Frenchman told the BBC. I love my football and my hunger is still there to achieve. I am in good shape and my leaving of Liverpool was not health-related. I will have a rest and then we will see. 				 																																	Berlin: Brazil World Cup defender Lucio, chased by Chelsea and Manchester United earlier this season, has completed a move from Bayer Leverkusen to Bayern Munich on Tuesday after a medical. 				 																																	Bayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said they had reached agreement with the player and Leverkusen but did not reveal the size of the transfer fee. 				 																																	Leverkusen, who bought Lucio from Internacional Porto Alegre for 8.8 million euros in 2001, had been asking 15 million euros for the 25-year-old. His contract at Leverkusan ran until 2007.				 																																	Portsmouth: Police on Tuesday said they would charge a 10-year-old boy with violent disorder in connection with rioting after a Premier League game. The unidentified boy, who is of the lowest age of criminal liability, was arrested along with a 14-year-old girl, Hampshire police said.				 																																	The boy will be charged at Portsmouth youth court on Thursday, a policeman spokesman said. The girl has already been charged and is on bail, along with five men who were arrested last week.				 																																	The arrests came after the March 21 match between Portsmouth and Southampton at Fratton Park. Portsmouth won 1-0.

Chelsea have not made an approach for Roberto Carlos, the Spanish clubs director of football Jorge Valdano told Marcas sports website. But he added neither the player nor his agent had been in touch.

The next step is to get teams of professionals to analyse financial and legal issues, a process which would take up to six weeks.				 																																	Thailand has offered 4.6 billion baht ($113 million) for a 30 per cent stake in the club.

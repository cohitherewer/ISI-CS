 Spain leave Reyes out of squad 
 After a brilliant Champions League season, Morientes is back Madrid: Spain coach Inaki Saez opted for a conservative Euro 2004 squad, naming eight defenders and leaving out Arsenal striker Jose Antonio Reyes on Thursday. Experienced players from Real Madrid and champions Valencia made up the backbone of the 23-man squad which will play hosts Portugal, Greece and Russia in Group A. The coach said 20-year-old Reyes, who has won four caps and scored two goals for Spain in the Euro qualifier against Armenia in October, had not yet reached maturity. Reyes is a man of the future for the national side, Saez said. As well as Reyes, Saez left out Valencia attacker Mista, the highest-scoring Spaniard in this years Primera Liga with 19 goals. Mistas stunning form helped his side seal a league and Uefa Cup double this season. My experience of international tournaments is that central defenders always receive the most punishment, and in the final  which is what we aim to reach  you are always short of defenders, Saez said. So I have put another man in at the back. Saez named Raul despite the Spanish captains poor season with Real Madrid. Fellow striker Fernando Morientes of Monaco also won a place after a brilliant Champions League campaign. Saez opted for versatile Barcelona defender Gabri to plug any holes in the Spanish defence, saying he was familiar with the player from coaching the Spanish youth team which won the 1999 World Cup in Nigeria. Defensive stalwarts Ivan Helguera and Michel Salgado of Real Madrid, and Carles Puyol of Barcelona are included and Betis Juanito won a place despite his sides indifferent league form. Spain, who have not lost in nine internationals, will rely on first choice goalkeeper Iker Casillas of Real Madrid. Athletic Bilbaos 24-year-old goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia was named in the squad for the first time. THE SQUAD Goalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Santiago Canizares (Valencia), Daniel Aranzubia (Athletic Bilbao) Defenders: Carles Puyol (Barcelona), Ivan Helguera (Real Madrid), Carlos Marchena (Valencia), Michel Salgado (Real Madrid), Gabri (Barcelona), Raul Bravo (Real Madrid), Cesar (Deportivo Coruna), Juanito (Betis) Midfielders: Juan Carlos Valeron (Deportivo Coruna), Xabi Alonso (Real Sociedad), Ruben Baraja (Valencia), Vicente (Valencia), David Albelda (Valencia), Joaquin (Real Betis), Xavi (Barcelona) Forwards: Raul (Real Madrid), Albert Luque (Deportivo Coruna), Fernando Torres (Atletico Madrid), Fernando Morientes (Monaco), Joseba Etxeberria (Athletic Bilbao).

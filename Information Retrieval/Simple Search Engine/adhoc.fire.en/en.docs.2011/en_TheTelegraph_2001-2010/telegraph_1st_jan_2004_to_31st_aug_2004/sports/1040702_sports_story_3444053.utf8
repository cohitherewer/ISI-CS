The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Back on the pedestal 
 - Weve suffered a lot to reach the final in our country: Figo  Luis Figo goes past Giovanni van Bronckhorst during Portugals semi-final against The Netherlands in Lisbon on Wednesday. (AFP) Lisbon: Six days ago Luis Figo turned his back on his teammates and the coach after being substituted during the quarter final against England. On Wednesday, the captain was back on his pedestal as national hero after a barnstorming performance in Portugals 2-1 Euro 2004 win over The Netherlands which took the hosts into their first major final. The 31-year-old came into the tournament as the soccer icon of the host nation but found himself regularly substituted by Scolari in a personally frustrating period. When it happened again after 75 minutes against England the winger marched straight down the tunnel and was markedly absent as the squad linked arms during the penalty shoot-out. Figo spent the week defending himself and said on Tuesday: I dont feel I have to prove anything. People know me very well now and I just have to give my best in the next game. Which is exactly what he did in one of the finest performances of his 109-match international career just when his country needed him most. That total equalled Fernando Coutos record until the defender reclaimed it when he appeared as a late substitute, and rarely can Figo have been such an inspiration. His performance brought back memories of Euro 2000, when he was at the peak but saw his efforts fall short as Portugal went out in the semi-finals. This time the 2001 World Player of the Year was not to be denied and Scolari, knowing that the winger was playing on adrenaline, did not dare consider bringing him off again. As the clock ticked down and Portugal fought desperately to hang on to their 2-1 lead, Figo showed a side of his game not often seen as he chased, harassed, and tackled for the national cause. This time when the whistle went he was where he belonged, in the middle of the pitch, shirt stained with sweat, surrounded by his celebrating teammates. Its difficult to explain in one word the emotion I feel right now, Figo said, after he was voted Man of the Match. Weve suffered a lot to reach the final in our own country. We cannot wish for anything more than this. Just one more thing  victory in the final would be the perfect end to a memorable career.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Nervousness did us in: Limba Ram
New Delhi: Archery star Limba Ram on Sunday identified technical flaws, such as delayed shooting of arrows, and lack of mental strength as the main reasons for the poor showing of the Indians, particularly in the team events, at the Athens Olympic Games. Appointment of a group of dedicated sports administrators for creating a data bank, taking help of sports psychologists and laying greater stress on yoga, meditation and sports medicine are some of the steps suggested by Limba to ensure better performance in major events in the future. The Indians fell victim to their traditional problem of nerves in crucial stages of knockout matches, said Limba, considered as the countrys all-time best archer. Referring to Satyadev Prasad, whose valiant fight against the top seeded Korean Im Dong Hyun in the pre-quarters was the high point of the Indian campaign in Athens, Limba said that he too looked jittery in the vital closing stages which cost him the contest.

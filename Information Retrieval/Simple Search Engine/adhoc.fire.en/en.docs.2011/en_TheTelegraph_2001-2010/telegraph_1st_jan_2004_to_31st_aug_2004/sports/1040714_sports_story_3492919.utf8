 Warne joins Murali at 527 but Sri Lanka hold on
 - FINAL TEST 
- Hayden hits second ton, Chandana scalps 10 in match  Kumar Sangakkara after completing his half-century on the fifth day of the second Test in Cairns on Tuesday. (Reuters) Cairns: Shane Warne took a world record-equalling 527th wicket on Tuesday but Sri Lanka held on to draw the second and final Test. The Lankans reached 183 for eight at stumps on an exciting final day after Australia had set them 355 to win. Warne took three for 129 and four for 70 after starting the game needing seven wickets to equal Muttiah Muralidharans world mark of 527. Warnes 527th wicket came via third umpire Bob Parry when the leg-spinner had Upul Chandana stumped for 14 at 174 for eight. With a crowd of about 1,700 cheering on Warnes every move, tailenders Chaminda Vaas (11 not out) and Nuwan Zoysa (three not out) defied the Australians for 30 nervous minutes. The draw meant Australia won the two-match series 1-0. Captain Ricky Ponting said: Were probably all a little bit disappointed for him (Warne) now that he hasnt actually broken it. But what a fantastic effort it is to be a joint world record-holder. Mahela Jayawardene was caught-behind off Glenn McGrath for six at 58 for three and Thilan Samaraweera was run out for a duck six runs later. Kumar Sangakkara put on a defiant stand of 43 for the fifth wicket with Tillekeratne Dilshan, who fell on the final ball before tea for 21, caught at first slip by Warne off Jason Gillespie to make it 107 for five. Warne then removed wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana for 14 at 136 for six, caught at short-leg, as Sri Lanka defended grimly with no hope of victory. Sangakkaras 264-minute vigil ended when Warne bowled the left-hander for 66 made off 173 balls. Warne then removed Chandana but, despite having all the fielders crowded around the bat, another wicket eluded him. Earlier, Player of the Series Matthew Hayden blasted his second century (20th in 55 Tests) of the match to guide Australia to 292 for nine declared after beginning the day on 194 for two. Hayden, who passed 5,000 Test runs on Tuesday, made 132 off 171 balls with 10 fours and one six before being bowled by Chandana who took five for 101 to return a ten-wicket haul for the first time. McGrath fined Glenn McGrath was fined $2,200  25 per cent of his match fee  for making an audible obscenity on the final day. The fast bowler was also reprimanded by Match Referee Chris Broad for shouting an obscenity after umpire Billy Bowden turned down a leg-before appeal on Sanath Jayasuriya. The report was submitted by all officiating umpires, who said that McGraths foul language could be heard from the boundary line.SHANE WARNE FACTBOX Born on Sept. 13, 1969, Melbourne.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Owen still has key role to play
 BY GERARD HOULLIER  Michael Owen will always be a goal-scorer Should Michael Owen be dropped? It is as simple a decision as any that Sven-Goran Eriksson has to make. The answer is no. Or, as the coach has a habit of saying, absolutely not. I spoke to Michael and the other Liverpool lads when I dropped in on the training camp yesterday as part of my work with Uefas technical group, but it didnt even cross my mind to ask him whether he felt his place was under threat. I realise people are impatient because, after two matches, Michael has not scored. But look at his contribution. Leave aside the France match for a moment  there were very few chances for the strikers on that tightly contested occasion  and appreciate how beautifully he made the crucial first goal against Switzerland for Wayne Rooney. He could have shot, but was very unselfish, placing it on Rooneys head so that the chance was easy to take (I liked the way the young player acknowledged it afterwards, by the way). And the first goal is very important in a game like that. To dwell on Michaels creative ability rather than his finishing may seem odd to some people but, in truth, a combination of racing through to score and arriving for tap-ins was never going to be the entirety of his game. Especially in view of all his injury problems, he has had to develop a wider range. As I said last week, he has improved in terms of strength, ball-holding ability and several other aspects. I really must stress: Michael will always be a goal-scorer. But now he can drop off, turn and go and I think he will evolve into someone who plays just off the strikers. You could compare the role I envisage to that of Youri Djorkaeff in Frances successful teams, although I repeat that Michael will always be a principal source of goals. Of course, he used to play right at the front, where Rooney operated against Switzerland, but it is difficult for Michael to exploit space behind defenders these days; they know him too well. That was the former Michael Owen. Maybe it will be best for England if, in the future, he plays just off Rooney, using the sharpened game-awareness he has acquired over the years. He can either run at defenders or play the through-ball for someone else. The assumption has always seemed to be that Michael would be at the front with Rooney dropping off, but in Portugal the evolution has been in the opposite direction  and I believe it has been natural. It will be interesting to see how Rafael Benitez, my successor at Liverpool, approaches the task of getting the best out of Michael. Obviously he will have his own ideas  and his record at Valencia proves that he knows how to structure a team effectively  but all I can tell you is what I would have done next season. The plan was to have Djibril Cisse at the front, with Michael roaming behind him. I believe they would both have scored a lot of goals for the club. I am still looking forward to seeing Cisse in a Liverpool shirt after he arrives from Auxerre later in the summer. Although there has been speculation about Steven Gerrards future at the club, I see no sign of it affecting his concentration. He has matured splendidly and become a great asset to England as well as Liverpool. This maturity has been evident in the way he has done whatever the team require, acting as a sitting midfielder in both games so far yet being involved in the creation of a goal against Switzerland, cleverly exploiting space left by Bernt Haas, as well as scoring one. Unfortunately he also had a hand in Frances winning goal last Sunday.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

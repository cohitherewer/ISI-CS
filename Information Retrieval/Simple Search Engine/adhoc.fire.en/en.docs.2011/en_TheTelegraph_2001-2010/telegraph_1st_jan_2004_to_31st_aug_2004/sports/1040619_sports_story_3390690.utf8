 Young firefly who sets England alight
	 - Rooney brings to his trade the belligerence of the boxing gym and the footwork of the dance hall  BY PAUL HAYWARD  Wayne Rooney after scoring against Switzerland during their group B tie at the Cidade de Coimbra Stadium on Thursday. (Reuters) Hair cropped, shirt out, jaw jutting, legs pumping. Talent plenty. Fear none. Bertie Wooster he may not be, but there is still something classically English about Wayne Rooney, who has been his countrys most influential player in Portugal so far. The boy is now a man. Rooney brings to his trade the belligerence of the boxing gym and the footwork of the dance hall. The hot southern sun has illuminated both halves of his character. Wayne 1 slides in on the goalkeeper and earns himself a booking. Wayne 2 smashes a right-foot shot which hits the post, bounces off the same goalies head and rolls into the net. He is like England itself: volatile, rough-hewn and capable of acts of beauty. Watching him walk the line between aggression and artistry in Englands 3-0 victory over Switzerland, you marvelled at his ability to influence events at such a tender age. His Man of the Match award was a no-brainer. The England throng could imagine him standing alongside them had talent not intervened. They chant his name with increasing fervour and know he is currently the only England player who runs directly at opponents and dribbles past. There is a case for saying that Rooney came of age on the international stage when he performed that 360-degree spin in front of Zinedine Zidane, the worlds leading expert in balletic moves. In Lisbon last Sunday, Rooneys pirouette took him and the ball away from the French master. Technically, there was no need for the young Evertonian to perform such a fancy manoeuvre to evade Zidane, but the suspicion is that he was trying to make a statement, like a pupil to a monk. The scoreline says this was an authoritative win. The scoreline lies. Only in the last 15 minutes did England really shake Switzerland by the throat. Until Englands numerical superiority began to tell, they lacked the pace and panache of a potential championship winning side. They failed to support the two front men in sufficient numbers and positioned themselves as if France were in town again. For the second time in five days, Rooney was the firefly, flashing about in the huge spaces between midfield and attack. Without him, Erikssons team would lack the essential quality of menace, of speed and unpredictability. Steven Gerrard would be directing traffic from central midfield, Frank Lampard would be chugging upfield from time to time, Paul Scholes would be firing diagonal cannon balls and David Beckham would be whipping in the occasional world-class cross. But there would be nothing to get John Bull up in the stands doing the conga. Rooney is fortunate to enjoy such licence. In two games, Eriksson has asked Michael Owen to play the Alan Shearer role, hard up against the opposition back four and mostly unsupported. It is not the job he was born to do. The upside is that Rooney can play without responsibility and choose his own line of attack. He does it well. He sees the balls angles and knows how to exploit space. This is the one quality no footballer can be taught. Rooney sees the game. And his youth carries him where he wants to go, sometimes with sparks and collisions along the way. These rave reviews may soon assume a darker tone. We are one bad tackle or swinging arm away from reporting his first international red card. It may be why Gary Neville, the teams wise shop steward, wrapped an arm round his young colleague after he had headed England into the lead. The goal was a routine finish that followed a cross-field ball from Beckham to Owen and a dinked cross on to Rooneys forehead. The celebration was something else: a somersault, followed by a good slap for the corner flag. Nevilles concern was not for the stick. He had seen Rooneys raised studs take a slice out of Jorg Stiel in the Swiss goal, six minutes previously, and the push from behind on Fabio Celestini that preceded the England breakthrough. Valentin Ivanov, the Russian referee, is not from the school of liberal officiating that gave us Markus Merk, the man in black for Englands 1-2 defeat to France. Neville could see that red might not be far behind and intervened. Beckham then took his turn to douse the bonfire of youthful emotions. Credit due: Rooney was more considered, less excitable from then on. He listens. Hallelujah. The word from inside the England camp is that the countrys youngest international debutant respects the hierarchy and is eager to learn. The fans love him because he runs at people, makes things happen, stands up for himself and leaves the imprint of the Englishman abroad on any defender who thinks he can be knocked around. Thierry Henry said it all last week: Rooney plays with his heart. One that has Made in England stamped on it.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

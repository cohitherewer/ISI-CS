 Pak bans liquor ads
Karachi: Pakistan cricket authorities have banned alcohol advertisements on cricket grounds during the series against India, officials said on Sunday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) opened sponsorship bids for various categories on Saturday. Results of the bids would be made known in the next few days after considering objections raised by some Pakistani and Indian companies. No seller of beverages, meaning any drink containing alcohol would be allowed to be the title sponsor or the co-sponsor, read the PCB bid documents. Alcohol is banned in Pakistan and alcohol advertisements are disallowed in the media and outdoors. The title sponsors will have the right to name the series. There are proposals to name the series as friendship series or the Imran-Kapil series. (AFP)  Copyright

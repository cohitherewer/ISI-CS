 Windies drop Best, Jacobs
St Johns: Pace bowler Tino Best and wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs were left out when the West Indies named their 14-man squad for the ICC Champions Trophy in England next month. Best was forced to quit the Test series against England earlier this month owing to a back problem. Ravi Rampaul, Devon Smith, Carlton Baugh and Darren Sammy, who, like Best and Jacobs, were in the squad which played in the triangular one-day series involving hosts England and New Zealand in June and July, were also omitted for the Champions Trophy. Brian Lara is leading the team on the current tour of England but the West Indies wont name their Champions Trophy skipper until later. Joey Carew, acting chairman of selectors, said Mervyn Dillon had been recalled to add experience and consistency to the bowling.

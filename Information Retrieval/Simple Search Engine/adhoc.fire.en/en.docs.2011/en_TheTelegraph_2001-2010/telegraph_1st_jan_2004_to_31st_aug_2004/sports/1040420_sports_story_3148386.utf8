The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB two wins away from NFL title
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  No time to relax, says Bhutia Calcutta: The National Football League title is almost in the grasp of East Bengal. Two wins from four remaining matches, and they will become the first team ever to defend Indias most coveted football crown. They have 40 points from 18 matches and two wins will take them to 46. Closest rivals Dempo have 36 from 19 and third-placed Mahindra United 33 from 18. If East Bengal touch 46, Mahindra and Dempo will not be able catch them even if they win all their remaining engagements. East Bengal have a good chance to seal the title here before the last two matches in Goa. They meet a struggling Mohun Bagan on Sunday and face the bottom-placed Indian Bank on April 28. However, they are not taking anything for granted as yet. We have not won the title until we have won it. We still have to finish it off and cant relax, Bhaichung Bhutia told The Telegraph on Monday. A solid team, with the best of Indian talent, consistent foreigners, enviable bench strength and an astute and dedicated coach in Subhas Bhowmick  these are broadly the reasons behind East Bengals success. Another factor tilting the balance in favour of Bhowmicks boys is their impeccable record in home matches, after a poor start, when they collected just two points from the first three games. Of the 12 matches they played here so far, East Bengal have won 11 and drew one. No other team has done even remotely as well at home. Its always important to win home matches. We have done that and it has proved very fruitful, said Bhutia. The start striker felt playing two tournaments simultaneously (National League and AFC Cup) doesnt have any adverse effect. The aim is to play well and not differentiate between tournaments. Its not that you put in 10 percent in IFA league, 20 percent in AFC Cup and 80 percent in National League. When you play, you just try to do your best, irrespective of the competition, said Bhutia.  Copyright

 Iran in a tizzy over Rezazadeh triumph
Teheran: Iranians swelled with pride on Thursday after weightlifter Hossein Rezazadeh confirmed his status as the worlds strongest man at the Athens Olympics. Known affectionately as the Iranian Hercules, Rezazadeh, equalled his own world record total lift of 472.5 kg with an ease and panache that crushed super-heavyweight competitors, as reported in Thursdays late City edition. I was so proud because this year we sent Hercules to Athens, said Shirin, 35, a furniture designer in Tehran. He won because he believes in God, the Republics Abrar-e Varzeshi newspaper said. Irans national anthem was played in Athens, thanks to our champion, said the state-run Iran newspaper. His gold gained Iran respect. President Mohammad Khatami told Rezazadeh in a message: Your ranking first was not only a sporting victory but a proper response to our nations expectations. I congratulate you, therefore, for delighting the hearts of the Iranian nation. His stocky form gazes down from Teheran billboards advertising a motor oil, vying with Michael Schumacher and David Beckham who front rival brands.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

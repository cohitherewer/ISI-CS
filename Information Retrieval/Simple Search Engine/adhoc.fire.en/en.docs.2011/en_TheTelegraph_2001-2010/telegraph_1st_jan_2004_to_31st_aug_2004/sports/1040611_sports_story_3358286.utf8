 Carlisle questions ICC decision
Harare: Rebel player Stuart Carlisle has questioned the International Cricket Councils (ICC) decision to allow Zimbabwe to continue to play one-day Internationals this year. The ICC said on Thursday after a meeting in Dubai the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) had agreed to postpone their remaining Test matches because of their ongoing dispute with 15 rebel white players. Carlisle said the rebels would not return until the ZCU agreed to binding arbitration. Thats very nice of the ZCU, isnt it, he said. Until there is arbitration and our main issues are sorted out, youre not going to see any players coming back. The guys need to get on with their lives. We cant keep waiting for the ZCU and the ICC to keep beating about the bush. Carlisle said the rebels were still hoping to organise a social tour to England next month. Were very focussed on this social tour to England... It is looking increasingly possible. Fair move: Rameez The PCB has called Zimbabwes decision to pull out of Test cricket for the rest of the 2004 season fair, but said Pakistan would play six one-day matches or a tri-series when they host the African nation in October. It was a fair decision and now we would want to play six ODIs or pursue one more team to play a tri-series, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

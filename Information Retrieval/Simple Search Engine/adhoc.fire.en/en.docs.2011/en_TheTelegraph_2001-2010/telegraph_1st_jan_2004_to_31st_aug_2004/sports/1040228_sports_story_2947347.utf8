The Telegraph - Calcutta
 This lot mentally tougher than we were: Prasanna
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Erapalli Prasanna Calcutta: Erapalli Prasanna feels the Indians were weighed down by diplomatic pressures during the revival tour of 1978 which led to their dismal performance but the current lot is mentally tough enough to handle such situations. Unlike the forthcoming tour where the players will be briefed by government mandarins before their departure, the briefing for the Bishan Singh Bedi-led side was done by the Board and manager Fateh Singh Rao Gaekwad before they left Mumbai. It was more or less a relation building tour and unfortunately we were not mentally geared up to take it, Prasanna said. Before leaving for Pakistan we were all briefed about the importance of the tour in terms of improving bilateral relations. We were brainwashed to such an extent that we never had a feeling that it was a normal cricketing tour, he added. But this time, he says, things will be different. Present day cricket is different. The players now are more stronger mentally. So, off-the-field happenings will not affect their performances. The legendary off-spinner felt the on-field happenings had taken a backseat on the 1978 tour and that led to the 0-3 rout in the Test series. The gameplan was missing and the planning wasnt foolproof. Moreover, we bowled badly. Venkat should have played all three Tests on that tour. Prasanna feels Anil Kumbles fitness will be the key to Indias chances. If fit, Kumble will be the trump card. But we need to find a replacement for Harbhajan Singh. After 25 overs, the spinners will come into play. The side that utilises these middle overs, before the second new ball is due, effectively will call the shots in the series. We definitely have a stronger batting line-up. The depth in batting is enormous. But to win you also need to take 20 wickets.  Copyright

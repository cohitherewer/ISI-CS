The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kumble catches Pak on the wrong foot
 - India a wicket from innings win - Inspired Pathan able foil for leggie - Youhanas unbeaten 107 too late in the day  Yusuf Youhana after his century in Multan on Wednesday. (AFP) Multan: India were tantalisingly close to their first-ever Test win in Pakistan on the penultimate day of the first Test. After being forced to follow-on, the hosts were left staring at defeat, Anil Kumbles seven wickets on Wednesday laying Pakistan low. The Indians quickly knocked off the last four wickets of Pakistans first innings, enforced the follow-on, and then left them on a pathetic 207 for nine in their second essay. The visitors are still ahead by 61 runs and need only the last Pakistani wicket on the final day to record a win after 52 years. The under-rated Indian bowling took a total of 13 wickets during the day, but a brilliant unbeaten 107 by vice-captain Yusuf Youhana forced the match on to the fifth day despite an extended half-an-hour Wednesday. Kumbles six for 71 in the second innings, his 24th five-wicket haul in Tests, followed his two for 100 in the first innings. The ace leg-spinner was greatly supported by left-arm pacer Irfan Pathan who scalped two first innings wickets and one in the second. The disciplined bowling, coupled with an inept home side batting, put India on the threshold of a historic win on Pakistan soil. The seasoned Kumble, returning to the Test squad after a two-month break due to injury, showed that he is still a force to reckon with as he produced a mesmerising spell to break the backbone of the Pakistani batting. Standing tall among the ruins, Youhana unleashed a flurry of strokes towards the end of the day in desperation. The Indians did their best to wrap up the match today itself but Youhana launched a counter attack with a barrage of boundaries to notch up his 11th Test century. Earlier, the home team plunged into trouble straightaway after the lunch break as they lost Imran Farhat (24), Taufiq Umar (9), captain Inzamam-ul Haq (0) and Yasir Hameed (23) in quick succession to allow the Indians to take a firm grip on the match. After being bundled out for 407 in the first innings, about half-an-hour before the lunch break, the two Pakistani openers seemed determined to give them a solid start, playing watchfully against Pathan and Laxmipathy Balaji. The Indians did not allow the absence of pace spearhead Zaheer Khan, who bowled just one over during the pre-lunch session and did not take the field again, to hamper them as they went about taking wickets at regular intervals. The Pakistani openers took the score to 33 before Kumble struck the first blow by evicting Farhat who looked the more aggressive of the two batsmen. The left hander went for a drive but only succeeded in edging the ball to Parthiv Patel behind the stumps. In his very next over, Kumble inflicted another blow by getting rid of Umar who offered no stroke and was trapped leg before wicket to a sharp incoming delivery. In all, there were four leg-before decisions in the Pakistan innings. But the biggest jolt for the home team came a few minutes later when captain Inzamam, who has been in tremendous form, got run out for a duck to give the visitors a firm control of the game. Inzamam failed to reach the safety of his crease as Yuvraj Singhs direct hit from mid on region hit the stumps, reducing Pakistan to a precarious 44 for three by the 21st over. The in-form Hameed and Youhana tried to perform the salvage job before part-timer Yuvraj joined the party by claiming the prized scalp of Hameed for 23. He went for a shot on the on-side but failed to control and Virender Sehwag held on to a well-judged catch in the short fine leg region. Youhana and Razzaq managed to survive till the tea break, taken with Pakistan on 91 for four, but the visitors came back strongly and kept beating the two batsmen persistently, Pathan being the luckless bowler on a number of occasions. However, Kumble brought an end to Razzaqs resistance with Aakash Chopra taking a brilliant reflex catch at forward short leg. A few overs later, Pathan trapped Moin Khan leg before to compound the misery of the hosts. The penultimate days play began in dramatic fashion as the Indians snared up three of the last four wickets within just 10 minutes of play. Pathan fired the first salvo in the morning by claiming the wicket of Razzaq off the very first ball with a rising delivery which took the edge and Parthiv latched on to an easy catch behind the wickets. Razzaqs 47 included six boundaries . The young Baroda pacer struck again in the very next over by removing Saqlain Mushtaq who had himself to blame for his dismissal as he played a rash stroke. Sachin tightened the noose around the hosts by claiming the wicket of Shoaib Akhtar to reduce Pakistan to 371 for nine. The last wicket pair of Sami and Shabbir prolonged the inevitable by defending stoutly and added 37 vital runs to the total before Kumble finally sent Sami back by dislodging his stumps for 15. Meanwhile, coach Javed Miandad has surprisingly recommended the name of controversial former fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz to the PCB for appointment as bowling coach. Miandad has recommended that Sarfraz be appointed as national bowling coach so that he himself can divide his time between the senior and junior teams and also work at the national academy in Lahore, according to local media reports.

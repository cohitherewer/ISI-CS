 Moya doubtful, Clijsters back at practice
 Carlos Moya lies in pain after spraining an ankle during his match versus Lleyton Hewitt in Sydney on Saturday. (AFP) Sydney, Jan. 17 (Reuters): As Carlos Moya looks a doubtful starter for the Australian Open starting next week, Kim Clijsters resumed practice on Saturday in a bid to play in the first Grand Slam of the year. Moya injured his ankle in Saturdays Sydney International final against Lleyton Hewitt. The Spaniard was rushed to hospital after rolling his right ankle in the first set, forcing him to retire and handing the title to the Australian. Doctors initially feared Moya may have fractured his ankle but X-rays cleared him of any breaks. An ATP tennis official later said Moya had a bad sprain. Meanwhile, Hewitt told a news conference on Saturday that Clijsters had been doing some light training but would not make a final decision on whether or not she will play the Australian Open until they arrive in Melbourne. Its going all right, Hewitt said. She had a light hit yesterday but were just taking it day by day. Venus Williams did not waver for a second when asked if she was ready for the Aussie Open. Yes, she said after sauntering into Melbourne Park following a six-month absence through injury looking as though she did not have a care in the world.  Copyright

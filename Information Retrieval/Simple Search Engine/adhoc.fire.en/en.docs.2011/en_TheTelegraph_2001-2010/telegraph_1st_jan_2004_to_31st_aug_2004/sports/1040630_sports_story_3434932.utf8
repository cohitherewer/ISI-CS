The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pakistan slam six past Tirkey amp; Co.
 - 4-NATION MEET 
- Wobbly defence, poor shooting do India in  Sohail Abbas is back among goals Amsterdam: Indias outing against Pakistan  a team which has not fared too well against Dlip Tirkey and Co. in the recent past  was an absolute disaster, going down 1-6 to their neighbours here Tuesday. India had suffered their biggest defeated to Pakistan in the 1982 Asian Games final when they lost 1-7. In the Rabobank four-nation tournament, Sohail Abbas scored twice (28th and 43rd minutes) and Shakeel Abbasi (7th), Shabbir Hussain (33), Kashif Jawaid (55) and Nadeem Khan (64) scored one each. Deepak Thakur had made it 1-2 in the 32nd minute, but that was little consolation. This was Indias second loss in as many matches in the tournament, following their 0-2 defeat to hosts Holland Sunday. Tuesday Pakistan played a disciplined game against a sloppy show by India. India often struggled for ball possession and hardly made any organised move during the entire match. And even Thakurs goal appeared to be a fluke. India rarely posed a threat to the opposition, with most of the forwards including veteran Dhanraj Pillay failing to match their counterparts in speed and ball control. The Pakistanis played purposefully with incisive moves up both flanks, creating a lot of problems for Indian defenders. The shoddy Indians conceded goals in the first half itself. It was rank bad defending, especially by Kanwalpreet Singh. There was hardly any game plan and not even a single co-ordinated move was executed by the Indians. The eight-time Olympic champions started the high-profile game with two of their most senior players Pillay and Baljit Singh  but neither did any good to the sides cause. Goof-ups in the Indian deep defence helped Pakistan take complete control in the first half itself. Thakurs goal, though, was a face-saver. A midfield error by Vikram Pillay in the seventh minute was followed by a long run by Jawaid, whose cross from the right flank was hit home by Abbasi after Kanwalpreet had made a mess with the clearance. And in the 28th minute Abbas slammed home from the only penalty corner that the side got in the first half. Thakurs goal raised minor hopes, but Pakistan dealt a major blow when Shabbir Hussain gave his team a 3-1 lead just before the half-time hooter. Changes were made after the lacklustre first half. India replaced Devesh Chauhan in goal with young Adrian DSouza, but the move made had no effect on the Indians fate. Pakistan hammered in three more goals to complete an emphatic win. Sohail scored his second goal from another penalty corner (he being the nations penalty corner specialist) in the 43rd minute and eight minutes later Jawaid made it 5-1 before Nadeems goal six minutes from the end sealed the fate of the Indians. India now have only a very remote chance of qualifying for the final. They play their last league match against Germany Thursday. The worst, of late Olympic gold medallist and national selector Gurbux Singh reacted strongly to the disastrous loss by India, saying it was the worst defeat I have seen in the last 3-4 years, adds a Staff Reporter in Calcutta. He said one of the prime reasons for the disaster was because the defenders were travelling to far up and we were being outnumbered in our own defence. That just cannot happen. Kanwalpreet was the main culprit in this. He had no business going up so far when he would not be available when the going was tough in our defence area. Gurbux said skipper Dilip Tirkey was also to blame in this defeat. He was too often up and failed to make it bad. All this, remember, was apart from our failure to convert from penalty corners, said Gurbux. He said he found little of plan or strategy in the game. Even though India lost 0-2 to Holland, I was happy with their game, because they played positive hockey and even had better ball possession, he said. They played better than the Dutch in patches and could have won had they been able to convert the many opportunities that came their way. There was plan and purpose in that match.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 EURO DIGEST
London: Wayne Rooney will be sidelined for around eight weeks after breaking a bone in his foot during Englands quarter final defeat by Portugal in the European Championship, his Premier League club Everton have confirmed. England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had initially said Rooney would be out for six weeks. Everton confirmed the diagnosis of his injury after Rooney saw a specialist on Saturday. Berlin: England captain David Beckham has a problem with nerves when it comes to taking penalties in big tournaments, according to former Germany coach Franz Beckenbauer. Its quite possible that Beckham suffers from a mental block at big tournaments, Beckenbauer said in a column in Bild on Saturday. He was sent off at the 1998 World Cup, and now he missed two penalties against France and Portugal. Beckham appears to have a problem with nerves. Lisbon: Greeces tactical play in knocking holders France out of Euro 2004 has earned glowing praise from Uefa technical delegate Roy Hodgson. It was a very good tactical display by the Greeks, very disciplined, said Hodgson, who coached Switzerland to the 1994 World Cup after a 32-year absence from major tournaments. I thought they showed two vital qualities you seek in all teams, energy and enthusiasm, Hodgson said.  Paris: Frances 0-1 defeat to Greece was a Greek tragedy which sounded the death knell for a generation of players, French newspapers said on Saturday. Indefensible, was the one-word headline on the front page of lEquipe. Pitiful, was Liberations assessment of the performance of the former world and European champions. Les Bleus are stark naked, they showed no desire, no ideas, no enthusiasm, no collective talent, lEquipe wrote. Apart from two or three players of genius, they dont have much to offer any more.

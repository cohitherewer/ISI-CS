The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nonchalant win for India
 - Asia Cup l Sachin posts highest score vs Bangla after bagging 3 wickets  Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar has his stumps shattered in the Asia Cup match against India in Colombo on Wednesday. (AP) Colombo: Sachin Tendulkar gave ample display of his all-round abilities as India showed signs of returning to top form with an emphatic eight-wicket victory against Bangladesh in the first second stage match of the Asia Cup cricket tournament here on Wednesday. Tendulkar snared three Bangladesh wickets before hitting up his highest-ever score of 82 not out against the minnows to help India overhaul Bangladeshs total of 177 in just 38.3 overs. Much of the credit for setting up the win went to off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and Ashish Nehra although it was Irfan Pathan (3/32) and Sachin Tendulkar who did the maximum damage after some initial wayward bowling by the pacemen. Harbhajan marked his return to international cricket after an eight-month injury lay-off, with impressive figures of 10-2-20-1 on a placid track at the SSC ground, after Sourav Ganguly won the toss and elected to bowl. Nehra, playing his first match of the tournament in place of an injured Zaheer Khan, also did not disappoint with some disciplined bowling in the middle overs. In their run chase, India lost opener Virender Sehwag early but Tendulkar combined with Ganguly (60) to put on 154 runs for the second wicket and take the team to a facile win. The victory earned India six points including a bonus point. The Indians will now take on arch-rivals Pakistan in their next match on Sunday. The Indian innings was off to a spectacular start with Sehwag punishing a clueless Tareq Aziz who struggled to find his rhythm in the first over which cost him 19 runs. But Sehwags belligerence proved shortlived with the bowler having him caught by Alok Kapali on the fifth ball of the over for an eight-ball 16. Undeterred by the early loss, Ganguly, promoting himself to No. 3 ahead of VVS Laxman, and Tendulkar then went about the task in a clinical fashion. The pair put on 100 runs off 149 balls but accelerated thereafter to show their class. Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique was treated with contempt by Ganguly who hit two of his three sixes against the hapless bowler. Tendulkar also showed his aggressive instincts, reaching his 67th half-century. Tendulkar also surpassed his previous highest score of 54 in the 31st over. The two batsmen, in the process, established a new Asia Cup record erasing the previous mark of 123 for second wicket set by Saeed Anwar and Rameez Raja of Pakistan against Bangladesh in Colombo during the 1997-97 edition of the Cup. With five runs to target, Ganguly holed out to Kapali, after batting for 100 balls for his 60 runs inclusive of three fours and three sixes. Tendulkars unbeaten 127-ball knock contained 10 fours and a six. Earlier, Pathan provided his usual breakthroughs at the start and Harbhajan and Tendulkar forged a spin pair which brought wickets for the Indians at regular intervals. Captain Habibul Bashar was bowled neck and crop playing outside the line of a delivery and Rajin Saleh was consumed first ball up by way of leg-before wicket decision. Ashraful teamed up with Kapali to hold the innings together and put on 46 runs for the third wicket before Nehra had the latter caught behind in his very first over. Bangladesh were reduced to 92 for 5 when two wickets fell in Harbhajans sixth over, one by way of a run-out. Harbhajan pushed through a delivery which found Faisal Hossain (17) in front of the stumps and then Ashraful could not beat a direct throw from Yuvraj Singh at mid-wicket after making 35 from 69 balls with three fours. Tendulkar then took centrestage, picking the next three wickets to fall. India had rung in three changes in their side, bringing in Harbhajan, Laxman and Nehra in place of Anil Kumble, Parthiv and Zaheer. Match Referees interchanged Even though Mike Procter was allotted the game at the SSC, eventually Roshan Mahanama sat in the Match Referees chair. This came about as the other game of the day (at the Premadasa Stadium) featured Sri Lanka, and Mahanama wouldnt have qualified as a neutral there.  (PTI)  Copyright

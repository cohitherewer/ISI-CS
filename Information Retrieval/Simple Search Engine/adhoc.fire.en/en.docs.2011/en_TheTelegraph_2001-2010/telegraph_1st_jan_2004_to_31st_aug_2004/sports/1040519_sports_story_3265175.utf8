 Umrigar against foreign teams participating
Mumbai, May 18 (PTI): Former India skipper Polly Umrigar is against the entry of a foreign team in the Duleep Trophy as it will dilute the importance of the event. This experiment, under which the England A team took part in the Duleep Trophy last season, should be discontinued, said Umrigar. What is the point in allowing a foreign team? It devalues the tournament and dilutes its importance, he said. Umrigar welcomed Sourav Gangulys suggestion for the introduction of a two-tier system when the (ICC) gives Test match status to more countries. Its a very good suggestion. In fact the Ranji Trophy two-tier system, under which there is promotion and relegation, is the best example for the ICC to follow, Umrigar added.  Copyright

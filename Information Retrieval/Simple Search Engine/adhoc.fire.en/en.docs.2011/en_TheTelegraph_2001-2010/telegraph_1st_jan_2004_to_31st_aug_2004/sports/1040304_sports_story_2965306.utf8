The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hostile welcome awaits Warne
 - Leg-spinner bags first wicket for Australia after return from ban  Shane Warne during a warm-up match against Sri Lanka Presidents XI in Colombo on Wednesday. (Reuters) Colombo: Australias Shane Warne is set to face hostile Sri Lankan fans when he returns from a drug-induced ban to take part in next weeks Test series, newspapers said Wednesday. The star leg-spinner, who served out a 12-month ban after failing a dope test before the world cup last year, was dubbed Shame Warne by the media even as crowds began to heckle the player. No international cricketer has been involved in controversies in relation to Sri Lanka as much as Warne, The Island newspaper said in a story headlined Shame Warne is back. He knows that a very hostile reception awaits him when the Tests come around, it added. The newspaper noted that Warne was jeered when he emerged from the pavilion for a practice stint during the one-day International over the weekend, with many fans shouting Shane Warne, go home. Sri Lankas former World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga also did not spare Warne, saying the Australian should have been banned for life for taking drugs. Twelve months might seem like a long time, but I dont agree with the punishment he got, Ranatunga said. If you take drugs, you should be banned for life. That goes for all players. In the lead-up to the Test series, which starts in Galle on March 8, Ranatunga and Warne had been engaged in a verbal spat. Warne, who has been mocked publicly in the past over his weight, had said of the chubby Ranatunga: Arjuna, hes probably slotting himself around at 150 kg at the moment, is he? Swallowed a sheep or something like that? Ranatunga reportedly retorted by saying that it was better to swallow a sheep than to take what the Australian had been ingesting  a reference to him using a banned diuretic. Warne was whisked away by the team management from a media conference last week when local media tried to ask him about his spat with Ranatunga and possible confrontation with local crowds. The cricketing animosity between the two countries began when Sri Lankas star spinner Muttiah Muralidharan was no-balled for throwing by Australian umpires on a tour down under in 1995. Australia then boycotted their World Cup match in Sri Lanka in 1996 due to security concerns. Ranatungas men went on to win the tournament  beating Australia in the final in Pakistan. Warne on Wednesday bagged his first wicket for Australia in a practice match against a Sri Lanka Presidents XI team. Sri Lanka XI tail-ender Ruchira Perera became Warnes 857th victim in first-class cricket when he was stumped by Wade Seccombe. Warne bowled a short spell of 6.2 overs and conceded 21 runs for his wicket. The 32-year-old leg-spinner was banned from all forms of cricket in February 2003 after testing positive for the banned diuretics hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride.  (AFP)  Copyright

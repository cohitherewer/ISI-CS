		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 EURO DIGEST
Oporto: The Italian football federation (FIGC) has decided not to appeal against striker Francesco Tottis three-match ban for spitting, FIGC spokesperson Barbara Moschini said on Friday. Totti, 27, was suspended by Uefa on Thursday for spitting on Danish opponent Christian Poulsen in their Euro 2004 opener. FIGC legal representative Guilia Bongiorno said the federation chose not to contest the decision for fear of a heavier punishment.Berlin: German midfield general Michael Ballack looks set to stay at Bayern Munich with the Bavarian giants reportedly extending his contract at the Olympic Stadium until 2008. Ballack, 27, was poised for a 12 million euro move to Barcelona, with the club giving him the green light, but Bayern have performed a U-turn after their failure to sign Portuguese international Deco of FC Porto. Ballack is contracted at Bayern until 2006 but Bild claims Munich want to extend that deal by a further two years to show their faith in the playmaker.Falperra: Spain have no complaints about the choice of Anders Frisk to referee Sundays showdown with Portugal, despite unhappy memories of the Swede and resentment over their last meeting with tournament hosts. I have absolute faith that the refereeing job will be done with justice, Spain coach Inaki Saez said on Thursday, after learning that Frisk would control the Group A game at the Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon. Frisk was singled out for fierce criticism from Spains then coach Jose Antonio Camacho, when he awarded Ireland two penalties in normal time in their game at the World Cup in 2002.Espinho: Teams are being punished too harshly for fouls by their goalkeepers, a top referees official said on Thursday. Volker Roth, chairman of Uefas referees committee, would welcome a change in the law under which a goalkeeper faces an immediate red card if he intentionally handles the ball outside the area, or prevents an opponent from taking advantage of a scoring opportunity by bringing him down. The law harshly penalises the goalkeeper and his team, Roth, a former international referee, said. In fact, there is a triple punishment if the goalie is sent off because the number two goalkeeper comes in to replace him, an innocent outfield player is substituted to allow the replacement and if a penalty has been awarded, a goal is often scored against the team as well.

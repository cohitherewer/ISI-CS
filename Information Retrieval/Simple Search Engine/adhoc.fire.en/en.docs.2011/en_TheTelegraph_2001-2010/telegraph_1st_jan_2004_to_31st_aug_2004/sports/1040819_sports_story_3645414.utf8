The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hoogenband defends crown
Athens: Pieter van den Hoogenband won the mens 100m freestyle at the Athens Olympics on Wednesday to become just the third man to win swimmings premier race on two occasions. The flying Dutchman retained the title he won in Sydney in a slick 48.17 seconds but just failed to beat the world record he set in Sydney four years ago although two other records fell. The United States broke the oldest world record in swimming to win the womens 4x200 freestyle relay and claim their sixth gold medal in the pool. Australias Jodie Henry smashed the womens 100 freestyle world record in the semi-finals to confirm her status as the favourite for Thursdays final. Japans Kosuke Kitajima captured his second gold by easily winning the 200 breaststroke four days after he took the 100 while Otylia Jedrzejczak won the womens 200 butterfly to become Polands first Olympic swimming champion. Van den Hoogenband joined Johnny Weissmuller and Alexander Popov as the only men to successfully defend the 100 freestyle title with a perfectly-timed swim, hitting the front in the final two strokes. South African Roland Schoeman finished second in 48.23 and Ian Thorpe came third in 48.56, flashing home from sixth at the halfway mark after winning the 200-400 freestyle double earlier in the meet. The US quartet of Natalie Coughlin, Carly Vollmer, Dana Vollmer and Kaitlin Sandeno wiped the last East German record from the books with a combined time of seven minutes 53.42 seconds. The old mark of 7:55.47 was set exactly 17 years ago to the day but was doomed from the moment Coughlin, who won the 100 backstroke gold, raced through the lead-off almost three seconds under world record pace. China were second, Germany third. Venus, Roddick crash out Womens tennis title-holder Venus Williams of the United States crashed out of the meet when she lost 4-6, 4-6 to Frenchwoman Mary Pierce. Andy Roddick, considered odds-on favourite for the gold following Roger Federers exit, also got dumped out on Wednesday. The mens second seed was beaten 4-6, 4-6 by Chilean Fernando Gonzalez. Zhang Guozheng earned Chinas third weightlifting gold, taking the 69 kg title with a supreme display of strength before stumbling off the stage injured. Despite apparently straining his back at the end, an animated Zhang left no room for challenges, completing his four lifts with devastating ease. He combined 160 kg in the snatch with 187.5 kg in the clean and jerk for a total of 347.5 kg. In the first athletics event, European champion Irina Korzhanenko, who lost the 1999 world indoor title for doping, released a years best of 21.06m to win the womens shot put gold at the Olympia on Wednesday.

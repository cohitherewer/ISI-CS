The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan, Bell steady England 
 Bell, who made 70, in action on Thursday London: England recovered from 64 for three to 313 for five at close on the opening day of the fourth and final Test against the West Indies at The Oval on Thursday. Skipper Michael Vaughan (66) and debutant Ian Bell (70) put on 146 for the fourth wicket before departing in the final session. Vaughans half-century came in his 50th Test appearance as England chase a record-equalling seventh successive Test win. Trescothick failed to add to his lunch-time score of 30, clipping Fidel Edwards to Ramnaresh Sarwan at square leg. Key (10) perished four balls later, edging a wide Dwayne Bravo ball behind to Carlton Baugh. Bell, with an average of more than 80 for Warwickshire in County championship this season, replaced broken-finger victim Graham Thorpe and played some streaky defensive shots early on before being hit on the shoulder by Edwards and receiving treatment. The 22-year-old recovered and gradually settled, stroking three boundaries. The south London ground is undergoing extensive redevelopment work but a full house still arrived to see England start their bid to clinch the series 4-0 and record a second whitewash in a row after the 3-0 rout of New Zealand in May and June. Play began 25 minutes later owing to a heavy cloud cover but sun broke through before lunch just as Andrew Strauss mistimed a hook off Jermaine Lawson, lobbing an easy catch to Edwards at the mid-wicket for 14. Vaughan opted to bat on the traditionally flat Oval track despite early cloud cover. The West Indies, who were again untidy in the field, made two changes with Lawson and Dwayne Smith replacing injured duo Dave Mohammed and Pedro Collins. (REUTERS)  Copyright

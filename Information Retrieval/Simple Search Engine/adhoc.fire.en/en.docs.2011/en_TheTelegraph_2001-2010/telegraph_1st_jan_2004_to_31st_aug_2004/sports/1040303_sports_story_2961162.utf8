 Italian soccer draws deputy PM flak
Rome: Italian soccer is sick, the countrys deputy Prime Minister Gianfranco Fini said on Tuesday. Football has been sick for sometime, everyone knows that and it is for a series of reasons, Fini said in reaction to a nationwide fraud investigation into the game. His comments contrast with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis reaction to last weeks raids by finance police on the offices of 51 Serie A and B clubs. Berlusconi, who is also president and owner of AC Milan, described the investigation as a step towards a police state. Fini said that clubs which had nothing to hide need not fear opening their books. I dont think that verifying the cleanliness of Italian football is a negative thing, in fact it is positive, above all for those who are honest, said Fini. Personally I believe that those who really have nothing to fear will not worry if the financial police ask them to verify their accounts. As well as the far-reaching fraud investigation, Serie A club Lazio is being scrutinised by Rome magistrates looking into the collapse of food company Cirio which owned the club. On Monday judicial sources said they believed Lazio had paid the bonuses for their 2000 Italian title win out of cash illegally transferred from Cirio, which was owned by former Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti. The Cirio probe is also looking into transfer deals between Lazio and Parma. Parma is owned by dairy company Parmalat which is struggling to survive a multibillion euro hole in its accounts which led to the arrest of its founder Calisto Tanzi and his son, former Parma football club president, Stefano Tanzi. Fini is leader of the National Alliance, the coalition partner to Berlusconis centre-right Forza Italia party. (Reuters)  Copyright

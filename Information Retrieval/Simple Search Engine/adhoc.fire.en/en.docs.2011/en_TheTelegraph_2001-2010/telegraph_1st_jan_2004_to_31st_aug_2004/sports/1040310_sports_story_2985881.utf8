 Zimbabwe issue takes centrestage 
Auckland: International crickets governing body was meeting behind closed doors on Tuesday with a range of tough decisions to make, headed by Englands proposed and increasingly controversial tour of Zimbabwe. The ICC board, including Zimbabwe Cricket Union chairman Peter Chingoka, went into the meeting at an Auckland hotel. Under ICC rules, barring a government ban, the only other way for the ECB to withdraw without paying compensation is on security grounds. If England do pull out of Zimbabwe they could consequently lose their lucrative role as hosts of Septembers ICC Champions Trophy as well as three warm-up matches with India that accompany it. The ICC said they believed the Champions Trophy should stay in England.  (AFP)  Copyright

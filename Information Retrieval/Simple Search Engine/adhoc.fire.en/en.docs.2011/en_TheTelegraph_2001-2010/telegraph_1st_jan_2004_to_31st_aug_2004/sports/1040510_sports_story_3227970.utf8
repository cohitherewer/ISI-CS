The Telegraph - Calcutta
Hail to the king and his courage 
- President to mom, the accolades keep piling up
 Murali had the record problem covered, way before Shane Warne could...Colombo: Sri Lankas President and Prime Minister led millions of fans here on Sunday to congratulate star off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan for breaking the world record for Test wickets. President Chandrika Kumaratunga said she was impressed by Muralidharans courage and determination in facing challenges and adversaries, a reference to being called for throwing by an Australian umpire. I join all Sri Lankans in expressing our pride and delight that you are the first Sri Lankan to establish a world record in Test cricket, Kumaratunga said in a message sent to Muralidharan. The controversial spinner, affectionately known as Murali, smashed through Courtney Walshs record of 519 victims in Harare on Saturday as Sri Lanka crushed Zimbabwe in the first Test by an innings and 240 runs. He finished the game with match figures of eight for 92 to take his career tally to 520. May you and the Sri Lankan cricket team have the ability to improve its position and take Sri Lankas name further in international fame, said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse. Sri Lanka Cricket president Mohan de Silva said the record was even better because of the obstacles Muralidharan faced and vowed that the governing body of the sport here will be a pillar of strength to him. Muralidharan was assessed by experts in Australia last month after he was reported for a suspect bowling action by Match Referee Chris Broad after the third and final Test against Australia here in March. A report has been sent to the International Cricket Council (ICC) which is yet to make the findings public. The Sri Lankan media, on Sunday devoted their entire sports front pages to Muralidharans record-breaking feat. Murali on top of the world, said the Sunday Observer. King Murali was the headline in the Sunday Island,while the Sunday Times said: King Murali does it! Muralidharans parents were jubilant as they watched television broadcast of their son play in Harare and set a new world record. I think I am the happiest mother in the world today, said his mother, Lakshmi Muralidharan. I didnt think he would come this far. I never even thought he would play for the country, but once he started I knew he would do something, but not this. Muralidharans father, S. Muttiah, said he was overjoyed and expected his son to reach the 1,000-wicket mark if he continued to play. If he continues for a few more years, I am sure that he will go on to pick up 1,000 wickets in Test cricket, Muttiah said adding that he was disappointed over the controversy surrounding his sons bowling action. His record-breaking achievement was witnessed by just 400 spectators at the Harare Sports Club, but muralidharan refused to be drawn into the controversy over the make-up of the Zimbabwe team which contained five new caps after former skipper Heath Streak and his fellow white rebels refused to play. Zimbabwe has played the best available team they could have put out, said Muralidharan, who will be looking to add to the tally when the second and final Test starts in Bulawayo on Friday. He also knows his record may not stand for long. (AFP)  Copyright

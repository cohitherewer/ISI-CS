 Selectors await Hussain decision
London: The England selectors waiting for Nasser Hussains decision on whether to bring down the curtain on his international career. The former skipper indicated he was contemplating retirement after his match-winning century on Monday which sealed a seven-wicket win in the first Test against New Zealand at Lords. Hussain said he would consider his future and discuss the situation with coach Duncan Fletcher and father Joe before telling the selectors his decision. But the 36-year-old is yet to reveal his plans to the selectors, who are waiting for his decision before they sit down and select the squad for the second Test. We wont be talking as selectors until weve spoken to Nasser, but well give him as long as we can to make what is a very big decision for him, said chairman of selectors David Graveney. Notable figures have come out in support and advised Hussain to continue while he can still perform at the top level. Former teammate Alec Stewart has urged him to carry on.  (AFP)  Copyright

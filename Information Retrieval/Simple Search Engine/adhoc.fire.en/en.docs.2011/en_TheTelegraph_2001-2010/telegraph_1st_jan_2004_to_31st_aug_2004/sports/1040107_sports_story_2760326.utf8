The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan lose to Churchill 
Margao: Churchill Brothers warded off Mohun Bagans second-half challenge on Tuesday to eke out a 1-0 win which helped them move into second place in the 8th National Football League. Churchill have 14 points from eight matches, while Dempos tally is 17 points from seven games. Mohun Bagan, who had bowed to Salgaocar the other day, are stuck on 11 points. Churchill started on a promising note, probing the Calcutta defence with a steady flow of passes. The Goans missed a couple of chances before scoring the winner in first-half injury time. Yusif Yakubu, combining with John Kingsley, raced down the left flank beating a couple of defenders and relayed the ball to Francis Alfonso who tapped the ball into the net to give Churchill their fourth win. Mohun Bagans inconsistent form continued as their midfield failed to function. With Jose Ramirez Barreto being tightly marked, their attack lacked sting, particularly disappointing in the first session. In the second session, Barreto produced some magic when he shrugged off his marker, avoided the challenge of two more defenders and then sent a cross for Hardeep Gill whose header was smartly tipped over by Mark Mascarenhas. A few minutes later, Osumanu Husseini cleared a shot by Ashim Biswas  who was set up by Hardeep Singh Saini  from the goalline. Mohun Bagan had the first good chance of the match when Biswas shot out on the run after Barreto had put him through in the 17th minute. Two minutes later, Churchill launched a counter-attack and Alfonso missed an open chance as he shot out off a pass from Somatai Shaiza.  Dora hospitalised  Mohun Bagan got a jolt when reliable keeper Prasanta  Dora got injured following a clash with Shaiza. Dora was  stretchered off the field and had to be taken to hospital.  X-rays didnt reveal any fracture, though Dora would be  kept overnight in the hospital for routine observation.  Arindam Ghosh replaced Dora under the bar and within a few  minutes he was upto the task, saving a stinging Yakubu shot.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greek camp hit by an untimely dispute 
 FROM SAM WALLACE IN PORTO Nikolaidis is a majority stake-holder at AEK AthensOn the eve of the most important match of the countrys soccer history, the Greek national team was on the brink of chaos Wednesday as their players threatened to strike over a wages dispute, casting a long shadow over their semi-final versus the Czech Republic. As Greece prepared for their greatest achievement in almost 80 years of international football, the financial collapse of top club side AEK Athens further unsettled Otto Rehhagels players. The German coach, 65, refused to discuss the delicate state of negotiations between his players and the Greek football federation, but that did not prevent him entering into a slanging match with a journalist at a tense press conference at the Estadio do Dragao. It is understood that the Greek players, led by captain Theo Zagorakis, were in further talks Wednesday night aimed at settling the row. The rift centres on a euros 100,000 bonus that has been promised to each player for reaching the semi-finals. The players are now demanding that they should be paid euros 300,000 each from the euros 10.3 million [ 7.3 million] pot of prize money that has been given by Uefa to the federation. The Greeks earned euros 5 million ( 3.5 million) for reaching the tournament in Portugal, a further euros 1 million ( 710,000) for their four points in the first phase and euros 1.9 million ( 1.35 million) for reaching the last eight. Their shock victory over France in the quarter finals earned them euros 2.4 million [ 1.71 million] alone. Embarrassed Greek federation officials refused to answer questions about the row and said there would be no problem fielding a team Thursday. Privately, Rehhagel was confident that a compromise could be reached. He had also to take into consideration the spectacular collapse of AEK Athens who have five players in his squad. Perhaps more staggering is that Rehhagels striker Demis Nikolaidis, who plays for Atletico Madrid, is AEK Athens majority shareholder. The clubs national team players  Michalis Kapsis, Costas Katsouranis, Vassilis Lakis, Vassilis Tsartas and Zagorakis  all face the termination of their contracts and their club could be relegated to amateur status. The club owes almost euros 100 million to creditors and the Greek government has rejected a proposal to write off 95 per cent of AEK Athens debt. The Greeks problems were not confined to money after Rehhagel clashed with journalists over allegations that he has alienated his players. The outspoken German won two Bundesliga titles, two German cups and a European Cup-Winners Cup with Werder Bremen as well as leading Kaiserslautern to the Bundesliga title later in his career. Nicknamed King Otto II, he has not proved low on confidence. It has been alleged that he told the Greece players after the quarter final win over France that the victory was the result of his own leadership. When confronted with that he responded by telling the accusing journalist: If you were a real man, you would tell me who your mole is.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

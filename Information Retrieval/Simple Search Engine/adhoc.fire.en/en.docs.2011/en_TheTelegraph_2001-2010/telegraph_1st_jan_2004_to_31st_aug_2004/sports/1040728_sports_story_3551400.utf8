The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Third straight loss for Md. Sp.
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tarif Ahmed scored the winner Calcutta: It was a match between two sets of strugglers  Mohammedan Sportings glamour club rejects and Tollygunge Agragamis bits and pieces team featuring many unknown faces. The latter showed more enterprise, missed many chances and still came out 1-0 winners in Tuesdays Super Division League encounter at Barasat Stadium. Tarif Ahmed scored the goal in the 51st minute. It was Tollygunge Agragamis second straight win and took their tally to eight from five matches  a big improvement on two points after three outings. For Mohammedan Sporting, it was a third successive defeat, which kept them on three points after four matches and there is little doubt that making it to the Super Six will be a Herculean task for them hereon. It was a shockingly insipid display from the team featuring the likes of Anit Ghosh, Ratan Singh, Naushad Moosa, Jiten Rai and Goutam Ghosh  all of whom represented some top club or the other not too long ago. That experience, however, was never to be seen and defence was the area were Mohammedan Sportings frailties were exposed by one Gouranga Dutta. In his second season with Tollygunge, this youngster kept the Mohammedan Sporting defenders guessing with his ability to hold the ball and dribbling. He also slipped in some dangerous balls that would have delig hted regular striker Akeem Abolanle, who was unavailable because of malaria. Tarif, hardly an able replacement, missed many. The Mohammedan Sporting players were trying to build the game by playing passes among themselves in the first half, but their co-ordination and understanding kept getting worse as the match wore on. Coach Mridul Banerjee admitted that making the Super Six will be tough. With this set of players, its difficult. We need a foreigner in attack. We will have to follow an ultra-cautious method from the next match and ensure a draw at least. Club officials said many of the players have been recruited after consulting the coach. If there is something wrong, the coach is also responsible, said club secretary Sultan Ahmed. However, he ruled out sacking the coach at this juncture. We will support the coach and speak to him and the players at the earliest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rain abandons second ODI
 Anderson takes wicket in comeback match Port-of-Spain, April 24 (Reuters): The second one-day International between the West Indies and England was abandoned as no result after only 16 overs action on Saturday because of torrential rain. The West Indies, trailing the seven-match series 0-1, were 57 for two when the rain came, flooding the Queens Park Oval and putting the third match  scheduled for Sunday  in serious doubt. The game, already reduced to 46 overs-a-side because of heavy rain in the build-up to Saturday, was officially abandoned just before 1 pm local time. The West Indies, after opting to bat first, lost Shivnarine Chanderpaul for three and Chris Gayle for 20 as they slipped to 34 for two. But Ramnaresh Sarwan (11 not out) and Ricardo Powell (eight not out) steadied the innings before rain forced the players off. Chanderpaul, who hit 84 in the first match in Georgetown last weekend, was the first to go. He was snapped up by Chris Read off Steve Harmison. Gayle hit two superb boundaries through the off-side before falling to a well-taken catch by Paul Collingwood in the gully off James Andersons third ball. Anderson was recalled to the England XI, in place of James Kirtley.  Copyright

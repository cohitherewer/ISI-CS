We can beat the Aussies: Sehwag
 Sehwag salutes Sourav for teams good run New Delhi: Virender Sehwag believes India can beat Australia in the home Test series later this year. The dashing opener admits the Australian attack will be stronger than what it was during Indias trip Down Under, but says the Indian batsmen can do anything when in form. Definitely we are on a par with them. If we can go there and beat them on their home ground, definitely we are up there, said Indias only triple centurion. To beat Australia, we have to battle for all five days of a Test. We did that in Adelaide. We hope we can put up a similar fight when they come here, the 25-year-old said. Sehwag said he will take it series by series since several other tournaments are lined up before the Australia series. We are playing the Asia Cup, a tri-series in Holland and the Champions Trophy. I would like to take it series by series. Their attack will be a lot better with four good bowlers in Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee and Shane Warne. But it will depend on the form of our batsmen. Sehwag blamed bad luck for Indias recent ODI defeats against Australia and denied that the world champions enjoyed any psychological advantage. Sehwag credited skipper Sourav Ganguly for the Indian teams transformation into a side that dares to take on the best in the world. The credit for much of it has to go to the captain. The players know that hard work will bear fruit. We have won a lot of matches, and Sourav is the most successful Indian Test captain. It is nice to be part of a successful team. Three years earlier, players would come in and go out. But in the last two years at least, I can say that except for one or two changes the team has remained the same.  (PTI)  Copyright

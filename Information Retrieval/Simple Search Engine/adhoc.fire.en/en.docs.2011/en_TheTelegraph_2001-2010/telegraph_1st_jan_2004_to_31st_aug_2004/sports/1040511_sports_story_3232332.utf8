 Chinese men tame Indonesia 
 - China, Korea, Taiwan storm into womens quarter finals Jakarta: Malaysia cruised into the quarter finals of the Thomas Cup mens team badminton championship with a 5-0 victory over Thailand despite fielding a second-string team. Wong Choong Hann, the worlds number three singles player, made a rare doubles appearance and fourth-ranked doubles pair Choong Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah were both rested. China loosened Indonesias 10-year grip on the Thomas Cup, dousing a fiery reception to take an unbeatable 3-0 lead against the hosts. World No. 1 Lin Dan fought back from 14-16 down in the first game to beat Sony Dwi Kuncoro 17-16 while new-look Indonesian pair Luluk Hadiyanto-Alvent Yulianto were beaten 9-15, 10-15 by second-ranked Cai Yun-Fu Haifeng. Taufik Hidayat was beaten 13-15, 6-15 by big Bao Chunlai, the world No. 4, just hours after the Asian champion was reportedly involved in a scuffle in the stadium car park. Meanwhile, defending champions China, South Korea and Taiwan scored landslide victories Monday to grab spots in the quarter finals of the womens Uber Cup. And former world champion Camilla Martin led Denmark to a 4-1 win over Japan. The Thomas Cup tie Sunday was wrapped up in three matches after world No. 13 Muhammad Hashim Roslin beat Thailand Open champion Boonsak Ponsan and Koo Kien Keat-Chew Choon Eng scored a narrow victory over Pramote Teerawiwatana- Tesana Panvisvas. Lee Chong Wie beat Thirayu Laohathaimongkol 15-12, 15-3 to seal the win. Malaysia will now face either Indonesia or New Zealand in the last eight while Thailand should end up meeting fourth seeds South Korea. South Korea also made it safely into the quarter finals with a convincing 5-0 victory over Germany. Earlier, Japan edged towards the last eight with a hard-fought 3-2 win over England. The closest match yet went down to the wire with Japans re-arranged doubles pairings failing to mix it with their heralded opponents.  Japans singles players made the difference, world No. 28 Sho Sasaki seeing off 78th-ranked Nicholas Kidd in the final game to set up a likely knock-out match against debutantes South Africa. In the Uber Cup hosts Indonesia stumbled to their second loss. South African women picked up their first-ever Uber Cup game, courtesy a withdrawal by Germanys Juliane Shenk from the last doubles rubber.  However, the match had already been decided with Germany winning the first four games. World No. 1 Ruina Gong led China to a 5-0 victory over The Netherlands who on Sunday upset three-time champions and hosts Indonesia.  (AFP)  Copyright

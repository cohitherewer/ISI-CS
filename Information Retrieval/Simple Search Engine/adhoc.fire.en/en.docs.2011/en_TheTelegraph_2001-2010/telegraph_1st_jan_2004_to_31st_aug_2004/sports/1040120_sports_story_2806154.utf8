 Nigel Short takes title, Thipsay third
 Thipsay put up a good show Mumbai: Top seed GM Nigel Short of England won the Commonwealth chess championship with a win over Indian GM P. Harikrishna in the ninth and final round on Sunday. Since the championship incorporated an international open, the overall title was won by second seed GM Smirnov Pavel of Russia, who tallied 7.5 points  the same as Short. Pavel could not win the crown as he does not belong to a Commonwealth country. Koneru Humpy added another feather to her cap by winning the womens crown for the first time. She dethroned S. Vijayalakshmi who had to be content with the silver this time. The silver in the mens section went to GM Niaz Murshed of Bangladesh who put up a sterling show to beat GM Sergey Iskusnyh of Russia in the last round. Murshed finished with seven points. Indian hopes of gold in the mens section were dashed after seasoned GM Praveen Thipsay went down fighting to Smirnov. Thipsay, gold medallist in 1985, got the bronze for his superlative effort. Medals in the mens section apart, the championship turned out to be very productive for the norm seekers. S. Meenakshi earned the distinction of becoming the fifth Indian WGM, 14-year-old D. Harika added to the list by bagging her final norm. Harika is now the youngest ever girl in the country to become a WGM. The Andhra prodigy bettered the record of Humpy by more than a year. Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury and M.R. Venkatesh completed the formalities of their final IM norm and will now become next two IMs of the country. Getting their second IM norms were Abhijeet Gupta and R.R. Laxman while K. Ratnakaran got his first.  (PTI)  Copyright

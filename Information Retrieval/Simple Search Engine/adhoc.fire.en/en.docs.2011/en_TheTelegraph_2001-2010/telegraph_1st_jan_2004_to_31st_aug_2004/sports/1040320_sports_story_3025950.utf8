The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Star parade by Ethiopia
 Kenenisa Bekele will attempt a third consecutive double at the IAAF cross-country world meet in Belgium Brussels: Ethiopia, stricken by poverty, war and famine, is still able to parade an array of supreme distance runners this weekend at the last major international championships before the Athens Olympics. World 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele, the only man to win the world long- and short-course cross-country titles, attempts a third consecutive double at the hilly Parc of Laeken. His teammate Werknesh Kidane, the world 10,000 silver medallist, has entered both the womens events in the two-day championships. Four other Ethiopians have been selected over both distances although a final decision on the team will not be made until Friday evening. Ethiopia, Africas oldest independent country, is enjoying a golden age in athletics comparable with any in its illustrious history since Abebe Bikila became the first African to win an Olympic title with his marathon title at the 1960 Rome Games. Bekele led an Ethiopian clean sweep in the 10,000m at last years Paris world championships, beating the incomparable Haile Gebrselassie into second place. Kidane finished second to compatriot Berhane Adere in the womens 10,000 while 19-year-old Tirunesh Dibaba won the 5,000. The level of the Ethiopian track achievement was such that the north Africans finished third in the overall medals table behind the might of the United States and Russia. Kidanes chances of two titles were enhanced on Thursday by the withdrawal through injury of Britains world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe. Radcliffe, the 2001 and 2002 long-course champion, had planned to double up in Brussels. Dibaba will run in Saturdays long-course eight-km race the day before her sister Ejigayehu competes in the four-km event. The pair were inspired to take up athletics after the achievements of their cousin Derartu Tulu, the first black African woman to win an Olympic title with her triumph in the 10,000m at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Tulu, now 34, went on to win three cross-country titles and the 2000 Sydney 10,000 gold followed by the London Marathon in the following year. She plans to defend her 10,000m title in Athens in August and will run the long-course event in Brussels. Bekele, 21, who also picked up a silver medal in the 5,000m in Paris, has shown he is in prime form this year with a world indoor 5,000m record in Birmingham, England, last month. I am ready to run and win both medals in Brussels, he said.Kenenisa is ready for everyone and he does not prepare for individuals. In Lausanne last year, Ethiopia won four of the six individual gold medals and two of the team titles and, as usual, their main opposition in the team events will come from the Kenyans.

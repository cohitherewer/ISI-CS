Like goalscorer Traianos Dellas, whose header beat the Czech Republic in extra time of Thursdays semi-final, many Greeks saw the hand of God in their sides win. God was on our side, said 84-year-old Jenny Dekanika.I thank him for letting me live long enough to see this day. In what has become a twice-a-week ritual as Greece has cut down more fancied opponents, Athens, as well as towns, villages and islands throughout the nation of 10 million, burst into fireworks, noise and Greek dancing. With each win, the celebrations have become larger, louder and more exuberant. Greece had never won a game at a major tournament before Euro 2004. An hour after the game ended, more than 100,000 people had descended on Athens central Omonia Square where a giant television screen had been erected. Prime Minister Costast Karamanlis announced he would travel to Lisbon to watch Sundays final between Greece and Portugal. Get out on the streets everyone and celebrate. This is our time, radio announcers urged listeners. The celebrations spread far beyond Greece to the Greek diaspora which is one of the most extensive in the world. On the Greek part of Cyprus, Cypriots claimed the victory as their own. Were all Greeks in our hearts, said bank employee Mario Paplou in the islands capital of Nicosia. About 4,000 Greek fans, gathered in front of a giant television screen in the centre of Berlin, went beserk when the goal was scored. No, its not Athens, its Berlin, German TV commentator Johannes Kerner assured viewers as the square became a sea of Greek flags. In Sydney, thousands of Greek fans celebrated by stopping the traffic in the inner city suburbs of Leichardt and Enmore in Sydney on Friday morning. Down in Enmore Road in front of the theatre, were still celebrating, but the police want us to move, a fan, Andy Paschaladis, told Australian television. But how do you move a group of people who want to celebrate? Its a great day for the Greek footballers and the Greek people. In Melbourne, fans cried tears of joy and let off flares in the city streets. We just went crazy, Greek fan Peter was quoted as saying by Australian Associated Press. We turned the place upside down. Everyone just cant believe it. Everyone jumped up and down.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

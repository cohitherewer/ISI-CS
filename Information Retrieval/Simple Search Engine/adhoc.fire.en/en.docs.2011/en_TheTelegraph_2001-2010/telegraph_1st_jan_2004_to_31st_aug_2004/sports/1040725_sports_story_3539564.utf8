 Hunter should be prosecuted: Jones lawyers
San Francisco, July 24 (Reuters): Lawyers for Olympic track champion Marion Jones said on Friday that her ex-husband C.J. Hunter should be prosecuted for lying to federal officials following reports that he told them Jones had used steroids at the 2000 Sydney Games. Since C.J. Hunter has lied to government officials, he also needs to be investigated, be subjected to a polygraph investigation and prosecuted for lying to federal investigators, her attorney Joseph Burton said. Several California newspapers reported that former shot putter Hunter, who was banned for using steroids and who was divorced from Jones in 2002, made the allegations to investigators probing the BALCO steroids scandal. A person answering the phone at Hunters North Carolina home referred questions to his attorney, who in turn did not respond to requests for comment.  Copyright

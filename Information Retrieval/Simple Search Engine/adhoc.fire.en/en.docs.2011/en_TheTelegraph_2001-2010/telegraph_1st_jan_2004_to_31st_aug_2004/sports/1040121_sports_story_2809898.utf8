The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004  Bharath has way with fillies 
 BY STAR RACER The RCTC Bookmakers took the beating  on successive Saturdays but racegoers were happy on each  ocassion, and so were Singh brothers  Bharath And Vijay.  If Vijay ruled the January 10 race-card when he saddled  five winners, Bharath matched his kins score in equal measure  exactly a week later.				 										Four of Bharaths five winners were ring favourites. But the victory of his hottest fancy, Evangeline, in the afternoons feature event, the 1,200m HSBC Cup, did not please the purists who had expected the Excaliburs Lake-Glowing Tribute daughter to triumph handsomely. The monsoon season Fillies Stakes winner was stretched to the fullest by the topweighted Network who, at more favourite terms, was outclassed by her in their previous clash on the New Years Day. 				 										The trainer, however, was all praise for Evangelines courage and talent because the four-year-old had delivered when required  winning four of her five starts during the nine-week old season.				 										Evangeline is likely to be rested for a little while before she starts her preparations for the more arduous journey towards the west.				 										Bharath appears to have a way to mould weaker sex into champions as four of his five winners belonged to that category. Blue Chip, a five-year-old mare, for instance, was just about an ordinary galloper till the other day. The Bharath-touch transformed the Metal Precieux-In The Blue daughter into a Class II winner. Although, she was pressed by Compassionate and the monsoon Derby winner, Accuser, in the final stages of the race, yet at the wire, she had a shade under a length to spare to the former in the 2,200m Pearson Surita Memorial Cup.				 										Bharaths baby race debutant, Sparkling Clear, was also a fluent winner of the 1,100m Strings Of Pearl Plate, though the Flitch-Million Star daughter beat another first timer in Make A Wish, a Daniel David-trainee. Daniels Royal Bounty was a promising third after losing some ground at the start.				 										The official verdict of half-a-length recorded by Bharaths Rock Music, in the 1,400m T. N. Banerjea Cup, may flatter the efforts of Daniels second placed filly, Queen Of The Nile. C. Alford just needed to use hands and heels to make the four-year-old filly  by Inner City out of Music In Motion  stretch.				 										Akebono, who had come with a late run to finish close to Destiny Dance and Devasva in his last start, took the measure of Moon Quest to complete Bharaths days tally.

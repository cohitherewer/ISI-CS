The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. escape with draw
 - SUPER DIVISION 
- Lathicharge to control fans and officials after match vs George  A STAFF REPORTER  Stanley Festus exults after Mohammedan Sportings equaliser against George Telegraph at Howrah Stadium on Monday. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Even a win in the previous match, after four consecutive defeats, failed to inspire Mohammedan Sporting as they escaped with a 1-1 verdict against George Telegraph in a CFL Super Division match at Howrah Municipal Stadium on Monday. Nigerian M.C. Francis put George Telegraph ahead three minutes before the breather. Mridul Banerjees team then had to survive more onslaughts from the opposite end before equalising through a fortuitous goal deep into the second half. The draw took George Telegraph to 15 points from nine matches while Mohammedan Sporting crawled to seven after as many outings. The black-and-white brigade, though, started promisingly, with new foreign recruit Stanley Festus making debut as Raman Vijayans partner up front. In the 20th minute, Danny Muniaos corner was initially parried by George Telegraph goalkeeper Ganesh Singh. Right-back Bidesh Pal sent in a deep cross, Festus headed it back to the box, but Vijayans weak header from close went straight to Singh. Mohammedan Sportings early sparkles died towards the end of the first half and George Telegraph took the lead. Goalkeeper Chinmoy Banerjee missed Ashok Das right-flank cross, only to see the ball go in from the far corner. The referee Ashish Chakraborty awarded the goal to Francis, but defender Michael Ajayi looked like forcing it in while trying to clear the danger. Mohammedan Sporting survived a George Telegraph counter-attack when Francis, fed brilliantly by fellow Nigerian W.T. Sunday, was off the target with only Chinmoy to beat. Then came Naushad Moosahs long throw into the George Telegraph box in the 79th minute. When Singh failed it to grab it, Shyam Mondals attempted clearance took a deflection off Festus legs and went in. The match, incidentally, kicked off about 14 minutes after the scheduled time as both teams jerseys looked similar. Mohammedan Sporting lost the toss to change their attire, but in a good gesture, George Telegraph came in a new dress. It was beyond understanding how some Mohammedan Sporting officials could not reciprocate such gesture by sportingly accepting the result as they abused the referee after the match.

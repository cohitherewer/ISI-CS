 Harbhajan, Nehra down with viral 
 - Wright wants batsmen to hit cruise button straightaway  Harbhajan has been severely weakened Amsterdam: Team India are facing a fitness crisis ahead of the tri-series meet, also involving world champions Australia and Pakistan, as two of their frontline bowlers were running high temperature. Harbhajan Singh and Ashish Nehra are down with viral fever and could not accompany the team to the practice session on Thursday morning. Ashish is particularly bad and he is completely laid up in the bed, remarked physio Andrew Leipus, who himself is battling with throat congestion and stayed back from practice to arrange for the doctor and medical help for the cricketers. I am completely bereft of any strength in my frame, commented Harbhajan. Its difficult to even be on my legs, he added. Leipus, however, was satisfied with the progress V.V.S. Laxman has made on his bruised knee. The swelling has subsided completely and V.V.S. has recovered well, said Leipus. Meanwhile, coach John Wright hopes his top order batsmen shed their lethargic form of the Asia Cup and hit the cruise button straight away in this meet, beginning on Saturday. The first 15 overs are critical. We didnt play the first 15 overs as well as we could have (in the Asia Cup), remarked Wright, as he took the side to Utrecht for an unscheduled practice session. We have guys like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Sourav Ganguly and Laxman and generally when they explode, there is no problem with the scoring rate, he said. Indias practice session was brought forward in this neighbouring city of Amsterdam as the Pakistanis cooled their heels in frustration owing to the non-arrival of their kit. For any side to have wickets in the final 10 overs is important. If anything, we now have more depth in the batting with (Ajit) Agarkar back and (Irfan) Pathan showing promise, he said. The New Zealander conceded that, though flexibility is important in one-day cricket, it doesnt imply the team needs to shuffle batting order to maximise its potential. Indians could have a wicket to their liking in Amstelveen where the authorities are trying to produce a flat pitch.  The short boundaries will help AfridiAfridi in key role Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, meanwhile, intends to use the flamboyant Shahid Afridi strategically in the competition. Afridi knows about his role and he and Salman Butt have been told clearly what their roles are going to be, said Woolmer as his team prepared to build its reputation afresh. Afridi has a splendid record against India and is one of the most powerful hitters in world cricket  a fact, which would come handy on a short VRA Ground during the competition. Woolmer sees an important role for Afridi, given the fact India have a pace attack which pitches the ball up, an advantage otherwise but which could be a handicap on short boundaries of the ground. The coach also wants to send the 12th man with a walkie-talkie on the field from now on. (PTI)  Copyright

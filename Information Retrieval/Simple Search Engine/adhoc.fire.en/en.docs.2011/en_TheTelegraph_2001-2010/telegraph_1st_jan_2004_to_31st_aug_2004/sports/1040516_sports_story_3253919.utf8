The Telegraph - Calcutta
 1st round ends
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  A survey car on arrival at the Kidderpore dock Calcutta, May 15: The first circuit has been completed. The survey team returned some time back, and now the cars are here, released on Saturday from the Netaji Subhas Dock where they had been delivered by ship. And, despite the change in order at the Centre, the inaugural India-Asean Car Rally is rolling on its way. The three Indian cars  a Mahindra Scorpio, a Tata Safari and a Toyota Qualis  endured tough driving through over 5,000 km in five countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand) after leaving India, and though there were some power problems, the general report talks about the cars actually behaving in a very mature manner, according to rally commission chairman Rajat Majumdar. This was the first time that any car has travelled the entire landmass to the Pacific Ocean from the Indian sub-continent and topped it with endurance performance. Majumdar and his team have picked up route charts with GPRS systems and a fine-tuned rally route will now be put in place, especially with the huge stretches of non-metalled surfaces that Myanmar presents (not to talk about the thrill of driving through insurgency-hit areas). The basic idea of the rally is akin to the London-Sydney touring rally, in a mixture with the Paris-Dakar. The rally itself, scheduled for November, is expected to have several cars from different auto manufacturers and the general consensus reached is that SUVs would be the preferred vehicle.  Copyright

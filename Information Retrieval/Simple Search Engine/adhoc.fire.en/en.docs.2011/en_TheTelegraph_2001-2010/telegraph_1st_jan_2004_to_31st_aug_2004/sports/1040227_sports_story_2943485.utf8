 India storm into semis
 - Dhawan (146), Karthik (70 n.o.) help team canter to 54-run win over Lanka  Indias Shikhar Dhawan en route to his 146 as Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Gihan de Sliva looks on in Dhaka on Thursday. (AFP) Dhaka: India stormed into the semi-finals of the ICC under-19 World Cup, beating Sri Lanka comfortably by 54 runs in their Super League match at the Bangabandhu Stadium on Thursday. A brilliant Shikhar Dhawans 146 and a swashbuckling 70 from wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik helped India put up a formidable 316 in 50 overs. In reply, Sri Lankans got off to positive start, fetching 83 runs off just 10.1 overs in the opening stand. But the ask was always steep for the Lankans and they lost wickets at regular intervals in a bid to keep the momentum going. They finally crumbled at 262 in 46 overs. India play the winners of New Zealand and Zimbabwe match in the semi-final on Sunday. India suffered early blows when Ambati Rayudu opted to bat first. But the Indian captain was dismissed for one leaving his team reeling under three for 39 runs in 8 overs. But Dhawan was confidence and character personified on the other hand. After a couple of failures, he shot back into his supreme form to post his third century in the tournament. He and Suresh Raina (54) stitched together 134 runs to take the sail away from Sri Lankas early offensives. Rainas departure led to the introduction of Karthik at the crease. The young wicketkeeper simply blew the Sri Lankan attack with a brilliant display of strokeplay. Karthiks 70 came off just 39 balls, including six hits to the fence and four over-boundaries. Dhawans innings, on the other hand, included 136 balls and was studded with 19 fours and a couple of hits over the rope. The Dhawan-Karthik association for the fifth wicket was worth 115 runs before the former was run out in the 48th over. The Lankans began their chase at a fiery pace, Harsha Vithana and Upul Tharanga taking the battle back to the Indian camp. Left handed Tharangas 61 came off 42 balls and contained 10 fours and a six while right hander Vithana made a sedate 37 from 56 balls. But Rudra Pratap Singh gave the Indians the breakthrough when he castled Tharanga and soon the floodgates opened. The rout started in the 23rd over with Rayudu removing G. De Silva, and the Lanka lions faltered from a healthy 142 for two to be all out in 46 overs. Praveen Gupta picked three for 25 while Rayudu grabbed two for 47.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

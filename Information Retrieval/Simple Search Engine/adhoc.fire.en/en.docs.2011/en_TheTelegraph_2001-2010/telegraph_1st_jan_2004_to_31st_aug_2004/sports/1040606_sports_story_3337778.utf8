		 Sunday, June 06, 2004  Fallon does it again 
 Kieren FallonEpsom, June 5: North Light, the 7-2 joint favourite ridden by Kieren Fallon for trainer Michael Stoute, galloped to a one and a half length success in the Epsom Derby on today. It was a remarkable classic double for the jockey and trainer who won the Derby a year ago on Kris Kin.				 										Second place in the 14-strong field went to Rule of Law (20-1) with Let the Lion Roar (14-1) in third.				 										The result was a huge disappointment for former champion Frankie Dettori who was riding the other 7-2 joint favourite Snow Ridge for the Godolphin stable but finished in mid-division.				 										Dettori has still to win the Derby after 12 unsuccessful attempts.But it was a second classic victory in the space of 24 hours for Fallon who captured the Epsom Oaks on Friday on Ouija Board. The filly won by seven lengths. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 France to go for the jugular vs Croatia
 - Captain Desailly hints at return today  A victory will give Santini the option of resting Zidane before the quarters Santo Tirso: France coach Jacques Santini knows victory in their second Euro 2004 match against Croatia on Thursday would allow him the luxury of resting key players for their final group game. Zinedine Zidanes injury-time double against England got the champions off to a dramatic winning start on Sunday and another three points against Croatia would put Santinis team through to the quarter finals from group B. With a success on Thursday, we will be through, he said. Its what the figures say. As Croatia and Switzerland drew in their first match, only one of them can make seven points at best. With six, we are qualified. Santini believes if France are to retain their title he will have to rest players like Zidane and Robert Pires for at least one match and the energy-sapping win over England adds weight to that argument. He is unlikely to make any changes to his starting team for the Croatia match, with midfielder Claude Makelele expected to shake off a minor shoulder injury. Meanwhile, France captain Marcel Desailly has fully recovered from a knee injury and could return against Croatia. The 35-year-old libero twisted his right knee against Brazil last month and was left out of the match against England. Asked if he would play in Leiria on Thursday, Desailly said: The answer is more yes than no even if it still can be no. Its up to the coach, he is the one in charge. Croatia looked ordinary against Switzerland, drawing 0-0, but Santini is expecting them to provide a formidable barrier to his French playmakers. Croatia have made it clear they would be delighted with a point against the French, and Baric is already casting his mind ahead to the potentially decisive match against England. With several of his players on yellow cards, Baric could also change his team to avoid suspensions. Striker Dado Prso may be the one to miss out as Baric will want him upfront against England.

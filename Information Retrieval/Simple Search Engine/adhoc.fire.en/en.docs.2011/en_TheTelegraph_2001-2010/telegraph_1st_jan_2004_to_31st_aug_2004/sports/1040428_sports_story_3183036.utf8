				 																																	Lausanne: Olympic authorities have announced they have taken out insurance cover of $170 million (143 million euros) in case the Athens Games are called off in August. 				 																																	The IOC said in a statement that a similar policy would be taken out for the 2006 Turin Winter Games, 2008 Beijing Games and 2010 Vancouver Winter Games. It is the first time in the history of the Olympics that the IOC has taken out insurance cover. The move is part of IOC president Jacques Rogges plans to shore up finances should an Olympics be cancelled. He said cover for full and partial cancellation of the August 13-29 Games had been signed with a syndicate of London insurance companies. The policy covers terrorism, earthquake, flooding and landslides. 				 																																	London: Chelsea have appealed against captain Marcel Desaillys three-match ban for elbowing Monacos Fernando Morientes during their Champions League semi-final last Tuesday. The appeal will be heard by European soccers governing body Uefa on Friday and the result known before Chelseas home leg with Monaco on May 5, the club said on their website. The 35-year-old France captains ban was based on video evidence as referee Urs Meier did not see the incident, during the match which Monaco won 3-1.				 																																	The London side said another Chelsea defender, Robert Huth, also faced a ban after the English FA requested video footage of a clash between the young German and striker Alan Shearer towards the end of a premier league game last Sunday.				 																																	Berlin: Fifa president Sepp Blatter has proposed scrapping draws in soccer, saying every game should have a winner. In an idea that would revolutionise the worlds most popular sport if adopted, Blatter suggested that games could be decided by a penalty shoot-out in the case of a draw. Every game should have a winner, Blatter, president of soccers ruling body, told German sports news agency SID. When you play cards or any other game, theres always a winner and a loser. We should have the courage to introduce a final decision in every game of football.

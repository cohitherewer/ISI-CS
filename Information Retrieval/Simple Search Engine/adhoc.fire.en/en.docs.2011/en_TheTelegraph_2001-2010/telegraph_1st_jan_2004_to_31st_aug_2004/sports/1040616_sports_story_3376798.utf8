 Agassi to skip Big W
 - 1992 champion hopes to return next year  Agassi has been suffering from a hip injury London: Andre Agassi has pulled out of Wimbledon which starts next week for the first time since 1997 because of a lingering hip problem. I have been struggling with a hip injury for the past couple of months and in my preparation for Wimbledon realised the injury was only worsened by the nature of the surface and would prevent me from competing, he said in a statement. But the 1992 champion ruled out suggestions he was near the end of his career. My hope and plans are to see you next year, the 34-year-old added. There is growing speculation that the eight-time Grand Slam champion will retire at the end of the 2004 season. His last Grand Slam win came at the Australian Open in 2003, and he has not won an ATP title for 16 months. His next tournament would be the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles which starts July 12. He won his first major in 1992 at Wimbledon. He lost to Pete Sampras in the final in 1999 and reached the semi-finals three other times. Last year, he lost in the fourth round to Mark Philippoussis of Australia in five sets. Agassi, 34 in April, appeared to have every intention of playing Wimbledon when he took a wild card for last weeks Queens Club tournament where he lost in the first round to 60th-ranked Igor Andreev of Russia on his grass court debut. He has lost in his opening match in his last three tournaments. He sat out almost the entire European claycourt season, except for one small event in Austria, and then lost in the first round to little-known Jerome Haehnel of France at Roland Garros. Wimbledonhas already lost the top two women players, Belgians Justine Henin-Hardenne because of a virus and Kim Clijsters with a left wrist injury. Gustavo Kuerten and Gaston Gaudio of Argentina pulled out last week because of injuries. (AFP)  Copyright

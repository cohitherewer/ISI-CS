 Villarreal, Valencia in semis clash
London: European debutants Villarreal set up an all-Spanish Uefa Cup semi-final with regional rivals Valencia after ending Celtics bid to reach successive finals on Wednesday. Goals from Sonny Anderson and Roger gave Villarreal, who qualified for the competition via the Intertoto Cup last July, a 2-0 quarter-final second leg win over the Scottish side at El Madrigal to secure a 3-1 aggregate success. For us to meet Valencia in the semis is a really important step for a club like ours, said Villarreal coach Francisco Paquito Garcia. I was a player at Valencia and hold the club close to my heart but now Im with Villarreal and, of course, I want them to win. The club has never made a semi-final like this in its history and were going to make sure we enjoy it and at the same time make life as difficult as possible for Valencia. Primera Liga leaders Valencia, Champions League runners-up in 2000 and 2001, booked their place in the last four by easing past Girondins Bordeaux 2-1 at home to go through 4-2 overall. Former European champions Olympique Marseille will play Englands Newcastle United in the other semi-final. A second-half goal from Camel Meriem handed Marseille a 1-0 victory over three-times winners Inter Milan at the San Siro to seal a 2-0 passage. It was Inters first defeat against French opposition in 10 European ties and leaves Italy without a representative in the semi-finals of either of the two European club competitions. Newcastle, who last tasted European success in 1969 when they lifted the Fairs Cup, the forerunner to the Uefa Cup, sunk PSV Eindhoven 2-1 at St James Park to go through 3-2 over the two legs. Villarreal kept up their record of not conceding a goal at home in their first season in European competition by shutting out Celtic who lost last years final to Porto.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

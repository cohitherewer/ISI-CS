The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rohan eagerly awaiting dads tips
 - Junior Gavaskar in ODI XVI Down Under  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rohan will consult Devang Gandhi Calcutta, Jan. 3: He had left his Mumbai home some eight seasons back with one dream  making it to the senior India team. And finally it has come true. Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar will board the flight to Australia to represent India in the forthcoming tri-series. Friends from all parts are calling him, but the one man he is dying to talk to is his father, the great Sunil Manohar Gavaskar. Its too late in Australia now. I couldnt communicate the good news to my father, an excited Rohan told The Telegraph on Saturday evening from Jamshedpur, where he is with the Bengal team for the East Zone one-dayers. There are quite a few things I would like to ask my father before I take guard, Rohan. His tips will surely come good Any specific area of the game he wants to discuss with Sunny? Its difficult to pinpoint right now But one things for sure, come what may, I will play my natural game, the left-hander said. Rohan will join the Indian squad as the 16th member after Mohammed Kaif was excluded with an injured finger. He is likely to leave India on Monday for the one-dayers which get off on Friday. Before he leaves for Australia, Rohan wants to have a session with Devang Gandhi, who was there with the Indian team which toured Down Under in 1999-2000. Incidentally, Devang will take charge of the Bengal team once Rohan leaves. Devang has always been a big help I would surely talk to him once more before I leave. However, Rohan is not very sure how many chances he will get. Ive to utilise whatever chance comes my way, he added. The fact that Sourav Ganguly will be there in Australia will be a big boost. Obviously, dadas tips are something Im looking forward to. Was he expecting a call? See, Ive been performing quite regularly. It wasnt, therefore, too much of a surprise. Elaborating on his performances, Rohan said: I played well in England for India A. Then the Challenger Trophy and the Test series against Sri Lanka A were also quite satisfactory. Rohan informed he has been congratulated by each of his Bengal teammates after getting the good news from a CAB official. They have all been so supportive I owe a lot to them, he said. And the gutsy cricketer promised he will do his best to fulfil the expectations of all those who have helped him so far. I want to perform for each of them, Rohan signed off. Our Special Correspondent in Sydney adds: While its not clear whether the team management was consulted over Kaifs replacement, The Telegraphs sources have indicated that the thinktank specifically asked for a medium pacer. No name, however, was suggested.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Penalty corner rule changed
New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): Changes in the execution of a penalty corner in hockey, to maintain the spirit of fair play, will come into effect from June 1 for all international matches, the FIH announced. The change is in time for this years Olympics. The change addresses a situation where a defender runs directly into the line of a goalbound shot with the clear intention of allowing himself to be hit. Currently, this may lead to the shot being blocked or in a free hit for the defending team. Umpires will be instructed to penalise a defender who runs at a legitimate shot at goal during a penalty corner with the clear intention of blocking the shot with his body. The defender will be cautioned and another penalty corner will be awarded to the attacking team. If the practice persists, awarding a penalty stroke and/or suspending the defender will be considered by the umpires. A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Olympic gold medallist, former skipper and national selector Gurbux Singh reacted strongly to this change and said that the sudden introduction of the rule change was unfair. This is unfortunate, because this will give an unfair advantage to the attacking team, Gurbux told The Telegraph Saturday. This will make defending penalty corners more difficult. It will create several problems, said Gurbux, in how the umpire interprets the intention of any onrushing defender. There will always be this margin of difference between the legitimate and the illegal charge and the umpire seems to have a rather wide berth. The current rule says that if the shot from a penalty corner strikes an onrushing defender below the knee the penalty corner is re-taken. Anything above the knee results in a free-hit against the attacking team. That will not stay.  Copyright

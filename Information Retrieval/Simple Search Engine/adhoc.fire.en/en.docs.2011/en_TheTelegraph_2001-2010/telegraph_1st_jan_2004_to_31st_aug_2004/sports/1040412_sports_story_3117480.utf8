 Harbhajan wants county stint
 Harbhajan (seen tuning up in Jalandhar on Sunday) says he has recovered fully Jalandhar: Harbhajan Singh said on Sunday he wants to play in the County Championship in England to get back his bowling rhythm before joining the Indian team. The off-spinner suffered a finger injury in his bowling arm during the first Test in Australia last year, which needed a surgery, and has not played since. I have totally recovered but to get back my full rhythm, I will play county cricket in England before joining the Indian team, said Harbhajan, adding that he has conveyed his willingness to authorities concerned in England. Harbhajan went to England last year to play for Lancashire, but his stay there was cut short by the finger injury. I have started bowling 10-12 overs at a stretch, and will double the work load next week. But to get fit to join the Indian squad, I should be able to bowl at least 35 overs continuously which I used to bowl before my injury. I would like to play as many tournaments as possible, including county cricket and the Indian Airlines tournament to be held in Delhi shortly, he added.  Support for Murali Harbhajan said allegations of chucking against Muttiah Muralidharan were unfortunate. He said Murali should not be accused of chucking without conclusive evidence. Making allegations of chucking against the worlds top spinner, that too when he has already taken more than 500 Test wickets, can really disturb the player who still has a lot of cricket ahead of him. I can very well understand the mental state of a player against whom such a charge is made. The player cannot concentrate and perform, said Harbhajan, whose action had also come under scrutiny. Murali has played the game for years now. On one hand you refer to him as a legend and on the other you pressurise the player by making charges against him.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stephen for junior teams, always
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Stephen Constantine has a suggestion for the AIFF: always send the junior national team to compete in the SAF Games. The standard in the SAF Games is not too high we should be sending the juniors rather than the senior team, the chief coach of the Indian football teams said on Wednesday. He was in the VIP stands of the Salt Lake Stadium, watching the Dempo versus Tollygunge Agragami game with East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick. This time, of course, theres no option but to send a junior team to the SAF Games as it clashes with Indias World Cup qualifying tie against Oman (April 4). Islamabad hosts the SAF Games from March 29 to April 7. Constantine said he is yet to get a video cassette of the Oman team. Neither has he received footage of Indias matches in last years Afro-Asian Games.  Copyright

 Sasikiran eases into second spot
 - MOSCOW CHESS 
- Filippov emerges sole leader  Sasikiran beat Markowski Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran scored his third win on the trot (this time over GM Tomasz Markowski of Poland) to elevate himself to the joint second position after the seventh round of the A group of the Aeroflot international open chess tournament here. GM Valerij Filippov of Russia emerged the sole leader on six points out of a possible seven when he turned the tables on compatriot Alexander Rustemov in his seventh round board Monday. With two more rounds to go, seven players including Sasikiran share the second spot with 5.5 points apiece. The other six following Filippov were Fernec Berkes of Hungary, Joel Lautier of France, Dutchamn Loek van Wely, Russians Pavel Tregubov, Alexander Motylev and second seed Alexey Dreev. There was more good news for Indian players in the group B section as P. Konguvel shot in to joint third spot with his sixth successive victory in the event. Konguvel accounted for Vitaly Kunin of Russia and took his tally to 6.5 points from eight games played so far. Russians Dzhakaev Dzhakay and Anatoli Shvedchikov, who both have seven points each to their credit, now share the lead in this section. Konguvel is on their toes along with five others. International master Lanka Ravis aspiration to become a GM suffered a further setback as he lost his second game in a row, going down to GM Vasily Yemelin of Russia, who played white. In the other games involving Indians in the A group, IM Neelotpal Das had little trouble holding Russian Igor Kurnosov, Praveen Thipsay signed peace with Vladimir Belov of Russia and Sandipan Chanda split the point with Chinese Yu Shouteng. In the B group, it was a different story as both IMs Dinesh Kumar and Sudarrajan Kidambi scored sparkling victories over Russian Alexey Feoktistov and Estonian Priit Leito, respectively. Tejas Bakre drew his fifth game in the event, signing truce with Pavel Ponkratov of Russia. Sasikiran played an eventful game against Markowski, who was with black. Sasikiran took his opponent for a long and complicated ride in the middle game with deft manoeuvres aimed at gaining control on both flanks. The Pole was found struggling when it came to putting up correct defence and his position fell apart soon after the endgame surfaced. Markowski resigned in 44 moves. In the lone decisive battle among overnight leaders, Filippov was simply too lucky as he overcame a stiff fight from Rustemov. Rustemov had a commanding position with his queen against rook and a minor piece but failed to make most of the advantage before surrendering after 65 moves.  (PTI)  Copyright

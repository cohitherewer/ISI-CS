The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zidane heaps praise on Barthez
Lisbon: Zinedine Zidane showed David Beckham how to bend it when he conjured up a stunning win in the Stadium of Light on Sunday. His display showed just how much he means to France. The soft-spoken Real Madrid playmaker whose two headers won France the 1998 World Cup final against Brazil, lit up France with two injury-time strikes for a famous win. But the player, who will turn 32 later this month, was typically modest in triumph. Fabien (Barthez) kept us alive. He helped us believe we could still win. That was the turning point, he said of the goalkeepers penalty save to deny David Beckham. Zidane, who scored from a golden goal penalty in the 2002 European championships against Portugal, said Frances big-match experience made the difference. Weve been through this sort of thing before. We had not expected such a hard game but we never gave up. In a game of football its usually a couple of things that decide who wins. Fabien made his save and Titi (Thierry Henry) won the penalty. Frank Lampard said Englands heartbreak defeat to France has made them even more determined to reach the final and play the French again. Lampard said England players were angry to hear the French celebrating after Zidanes injury-time goals. It was a bit harsh, a bit premature and I dont think we would have done the same thing had we won the game. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has claimed that England would have claimed a famous victory over France but for a mistake by German referee Markus Merk. The Liverpool striker was adamant that Mikael Silvestre should have been sent off for pulling down Wayne Rooney to concede a penalty 18 minutes from time that Fabien Barthez brilliantly saved. To be fair to Becks, Barthez pulled off a great save,Owen said. The disappointing thing for us was the fact that Silvestre brought down Wayne in a goalscoring position as the last man and wasnt sent off. Beckham cut a forlorn figure in the England dressing-room after his crucial penalty miss against France, coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said on Monday. If he feels like he doesnt want to take them (penalties), then we will get someone else, but if he feels he is still the best, then he goes on.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Roddick picks up years second title
 - Injured Coria retires after three sets  Andy Roddick after winning the Miami Masters on Sunday Miami: Andy Roddick was handed the Miami Masters title on Sunday after a back injury forced Guillermo Coria to retire with the American leading 6-7, 6-3, 6-1 in the best-of-five-set final. The title is Roddicks second of 2004 and 13th in all. The $533,350 winners cheque takes his career earnings to $5,967,306. Even when Guillermos hurt, hes still faster than 95 per cent of the players on the tour, said Roddick. Its tough to play when youre injured, especially in a big tournament like this. Its a great effort. Argentine Coria sustained the injury at 4-4 in the first set when he felt a sharp pain in his lower back after a rally. He received treatment and massage at the change of ends at 5-6 but continued to struggle. It was excruciating pain and even though I won the first set I knew I wasnt going to be able to finish, said Coria. As the match wore on, he was a shadow of the player who had Roddick on the run in the first set. The American broke the weakened Coria serve at the start of the second set and never looked likely to surrender the advantage. When he broke Coria again at the start of the third, it sealed the Argentines fate. After three sets and just over two hours, Coria admitted defeat. I didnt want to disappoint the crowd any further, said Coria, who faces a race against time to be fit for Argentinas away Davis Cup tie against Belarus, which starts on Friday. I will rest tomorrow and hopefully Ill be ready to go in three or four days, said Coria. I dont want to miss the opportunity to play Davis Cup for Argentina because I missed our last tie against Spain. Teammate David Nalbandian has already been ruled out with an ankle injury. Roddick said of Sundays victory: Any time you win on someone defaulting you feel a little bit fortunate. Its not the picture-perfect ending but at the same time Im still here at the end of the day and that was always my goal. I have been saying for the last few weeks that I needed a big win to put my stamp on this year. This tournament has been really good for me.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

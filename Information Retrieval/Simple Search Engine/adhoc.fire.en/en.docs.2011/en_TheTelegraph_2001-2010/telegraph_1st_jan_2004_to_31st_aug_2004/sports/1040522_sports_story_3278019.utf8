				 																																	Heidelberg: Colin Montgomeries season lay in tatters here Friday after he failed to make the cut in the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open. Needing a good tournament to ensure his place in both the US and British Opens, the latter on his home course of Troon, Scotland, Montgomerie staggered into the clubhouse with a second round, six-over 78 and an early trip home.				 																																	Facing major problems both in his personal life with a divorce in prospect from his wife Eimar and in his professional game which has seen him slump down the world rankings, the 40-year-old came to Germany ranked 50th in the world, the last automatic qualifying spot for the top meets.				 																																	New York: The Ladies Golf Union announced here on Thursday that the womens British Open will break new ground in 2007 when it is played at the Old Course, St Andrews, August 2-5. It will mark the first championship for women professional golfers to be held at the venerable Old Course, which has hosted 26 Open Championships. 				 																																	The LGU announced the move as the World Congress of Womens Golf opened in New York. The womens British Open has only on one occasion been played in Scotland, in 2002, when the winner at Turnberry was Australian Karrie Webb. 				 																																	Paris: Fifa signed a declaration at its centennial congress on Friday, signalling its intent to join up to the world anti-doping code. It did not sign the code itself although Fifa officials said this was a formality. All sports have to sign up to the code if they are to take part in Augusts Olympic Games.				 																																	This is a great day for sport and the fight against doping, said Dick Pound, head of the World Anti-Doping Agency.				 																																	I am sure this marriage between Fifa and WADA will be a long one and produce good.				 																																	Fifa pardoned Cameroon and lifted the six-point sanction imposed for the team wearing a one-piece kit in this years African Nations Cup.				 																																	Hong Kong: American basketball legend Michael Jordan breezed through Hong Kong on Friday, on a brief visit that has seen him spend more time promoting his latest range of trainers than meeting fans. Jordans arrival was greeted by a handful of fans at a press conference where he unveiled his latest branded basketball boots.

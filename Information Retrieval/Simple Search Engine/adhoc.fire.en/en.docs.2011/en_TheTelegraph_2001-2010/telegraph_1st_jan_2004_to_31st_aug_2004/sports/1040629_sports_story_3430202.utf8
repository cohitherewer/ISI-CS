The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 David Beckham is overrated 
Talking Tactics P. K. BanerjeeFour World Cup winners were in the fray when Euro 2004 kicked off just over a fortnight ago and none of them will be in action in the semi-finals. This shows how competitive and cruel the European Championship can be, with the rigours of club football once again taking its toll in a tournament of this nature.Considering the number of unexpected winners this championship has produced over the years, the elimination of France, England, Germany and Italy is not a huge surprise. The last two were not in my list of favourites anyway, because they have not unearthed enough talent in recent years.The impact of club football on the players is being felt, quite like in the World Cup two years ago. Players from the top leagues are not shining as brightly as they are expected to when in national colours, with one or two exceptions. The pressure of those competitions is taking too much out of them.France is the team to have suffered most because of this factor. Their players were fatigued and though they say playing for the country is the biggest motivation, I dont think they were emotionally as charged up. The spring in the steps of Henry and Pires or the authority with which Vieira patrols the midfield for Arsenal was just not visible.I dont think people concerned consider this to be a problem. The commerce of football owes too much to the club structure and the better players will have to reserve their best for their clubs. This is why every edition of the World Cup or European Championship is usually followed by reports of huge offers for new stars.Eriksson delivered while Beckham floppedSadly for Germany and Italy, very few of their players will feature in this sought-after bunch after Euro 2004. These superpowers are still respected because of their strong roots, but it has become hollow above the surface. Other teams have noticed it and dont treat them as heavyweights any more.Of the big ones knocked out, England impressed me the most, though I must add Beckhams showing vindicated my belief that he is an over-rated midfielder. The England captain has admirable control over swing and his crosses, free-kicks and especially the long balls from the deep are most accurate. He can vary the height, curve and dip of the ball like nobody else can and yet, he is more talked about than what he should be. To earn this kind of fame one has to do more than what Beckham is capable of.Erikssons team lost in the quarters once again, but they have every right to believe that they could have gone at least a step further. The Swede doesnt talk aggressively and maintains a suave image, but has quietly taken his team to a respectable height.The biggest surprise this time has come from Greece. Turkey had pulled off a similar coup in the last World Cup, and the performance of these two teams indicates that a time will come when the World Cup and the European Championship will see more of these so-called smaller teams. One reason behind Greeces run of success must be the fact that their players are fitter and more motivated than the big names in the traditionally big teams. They were more fresh, looked keen to do well and were certainly more desperate to do well.This makes it clear that nobody will ever take anything for granted in this championship. Latvias crucial draw against Germany illustrates this point. Euro 2004 may mark the first step towards a future where there will be no favourites and no underdogs. Everybody will start on an equal footing.

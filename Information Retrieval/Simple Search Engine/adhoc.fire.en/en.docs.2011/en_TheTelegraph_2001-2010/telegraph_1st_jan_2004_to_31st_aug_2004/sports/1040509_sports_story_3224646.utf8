 Search on for Maradonas rehab centre 
Buenos Aires, May 8 (AFP): Diego Maradonas family has been trying hard to find a drug rehabilitation centre which will accept the football legend who has come close to death with heart and lung problems. Clarin newspaper reported his ex-wife Claudi Villafane burst into tears while being unable to tell him five Argentine clinics had refused to take him, fearing resistance from Maradona and for the privacy of other patients. Claudia, please tell me whats happening, Maradona asked of Villafane in one of his rare moments of lucidity, according to medical sources quoted by Clarin. Maradona, who was admitted to the Suizo-Argentina clinic on Wednesday having spent 12 days in the same hospital last month, is under sedation in intensive care. Maradona will not hear of going to an Argentine drug rehabilitation centre, preferring to returning to Cuba where it is said he has been fighting his addiction since 2000. Cuban leader Fidel Castro has put a plane at Maradonas disposal should he want to return to the island, according to sources close to the player.  Copyright

 Russian ruins Venus return
Dubai: Venus Williams continued her disappointing start to the year when she suffered a 2-6, 3-6 defeat against Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarter finals of the Dubai Open on Thursday. World No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne took just 48 minutes to sweep aside an ailing Conchita Martinez 6-1, 6-0. Second seed Williams was absent from the Tour after Wimbledon because of injury and has struggled since returning at the Australian Open. She lost there to compatriot Lisa Raymond in the third round, and then won just one match in Tokyo before defaulting her quarter final because of a knee injury.Kuznetsova, 18, used a big forehand, solid serve and strong groundstrokes to keep the American under pressure, and after dropping her serve in the opening game looked the more solid player. The American briefly threatened a comeback, pulling back to 2-3, but made far too many unforced errors and three more consecutive breaks of serve left Kuznetsova serving for the biggest victory of her young career.

 Navratilova in Big W rethink
 Martina Navratilova London: Nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova may not take part in the singles at the all-England club next week after failing to qualify for Eastbourne tournament on Sunday. The body is not working as well as it used to, admitted the 47-year-old who was given a wild card into the main draw of the singles, ten years after her last appearance at Wimbledon. I need to decide whether Ill take that wild card at Wimbledon or not. Ive asked for it but Ill have to see, said Navratilova who has won the title here on 11 occasions since making her debut in 1974. On Sunday, she lost 4-6, 2-6 in the second qualifying round to Russian 29-year-old Elena Likhovtseva. Ive had a bum knee and then my ankle gave out on me in the middle of the game against Likhovtseva. It just got jammed and the trainer fixed it but I have to loosen these bones. Likhovtseva is very good on grass and she passed me as good as anybody, said Navratilova, who won her first round qualifier in two sets against Italys Mara Santangelo, 22, on Saturday. This was the fourth singles event Navratilova has played in 2004 after falling in the main draw first round at Amelia Island, Charleston and Roland Garros. Henman too boring John McEnroe on Monday slammed Tim Henman for being too boring, just a week before the start of the Wimbledown. The former Wimbledon champion, in an interview with the Radio Times magazine, said the current crop of players were robots. He described Henman as the classic example. Get with the fans. They are rooting for you! Respond to them, harness their energy, love them back! If he could do that, Henman could win on grass, McEnroe said. (AFP)  Copyright

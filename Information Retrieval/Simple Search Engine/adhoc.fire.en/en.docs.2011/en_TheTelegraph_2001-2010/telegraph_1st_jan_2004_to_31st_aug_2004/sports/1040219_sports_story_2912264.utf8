 Alok bags grand double
New Delhi: Three-time champion Alok Kumar completed a grand double by thrashing world amateur champion Pankaj Advani 7-1 to win the 70th national snooker championship in Gwalior on Wednesday. Alok defeated Advani 61-43, 93-11, 59-50, 77-70, 40-14, 83-14, 21-65, 70-78, according to information received here. He became the second player to win the billiards and snooker titles in the same tournament after Geet Sethi achieved the feat in 1988. The Punjab cueist followed a safety first approach to frustrate the defending champion, who prefers to play a fast game, and took a 6-0 lead at the break.  (PTI)  Copyright

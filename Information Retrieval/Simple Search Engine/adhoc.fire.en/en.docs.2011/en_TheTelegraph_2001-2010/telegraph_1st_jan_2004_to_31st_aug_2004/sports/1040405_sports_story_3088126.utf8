It is Michael again 
 Michael Schumacher, after winning the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday. (Reuters) Manama (Bahrain): Michael Schumacher celebrated a third win in three races Sunday as Ferrari turned Formula Ones first Grand Prix in the Middle East into a one-two domination in the desert. The six-time world champion raced untroubled from pole position to the chequered flag to add Bahrains debut to a record-breaking list that now runs to 73 wins. While the tiny Gulf kingdom provided novelty and a welcome change of scenery, the result remained the same as the German led his Italian team imperiously to their second formation finish of the year. Schumacher crossed the line 1.367 seconds ahead of Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, runner-up just as he had been in the Australian season-opener, and nearly half a minute clear of the rest after lapping all but six. Briton Jenson Button was third again for BAR after taking the first Grand Prix podium of his career at the last race in Malaysia. It was a really a dream result, said Schumacher after spraying non-alcoholic fizzy fruit juice at his podium rivals instead of the usual champagne, in accordance with local Islamic sensitivities. Ferrari maintained their stranglehold on the constructors championship with 51 points, ahead of Renault on 22 with BAR sharing third place with Williams on 19. Schumacher has 30 points to Barrichellos 21. Italian Jarno Trulli was fourth in a Renault in a race with plenty of overtaking on a surprisingly cool and overcast afternoon with occasional drops of rain. Ferraris old rivals McLaren once again licked their wounds after another miserable weekend. Kimi Raikkonen, the man who took Schumacher down to the wire last season and ended overall runner-up, was the first retirement when his engine blew spectacularly with the race barely started. A sheet of flames erupted from the rear of the car, followed by a column of smoke and steam, as the Finn headed for his third successive retirement. Teammate David Coulthard also retired.

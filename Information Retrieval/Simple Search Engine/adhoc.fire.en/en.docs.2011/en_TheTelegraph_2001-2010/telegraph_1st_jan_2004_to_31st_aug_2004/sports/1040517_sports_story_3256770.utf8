 Jones to sue if kept from Athens
New York: American sprint queen Marion Jones promised a lawsuit here on Sunday if she qualifies for the Athens Olympics and the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) tries to ban her without a positive dope test. Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, has been linked to the BALCO steroid distribution scandal and previously undetectable steroid THG but again denied she has taken improper drugs. She also blasted the notion that the USADA could keep a qualifying athlete from Athens because of non-analytical positives, evidence linking athletes to drugs even though no dope test ever came back positive. For someone to be found guilty or condemned without any form of investigation, I think thats unfair, Jones said. We live in the United States, where you are innocent until proven guilty. If I make the Olympic team, which I plan to, and Im held from the Olympic Games because of something somebody thought, you bet there will be lawsuits. I will not let some organisation take away my livelihood because some organisation had a thought, a hunch, some organisation showing their power. The USADA has received evidence in the BALCO investigation gathered by federal agents, in hopes of uncovering doping cheats who might have escaped tests. Asked if there was any reason to believe there was any evidence in the documents that might lead to her receiving such a ban, Jones replied: At this point, no. She also said she had never been contacted by the USADA.  (AFP)  Copyright

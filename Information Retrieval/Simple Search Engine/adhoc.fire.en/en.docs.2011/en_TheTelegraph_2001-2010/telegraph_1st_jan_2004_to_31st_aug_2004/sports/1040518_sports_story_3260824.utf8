The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Muralis four in Lanka win
 - Visitors humiliate Zimbabwe by an innings to wrap up series 2-0  Muttiah Muralidharan celebrates the dismissal of Tatenda Taibu with keeper Prasanna Jayawardene in Bulawayo on Monday. (Reuters) Harare, May 17 (Reuters): Muttiah Muralidharan took four wickets as Sri Lanka humiliated Zimbabwe by an innings for the second Test in succession on Monday to wrap up the series 2-0. The off-spinner bowled almost without a break from one end to take four for 79 from 28.1 overs as Sri Lanka won the second Test in Bulawayo by an innings and 254 runs an hour after lunch on the fourth day. Zimbabwe, needing 485 to make Sri Lanka bat again, were dismissed for 231, their fate sealed when they lost six wickets for 48 in 14 overs either side of lunch. The result capped a successful tour for Sri Lanka, who won the one-day series 5-0 and won the first Test by an innings and 240 runs, but those successes were achieved against woefully out-classed opponents. After Sri Lankas first innings of 713 for three, the ninth highest total in Test history, the home side had resumed on 44 for two and enjoyed their best session of the series as Brendan Taylor (61) and Dion Ebrahim (42) defended well while taking their chances to score. But seven overs before lunch Taylor attempted to work a delivery from Muralidharan to the leg side and fell to a looping catch taken at silly mid-off by Mahela Jayawardene. Taylor showed grit for his maiden Test half-century. He batted for more than three hours, faced 142 balls and hit six fours and a six, and his dismissal ended a third-wicket stand of 85. In Muralidharans next over captain Tatenda Taibu attempted a defensive stroke and popped a catch to Dilshan Tillakaratne at silly mid-on to be dismissed for a duck. Three overs later Sanath Jayasuriya, bowling his left-arm spin, aimed a delivery at Ebrahims pads and the batsman flicked a catch to Maravan Atapattu at leg slip. Zimbabwes collapse resumed in the fifth over after lunch when Alester Maregwede was trapped in front for 28 by left-arm pace bowler Chaminda Vaas. Vaas struck again three balls later when Mluleki Nkala edged to Tillekaratne Dilshan at third slip to fall for a duck. Next ball Muralidharan trapped Elton Chigumbura in front for 12. No. 10 Tinashe Panyangara scored a breezy 40 not out off 45 balls with six fours to nurse Zimbabwe past 200. Atapattu paid tribute to his bowlers performance on Bulawayos flat wicket after the victory. We played well in both matches, Atapattu told reporters. But we did especially well to bowl Zimbabwe out twice on a wicket as good as this one was, that was a good effort. The pitch was good enough for Atapattu to score 249, while Kumar Sangakkara survived being dropped on nought to score 270. They added 438 for the second wicket.  Copyright

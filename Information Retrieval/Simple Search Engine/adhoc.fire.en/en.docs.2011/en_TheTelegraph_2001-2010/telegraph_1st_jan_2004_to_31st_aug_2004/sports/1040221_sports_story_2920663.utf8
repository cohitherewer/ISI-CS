The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI holds talks with EC
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday informally checked with the Election Commission on the likely dates for the polls so that it does not clash with Indias tour of Pakistan. Jagmohan Dalmiya, BCCI president, said on Friday that the itinerary for the tour (three Tests and five one-dayers) will be announced on Saturday. Dalmiya held a meeting, which lasted for more than four hours, with BCCI joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty and Amrit Mathur, who were part of the delegation that took stock of the security and other aspects in Pakistan earlier this month. The briefing of the delegation members was mainly restricted to logistics and the security aspect, Dalmiya said. He also informed that he spoke to the home and sports ministries during the course of the day apart from the Pakistan Cricket Board officials on finalising the itinerary.  Copyright

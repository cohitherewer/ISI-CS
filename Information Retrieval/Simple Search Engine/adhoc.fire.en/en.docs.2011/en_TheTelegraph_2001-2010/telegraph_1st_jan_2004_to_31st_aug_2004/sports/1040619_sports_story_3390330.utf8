 Shoaib among probables 
 Shoaib Akhtar Islamabad: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) paved the way for controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on Friday, to play in the Asia Cup by naming him in the 26-member probables list for the event to be held in Sri Lanka next month. Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and all-rounder Shahid Afridi have been omitted from the list, which includes a host of youngsters, who helped the country win the under-19 World Cup earlier this year. Shoaib was apparently included after he insisted that he had recovered completely from the injury. Assuring full support to newly-appointed Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has said any player violating the ground rules to be laid down by Woolmer would be punished. We will give Woolmer full authority well make sure he has the stick and powers to implement his decisions on and off the field, Shaharyar said. Meanwhile, Woolmer said his predecessor, Javed Miandad, can still play a role in the development of the team. I know Javed is not a happy man at the moment but I would like his input, Woolmer said in a radio interview. Probables Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Imran Nazir, Inzamam-ul Haq, Yousuf Youhana, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Moin Khan, Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Umar Gul, Kamran Akmal, Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan, Shoaib Akhtar, Danish Kaneria, Younis Khan, Rao Iftikhar, Mohammad Hafeez, Faisal Iqbal, Asim Kamal, Salman Butt, Riaz Afridi, Zahid Saeed, Misbah-ul-Haq, Bazid Khan, Yasir Arafat. Molestation case PCB has declined to take any action against the Karachi-based Test cricketer, who has been accused of sexually molesting a model in Lahore last year. Dismissing the allegations as a private matter, the PCB has asked the player to get his name cleared through a police complaint. Shaharyar said in Karachi that the player had spoken to the board over the matter and claimed that he was being blackmailed by a model and her husband, who have alleged that she was intoxicated and sexually molested by the cricketer last year. We basically look at it as a private matter but we have advised the player to report the matter to the police and get a case registered against the woman and her husband, Shaharyar said.

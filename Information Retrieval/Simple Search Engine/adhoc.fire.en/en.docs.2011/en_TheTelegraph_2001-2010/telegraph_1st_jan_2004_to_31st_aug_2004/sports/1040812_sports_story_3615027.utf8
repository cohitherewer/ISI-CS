 Koreans ping-pong diplomacy 
Athens: Table tennis players from North and South Korea have agreed to hold a joint training session at the Athens Olympics in a symbolic attempt to start burying decades of Cold War rivalry, the Souths team said on Wednesday. For the first time we agreed to have a joint training session, South Korean team manager Shin Bark-jae told a news conference. Politics are far from us as we pursue the Olympic spirit. Athletes from the estranged Korean states were mixing freely in the Olympic village and their table tennis players would practise together on Thursday, Shin said. The following day competitors from the capitalist South and communist North will march together at the Games opening ceremony, repeating their joint arrival at Sydney in 2000 under a special unification flag bearing a map of the peninsula. Technically still at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty, the two states are discussing fielding a joint team for the 2008 Games in nearby Beijing, Shin noted. Wed like to have one team definitely. But so far we have not agreed to anything, he said. In the early 1970s, China and United States used table tennis tournaments as a way to break Cold War ice.

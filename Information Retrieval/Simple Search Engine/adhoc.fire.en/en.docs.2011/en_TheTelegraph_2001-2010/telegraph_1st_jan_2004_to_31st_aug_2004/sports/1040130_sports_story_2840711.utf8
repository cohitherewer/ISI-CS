 AP High Court serves notice to Muthaiah, BCCI
Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh High Court Thursday issued notices to the BCCI and its former president A. C. Muthaiah in an appeal filed by former captain Mohammed Azharuddin against a lower court verdict upholding his ban from Test cricket. The division bench comprising Justice Bilal Nazki and Justice T. Gopala Krishna Wednesday directed Azharuddins counsel to serve the notices personally, so that the appeal could be heard finally on March 9. However, the third additional civil judge, while upholding the ban, held the former skipper could not establish as to how he was subjected to discrimination and how the inquiry conducted by the BCCI was vitiated by arbitrariness or non application of mind.

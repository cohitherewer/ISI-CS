The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly eye win
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Roy has his task cut out Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami resume their battle for survival in the National Football League (NFL) on Wednesday when they take on former leaders Dempo at Salt Lake Stadium. Tollygunge are now in the relegation zone and their battle at the moment is with Mohammedan Sporting, who have 14 points from 14 matches. Tollygunge have 13 from 13 and coach Krishnendu Roy is hoping for a win, which will take them ahead the city rivals for the moment. But he knows that will be a very difficult task. Roy will miss goalkeeper Chinmay Banerjee (injured), defender Kabijit Khotel and medio Jiten Rai (both out with double bookings). All three are regulars and suitable replacements are not easy to come by. But we beat Haywards Sporting in the previous game and that is a big boost, said Roy. That is a significant morale-booster indeed. But Dempo will be a different kettle of fish. The Goans were leading the table after the first phase and have 24 points from 13 games. They have slipped of late, having collected just four points from the last five outings. They too will miss three regulars  medio Samir Naik and defenders Majed Bolaji and Valeriano Rebello. All three are injured. Coach Armando Colaco is drawing confidence from East Bengals recovery after a patchy start. If they can overcome a bad spell, why cant we?  Copyright

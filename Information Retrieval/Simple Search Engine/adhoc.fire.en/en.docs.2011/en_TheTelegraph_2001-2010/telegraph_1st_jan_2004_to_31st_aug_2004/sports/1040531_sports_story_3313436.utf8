 David Toms in big lead
German Town (Memphis): Defending champion David Toms raced to a massive seven-stroke lead Saturday after three rounds of the St Jude Classic. Toms shot a six-under-par 65, his 11th straight round in the 60s, and finished on 18-under 195. PGA Tour rookie Vaughn Taylor, on 202, is the closest to Toms. Taylor, the first-round leader, could manage only an even-par 71 as a 20 mph blew for most of the day.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

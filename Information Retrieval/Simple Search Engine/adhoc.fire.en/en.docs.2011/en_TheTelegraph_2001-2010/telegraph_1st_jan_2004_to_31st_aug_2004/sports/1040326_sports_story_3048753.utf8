The Telegraph - Calcutta
Sourav for third eye on lbw verdicts
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly Dave RichardsonLahore: Sourav Ganguly, the Indian captain, has suggested to the International Cricket Council (ICC) that the on-field umpire be given the option of referring close leg-before appeals to the TV umpire. I believe that is necessary when the ball either pitches just inside or outside the line of the leg-stump, Sourav told The Telegraph on Thursday evening, after interacting with Dave Richardson, the ICCs general manager (cricket). Sourav, however, declined to say whether other suggestions too were placed before Richardson (a former South African wicketkeeper), who arrived on Wednesday. Speaking exclusively, Richardson said his meeting with Sourav (as also Pakistans Inzamam-ul Haq) is part of an exercise to get the captains views on issues concerning them and the game. We wont be having a captains summit this year and, so, Ive been engaging in one-to-ones... I began with Graeme Smith over Christmas and, then, met Michael Vaughan before he left for the West Indies. After that, I exchanged views with the two Sri Lankan captains (Hashan Tillekeratne and Maravan Atapattu) and Ricky Ponting, he added. According to Richardson, he will complete his assignment before the Champions Trophy, which begins on September 10. In the near future, of course, he intends interacting with Brian Lara and Stephen Fleming  that should be in London itself. Basically, the discussions have focussed on playing conditions, illegal bowling actions, over rates, the ICCs own tournaments... Weve been keen on a feedback and if something needs to be looked into, its going to be taken up at the appropriate forum, Richardson informed. He returns to London on Friday morning.  Copyright

 Mighty Korea held by Jordan

(AFP) Jinan: South Korea failed to break down a negative Jordan side and were held to a goalless draw in their opening Asian Cup match on Monday. The Koreans, semi-finalists at the World Cup two years ago, dominated the group B match but could not find a way past inspired Jordan goalkeeper Amer Sabbah. We were unlucky, shrugged new South Korea coach Jo Bonfrere. Their goalkeeper had a very good day. We created chances, missed them and were not aggressive enough. Striker Ahn Jung-hwan came closest for South Korea in the 23rd minute with a dipping right-foot volley from 25 metres that Sabbah brilliantly kept out. Moments later, Chung Kyung-ho blazed over and Seol Ki-hyeon went close as South Korea kept the pressure on Jordan, who defended in numbers and rarely threatened on their Asian Cup debut. Ahn, who scored the goal that knocked Italy out of the 2002 World Cup, forced another acrobatic save from Sabbah in the 63rd minute. Lee Dong-gook and Seol Ki-hyeon were also denied by Sabbah, frustrating Dutchman Bonfrere in his third match in charge. Adding to his woes, defender Choi Jin-cheul was sent off seven minutes from time and will miss their next game against UAE on Friday. South Korea, who had struggled to find a coach following the resignation of Humberto Coelho in April, have not won the Asian Cup since 1960. We were not afraid of the Jordan defence, said Bonfrere. We tried to attack from the first minute. We had shots and they were saved. It was the same story in the second half.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

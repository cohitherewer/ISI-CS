The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Relieved, Thorpe thanks Stevens
 Ian Thorpe reflects on his good luck with coach Tracey Menzies during a press conference in Sydney on Tuesday. (AFP) Sydney: Olympic and world champion Ian Thorpe is relieved to have been offered the chance to defend his Olympic 400m title in August. The withdrawal of teammate Craig Stevens has paved the way for Thorpes Athens opening. Im excited about swimming the event because I won my first Olympic gold medal in the event, Thorpe told a packed news conference at Sydneys Olympic pool on Tuesday. Im not worried about the pressure that comes with it, a little concerned, but not worried. Thorpes hopes of swimming the 400 appeared to have sunk when he was disqualified for a false start after slipping off the blocks during last months Australian trials. He lost an appeal against the disqualification but was thrown a lifeline when Stevens, who finished second to Grant Hackett at the trials, gave up his spot on Monday, saying he wanted to concentrate on his other events  the 1500 freestyle and 4x200 freestyle relay. I wouldnt have swum this race if I wasnt satisfied about the decision Craig had made and how he made the decision, said Thorpe. I know Craigs decision was what he wanted to do, not what anyone else wanted him to do. I discussed with him what he had been through in the last month, and after that I thanked him for making the decision that hed made. Thorpes announcement ended a month-long saga that divided Australia with opinions split over what Stevens should do. Most observers expected Stevens would pull out and concentrate on his other events, though others urged him to swim the 400 even though he had little chance of winning. The final decision came after Australian Olympic officials consulted their lawyers to make sure Thorpe was next in line and Stevens management team negotiated an exclusive deal to make the announcement live on Australian television. I think the Australian public and the Australian media applied a lot of pressure to both young men and to us as a sport, Swimming Australia chief executive Glenn Tasker said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

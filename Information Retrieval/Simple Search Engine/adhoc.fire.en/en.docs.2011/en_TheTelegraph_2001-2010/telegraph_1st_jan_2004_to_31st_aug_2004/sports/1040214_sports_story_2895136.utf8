The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another slow start for Atwal
 Tiger Woods tees off with the ocean in the background during the first round of the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego on Thursday. (AFP) San Diego: While there was an overall surprise start Thursday to the $ 4.5 million Buick Invitational golf meet here on Thursday, Calcutta pro Arjun Atwals slow take-off wasnt surprising, at least going by his last two US PGA Tour openers. Atwal was tied at 99th spot, with 16 others a one-over par position. The overall surprise, though was in Kevin Stadler, the son of 1982 US Masters champion Craig, producing a birdie-eagle finish to snatch the first-round lead on eight-under-par 64. Daniel Chopra, the India-born Swede, meanwhile, had another good start, tied at 42nd spot with a two-under par take-off. Atwal, whose best finish in his short duration on the Tour has been a tied 21st in his last outing at Pebble Beach (he has made the cut in both the events he has taken part this season), has in both cases had sedate starts. A one over opening round, thus, is no indication of his moves in the next three rounds. Starting on the tenth tee, Atwal ran into early trouble when he bogeyed the 15th and 16th. He managed to keep to the pars before he slipped again, bogeying the third. A respite came in the fourth-hole birdie, but failed to hold onto the pace, ending on a ninth-hole bogey. Stadler, who played the easier North course at Torrey Pines, was one stroke clear of Ted Purdy and Swedens Jesper Parnevik. Two shots back on 66 were Kevin Sutherland, Swedens Mathias Gronberg, Craig Barlow, Bob Tway and Tom Lehman. While all the leaders played the North course, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Vijai Singh were in action on the more difficult South. Woods and Singh hit one-under-par 71s while Mickelson struggled to a 74. (Reuters)  Copyright

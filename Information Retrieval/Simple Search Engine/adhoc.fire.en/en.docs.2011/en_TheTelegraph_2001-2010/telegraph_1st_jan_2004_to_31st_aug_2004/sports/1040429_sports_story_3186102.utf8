The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fourth ODI washed out
St Georges: The fourth one-day International between the West Indies and England was abandoned on Wednesday without a ball being bowled. Torrential overnight rain left the Queens Park ground waterlogged. Last weekends back-to-back one-day International matches in Trinidad were both abandoned owing to rain. England lead the seven-match series 1-0 after their two-wicket win in Guyana in the opening game but rain is also forecast for St Lucia, the location for the fifth and sixth one-dayers this weekend. Meanwhile, England were expected to confirm they would go ahead with their controversial tour of Zimbabwe in October after one of the Management Board directors resigned. Des Wilson, the chairman of the ECBs Corporate Affairs and Marketing Advisory Committee, revealed the Board had given in to pressure from the ICC.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Kirmani hails Yuvraj, Chopras adaptability
Chennai: Chairman of the national selection committee Syed Kirmani says he would prefer a defensive opener to partner Virender Sehwag in Tests. He, however, emphasised that both Yuvraj Singh and Akash Chopra could fit into the role given their ability to adapt to any situation. The former India wicketkeeper said adaptability was key to any situation and both Chopra and Yuvraj were capable of rising to the occasion. Even if both are picked, they have the wherewithal to adapt themselves to the situation. We have to look into their usefulness to the team, Kirmani said. On the need to have specialists for every department of the game, he said he preferred a defensive batsman for the second openers slot. Kirmani also sought to downplay the recent remarks made by some of the players over the issue, saying they were all made keeping the interest of the team in mind. The comments of (Sourav) Ganguly, Sehwag and (Sachin) Tendulkar, I am sure, have all been made in a positive way. As long as there are no controversial remarks, I look at them from the committees point of view as a sporting one and not injuring the feelings of others. It is a good and healthy sign that players are airing their views, Kirmani said. We will not disturb the composition of the present well-knit team. On Rahul Dravid keeping wickets in one-day matches, Kirmani said: Dravid will do whatever is expected of him. It is a genuine suggestion made in the teams interest. The selectors will have no inhibitions about it. If the captain and the team feel Rahul is the best bet, it should be regarded by the committee too. The former wicketkeeper also said Parthiv Patels potential could not be overlooked. Just in case the regular (Patel) fails to perform, we will give youngsters like Dinesh Karthik or Vinay Uthappa who are knocking at the doors of selection a chance. (PTI)  Copyright

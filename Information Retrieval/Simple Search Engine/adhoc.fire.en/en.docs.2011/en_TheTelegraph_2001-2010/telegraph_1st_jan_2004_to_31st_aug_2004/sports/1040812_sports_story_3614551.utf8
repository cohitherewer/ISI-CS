		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 																																	Athens: The Olympic flame that will burn at the Athens Games arrived in the ancient town of Marathon on Tuesday as it prepared to enter the capital ahead of the opening ceremony. The flame will spend the night in Marathon, about 40 km north of Athens, near the spot where the ancient Athenians defeated an invading Persian army in 490 BC and inspired the legend of the messenger Pheidippides and the modern race. Thousands of onlookers waving Greek flags cheered as Olympic weightlifter Giorgos Tzelilis carried the flame up to a specially constructed marble podium and lit the altar. I wish I could have taken part in the Games but a serious injury has prevented me, said the injured Tzelilis. The town will be the starting point of the marathon race during the Olympics.				 																																	Athens: The Athens Olympics are bringing Greeces ex-king Constantine back for the first time in 37 years to the palace he fled as a young man  but just for drinks. As an honorary member of the IOC, the deposed monarch is invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace that was once his home on Friday, before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. The invitation has angered Greeces leftist parties, which say the former sailing Olympic gold medallist does not represent their country and has forced the conservative government to defend the move. Its a big problem for the IOC, which must not be a club of royals but include those who truly represent the citizens of their countries. How can the ex-king be a member of the IOC? asked Alekos Alavanos, an MP of the Leftist Coalition party.				 																																	New Haven: James Stillman Rockefeller, the oldest-known US Olympic medal winner and the former head of the bank that became Citigroup, died on Tuesday. He was 102. Rockefeller suffered a stroke on Thursday, his grandson, who lived with him at his Greenwich home said. Records of the US Olympic committee show that Rockefeller was the oldest American medal winner, a USOC spokeswoman said.				 																																	He was the captain of Yale Universitys eight-man rowing team that won the gold medal at the 1924 Paris Olympics. Another member of the crew was Dr Benjamin Spock, a renowned paediatrician who wrote a best-selling book about raising children.				 																																	Madrid: Real Madrid will pay Arsenal 33 million euros for Gunners skipper Patrick Vieira, Spanish sports dailies reported on Wednesday. It seems a done deal and the only thing missing is the green light from the English clubs board, said Marca.				 																																	The 33-million-euro transfer fee is more than the Spanish giants original offer of 30 million, while still less than the 42 million arsenal are seeking for Vieira.				 																																	Stockholm: Sweden defender Andreas Jakobsson has retired from international soccer, Swedish public television SVT reported on Tuesday. The 31-year-old wants to focus now on his career with Danish Super League club Brondby, said SVT. Jakobsson, who won 36 caps, established himself as a Sweden regular during the 2002 World Cup. 				 																																	London: Newcastle United have completed the signing of Ireland defender Stephen Carr from rival Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, the Tyneside club said on Tuesday. The 27-year-old right back moved to St James Park on a four-year contract. The transfer fee was not disclosed. Athletics, IAAF Super GP  from 2 pm on STAR  Sports

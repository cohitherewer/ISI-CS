 Underworld may hold sway: Sarfraz 
Islamabad: Living up to his reputation of making allegations before every important cricket meet, Sarfraz Nawaz cast doubts over Indias tour of Pakistan, claiming that the underworld will hold sway over the series. As the Indian team arrived in Lahore Wednesday to begin its 40-day tour of Pakistan, Nawaz, the enfant terrible of Pakistan cricket, alleged that mafia had set the stage to manipulate the results to its liking. In an interview to local daily The News, Nawaz said that his claims were based on the inclusion of the some of non-performing players in Pakistan team by the national selectors. He said the sacking of former cricketer Aamir Sohail as the chief selector ahead of the series, inviting cricketers such as Wasim Akram, whom he accuses of being involved in betting and match fixing, were some of the indications that led to him to conclude that betting may be in the offing. He alleged that there was already interference in coach Javed Miandads efforts to train the players.  (PTI)  Copyright

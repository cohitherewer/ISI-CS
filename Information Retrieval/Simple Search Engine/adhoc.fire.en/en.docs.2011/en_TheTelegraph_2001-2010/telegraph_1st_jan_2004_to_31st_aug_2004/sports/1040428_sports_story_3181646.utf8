 Diego opens eyes to special diet 
 Maradona remains under a guarded prognosis and continues in intensive care Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona opened his eyes and later began consuming a mix of liquid and solid foods amid expressions of relief on Tuesday from family, friends and fans over medical reports of new progress. But the legendary argentine soccer player remained under a guarded prognosis and continued in intensive care after he was admitted on April 18 to a private hospital with serious heart and lung problems. In a bid to get the periodical statements from his medical team, fans have been keeping up a more than weeklong vigil outside the Suizo Argentina Clinic where Maradona remains ensconced in a fourth-floor critical care unit. Maradona, who led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup title, opened his eyes for the first time on Monday, the leading daily Clarin reported. The report in Tuesdays editions said Maradonas former wife, Claudia and their two teenage daughters were now able to spend more time at his bedside as he showed signs of improvement. More visitors were expected as players and coaches from the soccer world continued to show their concern for the 43-year old former star, whose enormous talent on the soccer field has won him acclaim as one of the best ever to play the sport. Although doctors in their last report didnt say what foods Maradona was consuming, they said he was on a special diet, meant to assist his recovery. They also reported that antibiotics had brought a lung infection under control. Meanwhile, the medical team had no details on the heart inflammation condition that landed Maradona in the hospital. But they said the 43-year-old former star, taken off a respirator over the weekend, was now breathing without an oxygen mask. Outside the downtown Buenos Aires clinic, fans, curiosity seekers and tourists have thronged daily, some lighting candles or taping hundreds of messages, posters and sporting memorabilia to the walls. In his 20-year career, Maradona won Italian and Argentine league titles. In 2000, Fifa chose him as the games best ever, alongside Pele.  (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rooney one of the best: Pele
London: Pele agrees with England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson that Wayne Rooney has made a bigger impact on a major tournament than any young player since Pele himself. Pele was an unknown 17-year-old when he helped Brazil win the 1958 World Cup in Sweden and went on to become the greatest ever player. He scored the winner against Wales in the quarter finals in his first game in the tournament, hit France with a hattrick in the semi-finals and grabbed two against Sweden in the final. So far, Rooney has scored four times to help England through to the Euro 2004 quarter finals against Portugal Thursday. He also won a penalty against France that David Beckham failed to convert to allow France to come back and win 2-1 with two injury time goals from Zinedine Zidane. Wayne Rooney has already emerged as one of the best players at the European Championships, Pele told The Sun newspaper. Hes a very exciting talent, who shows maturity and composure beyond his young years. But Pele admitted he feared for the 18-year-old in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of modern football. Everywhere you look in England there seems to be a Rooney picture. I just hope that Rooney is allowed to remain focussed on his performance and that the only pressure he has to carry is that which he puts upon himself, Pele said. There is certainly a lot more pressure on a young player like Rooney than there was when I first played for Brazil, he added. It is something Wayne will have to learn to cope with. But Pele believes Rooney can lead England past Portugal into the semi-finals. With his tremendous ability both on and off the ball, I am sure England can go on to do extremely well in Euro 2004. And Manchester United great George Best agreed. I look forward to seeing him rise to the challenge in World Cups and European Championships for the next 15 years, Best told The Daily Mail. For a lad of 18, he is just incredible. Im not known for flattering modern day footballers  David Beckham has never impressed me  but Rooneys got everything. And he believes Rooney is tough enough to cope with the punishment he will now take from defenders out to stop him. Hes a strong lad and defenders dont hurt him. He can take a battering and hand one out. Best is now looking forward to more Wayne magic. With the talent hes got, you let him have the ball and watch the fireworks and its not easy to stop him.

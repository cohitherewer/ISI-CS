The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Moya in semis
 - Henin-Hardenne survives injury scare  Lleyton Hewitt after winning a point against Arnaud Clement in Sydney on Thursday. (Reuters) Sydney: Carlos Moya cruised into the semi-finals of the Sydney International with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Tommy Robredo whereas Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne and Lindsay Davenport of the United States survived injury scares to win their quarter-final matches on Thursday. Moya reached the final of the Australian Open in 1997 after finishing runner-up in Sydney a week earlier and is hoping he can go one step further this time after a great start to the New Year. I think I am playing better now than in 1997, the 27-year-old said after the victory over his fellow Spaniard. With every match I play, the more confident I get. As the highest ranked player left in the draw, he is now the clear favourite to win, with Australias Lleyton Hewitt, seventh seed here, posing the biggest threat. Hewitt booked his place in the last four with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Arnaud Clement, 2001 Australian Open runner-up. Dutchman Martin Verkerk, 6-4, 7-6 winner over Australias Mark Philippoussis, and South African Wayne Ferreira, who beat Australian wildcard Todd Reid 6-4, 6-4, complete the semi-final line-up. Henin-Hardenne sprained her ankle and needed treatment for blisters before beating American Chanda Rubin 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 while Davenport strained a shoulder muscle during her 6-3, 6-4 victory over Russias Elena Dementieva. Both Davenport and Henin-Hardenne said their injuries were not serious and they expected to line up against each other in Fridays semi-finals. Amelie Mauresmo of France also booked her place in the last four with a 6-4, 7-6 win over Russias Anastasia Myskina. She will next play Francesca Schiavone, who beat Anna Smashnova-Pistolesi of Israel 6-2, 6-2. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangalore boost for citys rising star
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Avirup Dutt Mazumder has been breaking one record after another in the ongoing state junior aquatic championships at Subhas Sarovar. The 17-year-old from Kasba has a home away from home, so to say. He studies in the S.R.N. Adarsh College in Bangalore, where he is actually taking higher lessons in swimming. After passing ICSE from Don Bosco, Park Circus, I thought of a switch, to study and to swim. I got in touch with S. Pradeep Kumar (renowned coach), who on my request, agreed to train me, Avirup said. According to Avirup, better training facilities in Bangalore attracted him and now he doesnt want to come out of that routine. I get the opportunity of training with the likes of Nisha Millet, Rahul Batra, Shiresh Reddy and others, he said. After this meet my aim is to do well in the junior nationals to be held in Jaipur from June 30 to July 4, he added. The story of Avirups venture into swimming is quite unique. None from his family ever wanted to become a swimmer, neither did Avirup had any special inclination. From a very early age I had been a patient of chronic asthma. Doctors told my parents to take me to the swimming pool, which changed my life, he revealed. Love for the water fetched him a bronze medal in the state sub-junior championships in 1995 and a couple of silver medals in the nationals next year. This made Avirup serious and he started working hard, with coach Asish Das. He got his rewards in 2002, when he set two records in 200 and 400m freestyle events in the state meet in 2002. This year I am really doing well and want to keep it up. I hope to do well in the senior meets and the upcoming junior nationals, he said. Avirup lamented that Bengal swimmers are more talented than their counterparts in other states but cannot fare well in the higher levels due to lack of facilities. Avirup also intends to go abroad for even better training if he can keep up the good work, which he is doing at present.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Will Fatima Bibis five-year wait at Kot Lakhpat end with the series?
 - Bihar Cricket Association president, senior Pakistani bureaucrat take initiative to end Indian nationals misery  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Perhaps one of the immediate beneficiaries of the friendship series will be Fatima Rawalpindi: While its to be seen whether the relations between New Delhi and Islamabad get warmer after this Revival Series, theres one 50-plus woman in a Lahore jail  a one-time resident of Mumbais Worli Naka  who could become an immediate beneficiary. If that does come about, it will largely be thanks to the effort of two officers  one on either side of the border: Amitabh Choudhary, a DIG posted in Ranchi, and Rao Iftikhar Khan, additional home commissioner of (west) Punjab. Choudhary, it may be recalled, was manager of the U-19 team which won the Asia Cup last November. It was during that trip, when he sought clearance to exit via Wagah (instead of taking a circuitous route through Dubai), that he met the immensely helpful Khan. More recently, when Choudhary informed Khan he would be coming for the third (and final) Test here, the latter requested help for Fatima Bibi, an illiterate Indian national, who has been in the Kot Lakhpat jail from July 1999 for entering Pakistan without a visa. According to Choudhary, who spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday, her case history  emailed by Khan  has been forwarded to a friend in the Ministry of External Affairs. Its for New Delhi now to send an advisory to our High Commission in Islamabad. In fact, Choudhary met Fatima earlier this week, en route to Rawalpindi. The womans tragic story begins in December 1992, when she lost her husband in the Mumbai disturbances. Fatima (and her three daughters) took shelter in her sisters house, but as that family itself was big, it was suggested she head for the Gulf and work as a domestic or whatever. Fatima left her daughters with the sister and landed in Dubai. Apparently, she was persuaded to marry a widower, who worked in a tailoring outfit. Fatima herself found employment and the understanding was that her earnings would be sent to Mumbai, thereby relieving the pressure on her sister. Soon enough, Fatima learnt she was being duped by her husband. Confronting him, though, set in motion a sorry tale of torture. Eventually, she pleaded that he put her on a flight to Mumbai. The husband did book her on one, but that flight was Islamabad-bound. Being an Indian national without a visa, Fatima was booked under the Foreigners Act and sentenced for a year. That was back in July 1999. However, Fatima languished as she neither had the means to leave Pakistan nor someone  till Choudhary and Khan got into the act  to plead her case before the appropriate authority. Once released, she must immediately exit from this country. Ive tried to do my best... Hopefully, my friend back in the ministry has started processing her case, remarked Choudhary, who added that Fatima was in a state of shock when he met her in the jail superintendents office. Initially, she was incoherent but, gradually, confirmed everything Id read in her case history... By the time I left, she felt comforted, Choudhary said. Incidentally, Choudhary (the Bihar Cricket Association president) came with a good luck message for Sourav Ganguly from the Jharkhand chief minister, Arjun Munda. The message, in the form of a letter, has been handed over to the Team India captain.  Copyright

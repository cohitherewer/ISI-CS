				 																																	London: Everton say they have offered their coveted England striker Wayne Rooney a club record wage of 50,000 ($93,620) a week to stay at the club. Everton owner Bill Kenwright told Sky Sports News he was hopeful of keeping the 18-year-old, who has been tipped to move away from Goodison Park after making a big impression at Euro 2004. I suppose, going into this next season, we were thinking probably double-your-money, well double what you are on now, Kenwright said. But (Everton manager) David Moyes said, Look, hes the best player in the world and I want to support the best player in the world. Id like him to become my captain and I think we should offer him the highest wage in our history.				 																																	Rome: Japan international Hidetoshi Nakata has joined promoted Serie A club Fiorentina from cash-strapped Parma for an undisclosed sum. The 27-year-old midfielder failed to establish himself at Parma following a 25 million euro ($31.11 million) move from AS Roma in July 2001. He was loaned out to Bologna in January as Parma tried to cut their wage bill when a multibillion euro accounting fraud exploded at the clubs parent company Parmalat. Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said Nakata was paid 2.5 million euros for the move and has brokered a salary of two million euros for each of the next three seasons.				 																																	Chennai: Porto chairman Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa has criticised Real Madrids attempts to sign Ricardo Carvalho and says the Spanish side have little hope of prising the Portugal defender away from the club.				 																																	Ricardo Carvalho is going nowhere, the Porto chairman was quoted as saying in the Spanish press on Monday. Porto isnt having a sale and at the moment moving to Real Madrid would be a step down (for Carvalho). They cant force us to sell a player if we dont want to.				 																																	Porto have already sold Paulo Ferreira to Chelsea and Deco to Barcelona. 				 																																	Los Angeles: NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr suffered minor burns to his face and legs on Sunday when his car spun out of control and caught fire during a practice run for the American Le Mans Series race in California. Officials at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma said Earnhardt was taken to a hospital for observation.Sport on Screen Cycling, Tour de France: Live from 6.30 pm on TEN Sports

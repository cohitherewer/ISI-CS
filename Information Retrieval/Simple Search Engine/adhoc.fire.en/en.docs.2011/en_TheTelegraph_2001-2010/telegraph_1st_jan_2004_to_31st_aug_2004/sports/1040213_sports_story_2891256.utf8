The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McGrath unlikely for Tests too
 McGrath has run out of time to prove his fitness Sydney: Glenn McGrath has run out of time to prove his fitness for next months Test series in Sri Lanka. McGraths ankle problems have kept him out of the New South Wales side for Sundays one-day match against South Australia here. With a ten-over spell in a one-day match considered the best way to ease McGrath back into competitive cricket after such a long lay-off, he is also unlikely to be named in the NSW Sheffield Shield team for the match against South Australia, starting on Tuesday. That means he will have played no cricket when the selectors sit down to finalise the Test squad for the Sri Lanka series, which starts in Galle on March 8. The Test squad will be named on Friday, with Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee most likely to spearhead the Australian attack and Michael Kasprowicz, Brad Williams and either Nathan Bracken or Andy Bichel to be included as the other quicks. It is highly unlikely McGrath, who turned 34 on Monday, will be granted a spot in the squad without proving his fitness and equally unlikely that the selectors will rely on a hunch he is ready to add to his 95 Tests and 430 wickets with no cricket behind him. Meanwhile, Ricky Ponting won the Allan Border Medal on Thursday for Australias Player of the Year after scoring three Test double tons and leading his side to World Cup victory in 2003. The last 12 months have been an exceptional year for me, Ponting said at the function. Obviously its a great thrill to win the Allan Border Medal. The World Cup so far has been the best cricketing moment of my life, he added of his undefeated 140 in the final against India.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

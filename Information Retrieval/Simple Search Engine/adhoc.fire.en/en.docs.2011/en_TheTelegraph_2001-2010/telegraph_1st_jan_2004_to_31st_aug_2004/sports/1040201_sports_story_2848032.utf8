The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Double for Rupesh Roy
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Hsuan Hwang of Chinese Taipei and Rupesh Roy of India with their trophies at DKS on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Jan. 31: City boy Rupesh Roy clinched a double by winning the boys singles and doubles titles in the ONGC ITF junior tennis meet at DKS on Saturday. Hsuan Hwang of Chinese Taipei won the girls title beating Pichittra Thongdach of Thailand 6-4, 6-3. But the day surely belonged to Roy. The second seed overpowered Xiao-Peng Lai of Hong Kong in a match that lasted about two hours. The 6-4, 6-4 scoreline may suggest otherwise, but the match was evenly contested. It was the powerful forehand of Roy that ultimately helped the Indian clinch the issue. Both Roy and Lai have powerful serves and they failed to make too much headway into the oppositions service games in the initial games. But Rupesh got a chance in the ninth game to break Lai and go 5-4 up. Thereon, it wasnt too difficult for him to close out the set with powerful serves. Roy started taking charge of the second set right from the word go, breaking Lai in the first game. He looked in total command, breaking the Hong Kong player in the seventh game to go 5-2 up. He was all set to wrap it up leading 40-15 in the eighth game. But Lai started making a bit of a comeback, taking the game to a deuce and then went on to break serve. Roys backhand isnt that powerful and Lai started taking advantage of that. Lai quickly made it 4-5, but Roy did not lose his cool. His first service, which had started going a bit astray, fell in the right place and the Indian closed out the match in style. In the doubles final, Roy, along with Anshuman Dutta, defeated the second-seeded Hong Kong pair of Martin Sayer and Lai 6-1, 6-3.  FINAL RESULTS BOYS: Rupesh Roy bt Xiao-Peng Lai 6-4, 6-4 GIRLS: Hsuan Hwang bt Pichittra Thongdach 6-4, 6-3 BOYS DOUBLES: Rupesh Roy/Anshuman Dutta bt Martin Sayer/Xiao-Peng Lai 6-1, 6-3.

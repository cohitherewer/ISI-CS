According to Arjuna Ranatunga, the deputy minister for industry, tourism and investment promotion, the promotional tour could take place after the September 10-25 Champions Trophy Both have agreed to act as ambassadors... Now, its a question of working out the most suitable dates... As of now, the tour may take place in end September, Ranatunga, incidentally the 1996 World Cup-winning captain, told The Telegraph on Monday evening. Ranatunga added that he is going to target north and west India. Tourists from the south come in thousands, but I believe theres a market in New Delhi and Mumbai... One can look at other regions in the next phase of our drive. Significantly, both Murali and Vaas are particularly close to Ranatunga and its not unusual for them to still seek his guidance.

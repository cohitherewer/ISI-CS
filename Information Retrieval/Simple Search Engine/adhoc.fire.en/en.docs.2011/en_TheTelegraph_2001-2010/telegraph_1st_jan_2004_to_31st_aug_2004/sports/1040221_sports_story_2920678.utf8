The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zidanes Real deal extended to 2007
 - Ive had 3 extraordinary years and that comes out on the pitch  Zinedine Zidane feels good in Madrid Madrid: Zinedine Zidane has signed a new contract with Real Madrid which will keep the worlds most expensive footballer with the Spanish champions until 2007. The 1998 World Cup winners two year extension to his existing contract which was due to run out in 2005 was announced on Reals official website Thursday. The club had the possibility to renew the contract by one year, but both parties finally reached an agreement for two years, the announcement said. The 31-year-old playmaker, who picked up his third Fifa Player of the Year award in December, arrived in the Spanish capital side in 2001 from Juventus for a world record 75 million euros ($ 90 million). He proved his worth by scoring the winning goal in the 2002 Champions League final for Madrid to become the champions of Europe for a record ninth time. He joined French first division side Cannes as a 16-year-old in 1988 and moved to Bordeaux in 1992. Juventus bought him for $ 4 million in 1996 after he had inspired Bordeaux to a Uefa Cup win over the Italian giants. Zidane won the European Super Cup, two Intercontinental Cups and two Italian championships with Juventus but missed out on the Champions League. Of all the goals he has scored perhaps his most important were the two headers against Brazil in the 1998 World Cup final. A Zidane-inspired France then went on to win the 2000 European Championship. Last week the Marseille-born midfielder hinted that he was interested in prolonging his stay at Real. Id like to carry on and I feel good in Madrid, I love it. I can only say good things about the club regarding the three years I have spent here already, said Zidane. The most important thing is that I feel really good in Madrid. My family is happy here. Ive had an extraordinary three years here. And all of that comes out when Im on the pitch. Real are out to defend the Spanish title, win the Spanish Cup and also a 10th European Cup this season. And the player known as Zizou relishes the challenge that awaits. We want to win everything. The objective is to win all three, he said. (AFP)  Copyright

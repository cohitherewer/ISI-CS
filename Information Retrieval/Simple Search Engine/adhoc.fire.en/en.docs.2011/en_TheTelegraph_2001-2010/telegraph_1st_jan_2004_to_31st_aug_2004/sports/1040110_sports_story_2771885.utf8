 ICC reminds of respect for umpires 
London: The International Cricket Council on Friday urged its Elite umpires to ensure that players respect the role and responsibilities of the officials. In a letter to the 16-member Elite panel of ICC umpires and referees, the ICC reinforced the importance of ensuring that players show due respect to the umpires. The ICC directive comes in the wake of actions of Match Referee Mike Procter to address instances of players celebrating a wicket without waiting for the umpires decision during the third Test between Australia and India in Melbourne. The ICCs Code of Conduct is in place to provide players with a simple guide to the way in which the game should be played and they are expected to have read the Code, have understood it and to act at all times within the spirit of the game, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed was quoted as saying in a press statement here. In particular this applies to the courtesy and respect that is afforded to umpires during the course of a match, Speed said.  (PTI)  Copyright

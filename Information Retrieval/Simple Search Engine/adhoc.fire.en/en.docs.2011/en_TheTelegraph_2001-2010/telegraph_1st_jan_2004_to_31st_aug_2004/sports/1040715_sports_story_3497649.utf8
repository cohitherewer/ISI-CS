The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal ride Bijen brace 
 - SUPER DIVISION - Bhowmicks experimental side looks unimpressive against George  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Bhola Prasad (left) and Climax Lawrence join Bijen Singh in celebrating the latters second goal against George Telegraph at the club ground on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Bijen Singh came off the bench and scored two second-half goals to guide East Bengal to a 2-0 win against George Telegraph in the Super Division League match on Wednesday. The late goals (72nd and 82nd minutes) came at the right time as cries of dejection were starting to fly from the stands with the home team struggling to break George Telegraphs overcrowded defence. The goals came at the right time for Bijen  the only striker of some repute in coach Subhas Bhowmicks experimental side  too. He had missed a penalty in the 40th minute. However, for the five thousand odd trying to weigh their teams strength ahead of Sundays match against Mohun Bagan, there was not much encouragement, Alvito DCunhas standout showing notwithstanding. George Telegraph didnt even try to trouble East Bengals new-look defence, so that part will remain untested till the Derby clash, but the same cant be said of the rest. Sasthi Duley looked completely out of place on the right side of the midfield and the general impression was that East Bengal need lots of fine-tuning and some reinforcements in certain departments. I am not disappointed. Physically, my players are 40 per cent of what I want them to be. We still created openings and our opponents didnt. I will continue to experiment in the next few matches, said Bhowmick. It was pretty one-dimensional throughout. East Bengal played almost the entire match in front of the rival goal but failed to create too many openings. DCunha looked eager to put an indifferent last season behind him and was the heart and soul of most of East Bengals moves. New recruit Climax Lawrence had an off-day as did most of his teammates entrusted with the responsibility of making things happen. Shylo Malsawmtluanga failed to control the ball to waste a possible chance in the opening minute, but the next real chance came after a long time. New Ghanaian defender Louis Aniweta missed that free header following a cross from Dipak Mondal. Then came the penalty. It was a centre from the right, which took a deflection and hit the hand of George Telegraph defender Sajal Saha. Bijen, who had replaced Nitin Pradhan seconds before that, drove a feeble effort into the upright to his left. I will speak to him the next day in practice. He is not supposed to take penalties for us, said Bhowmick. Incidentally, his team had got a penalty in the previous match too, which DCunha converted. The second half was a lot better, with DCunha shifting to the right. A 15-minute spell  12 minutes after the breather  saw a series of raids on the George Telegraph goal. This period saw DCunha hit the bar, Climax missing a sitter, a goalline save and also the first goal. DCunha won a ball in the right corner, sent in a low cross that eluded all at the near post and Bijen got just enough of his body behind the ball to guide it into the netting. It took everything out of George Telegraphs resistance.  The second goal was a lot better. DCunha again started the move, releasing Climax inside the box. The India medio should have scored, but hit into the goalkeeper instead. He made amends by lifting the rebound towards the far post where Bijen rose high to nod home. The win took East Bengal to six points from two matches, while George Telegraph stayed on ten after five.

 Man arrested for Yetunde murder
Los Angeles: Police have arrested a suspected gang member for allegedly murdering the older half-sister of US tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams four months ago. Robert Maxfield, 23, was arrested without incident on Monday near his sisters home in Los Angeles after law enforcement authorities surrounded the building, sheriffs department lieutenant Dan Rosenberg said. They surrounded the apartment complex. They called Mr. Maxfield out, and he was subsequently taken into custody without incident, he said. Maxfield was booked and was being held without bail on suspicion that he fired a fatal shot at Williams sister Yetunde Price, 31, as she sat in her car last September. Police said his arrest was the result of tips provided by members of the public. (AFP)  Copyright

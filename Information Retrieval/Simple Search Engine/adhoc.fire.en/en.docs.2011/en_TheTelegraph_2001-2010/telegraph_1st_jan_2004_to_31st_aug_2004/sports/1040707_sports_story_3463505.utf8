The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Faking charge caused mental torture
	 - Shoaib Akhtar says he is carrying a calf injury, hopes to be fit before Asia Cup  Shoaib Akhtar Islamabad: After going through an agonising trial to clear his name following allegations that he faked injury during the final Test against India in April, Shoaib Akhtar has said he underwent great mental torture during the turmoil. I went through mental torture after I was accused of faking injury, said Shoaib, who joined the camp for Asia Cup probables on Monday. The Rawalpindi Express also shot down the allegation that he deserted the team and pointed to the recent scrapping of his lucrative contract with English county Durham. I have returned to Pakistan foregoing a Rs 10.25 million contract with my county to play for my country in the Asia Cup, he told a local television channel. The controversial speedster made no efforts to conceal his differences with skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, whose request to bowl against India on the third day of the Rawalpindi Test he turned down, complaining of injury. Shoaib had to face a medical commission to prove that he had a rib cage injury and in the process picked up a bitter row with board officials. Shoaib said although he suffered mentally because of the boards attitude, he was still ready to play for Pakistan. Shoaib said he is carrying a calf muscle injury and has informed new coach Bob Woolmer and the board about this.  I am still bowling with that strain but hopefully, with the help of treatment here I will be fit for the Asia Cup, he said. Inzamam and board officials have already said that they want Shoaib and every other player to be 150 per cent fit to get selected in the team which will be announced in the next few days. Shoaib said he had great confidence in the abilities of Woolmer with whom he had two meetings in London before the new coach took over on July 2. I know Woolmer has special tactics to deal with fast bowlers and I hope I will enjoy my game under him, he said. Meanwhile, Woolmer was quoted as saying in a local daily that that the final decision of selecting the team would be taken by Inzamam. Inzamam is the one who has to fight in the field and he should have the right to choose his players.  (PTI)  Copyright

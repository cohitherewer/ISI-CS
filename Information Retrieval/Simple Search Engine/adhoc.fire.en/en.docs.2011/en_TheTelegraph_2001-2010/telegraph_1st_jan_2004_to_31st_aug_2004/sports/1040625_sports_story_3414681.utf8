 Nistelrooy ensures Dutch progress
 - United striker shatters Latvian dream  FROM CHRISTOPHER DAVIES IN BRAGA  Pavel Nedved flies over Czech teammate Marek Jankulovsky during a training session in Sintra on Thursday. The Czechs take on Denmark in the quarter final on Sunday. (AFP)Ruud van Nistelrooys Dutch double sent The Netherlands into the quarter finals where they will play Sweden in Faro on Saturday. While celebrating their place in the knockout stages, the The Netherlands supporters also paid tribute to what amounted to the Czech Republics second string by chanting the name of the country who defeated them 3-2 only last Saturday. Only the most optimistic Dutch follower  probably the coaches and players too  believed Germany would stumble. The Netherlands, who will meet the Czechs in a 2006 World Cup qualifier in September, had to do the business against Latvia and Van Nistelrooys two goals midway through the first half ended any realistic hopes the Euro 2004 debutants had of causing a sensation. The two most experienced squads at Euro 2004 went into the tie with a combined total of 2,054 caps between them, The Netherlandss Frank de Boer the daddy of them all making his 111th international appearance in the Municipal Stadium. The Netherlands quickly assumed control and when Arjen Robben put Van Nistelrooy clear a goal seemed certain, but former Crystal Palace goalkeeper Aleksandr Kolinko came out to block the shot with his body. Van Nistelrooys finishing was better in the 26th minute from the penalty spot after Mihails Zemlinskis was harshly judged to have fouled Edgar Davids, any illegal challenge not clearly made inside the area but, whatever the merits of Kim Milton Nielsens decision, this time the Manchester United striker gave Kolinko no chance. A few minutes later the orange masses were on their feet cheering again as the news that Marek Heinz had equalised for the Czech Republic against Germany filtered through. Van Nistelrooy put The Netherlands further ahead in the 35th minute, tapping the ball home after Phillip Cocu had headed down Clarence Seedorfs free-kick from the left wing. The Netherlands were given a sharp reminder that they could not drop their intensity or concentration because, within four minutes of the restart, Latvia had three good chances to score. Andrejs Rubins saw shots saved while Valentins Lobanovs was only inches wide with a low drive. Roy Makaay increased the party atmosphere with a crisp shot from 15 yards in the 85th minute.

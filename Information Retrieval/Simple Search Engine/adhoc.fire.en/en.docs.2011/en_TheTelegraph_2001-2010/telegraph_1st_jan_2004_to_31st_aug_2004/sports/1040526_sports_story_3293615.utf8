The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saheli assured of crown
Kozhikode: Saheli Nath of Bengal assured herself of the girls title with a round to spare by virtue of better progressive score after the eighth and penultimate round in the national sub-junior chess championship on Tuesday. There will be a keen contest in the boys section though, with just half-a-point separating leader K. Vijay Keerthi and the second-placed Parimarjan Negi. Saheli, playing white, overcame Kiran Monisha Mohanty of Orissa in 42 moves to consolidate her position on top and move to 7.5 points. She has a better progressive score than top seed Soumya Swaminathan and P. Lakshmi Sahiti.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Friday, June 04, 2004  Dettori may win his maiden Derby 
				 										Epsom: Frankie Dettori can lay his Epsom Derby bogey to rest with victory in Saturdays classic on 9-4 favourite Snow Ridge. Trained by Saeed bin Suroor for the global Godolphin set-up of Sheikh Mohammed, Snow Ridge advertised his Derby claims with an encouraging second place in the 2,000 Guineas a month ago.				 										Dettori, 33, is having his 12th ride in the Derby and has never done better than runner-up in 1995 to Lammtarra when riding a horse called Tamure.				 										Snow Ridges chances were boosted on Wednesday when long-time Derby favourite Yeats was pulled out by Irish trainer Aidan OBrien because of a muscle problem. The colts defection gives Dettori the best chance of his glittering career to break the ice although it took the late Gordon Richards 28 attempts before he ended the drought in 1953. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bekele shatters Haile record
 Kenenisa Bekele Ostrava: Ethiopian long distance runner Kenenisa Bekele shattered the world record just two months before the Athens Olympics. The diminutive Bekele broke his second world record in nine days when he shattered compatriot Haile Gebrselassies 10,000 metres mark at an international meeting. The 22-year-old double world cross country champion brought the capacity crowd to their feet as he crossed the line in 26 minutes 20.31 seconds, well inside Gebrselassies mark of 26:22.75 set in Hengelo, Netherlands, six years ago. Bekele had surpassed Gebrselassies 5,000 record at the Hengelo meeting on May 31. Im very happy...I knew I would break the world record only on the last lap, Bekele said. He added he would most probably run the 10,000 metres in Athens. Meanwhile, American Stacy Dragilas outdoor pole vault leap of 4.83m on Tuesday will not stand as a world record, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) have confirmed. Dragila beat the previous outdoor best of 4.82m recorded by Russias Yelena Isinbayeva England last year (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). But Isinbayevas indoor leap of 4.86m in Budapest in March stands as the overall world record following a rule change which combines indoor and outdoor marks. I can confirm 100 percent that the... world record is Yelena Isinbayevas, IAAF spokesman Nick Davies said on Wednesday. Stacy Dragila has jumped the highest outdoor record. Mozambiques Maria Mutola put her rivals on notice in the 800 metres where she will defend her title in Athens. Her time of 1:57.72 was the fastest in that distance this year by nearly a full second. Anju finishes fifth Indias ace long-jumper Anju Bobby George finished fifth with a below- par leap of 6.59m. Anju, currently ranked fourth in the world, was below her best. Last month in Doha, she had collected her first Super Grand Prix gold with a wind-aided 6.82 metres. (Reuters)  Copyright

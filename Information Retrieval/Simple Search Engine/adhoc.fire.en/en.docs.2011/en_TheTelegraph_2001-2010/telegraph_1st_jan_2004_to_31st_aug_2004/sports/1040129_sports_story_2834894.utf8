				 																																	Melbourne: Former world No. 1 Laura Davies will become the first woman to play in an Australasian or European mens tour event when she competes at the ANZ Championship north of Sydney next month.				 																																	This is a new challenge for me and something I think I will absolutely enjoy, Englands Davies said in a statement released on Wednesday. I had the experience of playing against the men at the Korean Open last year and with the modified stableford format used at the ANZ Championship I think I will have a lot of fun. I know the Horizons course very well and have enjoyed playing there in recent years.				 																																	Teenage American prodigy Michelle Wie, 14, narrowly failed to become the first female to make the cut in a mens PGA Tour event when she competed at this months Hawaiian Open. World No. 1 Annika Sorenstam of Sweden became the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event for 58 years, at the Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas last May.				 																																	Raleigh: US Olympic sprinter Chryste Gaines will be allowed to compete in next months Millrose Games if a lane becomes available, USA Track amp; Field (USATF) and her attorney said on Tuesday. At this point, Chryste has been granted an alternate position in the womens 60 metres, due to all lanes in the race being full, USATF spokeswoman Jill Geer said.				 																																	Gaines, who has a pending positive test for the stimulant modafinil, will be able to compete if someone drops out of the race or moves to another event.				 																																	We are feeling like the door is not quite closed yet, her attorney, Cameron A Myler, said.				 																																	Gaines, the world No. 2 sprinter, is having difficulty finding meetings while she awaits the adjudication of her positive modafinil test at the US outdoor championships last June.				 																																	Rome: Players who refuse to undergo blood tests for drugs should have no place in the national team, the president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said on Wednesday.				 																																	The FIGC is involved in a dispute with the Italian Footballers Association (AIC) over plans to get tough on drugs in soccer by introducing compulsory blood tests after some players refused to give samples earlier this month.				 																																	Players who dont accept blood testing will not be called up for international duty, Franco Carraro was quoted as saying in La Gazzetta dello Sport on Wednesday. 				 																																	They will also be subject to random tests throughout the season.				 																																	AIC president Sergio Campana has said sanctions against those who refused to give blood samples would have no basis in law. To speak about obligatory blood testing is not right. Every test needs the informed consent of the player, he said last week.				 																																	Hyderabad: Sania Mirza defeated Chantal Coombs 6-3, 6-4 to enter the pre-quarter finals of the Boca Raton Winter Classic ITF world ranking tennis tournament being held in Florida.				 																																	Sania had little difficulty in scripting a convincing win in the first set and stretched her form further to notch up a 6-4 victory in the second to leap into the last 16 stage, according to information reaching here on Wednesday.				 																																	Last week, Sania went down fighting to Petra Rampre of Slovakia 1-6, 6-1, 3-6 in the quarter finals of the Chris Evert ITF tournament held in Florida.

 Mickelson win inspires Henman 
 A shoulder injury has thrown Tim Henman off course in the recent past London: When Phil Mickelson sank a long putt on the final green to win his first Major in 47 starts this month, the Americans joy and relief was palpable. Across the Atlantic, British tennis player Tim Henman allowed himself a wry smile. Like Mickelson, Henman is regarded as one of the most naturally gifted exponents in his sport. Similarly like Mickelson, until that long-awaited US Masters victory at Augusta nine days ago, Henman has failed to deliver on that promise. Since reaching the quarter finals of Wimbledon in 1996, the Briton has played 29 Grand Slam tournaments  the tennis equivalent of the four golfing Majors. He has reached the semi-finals four times, on each occasion at Wimbledon, but has systematically failed to make the breakthrough. Still, though, Henman has resolutely plugged away and the serious-minded 29-year-old, who himself plays golf off a three handicap, recognises the parallels between himself and the American golfer. I think theres an element there, Henman said this week in Monte Carlo when asked if 33-year-old Mickelsons victory struck a chord. He obviously was very clear in the way that he felt he was developing his game and certainly I feel in the last six months my game has turned around so quickly. I feel that the way that Im playing, the way that Im beginning to use the abilities Ive got, theres no reason why I cant follow a similar path. For many years the spectre of seven-time champion Pete Sampras had haunted his Wimbledon dreams. More recently, a shoulder injury has thrown him off course. But undaunted, Henman continues along the path he believes will eventually lead him to the silverware his talents richly deserve. I would say 18 months ago, obviously a lot was dictated by my shoulder and there wasnt a great deal of direction, he says. But you know, lets face it, if its 25 or 35 years of age when you win a Major, I dont think anyones going to complain. Its important, you know, through the ups and downs, theres some difficult times, youve got to make sure you dont let yourself down mentally. I think thats something that Ive always been good at, and I think something that Mickelson has obviously shown.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

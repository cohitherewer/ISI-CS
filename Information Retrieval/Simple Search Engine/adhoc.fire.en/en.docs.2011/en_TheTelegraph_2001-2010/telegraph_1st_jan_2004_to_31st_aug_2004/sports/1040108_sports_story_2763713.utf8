The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB face Goan debutants
 - Defending NFL champions go into must-win match without Duley and Das  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Haywards will bank  on Serikis experience  Okoro is eligible  for selectionCalcutta: Its redemption time for East Bengal and coach Subhas Bhowmick. The teams fall from the sublime to the subjugated since a triumphant return from Jakarta, some six months ago, has invited strong criticism from various corners. All along Bhowmicks defence has been a single-point agenda  retaining the crown in the countrys premier tournament. Because, that means the ultimate honour here. That means opening of the door to a few continental championships as well. The team, however, did not got off to a start on expected lines in the National Football League (NFL). Eleven points from seven matches may not reflect the kind of confidence and courage, which once characterised and provided credence to the red-and-gold brigade. We saw those qualities blossom to the full in the ASEAN Club Championship and since then, these became first occasional, then rare and finally lost as East Bengal struggled to keep the momentum going in the wilderness of a heavy domestic schedule. But, Bhowmick  more a realist than a romantic  has stood up to it, saying the real push will come on home front. Well, come Thursday, East Bengal will be at home, meeting NFL debutants Haywards Sporting Club and the pressure is clearly on the coach. The next three matches are crucial for us, was how the East Bengal coach was envisioning his teams future on the match-eve. After the Goan team, East Bengal will take on Indian Bank in Chennai and Mohammedan Sporting here before the Derby clash with arch-rivals Mohun Bagan. My initial target is to collect at least 20 points from the first leg (of 11 matches). But I must say we are very much in contention, he said after the teams practice on Wednesday. He reasoned that almost all teams in the fray have very good foreign resources in their ranks and that has made the tournament more competitive. Describing their opponents as a fit and competitive side, Bhowmick, though, highlighted their inexperience as a weak point. But he quickly added: The NFL is getting more closely-fought each year because teams are now paying more attention to their foreign recruits. Nobody is underdog now and therefore, nothing should be taken for granted. Injuries to Sasthi Duley and Chandan Das, coupled with the yet-to-recover Douglas da Silva, should force Bhowmick to ponder at length over his midfield composition. But he refused to let his pressure, borne out of such circumstances, come out, revealing only that Bhaichung Bhutia will start upfront. However, Bhutias return to form, evinced in the previous two away matches  a 1-0 win over Mahindra United and 2-3 loss to Dempo  is a welcome relief for his coach at a time when the situation looks as much desperate as demanding. Haywards Sporting, on the other hand, boast of having the Maidan veteran Abdulateef Seriki and, creative midfielder Kamal Suliman and prolific scorer Dudu Omagbemi. The latter, however, will miss Thursdays tie owing to double booking. Unlike another debutant Mohammedan Sporting, the Goan team is at par with the defending champions point-wise. They have so far defeated JCT and Indian Bank, drawn with Vasco and lost to Churchill Brothers and current leaders Dempo. And such a confident beginning was clearly evident in coach Clifford Chukwumas words. We respect East Bengal, but are not afraid of them. Well be playing to our strength tomorrow and itll be a display of total football, said the Nigerian, who was originally a Haywards Sporting player, but forced by injuries had to don the coachs attire.  Okoro issue Meanwhile, East Bengals disciplinary body met Mike Okoro on Wednesday and decided to deduct 10 days salary. The Nigerian was showcaused for not joining the team for a couple of matches in Goa. It was also decided that he would be eligible for selection in the forthcoming matches. Okoro, thus, may well feature in the XI against Haywards on Thursday.  Copyright

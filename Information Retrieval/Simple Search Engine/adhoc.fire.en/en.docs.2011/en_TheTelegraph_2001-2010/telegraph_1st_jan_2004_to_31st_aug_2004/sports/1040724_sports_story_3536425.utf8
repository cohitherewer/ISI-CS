The Telegraph - Calcutta
 10-man Korea beat UAE 2-0
Jinan: Lee Dong-gook and Ahn Jung-hwan scored to give 10-man South Korea a 2-0 win over the United Arab Emirates in the Asian Cup on Friday. Victory left the Koreans on four points from two games, level on goal difference with Jordan at the top of group B. The UAE became the first team to be eliminated. South Korea took the lead through a Lee header four minutes before the break. Defender Park Jae-hong was then sent off in the 57th minute for a challenge on Ismail Matar, though replays showed no contact had been made. Ahn then made it 2-0 in injury time. By a rare coincidence, Jordan also battled with 10 men and beat Kuwait, courtesy two injury-time goals. Jordan, who had captain Faisal Ibrahim sent off in the 58th minute of a turgid encounter, scored through from Khaled Saed and Anas Al Zboun gave them all three points. (Reuters)  Copyright

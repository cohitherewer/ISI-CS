 Kaiser for sanctions against Lehmann
 Beckenbauer feels Lehmanns comments are in bad taste Berlin: Franz Beckenbauer has stepped into the ring in Germanys battle of the goalkeepers to call for sanctions against Jens Lehmann, who claimed he should replace Oliver Kahn as the national sides first choice. Arsenals Lehmann has stirred controversy in the soccer-mad country not only by saying he was the best and should be picked but also by criticising Kahns lifestyle. Lehmanns statements are cheeky, uncooperative and in bad taste, said Beckenbauer, the president of Kahns club Bayern Munich. (Germany coach) Rudi Voeller has to consider this carefully and act accordingly, the World Cup-winning captain and coach wrote in a column in Fridays mass-circulation Bild daily. Beckenbauer was the German coach when he had to face a similar situation at the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico. Harald (Toni) Schumacher was then Germanys No. 1 and reserve Uli Stein, out of frustration, verbally attacked Beckenbauer, who dropped him from the team and sent him home. Voeller said on Thursday that he would travel to London over the next couple of weeks to talk to Lehmann but would not be drawn on whether he might take sanctions. Reserve goalkeeper Lehmann and Kahn, the undisputed No. 1, make no secret of their difficult relationship. I didnt know we were supposed to talk, Lehmann told Thursdays issue of soccer magazine Kicker when asked why the two did not speak to each other. I dont have a 24-year-old girlfriend. I have a different life. Lehmann was referring to Kahns affair with a Munich barmaid which started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in Germany for weeks. I am deeply hurt by Lehmanns statements, said Kahn, who plans to carry on until the 2006 World Cup finals on home soil. This is as low as it can get. Kahn, at 34 the same age as Lehmann, was Germanys No. 2 goalkeeper for years and had to wait until Andreas Koepke retired after the 1998 World Cup in France to become the No. 1. The problem for Lehmann is that he might be regarded as too old to take over by the time Kahn ends his international career.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

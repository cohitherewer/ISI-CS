The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wright boost for Indians
Chennai: India may have lost yet another final but coach John Wright on Monday had encouraging words for his demoralised players saying that it was just a matter of fine-tuning certain aspects of the game to be able to win these high pressure matches. Wright said although the target of 229 was achievable it was difficult to bat on the track with the ball coming on to the bat slowly. It is a matter of winning those games. We lacked little things like fielding in the end and missed chances here and there. I think we are a much better team to play first in final encounters and the toss plays a vital role, Wright said after the teams arrival here. India lost the final of the Asia Cup by 25 runs against Sri Lanka last night, suffering their 10th defeat in 13 finals in tournaments involving more than two teams. Asked whether 229 was an achievable target, the former New Zealand captain said yes. It was a gettable target. But it was not going to be an easy target on such a wicket. Certainly it became difficult to bat on. The coach gave full credit to Sri Lanka for the victory saying the hosts bowled very well on the track. Let me put it down that there were two factors (for the loss). They bowled very well and certainly the wicket was lot harder to bat on. You got to give credit to them that they bowled well on it. They had a smooth total and played very well in the firs 15 overs. We did not bat as well as we can. On whether dropping Kumar Sangakkaras catch cost India the match, Wright said I think that was one of the reasons. But it was not an easy chance. Sangakkara was dropped by V. V. S. Laxman at first slip when he was on six and then went on to score a 82-ball 53 and also built a partnership of 116 runs with his skipper Maravan Atapattu for the third wicket. Asked whether the team needed a specialist wicketkeeper for one-day Internationals, Wright said the new selection panel in September may look into the situation. ... Probably once a new set of selection panel is set in September they might take a look at the situation. But we need to start planning right now for it so that the balance is made up and you do not go back to 2003. The Indians had asked Rahul Dravid to double up as a wicketkeeper just ahead of the 2003 World Cup to lend more depth to the batting line-up.  (PTI) Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Amittrajit claims pole position
	 - National racing championship  BY SUJIT BHAR  FISSME cars negotiate a turn in the qualifying round for the first leg of the seventh national racing championship in Rajarhat on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta, Feb. 28: The dust rises with the wind, fly ash is on the streets, and that is the track. In Rajarhat, on the eastern fringes of the city, there is a race happening Sunday. Saturday, against the slant of the sun, city boy Amittrajit Ghosh claimed pole position in the LGB (1300 cc) class and he starts in second best position in the Formula India Single-Seater Maruti Engine (800 cc) class. An extraordinary performance, considering the limited practice he has had with these racers, and more so, because this is the first time he has ever sat in an LGB racer, leave alone drive it. The qualifiers threw up a good deal of dust  roadside deposits, that urgently need to be cleared if, as Federation of Motorsport Clubs of India president Vicky Chandhok has claimed, safety is of prime consideration  and reasonable supply of speedy youngsters. As expected, this JK Tyre-sponsored (presented by Maruti-Susuki and Speed) seventh national racing championship sees several graduates from the national karting championship. One such, Gaurav Gill of New Delhi, claimed pole in the FISSME category. The pole in the saloon class for this (Esteems all) was grabbed by J.D. Madan. Ghoshs seventh lap (of nine) was his best, traversed in 1:32.953. Interestingly it was way better than second-placed Ameya Walavalkars (Mumbai) best lap (fourth, at 1:33.366), as well as national karting champion Rayomand Bannajees (from Pune, seventh 1:34.705). Bannajee finished third. A clutch plate welding problem pushed Ghosh off the top in the FISSME class. His gap with Gill is narrow, and if he can get over his slow starts in the finals Sunday, Ghosh can claim top honours. Ghosh has raced the FISSME on the Chennai race track. But this was very different, he said later. The margin of error is little here, no set standards of a set racer track, only natural instinct in play. This was the very first time I even sat in an LGB (these have become a full race category only this year), and with the extra power I was feeling much better (than FISSME). A career-best qualifying under these circumstances, is creditable. Sunday morning the best racers line up on the gird for the three prime categories over the 2.8 km stretch. The finesse of a class race affair will be lacking and, a la the regime of the state, the general poverty of the mind just might show. However, the beginning has been good, and what cant new brooms sweep from the surface. The bright point of these races will be a lesson from the JK support team of technicians. The speedy handling of situations like a broken fender or tie-rod or a torn-off suspension will make the difference in the pit lane. This will be a race organised by The Ramakrishna Race Performance Management Pvt. Ltd, a company set up by veteran rallyist Arindam Ghosh (Amittrajits father). A better understanding with the Bengal Motor Sports Club could have brought in more of the local technical help and a bit more glitz, but despite somewhat shorn of class, the speed will be around, thankfully.

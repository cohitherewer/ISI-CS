				 																																	Auckland: An Olympic gold and silver medallist was one of two people killed on Friday when their ex-French air force jet trainer crashed into the sea east of Auckland, officials said.				 																																	Yachting New Zealand said Olympic gold medal-winning yachtsman Chris Timms, 56, was one of the dead. The other man has not been named.				 																																	A witness who saw the jet crash said the 1960 Fouga Magister plane had been doing aerobatics before crashing into the sea.				 																																	Sailing with Rex Sellars, Timms won gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and silver at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, both times in the tornado class.				 																																	Marcoussis: France players underwent a random doping test on Thursday here, where they are training for Sundays Six Nations match against Scotland.				 																																	All the players had to submit to the test ordered by the French Sports ministry. Everything went smoothly. We have no worries, a team spokesman said.				 																																	The only French rugby international involved in a doping case is prop Pieter de Villiers, who tested positive for cocaine and ecstasy during a training session with his Stade Francais club in December 2001.				 																																	De Villiers was not officially punished because French anti-doping laws state that stimulants can only be sought in tests taking place during competitions but the French Rugby Federation left him out of the 2002 Six Nations. After missing the World Cup because of shoulder injury, he has been recalled to the team and was in Marcoussis on Thursday. 				 																																	Berlin: An unusual proposal has stirred debate before Saturdays Bundesliga game between strugglers Hertha Berlin and champions Bayern Munich.

The clubs officials called the idea to reward an own goal ridiculous and in bad taste but one Bayern player did find it funny.

Premier League rivals Chelsea and Liverpool, Scottish Premier League Celtic, Italian Serie A clubs AC Milan and AS Roma and German giants Bayern Munich make up the Champions World series.

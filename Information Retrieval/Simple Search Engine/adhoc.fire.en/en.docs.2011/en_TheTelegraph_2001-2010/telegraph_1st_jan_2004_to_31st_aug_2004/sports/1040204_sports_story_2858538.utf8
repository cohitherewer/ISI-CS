The Telegraph - Calcutta
 15-year-old stuns Shruti 
Bangalore: Kanika Minocha, the 15-year-old from Chandigarh, created the biggest upset in the opening round of the 87th all-India ladies amateur golf championship matchplay tournament, toppling the top seed and defending champion Shruti Khanna here on Tuesday. Seeded 16th, Kanika won 2-up on the last hole. One bad shot was all Shruti needed to crash out of the event. Leading 1-up till the 15th, Shruti had just 100 yards to green on the par-4 16th while her opponent was in the jungle on the right. Seeing her opponent on the green in three, Shruti took it a little easy and landed in the water hazard on the left. While Kanika ended up with a bogey, the Delhi lass lost two strokes on that hole and perhaps the match. Kanika made two superb pars on the finishing holes of the stipulated round while Shruti ended up with bogeys.  In a see-saw battle on the front nine, Kanika managed to get a slender 2-0 lead after she had drawn first blood on the third. Shruti did come up with a brillant show on her return journey and birdied the difficult 10th hole to reduce the margin and went on to draw level on the 12th. A par on the 14th gave Shruti a slender lead that she maintained till the 15th. Meanwhile, in the silver division, barring a minor upset where 11th seed Dimple Singh of Noida beat sixth seed F.K. Sharma, the other top seeds advanced into the second round without much ado. Bhavana Shetty bagged the Stableford competition honours with a score of 36.  (PTI)  Copyright

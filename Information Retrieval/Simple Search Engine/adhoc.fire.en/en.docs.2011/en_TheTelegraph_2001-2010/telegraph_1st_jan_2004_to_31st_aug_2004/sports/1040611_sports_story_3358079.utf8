The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Montgomery not running today
 - GOLDEN LEAGUE 
- Meet under dope cloud  Montgomery is fighting on Bergen (Norway): The 2004 Golden League circuit of six top-class meetings settles into its starting blocks here Friday with the sport of athletics rocked by the doping scandal in the US. Even Kenenisa Bekeles 10,000m world record in Ostrava Tuesday failed to lift the gloom which deepened when it was reported Wednesday that 100m world record holder Tim Montgomery has been warned by American anti-doping authorities that he faces charges of doping violations. Montgomery and Olympic relay medallist Chryste Gaines reportedly received warning letters from the US Anti-Doping Agency, relating to the probe into the California-based BALCO laboratory, which has been linked with the designer steroid THG. Montgomery, who has vowed to fight any charges, will not be among the starters Friday in a meeting moved from its traditional home in Oslo due to rebuilding work on the historic Bislett Stadium. Just six weeks before the Athens Olympics, many stars are still easing into their competitive season but any athlete hoping to emulate Maria Mutola and win the $ 1 million jackpot must win their event at every meeting. The mens 200m boasts an outstanding line-up including reigning world champion John Capel of the US and veteran Frankie Fredericks, a former world champion, along with rising US prospect Justin Gatlin. Russias Yuriy Borzakovskiy takes on world champion Djabir Said Guerni of Algeria in the 800m with gold in Athens on both of their minds, although Wilfred Bungei of Kenya has the years fastest time and will line up too.

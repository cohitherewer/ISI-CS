The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zidane best, says Beckham
Madrid: David Beckham has described Zinedine Zidane as the greatest player in the world and nominated the French playmaker as the Real Madrid teammate with whom he links best. Beckham told Cope radio station on Tuesday that he loved playing alongside Zidane, who in December was voted the Fifa Footballer of the Year for the third time. Zidane is the greatest player in the world, said Beckham. I get on well with him and he is the one who understands me best. He is the sort of player who makes special things happen on the field. Ronaldo is also special because every time he has the ball you know that he could score. The England captain also fuelled the rumours that Real will re-enter the transfer market at the end of the season to add one of the worlds top strikers  his former Manchester United teammate Ruud van Nistelrooy, Thierry Henry, Michael Owen or Francesco Totti  to their formidable squad.

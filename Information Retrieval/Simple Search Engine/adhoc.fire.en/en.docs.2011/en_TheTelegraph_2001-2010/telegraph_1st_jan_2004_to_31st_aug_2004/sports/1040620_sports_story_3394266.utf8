The Telegraph - Calcutta
 King may help Bengal probables
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, June 19: Team India trainer Gregory King is likely to spend a day or two with the Bengal players at the pre-season conditioning camp currently underway at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Training Centre. King is scheduled to arrive on Monday. As there is a break between the Bangalore and Chennai camps, he may come here which will be good for the state players, a CAB source said on Saturday. Bengal began training for the forthcoming season on Friday under assistant coach Satinder Singh. Physio Ranadeep Moitra is also expected to join on Monday. Moitra, incidentally, assisted King at the Bangalore camp. According to the source, it was at Sourav Gangulys request that King, in between his busy schedule, has agreed to spend time with the Bengal Ranji Trophy probables.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Voeller steps down
- Ottmar Hitzfeld favoured to take over
Almancil: Germany coach Rudi Voeller resigned on Thursday after the three-times world and European champions were knocked out of Euro 2004. Germany drew their first two group matches, including a 0-0 result with debutants Latvia, before going down to the Czech Republic 2-1 on Wednesday in Group D. The Czechs were playing their second string team. The 44-year-old Voeller said the national side needed a new start before the 2006 World Cup in Germany. I have the feeling that only someone who is untarnished and has a certain credibility  like I had four years ago  can do the job over the next two years, he said. Voeller told team officials overnight and they had asked him not to make a hasty decision. He told us it was not a spur-of-the-moment decision taken just after the game. We regret this decision very much but we have to accept it, said German federation president Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder. Voeller had a contract until the World Cup in 2006. Ottmar Hitzfeld is the clear favourite to replace Voeller and is ready to accept the challenge. It is certain that Ottmar Hitzfeld will play a role in the discussion, German Football Association (DFB) president Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder said on Thursday. Hitzfeld himself has repeated his interest in the job. After the resignation of Rudi Voeller, it would be a logical step for me to become national team coach, Hitzfeld said. Voeller was jeered by German fans after the Czech defeat and was close to tears in the post-match news conference.I had it in my head already that I would probably not go on. It would be fatal to hang on to the job and carry on regardless. Meanwhile, immediately after Voellers announcement German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in a hastily-called press conference, said: I feel very sad. For all involved, the priority is now to build a national team that can play with the best. Inaki Saez resigns too Spanish coach Inaki Saez has tendered his resignation, according to media. Saez caved in to intense pressure, several newspapers said, after the media attacked his announcement on Tuesday that he planned to lead Spains qualifying campaign for the next World Cup.

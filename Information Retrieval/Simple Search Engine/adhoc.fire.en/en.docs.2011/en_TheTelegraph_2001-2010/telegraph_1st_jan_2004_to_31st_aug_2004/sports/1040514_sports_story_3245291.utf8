India, who are playing the tournament with several youngsters, scored both their goals in the first half. Arjun Halappa put India ahead in the 22nd minute with a field goal, before talented youngster Sandeep Singh made it 2-0 with a neatly-executed drag-flick in the 30th minute, according to information received here. Meanwhile in the womens tournament, the second string Indian team was trailing 0-4 to Asian Games gold medallists China before the game was suspended 17 minutes into the second half due to heavy rains.

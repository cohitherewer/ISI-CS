The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Players confident of making semi-finals
 Gagan feels a medal isnt out of reach Barog (Himachal Pradesh): Urging the critics not to write them off, top Indian hockey players Wednesday said that the current team was the best-ever side in 20 years and had the potential to win a medal at the Athens Olympics. The players, attending a fitness camp here, pleaded not to read too much into the recent performances saying the team was preserving its best for mega event. Hockey has the best chance of fetching India an Olympic medal. We know our abilities and no doubt we have the wherewithal to win a medal, forward Gagan Ajit Singh said. Captain Dilip Tirkey was equally upbeat about Indias chances but said the team needed to bridge a few gaps to win the medal that has eluded the country in the last five Olympics. Indias last medal, a gold, came in the boycott-marred Moscow Olympics in 1980. We were unlucky to miss the semi-final berths in last three Games. There will be no repeat of the mistakes that we made on previous occasions, Tirkey said. But we need to be a little more consistent. We always play well against tough opponents but fail to carry that momentum against weaker ones. So may be our mental approach needs to be a little different. This mental approach seems to be bothering the side for quite some time now. On several occasions complacency of the players has witnessed a complete turn-around in the teams fate in crucial matches. To do away with this, the team management is leaving no stone unturned at the camp. Besides following a strict fitness regime, we are doing meditation. This will certainly help us in becoming mentally tougher and maintaining our cool in crunch situations, said Tirkey. The players have also realised that winning penalty corners is important for teams success at the Athens Olympics. They also admit that their eagerness to score on every opportunity is forcing them to make some glaring mistakes. This is also going to help the team as scoring goals from penalty corners will be easier after the introduction of the new rules, coming into effect June 1. (PTI)  Copyright

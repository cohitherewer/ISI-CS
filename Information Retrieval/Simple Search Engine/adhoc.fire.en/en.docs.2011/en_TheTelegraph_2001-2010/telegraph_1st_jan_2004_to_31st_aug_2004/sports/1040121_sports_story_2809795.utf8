The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sending second string a big mistake
 - Kamaldeep, Sandeep were major let-downs in Kuala Lumpur
 Stickwork / Gurbux Singh Indian hockey was just about coming  out of the shadows of the likes of cricket. The man on the  street was slowly noticing how the sport was trudging back  towards those good old days. Then came this years Sultan  Azlan Shah Cup! I think it was a folly to send  such an under-strength team to this tournament. If we had  to experiment  as we should, a view I have already espoused   there should be limits to it, like two-three players.  You just cant virtually just change the whole team! And  if we were not sending a good team, we should have stayed  out altogether. The fact is this: Australia have already  qualified, we have not. For us it was more important to  have tried out our best combination again (with young inputs),  preparing for the Tests versus Holland and the Olympic qualifiers  scheduled for March. As I see it, not only has our  gain from this tournament been a big zero, we have also  injured our three most senior players in the process  Baljit  Singh Saini was injured at the camp itself, Baljit Singh  Dhillon broke his nose during the tournament, and then Dhanraj  Pillay hurt his knee.  These were the three players who  should have been rested in the first place. Now they have  the task of recuperating before the Tests in early February. It was really sad to see that  the not one among those who were supposed to shine in Kuala  Lumpur, did show talent worthy of the top level, whatever  the reason for that may be.  If I still have to pick some,  Id say forward Arjun Halappa performed reasonably well  and medio Vikram Pillay to an extent. But consider the likes  of goalkeeper Kamaldeep Singh, or forward Sandeep Michael,  the one over who there was so much hype last year as find  of the meet. They feature nowhere now. Neither did Len Ayappa  measure upto anything. Think what the result would have  been if we had a proper senior line-up. Frankly, I did not  expect much from this team, and I was proved right. I would  have still been happy had even two-three new players shown  some talent and fighting spirit. They did get goals in every  match, but then in modern hockey that is always possible. The bigger problem is that this  defeat could have an adverse effect on the senior team itself.  I believe it will affect the morale of the players in the  senior team, and of the country in general. People do not  know our hockey players as well as they know the cricketers.  Hence many would not be aware whether it was a totally second  string team, or a first team. For them, simply, India performed  disastrously. It all boils down to national pride. Such total overhauling of a team  was okay if there wasnt any target in front of you (this  year the Athens Olympics). Do it immediately after the Olympics,  I have no problem. Not now. If we dont qualify for the Olympics,  history will be created, and not a very happy one at that. Age-wise there isnt much difference  between the new ones, many of those already in the senior  team. But look at the vast difference in standard. While  almost 90 per cent of those who shone in the junior category  even a few years back are now in the senior team, I see  no second line coming up. That worries me. One problem could be of age-cheats.  I believe the age cheats are getting through too easily.  We should start identifying talent between the age 17 and  20 and give them exposure, so in two-three years we can  get four-six kids with talent. But before that one must  be sure one is letting in genuine juniors.  Only one tournament in the country,  the under-14 K.D. Singh Babu meet in Lucknow (with former  Olympian Jhamanlal Sharma in charge), has strict age checks.  That level of checking is necessary everywhere. It is a  plague that needs to be tackled on a war-footing. I was pleasantly surprised to  see the game of Pakistan and Australia at the Azlan Shah  Cup. I was not very impressed, though, with the coaching  of Pakistans Dutch coach Roelant Oltmans. I think Pakistan  conceded some soft field goals, and this isnt the way European  hockey is played. But their forward line was really a revelation.  Shabbir Hossain on the left, Rehan Butt on the right, captain  Muhammad Nadeem and forward Kashif Jawaad and Mohammed Wasim  (arguably the best half back in world hockey today). Fantastic  star-cast and fine tactic. Then, of course, there is the  impeccable Sohail Abbas. The Germans looked solid, but  I thought they went into a decline after a good start. Reverse  was the case with the Australians. They started sluggishly,  and improved with each match, finally showing a vastly improved  team as they played the final. Not many players in the Australian  team were what we could call brilliant, but as a team they  controlled the game very well. They were one of the fittest  sides in the meet and of course, two-three senior players  were kept home because of injuries. With them, Australia  are sure to present a formidable side at the Olympics. Spain were quite workmanlike and  except for the fighting spirit and the fitness, there isnt  much still in the South Korean team. Copyright

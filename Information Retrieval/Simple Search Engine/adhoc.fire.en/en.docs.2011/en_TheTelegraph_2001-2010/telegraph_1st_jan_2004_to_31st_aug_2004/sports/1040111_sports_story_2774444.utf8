 Venus 3rd seed as Serena pulls out
Perth, Jan. 10 (AFP): Venus Williams will be the third seed for the Australian Open tennis championship after the withdrawal of her sister and defending champion Serena from the event, tournament director Paul McNamee said today. McNamee said he was disappointed Serena had pulled out of the event, citing ongoing problems with her left knee. The former world No. 1 had surgery in Los Angeles for the problem last August. She had been scheduled to play in the Hopman Cup international mixed teams event in Perth this week, but pulled out at the last minute to be replaced by Lindsay Davenport. Serena broke the news on her official web-site. I really looked forward to competing in the Australian Open. However, conferring with my trainers and coaches, we really dont think that sufficient time to prepare and train for it. she wrote.  Copyright

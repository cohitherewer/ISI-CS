 Obligado wins a thriller 

 BY STAR RACER
				 										Calcutta: Expected to land the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup untroubled on Friday, the half-money favourite Obligado had to battle it out for a neck victory against Bharath Singhs Allodium. Mallesh Narredu partnered the Indictment-Ensenada five-year-old.
				 										Going by their recent encounter in the 1,600m Gold Cup, terms of the race were heavily against Allodium. However, the eight-year-old ridden by C. Alford issued a strong challenge in the last furlong of the race to go down fighting.
				 										Earlier, luck smiled on Bharaths Bollywood Dreams who won the 1,400m Indian Champagne Stakes in a facile manner. With Daniels Lake O Gold leading erratically upfront and taking most of the fancied runners very wide at the final turn, the 110-1 rank outsider  on the totalisator  who was trailing the 10  horse field, grasped the rails side wide opening to score easily. Mark Reuben partnered the the Steinbeck-Liberty son to victory.

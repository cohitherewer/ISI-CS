The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real overcome first-half blues
 - EUROPEAN ROUND-UP 
- Milan stay five points clear of Roma; Valencia bow to lowly Espanyol  Massimo Ambrosini of AC Milan scores through a spectacular diving header against Lazio during their Serie A clash at the Olympic Stadium in Rome on Sunday Madrid: Real Madrid took full advantage of slip-ups by title rivals Valencia and Deportivo Coruna as they stretched their lead at the top of the table to eight points with a 4-2 victory over struggling Celta Vigo on Sunday. Celta looked anything but relegation candidates as they eclipsed Real in the first half and took a deserved lead thanks to a close-range strike from Sasa Ilic on 18 minutes. But Real roared back to life in the second half and well-worked goals from Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo put them 3-1 in front. Celta striker Savo Milosevic grabbed a late consolation with a cool finish on the break but Real had the final say when Zidane notched his second and his sides fourth in injury time. Earlier, Valencia had come unstuck when they went down 1-2 to struggling Espanyol at a snowy Montjuic, while in Sundays late match Deportivo Coruna lost 2-3 to a rejuvenated Barcelona in a thrilling match at the Riazor. The Catalans appeared to be heading for a comfortable win as they stormed into a 3-0 lead after 48 minutes thanks to a double from the brilliant Ronaldinho and a close-range strike from Javier Saviola following a magnificent passing move involving Xavi and Giovanni van Bronckhorst. But substitute Walter Pandiani put Deportivo right back in the game with two goals in five minutes, both coming from expert headers after defender Enrique Romero had floated the ball into the area. There was a heart-stopping finale when Barcelona midfielder Thiago Motta was controversially sent off for a foul committed by a teammate and Deportivo striker Albert Luque somehow contrived to put the ball over the bar from point-blank range. Frank Rijkaards side now trails Deportivo by just four points in fourth place, while the Galicians remain one adrift of Valencia. Against all expectations, Radomir Antics Celta made an explosive start at the Bernabeu, creating a string of scoring chances in the opening minutes. Carlos Queirozs Real side did not manage a shot on goal until Raul fired a snap shot from the edge of the area after a quarter of an hour and it was the visitors who took the lead three minutes later. Ilic made the most of some slack marking from the Real defence to poke in from close range after an Alexander Mostovoi corner had fallen to his feet. Real, jeered off by their fans at half-time, continued to look shaky after the restart and Iker Casillas had to react quickly to block a sharp shot from Savo Milosevic in the 54th minute. But a minute later, they got the breakthrough that changed the course of the match. Ronaldo stabbed in from close range after Pinto had failed to hold a David Beckham header to bring the Brazilian strikers tally for the season to 22 goals. Real now oozed confidence and after 64 minutes they took the lead when Zidane met a pin-point Luis Figo cross with an expert header. Figo himself scored Reals third when he raced on to an excellent lofted pass from Beckham, controlled with his thigh and beat Pinto with a low, angled shot. Although Milosevic cut Reals lead with a well-taken goal in the 90th minute, Zidane made it 4-2 with a great finish from the edge of the area after more good work from the outstanding Figo. Status quo in Serie A Midfielder Massimo Ambrosinis goal gave AC Milan a 1-0 win over Lazio on Sunday that preserved their five-point cushion at the top of Serie A. In earlier matches, AS Roma came from behind to crush Parma 4-1 while champions Juventus brushed aside Ancona 3-0 to keep up the pressure on Milan. The results left Milan on 58 points from 23 games, ahead of second-placed Roma (53) and Juventus (52). Milan, smarting from a 0-4 Italian Cup loss to Lazio in Rome earlier this month, nearly took a 17th-minute lead when Brazilian Cafu fired narrowly wide. The home side grew in confidence as the first half progressed with Claudio Lopez coming closest to scoring when he narrowly missed connecting with a superb cross from Stefano Fiore. Lazio continued to press after the interval, but failed to break down Milans solid defence. The game seemed to be heading for a draw before a lapse by Lazios defence allowed midfielder Ambrosini enough space to head Clarence Seedorfs cross past keeper Angelo Peruzzi in the 75th minute and secure all three points for the visitors. Lazios city rivals Roma did well to come from behind to beat Parma. Romas form during February had been blighted by the kind of inconsistency highlighted by the scoreless draw with bottom-placed Ancona that followed their sparkling 4-0 defeat of Juventus. A 30th-minute lob by striker Alberto Gilardino put Parma ahead, but Italian international Antonio Cassano equalised seconds before the interval, latching on to a Francesco Totti pass before rounding keeper Sebastien Frey and firing into the roof of the net. Roma grabbed the lead seven minutes after the break, when Emerson poked an Olivier Dacourt through-ball past Frey. A 70th-minute free-kick by Totti and an opportunistic goal from a rebound by Brazilian midfielder Mancini sealed the victory. At Turins Stadio Delle Alpi, Juventus gave a convincing response to criticism by their president Umberto Agnelli that they had fallen short of last seasons standards, recording a comfortable victory over Ancona. Midfielder Mauro Camoranesi gave the home team the lead in the seventh minute with a looping right-footed drive. The Italian champions then survived a spell of pressure by Ancona before a Fabrizio Miccoli tap-in and a curling close-range finish by Alessandro Del Piero wrapped up the 3-0 win before the interval. There was no such joy for sixth-placed Inter Milan, whose chances of snatching Italys fourth Champions League berth appear to be fading after gaping holes in defence allowed Brescia to overturn a 0-1 deficit to win 3-1. Serbian midfielder Dejan Stankovic headed Inter ahead three minutes after the break. Brazilian striker Adriano wasted an opportunity to double Inters lead in the 66th minute, when he failed to lift the ball over prostrate keeper Luca Castellazzi. Barely a minute later visiting striker Andrea Caracciolo showed him how to do it, delicately lobbing Francesco Toldo to level the score. Brescia midfielder Simone Del Nero then took advantage of slack marking to nod the ball home from close range in the 73rd minute and Caracciolo sealed the result nine minutes from time with a deflected header.

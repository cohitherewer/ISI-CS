The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Im not a sadist and I dont have malice: Brett Lee 
 - Everybody says a tour to India is an education and, hopefully, Ill be there next season  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Lee says Lillee taught him patience and to not try to blast batsmen out Sydney: Fashion designer, pianist and guitarist... Well, the 27-year-old Brett Lee is also a hit man. His four-year career may have been affected by injuries but, when he has struck the right notes, the batsmen have ducked. Lee, who hopes to keep his place in the Test beginning on Friday, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the decider. The following are excerpts: Q Youve just completed your comeback (at the MCG). How did the body respond? A Pretty good... The wicket wasnt as green and bouncy as wed thought and, so, it was tough... How long did it take you to find rhythm? Actually, the satisfaction came during one of the spells on the fourth afternoon. I didnt get a wicket, but felt nice... I bowled one at 144 kmp and, yes, had that satisfying feeling. Given that your Test debut was at the MCG itself, versus India (1999-2000), you must have been more comfortable... I was, but I was also determined on rising to the occasion against such a quality line-up... The SCG is your home ground. Are you excited that a role awaits you in the deciding Test of a big series? Because of Steve (Waugh), its going to be such a big occasion... I mean, 30,000 turned up at the MCG on the last morning, knowing that the game would end quickly... They did it for Steve and, if anything, its going to be bigger at the SCG... Simply walking out with him is going to be an experience. But the SCG isnt exactly known to thrill fast bowlers... Sure, it doesnt have that type of wicket, but its my home turf and Im familiar with every blade of grass. Your latest break from international cricket was for over two months. Arent such layoffs depressing? (Laughs) Of course, its hard... I make sure I dont watch too much cricket because, often, theres the urge to jump into the TV and help out the guys... Indeed, Im very disappointed I missed the last Test series in India as also the recent tri-series... From what Ive gathered, its difficult bowling there  which, in a way, makes it more challenging  and, then, its essential to be exposed to so much passion. Apparently, fans both love and hate us... Everybody says a tour to India is an education and, hopefully, Ill be there next season. Do you lose sleep over the possibility of again getting injured? Look, with so much rotation and movement, the bowling action is quite an unnatural thing for the body... Therefore, the risk of greater wear-and-tear is always there, more so for fast bowlers. One has to accept injuries to the extent possible. How much have you matured in the past four years? Ive learnt to bowl in different conditions... In the last 18 months, specially, my one-day game has really come on... Today, Im better with the line and length and you wont find me going for too many in an over. But, yes, Im seeking to improve in Test cricket and have a target of at least four wickets in every game. The more the opportunities I create, the better the chances of a bigger tally. In fact, Ive learnt a lot bowling with Glenn McGrath. Like what? Trying that off-line, bowling in that corridor of uncertainty... Ive learnt a bit from Glenns mindset too... Hes always positive, always stays convinced that he can knock batsmen over... Actually, Ive also learnt from Steve, another very positive person. If you hang around positive individuals, some of that energy is going to rub off on you. Have you had a personal bowling coach? Dont think I can call him that, but Im indebted to Dennis Lillee. Hes taught me the importance of being patient, of not trying to blast batsmen out... Whats on in your mind when youve reached the top of your run-up? Try not to think too much, try not to have a million things in the head... Ive been learning from Glenn who, when in rhythm, recounts a song at the top of his mark... That helps relax and focus better. So, when Im feeling good, even I play a song. That done, I only think of line and length. Did you play one at the MCG? (Laughs again) I did, before I got Rahul Dravid (second innings)... However, Im not going to let out too many things. Suffice to say the song wasnt Muqabala, Muqabala... How do you feel when a bouncer hits the batsman? A bouncer is a vital part of the bowlers set-up and, in any case, batsmen have so much protective gear... Having said that, the idea is not to cause harm, but use it as a weapon within limits prescribed by law. Surely, Im not a sadist and I dont have malice. Its generally believed you have a psychological hold over the Indians... Not sure about it, but if theres a Brett Lee factor then, well, Im pleased. Its not that I see myself as somebody special, though... Im part of a team and bowl in partnerships... Are you obsessed with speed? Speed is my biggest asset and thats why Im in the Australian team... The fastest Ive clocked is 160.7 kmp during the last World Cup... Given the aggressive role you play, does unwinding take time? On the field, Im very intense... Very serious... Off it, Im quite a placid person. I play the guitar, the piano and the mouth organ... Sing a bit too for my band (Six and Out)... That takes my mind off cricket. Also, I enjoy fishing and shopping. Much is made of your rivalry with Shoaib Akhtar... Were close friends... When he got past 160 (again, in the World Cup), I called him up... And, when I went beyond 160, he rang me... Shoaibs a great guy and the world needs more of his kind as people like an express bowler to come steaming in, hair flapping... He loves taking wickets and the crowds love this superb athlete. Has brother Shane been a big influence? Absolutely... I would call him my mentor... Its a pity a bad knee made him quit cricket at a young age... My brother apart, I learnt from Lillee and looked up to Allan Donald as well. How is your clothing label doing? (Smiles) Doing well... Ive got an outlet in Sydney itself and much of the designing is done by me... During the recent lay-off, I spent quite a bit of my time designing stuff for the next season... Your band, one understands, is quite a rage... Were busy during winters... We play in pubs, there are corporate gigs... Whats remarkable is that all five of us are cricketers... While my brother, Gavin Robertson and I have played for Australia, the other two  Brad McNamara and Richard Chee-qee have done duty for New South Wales... Were serious about Six and Out, at the same time, not that serious. The last question: Are you target-driven? Like Ive stated, I aim for at least four wickets in any Test and, having got to 135, my first target is reaching 200...  Copyright

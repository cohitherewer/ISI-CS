The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Imran Khan for Aaqib as bowling coach 
 - Bowlers perspective is needed to iron out problem  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Imran wants the PCB to act quicklyAaqib will be the right choice, feels ImranLahore: Despite a significant drop in no balls and wides in Wednesdays decider at the Gaddafi, former captain Imran Khan favours the immediate appointment of Aaqib Javed as Pakistans bowling coach. Aaqib, whose own bowling was fine-tuned by Imran, coached the U-19s to the World Cup title earlier this month.Look, we arent talking of rocket-science or something as intimidating... Our bowlers problem is specific to their run-up. And, so, we need a former bowler to set that right... Give Aaqib ten days and the problem will be a thing of the past, Imran told The Telegraph. Now a Member of the National Assembly from native Mianwali, Imran was responding to coach Javed Miandads appeal that he himself work with the Shoaib Akhtars to eliminate frequent over-stepping (and cut down on wides). After conceding as many as 98 sundries through no balls and wides in the first four ODIs, the Pakistani bowlers gifted only ten in the decider. Spending time isnt an issue. Having said that, the team needs a full-time bowling coach, because the captain (Inzamam-ul Haq), coach and manager (Haroon Rashid) are and were batsmen... A bowlers perspective is needed to iron out a basic problem. In fact, I remember working with Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis to get their run-up right... It was the same with Aaqib, Imran pointed out. He added: Today, there are specialists to work on specific problems and, if one exists, that should be acknowledged and the right person appointed... This (one-day) series has shown that a bowling coach is needed. In my view, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) must act quickly. The PCB, one understands, is considering doing so. Incidentally, Darryl Foster has already worked in that capacity  in an ad-hoc manner, though. Imran, who had a session with the bowlers during the pre-series conditioning camp here, indicated he could have a short interaction with them before the first Test, in Multan, from Sunday.

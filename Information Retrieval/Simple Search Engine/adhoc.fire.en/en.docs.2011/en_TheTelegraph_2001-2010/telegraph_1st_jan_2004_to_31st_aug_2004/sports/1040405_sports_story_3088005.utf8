The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gaddafi air astir even as Moin pulls out
 - SECOND TEST - Danish Kaneria, a Hindu with roots in Surat, set to feature in Pak XI; Sehwag hit at nets, but fine  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami perform stretching exercises during training in Lahore on Sunday. (Reuters) Lahore: The last Indo-Pak Test at the Gaddafi, over 14 years ago, produced as many yawns as runs. Now, with the hosts trailing in the three-match series, there may not be even one dull moment once the second Test gets underway on Monday. While Pakistan must not lose, if they are to stay alive till Rawalpindi, stand-in captain Rahul Dravid will be looking to wrap it up before Sourav Ganguly takes back the reins. Of course, he insisted that harping on the innings victory in Multan wouldnt be quite the right approach. With the wicket green and promising bounce, the toss could play a bigger role than usual. Dravid, however, pointed out that calling correctly alone isnt going to make a difference: Youve got to make the toss count, as we did in Multan... The build-up to Test No. 2 hasnt been without drama  and, one isnt alluding to curator Andy Atkinson and the surface. Indeed, the action has involved players, with senior pro Moin Khan pulling out with a groin strain and Virender Sehwag getting away with a bruise after being hit by Ajit Agarkar at Sundays nets. Sehwag, Indias one and only triple centurion, was struck around the left knee-roll and was painful enough for him to collapse. Fortunately, it didnt lead to anything more than a bruise. The Moin-development has come as a boon for young Kamran Akmal. Hes no rookie, but hasnt been getting many opportunities. More than anybody else, then, he will grab this call-up with both hands. Leggie Danish Kaneria, a Karachi-based Hindu with roots in Surat, must be preparing similarly: Hes set to take the berth occupied by Saqlain Mushtaq in Multan. Ive been wanting to play against India... God willing, my chance is hours away and Ill be able to make an impression, Kaneria told The Telegraph. Pakistan, one learns, are contemplating making one change for tactical reasons  dropping allrounder Abdul Razzaq and fielding left-handed Asim Kamal, who scored an excellent 99 on debut (versus South Africa, earlier in the season). Idea is to get a specialist and bolster the batting. Incidentally, Shabbir Ahmed complained of pain in his right shin after Saturdays workout, but the precautionary tests havent revealed a problem. Probably comforted by that, the lanky quick went flat out on Sunday. As for India, as already reported in these columns, Agarkar is going to take Zaheer Khans place. Apparently, Ashish Nehra too is tipped to make it  its just that the hard-working Lakshmipathy Balaji will have to be dropped. Eventually, sentiment may not come in the way of Nehra making a return. The decision, though, is only going to be taken before the toss. Bowling in the right areas is the key... Simply, its about line and length, not rocket science... As important will be holding the catches, remarked Dravid, adding: We know we havent held on to the lead (overseas) in the last couple of years, but thats an area weve been looking to improve. We have a good opportunity to correct that. [On the personal front, Dravid must be looking to correct his batting average as (stand-in captain). After all, his scores have been 13, 5 (Mohali) and 6 (Multan).] Key No. 2, if one can put it thus, is scoring big  batting first or second. Having totalled at least 675 in two of the last three innings, the Indians are familiar with posting a jumbo score. By the way, the captain who wins the toss may actually have hoped that his opposite number called correctly... TEAMS (as of Sunday night)INDIA (likely): Akash Chopra, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S.Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Parthiv Patel, Ajit Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra.

 Schumi eyes hattrick 
Montreal: World champion Michael Schumacher is chasing his third successive victory in the Canadian Grand Prix this weekend as he bids to continue his devastating form in a race that almost never was. There was uproar last year when the popular race, which has been won by Schumacher six times in the last 10 seasons, was thrown off the calendar to make way for Bahrain and China. But it was re-instated on an expanded 18-event schedule after the Montreal community put together a financial rescue package. And ahead of this weekends race Schumacher is confident that he will extend his winning streak at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. (AFP)  Copyright

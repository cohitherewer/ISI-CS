The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zidane says it wasnt perfect
	 - Sagnol doubtful for rest of tournament with broken left forearm  Santini will look forward to players recovery Coimbra: Frances roller-coaster ride through Euro 2004 shows no signs of stopping. The defending champions relief at making it into the quarter finals has been tempered by injuries to defenders Willy Sagnol and William Gallas. France meet the tournaments surprise package Greece Friday after finishing top of group B with another late win, this time over outsiders Switzerland. But the 3-1 victory came at a potentially heavy price. Sagnol broke his left forearm during the match against Switzerland and is almost certain to miss the rest of the European Championship, a team spokesman said on Tuesday. The injury is exactly the same as the one the Bayern Munich right back suffered during a German league match in March. Sagnol had medical tests today which revealed he broke his left forearm, the spokeman said.Doctor Jean-Marcel Ferret is very pessimistic about the chances of Sagnol being able to play again before the end of the tournament. His replacement Gallas suffered an ankle problem. As Santini waits for the results of medical tests to find out more, relief mixed with realism was the prevailing mood in the French camp after Mondays win secured by Zinedine Zidane and a second half double from Thierry Henry, his first of the championships. Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira warned: If we want to get past the quarter finals we have to play better than that. We finished the match exhausted. But qualifying will give us back our confidence. Zidane, who assumed the captains role again as he had done against England when his two stoppage time strikes earned France an unlikely 2-1 victory, agreed. Weve reached our main objective. But it wasnt perfect. Weve played better  to be perfect isnt easy, he said. Whats important is to simply tell ourselves that weve got to do better. Zidane is like a barometer to the fortunes of the French team  when the Real Madrid playmaker is on song, France sing, but an in-form Henry is also vital if Les Bleus are to become the first back-to-back European champions. It did us a lot of good to see Henry starting to score goals again, said Zidane who picked up the Man of the Match award. Were all happy about that, especially the way he scored his second goal. Santini was asked whether he was glad to leave group runners-up England with the task of playing hosts Portugal Thursday instead of Greece in the last eight 24 hours later. The extra day is more important than the fact we miss playing Portugal, Santini said. Thats the big advantage, extra time to confront a team as well-organised and solid as Greece. There are still areas where we need to improve, for example our attacking play in front of goal. The man who steps down as France coach to manage English Premiership Club Tottenham next season, added: We can always improve certain areas but our goal has been reached. When we were leading 1-0 we had four or five chances. If theyd been converted wed have come together and played in a more satisfactory way.Our objective is to go all the way in this competition. He dismissed the notion that German coach Otto Rehhagels Greece would be a soft touch in Lisbon. To reach the quarter finals you have to be a really good team. Dont forget theyve beaten Portugal in the opening match and contributed to Spains elimination. Theyre a very solid outfit. Talismanic keeper Fabien Barthez chipped in: If we want to be champions of Europe there are six finals to play. Each match is hard, no matter who the opposition.  (AFP)  Copyright

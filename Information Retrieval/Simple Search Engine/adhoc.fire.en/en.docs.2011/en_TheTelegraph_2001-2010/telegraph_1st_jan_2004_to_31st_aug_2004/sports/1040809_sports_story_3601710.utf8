 RAAF flying Iraqis 
Sydney: The Australian Air Force began flying the Iraqi Olympic team to Athens on Sunday amid tight security at Baghdad airport, officials in Canberra said. A defence department statement said the 48-member Iraqi Olympic party was flown out of Baghdad on a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Hercules to another country where it would take a connecting flight for Athens. This assistance will enable a very special group of athletes to achieve their dreams of competing in the greatest sporting event of the modern era, it said. We wish the Iraqi Olympic team our warmest support. (AFP)  Copyright

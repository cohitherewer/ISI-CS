The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Soumya still in lead
 A CORRESPONDENT  Assam boy Trailokya Nanda in action. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya Calcutta: With two rounds to go, Soumya Thakurta of St James School, sits pretty with 8.5 points after the conclusion of ninth round of The Telegraph schools chess championship at Alekhine Chess Club in Gorky Sadan on Saturday. After his excellent showing so far, much was expected from 11-year-old Bitan Banerjee. But he disappointed, tamely going down to Minhazuddin Sagar of Bangladesh. Debaditta Sinha Biswas of Salt Lake Point School, who was placed third last year came back into reckoning with a quick win against Antarip Roy of St Pauls Mission School to take his tally to 7.5 points. Meanwhile, St James School, with 28.5 points to their credit, looks all set to retain the best school trophy for the record fourth straight year.

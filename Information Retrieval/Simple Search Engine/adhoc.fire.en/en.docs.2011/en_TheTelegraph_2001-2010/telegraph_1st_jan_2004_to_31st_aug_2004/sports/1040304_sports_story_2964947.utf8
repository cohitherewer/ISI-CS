The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian eves beat Bulgaria
 Fine show by Mouma New Delhi: Indian eves continued their fine run in the world table tennis championship in Doha, jumping to the top spot in group E after registering a hard-fought 3-2 victory over Bulgaria. The Indians, playing in the second division of the competition, remain in the hunt for promotion to the first in the next edition of the championship, according to information received here Wednesday. As per the new format of the tournament, the teams have been divided into five divisions, with the best 12 vying for honours in the championship division for the title while all others being placed in respective divisions on the basis of their rankings. India have been placed in the second division and only one of the 12 teams, divided into two groups, would be promoted to the next division in the next edition. Indias victory over Bulgaria last night follows their win over Slovenia and a walk-over from Nigeria, meaning the women have maintained a cent-per-cent record after three matches. Poulami Ghatak started in fine form, accounting for K. Gatinska 11-6, 11-7, 4-11, 8-11, 11-9, while Mouma Das beat A. Kasabova 12-10, 4-11, 13-11, 11-5. Anindita Chakraborty, however, lost to D. Petrova 10-12, 5-11, 4-11. Poulami then hit a bad patch, losing to Kasabova 11-13, 11-6, 8-11, 9-11, but Mouma got the Indian girls back on track when she beat Gatinska 8-11, 12-10, 11-6, 11-6.

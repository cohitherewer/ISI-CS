The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United bow to Job well done
 - EURO ROUND-UP 
 - Real lose, but make Kings Cup final on aggregate  Manchester Uniteds Ruud van Nistelrooy in an aerial tussle with Middlesbroughs Franck Queudrue at Old Trafford on Wednesday. United lost 2-3. (AFP) London: Manchester Uniteds title hopes took a severe dent on Wednesday when the Premier League champions lost 2-3 at home to Middlesbrough. Cameroons Joseph-Desire Jobs fine shot won the game for Middlesbrough ten minutes from time after United had battled back after trailing by two first-half goals from Brazilian Juninho. Arsenal, who defeated Southampton 2-0 at home on Tuesday, hold a five-point lead over United with both sides having played 25 games. Third-placed Chelsea, 2-0 winners at Portsmouth with goals from Scott Parker and Hernan Crespo, closed to one point behind United while Liverpool moved up to fourth with a 2-1 home victory over Manchester City. Two headed goals from Juninho silenced Old Trafford and set United on their way to their second home defeat against Middlesbrough in the last three seasons. Juninho pounced to head home from close range after 34 minutes. The Brazilian struck again four minutes later, powerfully heading home a Stewart Downing cross before Ruud van Nistelrooy gave United a lifeline right on halftime with his 22nd goal of the season. United upped the pressure after the break and drew level on 63 minutes when Van Nistelrooy set up Ryan Giggs to stab home. However, hopes of completing a storming comeback with a third goal were ended ten minutes from time after Job fired home from 18 metres. United almost rescued a point in stoppage time but substitute Diego Forlan hit the crossbar from just four metres out.  Chelseas new signing Parker netted his first goal for the club with a crisp volley after 17 minutes at Fratton Park. Substitute Crespo sealed the points 11 minutes from time when he followed up to chest in after Jimmy Floyd Hasselbainks lob bounced back off the woodwork. Liverpools Michael Owen ended his goal drought dating back to October 25 with the first goal at Anfield to pile more pressure on Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan. Tottenham Hotspur won 4-2 at Charlton Athletic.  Zidane sent off In Madrid, Real Madrid scrambled through to the final of the Kings Cup with a 2-1 aggregate victory over Sevilla on Wednesday, despite having Zinedine Zidane sent off in the first half of a 0-1 second-leg defeat. Real, leading 2-0 after last weeks first leg at the Bernabeu, were shocked when Sevilla took the lead just 45 seconds into the return with a great finish from Antonio Lopez. Carlos Queirozs side were in further trouble in the final minute of the first half when French international Zidane, the 2003 Fifa World Player of the Year, was red-carded for an apparent slap to the face of Sevilla defender Pablo Alfaro. Stefano Fiore struck twice as Lazio reached the final of the Italian Cup with a resounding 4-0 victory over champions AC Milan on Wednesday, completing a 6-1 aggregate win, adds a report from Rome. In Monaco, Fernando Morientes sank French champions Olympique Lyon with a hattrick in Monacos 4-1 win in the French Cup third round on Wednesday. Lyon, seeking revenge after going down 0-3 in a Ligue 1 game in the principality a month before, had the best start, opening the scoring through Brazilian Elber in the 14th minute.  Two headers by Morientes within  three minutes, in the 58th and 61st, sealed victory for  Monaco. Croatias Dado Prso wrapped up the game with a fourth  goal in the 86th minute. (Reuters)  Copyright

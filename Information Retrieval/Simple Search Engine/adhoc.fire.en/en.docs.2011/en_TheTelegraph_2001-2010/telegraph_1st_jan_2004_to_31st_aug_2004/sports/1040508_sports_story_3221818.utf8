 Sunny, Shastri to stay away
Islamabad: Former Indian captains Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri have expressed their inability to attend a seminar being organised by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) in Lahore to discuss development of cricket in the region. Gavaskar and Shastri had informed the PCB that they could not participate due to prior commitments, a board official was quoted as saying in local daily The Dawn on Friday. Both the former cricketers did not visit Pakistan during the recent Test and one-day international series despite invitations from the PCB.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ten-team NFL likely from 2005-06
Margao: The core committee of Aiff has recommended structural changes in National Football League (NFL) for 2005-06 season onwards. The number of teams will be cut down from twelve to ten, to be played on home and away basis. This will make the league more competitive and have bigger rest periods for the players. It will cut down the expenditure, core committee chairman Shivanand Salgaocar said. He said that four teams will be demoted at the end of the ninth NFL while two top teams from second division will be promoted. Six more teams will be selected on the basis of the ranking of their states and quality of the respective state leagues. The committee will have another round of discussion before submitting the proposal to the Aiff executive committee, which will take a final decision on September 15. (PTI)  Copyright

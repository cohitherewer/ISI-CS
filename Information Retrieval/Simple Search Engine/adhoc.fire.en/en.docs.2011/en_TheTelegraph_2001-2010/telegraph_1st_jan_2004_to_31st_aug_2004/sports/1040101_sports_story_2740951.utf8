				 																																																	Tollygunge Agragami tightened their noose around fancied Mohun Bagan, dismissing the latter for a mere 182 in the CAB first division two-day league on Wednesday.  SUMMARISED SCORES  Mohun Bagan 182 (Amarjeet Singh 48; Fakhuruddin  Singh 3/24, Kunal Banerjee 3/31). Tollygunge Agragami 7/0.  Young Bengal 387 (Rohan Banerjee 108, Sougata  Mitra 88; Prasenjit Banerjee 5/130) vs Kumartuli Institute.  Ballygunge United Club 308/3 (Santadeep Paul  91 n.o., Nitin Chowdhury 71) vs Paikpara SC.  High Court Club 356/6 (Dibyendu Sarkar 108,  Arnab Ghosh 65) vs YMCA (College). East Bengal 318/5 decl (Subhamoy Das 119; Suman  Chakraborty 3/75). DKS 249/6 (Probal Dutta 114 n.o., Goutam  Shome 99). Match drawn. 				 																																																	 East Bengal club has called an executive committee meeting on Monday on the issue of Mike Okoros association with the club. 				 																																																	Okoro returned to the city last night and joined practice at the club ground on Wednesday. 				 																																																	In the changed perspective, however, the club officials may end up taking a relatively lenient stand on the player. With Douglas da Silva yet to recover and captain Suley Musah suffering from fresh injury, Okoro, in all likelihood, may be retained for his servive in the NFL despite his action.  Bankura overcame hosts West  Midnapur 1-0 in the Konark Sheet state football league on  Wednesday. Sidhu Das scored the winner.				 																																																	 Aditya Prasad and Manwar Hossain fetched a couple of gold for Bengal in the recently-concluded 19th national sub-junior boxing championship, held at Haldowani in Uttaranchal. 				 																																																	 Prochy Mehta won four gold medals at the 17th Malaysian Open Masters athletics championships recently held in Kuala Lumpur. Prochy won in the 100, 200, 400 and long jump with a meet record. 				 																																																	CRICKET: CAB first division league ties at various grounds from 9.30 am.

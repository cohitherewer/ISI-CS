The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dhoni stands a good chance
 - Team India Selection  Question over Zaheer Khans fitness;  Dinesh Mongia is a contender  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Mongia Dhoni Zaheer Calcutta: Bihars Mahender  Singh Dhoni, currently in Zimbabwe with the India A squad,  stands a good chance of making the Team India XIV/XV for  the tri-series in Holland and the two events in England:  The bilateral NatWest Challenge and the Champions Trophy. While the ICC-conducted Champions  Trophy has provision for only XIV, the selectors  chairman  Syed Kirmani, Kirti Azad, Pranab Roy, Kiran More and Sanjay  Jagdale  may pick XV for the first two engagements when  they meet here on Thursday afternoon. The August 21-28 tri-series has  world champions Australia and Pakistan as the other sides.  The NatWest Challenge, against England, features three matches  between September 1 and 5. As for the (second) Champions  Trophy, its going to be held from September 10-25. According to The Telegraphs  sources, Parthiv Patel will be dropped and, so, the  specialist wicketkeepers berth is going to be up for grabs. Frankly, Parthiv isnt suited  for ODIs We need somebody who can be effective with the  bat The injury to (V.V.S) Laxman in the Asia Cup has been  an eye-opener Parthiv had to step in, but couldnt quite  do the job, is how one of the sources put it on Wednesday  evening. Dhoni is the frontrunner, specially  after his showing in the second first-class game in Zimbabwe  (versus the Select XI) where he had 11 victims  six coming  in the first innings. Apparently, captain Sourav Ganguly  has indicated that the man in form (in Zimbabwe) will be  his choice. Of course, Tamil Nadus Dinesh  Karthik (also in Zimbabwe) is very much in the frame. Its  to be seen, though, whether fifties (96 and 52) in each  of the first two matches in Zimbabwe is going to be enough. Dhoni, by the way, had a 45 in  that second game. He didnt play the tour-opener. While Parthiv is certain to go  out, theres a question mark over Zaheer Khans fitness  and, as a result, his selection. He did pass a strenuous  test in Colombo, but not everybody is convinced he is  actually there one hundred per cent. Should Kirmani and Co. decide  to rest him, the door will open for Ajit Agarkar, who is  turning out for Middlesex. One understands theres going  to be a debate, at least over retaining Mohammed Kaif  as his contribution in the Asia Cup was negligible. Kaif totalled no more than 62  in five matches and, worse, ran himself out twice  against  Pakistan and Sri Lanka, in the tournaments second phase. However, right now, the selectors may not take the extreme step.THE EXPECTED LINE-UP  Certainties: Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Ashish Nehra, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Irfan Pathan.
Strongly placed wicketkeeper: Mahender Singh Dhoni. In the frame, too, is Dinesh Karthik
Could hold on: Mohammed Kaif.
Question mark: Zaheer Khan. If rested, Ajit Agarkar will benefit.
XVth player: Dinesh Mongia has emerged a strong contender. Also in the reckoning are Hemang Badani and Rohan Gavaskar.The bigger debate, though, is bound to be over the XVth player  assuming one is picked for the tri-series and the NatWest Challenge. Besides the usual contenders   Hemang Badani, Rohan Gavaskar and, to a lesser extent, Sridharan  Sriram  the selectors (as also Sourav and coach John Wright)  could actively consider recalling Dinesh Mongia. Mongia has been out in the cold  after the April 2003 tri-series in Dhaka but, in recent  weeks, has been prolific for Lancashire. Look, runs on the County circuit  hold more value than scoring in Zimbabwe Moreover, Mongia  has been in England for some time and acclimatising wont  be a problem explained another source. Incidentally, Mongia didnt figure  in the pre-season list of 20 probables. The rest, predictably, pick themselves. Wrights extension Meanwhile, its learnt that extending  Wrights (and physio Andrew Leipus) contract isnt an  issue for the Board. Leipus has been around from October  1999; Wright took charge in November 2000. Copyright

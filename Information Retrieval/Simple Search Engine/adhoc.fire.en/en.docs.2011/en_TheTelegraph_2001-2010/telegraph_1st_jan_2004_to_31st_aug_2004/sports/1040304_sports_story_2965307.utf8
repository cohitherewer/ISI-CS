The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies satisfied with security
Durban: An Australian delegation is satisfied with arrangements for the national teams tour of Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) said on Wednesday. Australia are scheduled to tour the troubled African country in May and June to play two Test matches and three one-day Internationals. The delegation is led by Cricket Australias (CA) general manager for cricket operations, Michael Brown, and includes the chief executive of the Australian Cricketers Association, Tim May, and team manager Steve Bernard. The Australians spent Tuesday in Harare, where they met government officials and police, and inspected grounds and hotels. A similar itinerary was followed in Bulawayo on Wednesday, and the delegation will leave on Thursday. The managing director of the ZCU, Vince Hogg, said from Bulawayo that the delegations visit was not out of the ordinary. Michael Brown was at pains to point out that Cricket Australia does this before every tour by Australia, Hogg said. They look at aspects like hotels, transport and safety, and they are looking closely at safety this time. Asked if the Australians were satisfied with what they saw, Hogg said: Weve had two very good days with them and their response has been favourable. Hogg said Brown and Bernard would travel to Sri Lanka, where Australia are currently on tour, and meet the team on Saturday. The England Cricket Board is yet to make a decision on Englands scheduled tour to Zimbabwe in November. England forfeited their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe, which was due to be played in Harare, over safety and moral concerns.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

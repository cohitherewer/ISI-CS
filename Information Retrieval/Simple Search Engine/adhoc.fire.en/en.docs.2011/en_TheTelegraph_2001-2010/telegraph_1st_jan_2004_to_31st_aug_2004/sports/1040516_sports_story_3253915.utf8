 India to bid for 2014 edition 
New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): New Delhi will bid to host the 2014 Asian Games, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi announced on Saturday. The Indian capital had hosted the inaugural Asian Games in 1951 and the 9th edition in 1982. Kalmadi said the city would have the required infrastructure in place to host the Asian sporting extravaganza as it would have already hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games before that. We are also in the race to host the 2016 Olympics. The bidding process will start very soon, said Kalmadi. Doha will stage the 2006 Asian Games. Guangzhou, the lone bidder for the 2010 edition, will be formally chosen in July.  Copyright

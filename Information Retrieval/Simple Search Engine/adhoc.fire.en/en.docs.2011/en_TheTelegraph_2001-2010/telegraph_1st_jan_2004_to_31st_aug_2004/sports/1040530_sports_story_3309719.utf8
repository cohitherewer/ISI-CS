The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India match top on Zico agenda
Manchester, May 29 (AFP): Japan coach Zico said on Saturday that he would be using the triangular friendly tournament with Iceland and England here to fine-tune his side for the upcoming World Cup qualifier against India. The Asian champions will play Iceland on May 30 and England two days later before meeting India in a World Cup Asian zone first-round qualifier at the Saitama Stadium on June 9. Zico, who replaced Frenchman Philippe Troussier after the 2002 World Cup co-hosted by Japan where they reached the last 16, said that the qualification campaign would take priority over a tournament which will help England prepare for Euro 2004. We all have in our minds the World Cup qualifier with India, so for these two games we are quite relaxed, explained Zico. We will be trying to use all or most of our players over these two games but the main object is to get ready for our World Cup qualifier which is very important for us.  Copyright

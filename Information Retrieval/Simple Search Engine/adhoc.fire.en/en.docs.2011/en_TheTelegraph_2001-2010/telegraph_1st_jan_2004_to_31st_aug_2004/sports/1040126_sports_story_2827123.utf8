 Brazilian ace passes away
London: Brazilian soccer ace Leonidas da Silva, the man credited with inventing the bicycle kick in the early 1930s, has died at the age of 90 from Alzheimers disease. Known as the Black Diamond, Da Silva was the 1938 World Cups top scorer with eight goals. Brazil finished third in the tournament. He also played in the 1934 World Cup. Da Silva, who retired in 1950, played for a number of Brazilian clubs, including Flamengo, Vasco, Sao Paulo and Botafogo. He scored 25 goals in 26 appearances for his country. The Brazilian soccer federation said its players will wear black armbands in the Olympic qualifier against Paraguay. The funeral will be on Monday. Known also as the Rubber Man because of his elusive dribbling skills, he made the headlines away from soccer in 1941 when he spent eight months in prison after being found guilty of falsifying a certificate exempting him from military service. Born in 1913, he played for two clubs in Rio de Janeiro before moving to Uruguay to play for Penarol in 1933. After being released from jail, he spent seven years playing for Sao Paulo, where more than 70,000 people turned out to watch his debut in 1942, but the World War II prevented him from playing at any more World Cups.

 Zaheer gets 1 more day to prove fitness
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Colombo: Speedster Zaheer Khan has been given one day more to prove his fitness  the test, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, has been put off till Thursday afternoon. Zaheer is confident of being fit and the physio (Andrew Leipus) feels his recovery is good. Now, the issue will be settled at nets which, by the way, is going to be optional for the rest of the team, captain Sourav Ganguly told The Telegraph late on Wednesday. Manager M.N. Dorairajan echoed much the same view. As reported in these columns, Ajit Agarkar will be summoned if Zaheer fails to satisfy the monitoring committee. Additionally, theres going to be a question mark over whether the left-armer will be offered a contract by the Board.  Copyright

 Sean Ervine seeks asylum in Australia
Perth: The bitter tussle between Zimbabwean cricket administrators and players claimed its first victim when allrounder Sean Ervine sought asylum in Australia. The 21-year-old Ervine arrived here hours ago, after wishing good luck to the Australian team at Johannesburg, who were en route to Harare for their tour of Zimbabwe, a website reported on Sunday. The situation in Zimbabwe cricket made my decision come a little bit quicker than normal, Ervine was quoted as saying. Ervine, who is reportedly dating the daughter of his Australian coach Geoff Marsh, Melissa, is one of the 15 rebels who went on strike to protest against the sacking of Heath Streak. After having his contract terminated, Ervine had applied for a de facto visa so that he could continue his first-class career with Western Australia. With Melissa here, it made my decision much easier, Ervine said.  (PTI)  Copyright

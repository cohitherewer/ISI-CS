 A dream that still drives Ivanisevic
 Goran Ivanisevic after his first-round defeat to Dutchman Sjeng Schalken at the Rotterdam meet. (AP) Rotterdam: Former champion Goran Ivanisevic said he was hoping to make another appearance at Wimbledon this summer. The 32-year-old Croatian was far from discouraged after absorbing a 3-2, 2-6 first-round defeat against Dutch seventh-seed Sjeng Schalken in Round I of the Rotterdam world tennis. After losing in 53 minutes, the Croatian admitted that a return to the All England Club, where he spectacularly beat Australian Patrick Rafter in 2001, was a long way off but still on his mind. Every time I say Im gonna play Wimbledon, I dont play it. Last year, I played Queens and then I had to leave (injured), said Ivanisevic, who has spent the past two years enduring a series of injuries. My goal right now is to play next week in Marseille and then Ill see  Wimbledon is far away. Last week in Milan he advanced to the second round with a win over Bohdan Ulirach before bowing out of the tournament. The most important thing now is to stay healthy and enjoy it, said the man who found his biography page missing from the 2004 ATP media guide, an oversight likely caused by his temporary inactivity. Ivanisevic admits the fierce serve that once struck fear into his opponents is now almost history  although he takes pride whenever he hits an ace. My serve will never be at the level it was before, he added. I still have some pain, but I can also still hit aces. I had something like 47 in two matches last week, thats fine. The serve is still there, its just the little things after the serve. Putting it together in practice and then in a match is a completely different story.  (AFP)  Copyright

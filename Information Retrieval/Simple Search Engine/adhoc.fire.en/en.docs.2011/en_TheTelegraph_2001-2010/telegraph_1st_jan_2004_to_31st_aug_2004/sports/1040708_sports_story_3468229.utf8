The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. to finalise foreign recruits within a fortnight
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting came out in the open on Wednesday, showing a low budget team this season and confirming Raman Vijayan as skipper. Club secretary Sultan Ahmed said at a press meet that the club had voluntarily stayed out of the money race. Later, though, he clarified that no sponsor was yet in sight. The club takes to the Calcutta Super Division field, Thursday, versus CFC in Howrah. In another match on Thursday, Tollygunge Agragami also take to the field, facing off with George Telegraph. He said the club will give an award of Rs 25,000 (and a citation) for the best player of the club each season and another award of Rs 10,000 for either the top-scorer or the second-best (to be judged by ex-players). Mohun Bagan have declared an award on these lines. Ahmed and coach Mridul Banerjee said they will most likely be finalising on the foreigners for the team in the next 15 days. A number of them have given tests, but I am going slow and not rushing to any conclusion. I may have a young, inexperienced team otherwise, but I want the foreigners as good as East Bengal or Mohun Bagans. Ahmed rued that last year there was too much leeway given to the players, and this year we have given full responsibility to the coach and we will just not interfere. Ahmed said that the issue of Mohammedan AC being allowed to use the same colour combination on their jerseys is an attempt to damage the 113-year-old Mohammedan Sporting Club brand. We will not allow that. Why did the IFA allow this? We have appealed to the governing body and are awaiting the outcome. IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, though, pooh-poohed this allegation and showed Rule 6 of the constitution, which says the IFA can allow any colour combination for any club. He said the rule is around for 60 years and that all of the IFAs 250 affiliates can demand and get black-white combination jerseys and get them. On the day of the match a different jersey is worn by one club, decided by a toss. Dutta called this mainly an emotional issue. He said the club has appealed to the government to finish repairing the northern galleries so we can have a decent number of seats for members and some fans. The club also released a song of the club sung by Bengali band Line e Achi.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. in final push for survival 
Margao: Its make or break time for Mohammedan Sporting. The enthusiasm and excitement of debuting in the elite tier of the countrys premier club tournament now seem to be running out of steam in their first season itself as the black-and-white brigade is struggling to stay alive. Come Wednesday, they will take on Haywards Sporting Club here, and coach Jamshed Nassiri, himself under pressure, has very little options but garnering full points against the Goan outfit, also the debutants. While East Bengal have already clinched the title, the sword of relegation is looming large on three other Calcutta teams  Mohun Bagan (21), Tollygunge (who were held goalless by Vasco in their penultimate match on Tuesday and are now on 20) and Mohammedan Sporting (18 from 19 outings). Indian Bank have already relegated. Nassiri has a few steep mountains to climb before enjoying any breathing space as Mohammedan Sporting, placed 11th in the table, will next face Goan challengers Vasco and Dempo. Haywards are placed in the seventh spot, with 26 points from 20 matches. They will have a double agenda  putting a brake on their losing streak, spanning three matches, and claiming a top-five finish. Haywards coach Peter Vales made his intentions clear saying they would go all out for a win. We will play our attacking game but at the same time will remain cautious as our opponents will also go all out for a win, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

 The train which exploded at the Atocha Station in Madrid on Thursday. At least 173 people were killed and some 600 injured in near-simultaneous blasts on three trains in the Spanish capital. (AFP) Madrid: Taeke Taekema and Matthijs Brouwer struck two goals each as Indias hopes of reaching the final of the mens Olympic hockey qualifiers dashed with a 2-4 loss against The Netherlands on Thursday. India fought bravely for most part of the semi-final encounter but came second best after the forwards failed to utilise the chances that came their way. The Indian backline also caved in against the Dutch onslaught as Taekema converted two penalty corners (13th and 34th minute) and Brouwer made the most of the defensive lapses by scoring two fine field goals in the 47th and 66th minutes. India scored through striker Gagan Ajit Singh (47th) and Deepak Thakur (42nd). India, who have already qualified for the Olympics, will meet the winners of the second semi-final between Pakistan and Spain for bronze. Meanwhile, New Zealand made it to the Athens Olympics after edging out South Africa 3-2 in their play-off clash. New Zealand will next play Great Britain, who beat Belgium 2-1 earlier in the day, for 5-6 positions. South Africa and Belgium will fight it out for 7-8 classification. Poland defeated Canada 2-1 in the 9-12 playoff . New Zealand scored through Hayden Shaw (16th, 40th) and Gareth Brooks (41st) while the South African goals came from Greg Nicol (6th and 32nd). Meanwhile, in a related development, Canada may pull out of the tournament after a series bomb explosions rocked the Spanish capital but other teams including India committed themselves to continue with the event. We learnt of the news only after returning to the hotel this morning from a training session. All the players and members of the contingent are safe and there is no cause of concern, India teammanager K. Krishnamurthy informed. The representatives of the Spanish government requested us to support them and not give in to the terrorists. Hence, all the teams agreed to continue with the tournament, Krishnamurthy said. The Indian team was reported safe after the blasts.  (PTI)  Copyright

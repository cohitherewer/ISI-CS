 Maradona joking with doctors
Buenos Aires: Improving football legend Diego Maradona has been joking with doctors about bringing him a ball so he can prove he is recovering, local press reports said on Thursday. Maradona, who has been in intensive care and close to death suffering from heart and lung problems for 12 days, said to medical staff in the Swiss-Argentina Clinic: Bring me a ball so that I can show them Im well. The decision to maintain him in intensive cares appeared to be to prevent an avalanche of visits that could harm his recovery, and to prevent a reported episode that one of the clinics employees tried to take photographs of him in his bed to sell to the press. The last medical report on Wednesday said his condition was stable with progressive improvement of the cardio-pulmonary system and that he no longer had a fever and the only medication he was taking were antibiotics. According to physiotherapists, the 1986 World Cup winning captain was reacting very well to exercises improving the ventilation of his lungs. Maradonas two teenage daughters, Dalma, 17 and Giannina, 14, asked fans to suspend last Saturdays proposed demonstration outside the hospital, thanking them for their concern, but saying both Maradona and other patients needed quiet for their recovery. Doctors have declined to say whether the former players current state is related to drug addiction, which he has fought for more than a decade. Maradona is Argentinas most famous player and led the country to their second World Cup victory in 1986. He played in his fourth World Cup in the United States in 1994 but tested positive for a cocktail of drugs and was thrown out of the tournament.  (AFP)  Copyright

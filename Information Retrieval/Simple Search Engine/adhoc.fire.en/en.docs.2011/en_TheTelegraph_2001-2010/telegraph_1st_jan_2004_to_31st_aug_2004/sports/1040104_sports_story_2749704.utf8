 Draw dents Kuntes chances
Hastings, Jan. 3 (PTI): GM Abhijit Kunte was involved in yet another quick draw with GM Stuart Conquest of England in the sixth round of the Hastings International Chess Congress on Saturday. With just three rounds remaining in the Category 13 tournament, top seed GM Vladimir Epishin made his presence felt with a clinical victory over compatriot IM Alexander Cherniaev and emerged sole leader on 4.5 points. GM Vasilios Kotronias of Cyprus follows the leader half-a-point behind while GM Jonathan Rowson of Scotland is a close third on 3.5. Kunte, defending champion GM Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark and erstwhile leader Mark Hebden of England share the fourth spot with three points each. Keteryna Lahno of Ukraine is seventh with 2.5 points among the ten contenders. Kunte played his second successive white in the event against Conquest but failed to break the defences of the Englishman who is struggling to find his form. The game started with a Slav Defence but Conquest transposed it into a Closed Grunfeld with black pieces and had an easy game on hand as Kunte allowed a thematic central breakthrough early in the middle game. At the time of peace agreement on move 19, two minor pieces and a couple of pawns had been traded and the position was just about level. Epishin, rated 2658 before the start of this event, lost a whopping 25 ELOs as the new rating list came in the New Year. He however seems determined to make amends and it was evident in his game against Cherniaev who played black. After starting with Semi Slav, Cherniaev found himself in a transposition to the Queens Gambit Declined position and found it hard to equalise as Epishin made a decisive foray in his territory. Through a perfectly timed manoeuvre, the Russian won a pawn and it was soon curtains for Cherniaev. The game lasted 34 moves.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Playing in Pakistan an education: Kumble
 - FIRST TEST IN MULTAN - Star leggie returns to Team India, exuding confidence  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Anil Kumble at practice in Multan on Friday Danish Kaneria during training in Multan on Friday. (PTI) Multan: Locals call this the City of Saints, but few in this region are either more hot or dusty. Faisalabad, of course, will definitely run Multan close... Its in this setting that Anil Kumble is going to play his first Test (match, actually) in Pakistan. Indias most successful spinner hadnt made his debut when the last full-fledged tour took place, in 1989-90, and wasnt picked for the short ODI series eight years later. He couldnt make it for the just-ended ODIs as he was recovering from a bowling shoulder strain. Its good to be back, though I havent bowled (in a competitive game) for over a month and-a-half... But, one has to adjust at the highest level and Im confident of doing so quickly, Kumble remarked on Friday afternoon, after the first workout here (at an admittedly splendid stadium) ahead of Test No. 1. The leggie continued: Playing in Pakistan is an education and, hopefully, we will take back many happy memories... In any case, we should cash in on the confidence gained by winning the ODIs... Agreeing that conditions tend to be quite similar to home, Kumble made the point that playing overseas anywhere is a challenge. Asked whether he had been working on a Pakistan-specific variation, he replied: Not really... Variations are important but, for now, Im largely looking to getting into rhythm. That may mean big trouble for Inzamam-ul Haqs team: After all, in his last Test series (Australia), Kumble picked up as many as 24 wickets in three matches. Clearly, post-Australia, expectations are even higher. Kumble, however, isnt one to get weighed down. Ive always tried to live up to my own expectations... If Im only going to think of what the others expect, then Ill be putting myself under needless pressure, he said. Kumble, incidentally, saluted Shane Warne for a phenomenal comeback after being banned for a year: He has shown the character of a champion... In fact, he has done so over and over again. Talking to The Telegraph, Kumble confirmed that wife Chetna is expecting their first child very soon. Smiling, he added: Yes, its a terrific feeling but, believe me, I wont be distracted. Meanwhile, Pakistans highly-rated leggie Danish Kaneria, who bagged 12 wickets in the 2001-2002 Multan Test versus Bangladesh, acknowledged that Team India will be an entirely different proposition. Yet, he is ready to snare arguably the best line-up currently in business. The first Test begins on Sunday.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004  Kader hangs up riding boots 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Jockey Aslam Kader bid good bye to his riding days on Sunday prior to the running of the Indian Turf Invitation Cup at the Mahalaxmi raceground in Mumbai. The champion rider had informed the Jockey Club of India about his decision to quit on Thursday but waited till Sunday to make a public announcement at the racecourse he had donned the silks for for the first time in 1978.				 										A darling of the racecrowd across the country, Kader went round Mahalaxmi public enclosures, escorted by the ex-cricketing champ Ravi Shatri and the Bollywood star Jacky Shroff, who had showered praise on the rider for his contribution to the thoroughbred sport, before race commentrator Cyrus Madan read out from a prepared text written by the 42-year-old jockey.				 										A winner of 1717 races, including 80 Indian classics, the pint-sized dynamite, as he was known in his hey-day, had been troubled by a neck injury suffered after a fall last year in Pune. He would have loved to continue with riding but the pain in his neck region becomes unbearable at times, said a family source in Bangalore over the telephone. He is quitting the sport on medical advice as the aggravated injury may prove very harmful, added the source.

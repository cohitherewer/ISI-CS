The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB cautious versus Indian Bank
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal have found some sort of rhythm after a few disappointing away outings in the National Football League. They are on the road again and meet Indian Bank in Chennai on Monday. With 14 points from eight matches, East Bengal are among the pack of teams chasing leaders Dempo and another win will take them closer to coach Subhas Bhowmicks primary plan of reaching 20 from 11. Indian Bank have just one from eight. The last time, when East Bengal won the title, Indian Bank had held them 3-3 in Chennai. Plus, Bhowmick will miss Bhaichung Bhutia and Debjit Ghosh in this match. Finding Bhutias replacement for a match is okay, but I still dont know how to make up for the loss of Debjit. There isnt anybody to replace him, Bhowmick said from Chennai on Sunday. There is no question of taking Indian Bank lightly, even though they have managed just a point so far. No match is easy, they start on a new note and end on another.  Tollygunge lose Salgaocar beat Tollygunge Agragami 2-0 in a ninth-round match in Margao, adds PTI. Both goals came in the first half, through Dharamjit Singh and Fredy Mascarenhas. The win took Salgaocar to 16 points from nine matches. Tollygunge stayed on even after nine.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Keepers on equal footing
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Its significant that Mahender Singh Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik are going to begin the tour of Africa on an equal footing. We havent named either of them as being the No. 1 keeper  whoever makes the most of opportunities will be treated as such, East Zone selector Pranab Roy told The Telegraph when contacted in Chennai. Dhoni, it may be recalled, narrowly missed making the XV to Pakistan earlier this year.  Copyright

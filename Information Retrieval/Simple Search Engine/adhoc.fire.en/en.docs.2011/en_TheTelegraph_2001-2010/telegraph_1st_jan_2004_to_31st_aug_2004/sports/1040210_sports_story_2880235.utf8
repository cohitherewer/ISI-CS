According to The Telegraphs sources, this was decided upon by the Pakistan Cricket Board late on Monday night. The tenders, by the way, were opened in Lahore. The sponsors name, one understands, will be made public on Tuesday.  Fixing issue closed Seeking to put an end to the controversy kicked off by the leaked letters of ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU), the PCB has said it would not take any further action on the issue,adds PTI from Islamabad. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said: My attention has been drawn to two leaked letters from the ACU to the former PCB chairman and former director. The only comment I have on these letters is that the first was sent on September 29, 2002 and the second on March 22, 2003.  In both the letters, there is a clear indication that they were based on information that needed to be confirmed before action was to be taken, Khan said.  Copyright

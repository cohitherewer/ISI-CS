The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greene slams Marion, Tim 
 - There is no room for drug-cheats in our sport, says former 100m champion  Greene believes its going to be tough for Marion Jones now New York, May 18 (AP): Maurice Greene has a message for Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery and anyone else implicated in the latest doping mess: deal with the consequences. Greene said on Monday he stands behind the US Anti-Doping Agency rule that can bar an athlete from competing in the Athens Olympics without a positive doping test. On Sunday, Jones said she would go to court if USADA held her out because of the rule. Jones and partner Montgomery were among several athletes who testified before a grand jury in the BALCO drug investigation. I stand behind USADA and everything that they do, Greene said on the final day of the US Olympic team media summit. The whole thing with this BALCO case, they made the stuff to be undetectable so they werent supposed to find it. What do you do if you know a person that possessed some of the stuff or had some dealings with this company? There is no room in our sport for drug cheaters whatsoever. USADA has the power to bring a doping case against an athlete in lieu of a positive test when the agency has other reason to believe that a potential doping violation has occurred, such as admitted doping, according to its rules. Greene and Montgomery have had a heated rivalry over the last three years. Montgomery took the 100m world record from Greene in 2002, and Greene has repeatedly stated he wants the mark back. Montgomery probably will be even less fond of Greene now. Greene believes Jones and Montgomery have a difficult road ahead of them. Its going to be tough for her (Jones), Greene said. Theyre afraid right now. If your name came up in that situation, youre afraid. Their job is tougher than mine. World champion hurdler Allen Johnson understands both sides to the debate over the USADA rule. But he would not say which side he was on. Were faced with a situation where you have people who were taking a synthetic steroid that was designed in a lab and designed so that the tests did not detect it, Johnson said. Is it fair to ban someone who has not tested positive? If you just look at it that way, you say of course not. But at the same time if you know someone who does take something thats not detectable what do you do? We dont have a definite answer. But I know the USADA is trying to do what is in the best interest of the sport. Jones has responded to the repeated questions about the drug implications with a calm demeanour. But Greene believes she is more worried than she seems. You can act like that all you want, but in the back of your mind... You have something else on your plate to deal with, Greene said. You wake up thinking I have to do this, this and this, then I have to talk to my lawyer. And he believes that takes away from preparation for track and field. Im including whoever had anything to do with that, Greene said. Theyre not able to concentrate 100 per cent on what they do. Its going to take away from their training. As a top athlete, most of us have the ability. Its the mental aspect that puts us over the top. They wont have the 100 per cent mental aspect of it.  Copyright

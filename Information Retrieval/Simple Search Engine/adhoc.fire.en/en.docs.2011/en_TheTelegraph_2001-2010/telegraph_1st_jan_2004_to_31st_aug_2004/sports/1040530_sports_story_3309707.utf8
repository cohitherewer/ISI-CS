 Senators grill PCB brass
	 - FALLOUT OF INDIA SERIES Islamabad, May 29 (PTI): The top brass of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), including chairman Shaharyar Khan, came under sharp criticism from the Senate standing committee on sports and culture, which termed their explanations for the recent home defeat against India as insufficient, and asked them to furnish written replies. Khan, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja and chief selector Wasim Bari were grilled by the 13-member influential committee  comprising ruling and Opposition members from the upper house Senate  for three hours on the factors that caused the teams first-ever series loss at home against the arch-rivals. While Khan and Rameez attributed the loss of one-day and Test series to various reasons including lack of motivation on the part of the team, the latter had a tough time explaining his occupying multiple posts as CEO, television commentator as well as director of a Pakistan bank. The committee members asked Rameez how he could justify his job as CEO while simultaneously doing the commentary, that too in a series involving the Pakistan team. Rameez said he loved commentary and made a living out of it while he worked as CEO of the board without salary. The PCB top brass informed the committee that the teams poor performance was due to lack of discipline, coaching and other matters causing the unpredictable defeat at the hands of India. The PCB chairman told the committee that the most important reason for defeat was that the Pakistan team had only 12 days of training while eight weeks were required, besides the shifting of venues for Tests from Peshawar and Karachi. We had to take all steps based on Indian requests so that the major sporting event could materialise, and we were successful in our aim, he said. Replying to a query of the committee chairman, Khan said that he was unsatisfied with the result of the series. However, the PCB chairman said the series has been declared The best sporting event of the year 2004 (by Laureus Sport for Good Foundation). Bari too faced intense examination over the procedures adopted for selection of the team. The Senate committee chairman, Zafar Iqbal, later said they would invite former cricket captains to know their views on the current state of affairs. The PCB announced Peshawar and Karachi will host the two Test matches against Zimbabwe later this year.  Copyright

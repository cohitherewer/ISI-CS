The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav has raised the comfort-level of his players 
	 - A captain needs luck, sure, but that alone doesnt guarantee success: Wadekar  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Rawalpindi: Ajit Wadekar got labelled a Lucky Captain, but the world needs to know he was shrewd with a capital S  otherwise, the only series victory in the West Indies (1970-71) and the first in England (1971) wouldnt have come about under his leadership. In town as an invitee for the decider, Wadekar  who won four Tests and lost as many out of 16  spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on captaincy. The following are excerpts On the qualities a captain must have The ability to lead by example, the ability to generate confidence, the ability to manage 12/14/16 individuals who could have appreciably different ways of reacting to one situation, the ability to quickly grasp the limitations of a player and encourage him to be a champion within his skill-level... Also, he should always aim to win  of course, if thats not possible, the idea must be not to lose... (After a pause) Because of the cultural differences, the seat often becomes very hot for an Indian captain. On his own approach I was transparent and got the respect of my players... I didnt have a problem seeking suggestions from even the least experienced... On being labelled a Lucky Captain A captain needs luck, sure, but that alone doesnt guarantee success. On his top five captains (in order of ranking) STEVE WAUGH: Took Australia to an unconquerable level... Led from the front and, in my opinion, handled everything  including the Media, which has begun to play a big role  beautifully. Steve made the team more professional. MIKE BREARLEY: Probably the first captain to psychologically analyse every member of his own team and the opposition... Obviously, his degree in psychology would have helped... His USP was knowing exactly how to get the best out of each player. Basically, Brearley made optimum use of talent. MANSUR ALI KHAN PATAUDI: Brought in much-needed freshness... Moreover, for the first time, an Indian captain began focussing on fielding... Its Tiger who made us realise that runs saved were in effect runs scored... I dont think he was aloof, its just that some players were scared of interacting with him... He did consult seniors and, despite what may have been reported, the two of us got along well. [Incidentally, Wadekar succeeded Pataudi as captain, in 1970-71. In 1974-75, though, Pataudi was back at the helm after Wadekars premature retirement.] IMRAN KHAN: Great motivator and one who had the aura of a captain... A captain should convey hes the boss  Imran did that with flair... Years on, people still recall his inspirational role in the 1992 World Cup. SOURAV GANGULY: Has injected aggression and given the youngsters much confidence. In todays cricket, being aggressive is a must and Sourav has made that a characteristic of the present-day players... Then, the youngsters have much less pressure as they realise he will give them a fair run. As I see it, he has raised the comfort-level of his players... (Again, after a pause) In any case, his record speaks for itself. Finally, on whether captaining today is easier/difficult (Smiles) Depends... Every captain has a huge support staff, beginning with the coach and computer analyst. However, after a defeat, its the captain who gets the blame  not the analyst, coach or laptop... Indeed, with so much Media scrutiny, captaining is perhaps a wee bit tougher now. Inarguably, the pressure is more.  Copyright

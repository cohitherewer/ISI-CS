 Nisha loses
Vijayawada: Arjun Tiwari grounded woman Grandmaster Nisha Mohota in the third round of the 42nd National B chess championship on Friday. While most of the seeds had a smooth sailing, G.N. Gopal of Kerala stole the show with a sterling performance to defeat International Master V. Saravanan. IM S. Satyapragyan went down to former national junior champion Pramod Kumar Singh of Bihar. Meanwhile, top-seeded GM R. B. Ramesh had it easy against M. S. Thej Kumar of Karnataka and so did GM S. Vijayalakshmi who had a very satisfying victory over R. K. Mishra of Madhya Pradesh.

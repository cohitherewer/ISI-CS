The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wright, Sourav have made India a dangerous team 
 - All the hard work John has put in is paying off, he should get an extension: Simpson Simpson feels Ganguly has been leading from the front Tendulkar needs to recharge batteries Mumbai: Bobby Simpson believes there is nothing wrong with Sachin Tendulkars form but he does need to recharge batteries. I dont think there is anything wrong with Sachins form. He just needs to recharge his batteries. I would love to talk to him if he needs tips any time, said the former Australian skipper and coach, who is here to train under-14 cricketers at the CCI Academy. Simpson was responding to a question whether Tendulkars batting had slowed down in recent times. Simpson, who served as consultant of the Indian team for over a year, also said that skipper Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright had been instrumental in Indias success and the two have complemented each other with some fantastic wins abroad. John (Wright) is doing a superb job while Ganguly led from the front in Australia and Pakistan and this has helped India emerge as a very dangerous team, he said. I think John has played a significant role in moulding the Indian team and if I was connected with the BCCI, I would definitely give him an extension, Simpson remarked. My feeling is that John has got a few more years left as coach and all the hard work he has put in with the Indian team is paying off at last. It is better to have a coach who can deliver than a coach with a big name, Simpson observed. Talking about Team India, Simpson said: I think the fielding, which was quite good during the Pakistan tour, can improve further which would get the best out of the present bowling attack. Asked about Australias four-Test tour of India later this year, Simpson said: If they want to beat the Aussies in the forthcoming Test series, the Indians will have to improve in all departments of the game. Its not easy to beat the best team in the world if you dont have the right combination and if you dont play really hard, he added. On the controversy over suspect bowling actions, Simpson said: I dont want to take names here but I can say that some people have got away with suspect actions though the ICC can improve the system for the future. Talking fondly of his young wards here, Simpson said, I find coaching these kids a real pleasure as well as a challenge. It is very satisfying to see a smile on the youngsters face when they understand what is expected of them and that gives me immense satisfaction.  (PTI)  Copyright

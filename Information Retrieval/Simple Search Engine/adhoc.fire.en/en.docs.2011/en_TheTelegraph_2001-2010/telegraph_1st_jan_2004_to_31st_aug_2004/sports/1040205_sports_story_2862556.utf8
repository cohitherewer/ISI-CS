The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dont read much into Perth struggle
 - Though struggling with injury, Kumble would love to accomplish a mission  BY ALLAN BORDER  Sehwag and Tendulkar are too good to fail regularly India have a rare opportunity to round off a golden summer in Australia. Much as their batsmen have frustrated the home team, true lovers of the game have relished their silken style at the crease. They have been unhurried yet dominant, graceful yet ruthless. But it is the Australians who have a psychological edge going into the tri-series finals. I am not saying this because Indian batting struggled in Perth. It is just that Ricky Pontings men have that extra confidence with Brett Lee back to his destructive form. Again, it is not because of his success in Perth. It is just that matter of feeling. Indian bowling has been good and I cannot overstate the case of Irfan Pathan and company. One of the many good things that has happened for India on this tour is that their bowlers have continued to develop. Youngsters like Pathan and Balaji have shouldered the responsibility well. They are Indias bowling hopes, in this series and beyond. Yet they have not been able to stop the Australian run-making machine. There is nothing at this point of time to make us believe that they would do so in Melbourne and Sydney either. There have not been very clear-cut messages on Anil Kumbles fitness, so I would go with the media reports and believe he is struggling for the finals. It is a shame really, for Kumble has class and experience to lift his performance that extra notch in the finals. He is a big-match player and there is this pride to play and win titles for your country. He was not given a chance in the World Cup finals, and he would not like to miss a similar opportunity once more. He would love to finish off a process, which he could not do in the Tests. But let me not give the impression that I am completely writing off Sourav Gangulys men. Throughout the summer they have shown they are perfectly capable of giving Australians a run for their money. And a few of the Indian seniors would love to lay their hands on a rare trophy in Australia. Neither am I inclined to read too much into the struggle of Indian batsmen in Perth. Even for us Australians, it is not easy to come and score runs at the WACA. There was a time when Western Australia had a dominance in domestic cricket and it was because they enjoyed such unique conditions at the WACA. The other state sides used to come here every year and struggle. So, when even the locals take some adjusting to its pace and bouncy, you cannot read too much into Indians failure. Over the years Australia have loved giving visitors a taste of WACAs unique offerings. Except for the West Indies of the 80s of course! The Perth pitch had its typical pace and bounce and, in retrospect, Australia would have loved to play India on such type of wickets. The other venues offered good wickets and Indians bloomed, but here they struggled. It was not because of any technical deficiency, they remain marvellous to watch. It is just that WACA, like a hot spicy Indian curry, takes some time getting used to. Lee, of course, has now got his tail up. He was fired up on Sunday. He was responsible for the Indians losing half of their side for 79 runs  a rare happening this summer. It was very difficult for tail-enders to make any substantial contribution from then on. Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag might have been rusty but they are too good players to fail regularly. They would be in far more familiar terrains in Melbourne and Sydney. Everyone knows they chalked up their best Test scores at these venues  195 for Sehwag and 241 for Tendulkar  and the memory of those knocks should keep the Australians uptight.  (PTI)  Copyright

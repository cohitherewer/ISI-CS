The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India ride Debabrata strike against Pak
Rawalpindi: Indias fine opening spilled over to the football field as well, as they beat the hosts Pakistan 1-0 in the football match of the ninth South Asian Federation Games here Tuesday. Debabrata Roy scored the winner in the 71st minute through a penalty, guiding his side to victory at the Army Stadium. India had at least four goal scoring chances in the match. However, the hosts concentrated mostly in clearing the ball at any cost, which resulted in the match turning out to be rather rough. India held the edge in the first half with medios Roy and Marlanki working in tandem with Jerry Zirsanga, S. Malsawmtluanga and Malswama up front. In the second session, though India missed two difficult chances, they had a well-organised attack and most of their moves emanated from the left wing. India now have four points from two matches, while Pakistan have three. Bangladesh, who were held to a draw by both India and Afghanistan in earlier matches, are at two points and will next clash with Pakistan. The outcome of this match will decide the two teams for the last four stages. India are to finish their league engagements on Thursday with a match against Afghanistan, after a days rest Wednesday. On Wednesday, Sri Lanka play Bhutan. (PTI)  Copyright

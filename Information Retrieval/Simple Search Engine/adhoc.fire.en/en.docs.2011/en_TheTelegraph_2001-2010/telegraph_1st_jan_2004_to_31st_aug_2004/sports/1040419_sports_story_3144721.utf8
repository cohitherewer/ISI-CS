 Medical inquiry into Shoaib injury 
 - PCB chief promises action if anybody is found lacking in commitment  Shoaib Akhtar is in a spot of bother Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will hold an inquiry into the injury to Shoaib Akhtar during the third and final Test against India in Rawalpindi. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said a medical inquiry committee would also probe injuries sustained by other players during the three-Test series that depleted the Pakistan team. Shoaib injured himself when he fell down in his follow-through on the second day, hurting his wrist and later also complained of a side muscle strain. But he batted on the fourth day without any apparent discomfort, hitting 28 quick runs with two sixes and four boundaries. Although Shoaib came out with a statement on Saturday saying he had given his best for the team, Khan said members of the medical inquiry committee will be announced later in the week. On the completion of the medical committees report and on receipt of the responses from certain players... (we will) decide on disciplinary action, if any, that is to be taken, Khan said. The PCB chief said his main concern and regret was the manner in which the Rawalpindi Test was lost without the semblance of a fight. I have taken serious notice of this lack of commitment to national honour, Khan said. I want to make it crystal clear that any player who is found incapable or unwilling to give 150 per cent for the team morale and national honour, will have no place in the Pakistan team, Khan said. Pakistan lost the three-match series 1-2, losing the third Test by an innings and 131 runs. The defeat gave India its first ever Test series win in Pakistan and the first overseas since 1993-94. Pakistan had also lost the five-match ODI series 2-3. Pakistans capitulation in the third Test and the controversy surrounding the manner in which Shoaib injured himself and did not bowl at all on the third day of the match has led to scathing criticism from the media and former players. Rameez removal The PCB is all set to remove Rameez Raja from the post of chief executive officer and plans to advertise for a full-timer for the job, adds a report from Islamabad. The PCB is likely to advertise for the post of CEO along with various other positions shortly, local daily Dawn reported quoting board officials. The officials said that moves were underway to get a full-time CEO but they were put on hold due to the Indo-Pak series. It now appears that the PCB wishes to get a full-time professional official instead of appointing anyone on an honorary basis like Rameez. The board is of the view that a person working in an honorary capacity would not do justice to his post. (Agencies)  Copyright

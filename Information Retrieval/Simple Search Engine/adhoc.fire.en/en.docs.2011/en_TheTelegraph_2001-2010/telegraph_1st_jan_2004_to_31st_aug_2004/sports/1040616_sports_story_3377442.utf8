The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Germans, Dutch draw
Porto: The irrepressible Ruud van Nistelrooy scored a brilliant goal nine minutes from full time to give The Netherlands a 1-1 draw in group D of Euro 2004. With the Dutch desperately looking for the equaliser, Van Nistelrooy produced a gem of a side-volley to beat Oliver Kahn who otherwise had a great match. Germany had taken the lead in the 30th minute off a freakish Torsten Frings free-kick. His right-footed effort swung in from the left, eluded teammate Bernd Schneider, the static Dutch defence and goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar before bouncing into the net just inside the far post. It was a costly goal for the Dutch as their captain Philip Cocu earned a yellow card to concede the free-kick for a foul on Philipp Lahm. (Reuters)  Copyright

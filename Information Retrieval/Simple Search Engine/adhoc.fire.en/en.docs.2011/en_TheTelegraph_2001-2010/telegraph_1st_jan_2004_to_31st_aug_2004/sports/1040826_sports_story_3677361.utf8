 Greece protest rejected
Athens: Greeces protest against the defeat of boxer Elias Pavlidis in the Olympic quarter finals by Egypts Ahmed Ismail has been rejected, the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA) said on Wednesday. It said it had rejected the protest because a particular unfair blow by Ismail in that second round had been ruled accidental. Some angry home fans hurled plastic water bottles into the ring on Tuesday after the referee stopped Pavlidis in the third round for a cut over his left eye, preventing him from becoming the first Greek boxer to win an Olympic medal. Pavlidis was leading 19-12 on points when Indonesian P K M Raja stopped the contest. The Greek Olympic Committee appealed against the decision, saying video evidence showed Ismail had dealt several unfair blows, especially in the second round. The protest said Ismail should have been disqualified in the second round for not competing fairly. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe rebels go public with demands
Harare: Zimbabwes rebel cricketers have released an open letter in which they accuse some members of the countrys ruling body of intimidation and of offering one white player cash to stand aside to allow a black teammate to take his place. The extraordinary statement details their nine points of disagreement with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union which have threatened to tear the sport apart since skipper Heath Streak was sacked last week.  Streak wanted a shake-up of the selection process and complained of political interference in the team.  The statement, which was issued on Wednesday, was signed by 13 white players  Streak, Stuart Carlisle, Grant Flower, Craig Wishart, Andy Blignaut, Raymond Price, Gary Brent, Sean Irvine, Travis Friend, Barney Rodgers, Trevor Gripper, Richard Simms and Neil Ferreria. We have been concerned for some time about what we consider to be the unprofessional manner of selection. There has been interference of a non-sporting nature, said the statement. There has, in our view, been racial and ethnic discrimination in the selection of the national team. We believe that problems of this kind can be rectified if minimum qualifications for selectors were introduced, as we have suggested.  We should also stress that the minimum qualifications proposed by the players are not discriminatory and indeed it would in our view be easy for a selection panel to be established with a majority of qualified black Zimbabweans. Names that come to mind would be Ethan Dube and Mpumelelo Mbangwa (providing he is willing to give up his media commentary) both of whom are qualified, ex-national players.  The players also angrily denounced the intimidation of players and a journalist.  We have been made aware that at least one black journalist and at least one black player (who has asked us not to reveal his name for his own safety) have been threatened by a member of the board not to side with Heath. We suspect that other black members of the team have been phoned and threatened in the same manner.  Once again, we have been reliably informed that a board member suggested during a selection meeting that Mark Vermuelen be offered a double match fee, not to play (in the fourth one-day International against Bangladesh). The suggestion was made to try and pave the way for Stuart Matsikanyeri, who had been dropped, to play. In conclusion, the players insisted that their criticisms are not racially motivated.

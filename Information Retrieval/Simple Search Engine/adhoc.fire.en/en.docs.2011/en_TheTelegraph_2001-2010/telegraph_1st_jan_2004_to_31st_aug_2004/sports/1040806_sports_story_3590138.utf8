The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Security loopholes abound
 BY HARRY DE QUETTEVILLE  A Greek soldier outside the Olympic stadium complex in Athens on Thursday. (Reuters) Ten days before the Olympic Games start in Athens, passes allowing vehicles into several venues, including the Olympic village, have been stolen. A security source said that the passes were taken from the windscreens of unattended official vehicles. Some people left the doors of their cars unlocked and the thieves just came in and took the accreditations, he said. It is not clear whether the thefts were opportunistic or part of a plot to breach the 700 million security operation for the Games, which begin on August 13. The security arrangements, described earlier this week by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, president of the Athens Organising Committee, or Athoc, as the biggest contribution ever made by the armed forces at a time of peace in Greece has mobilised some 70,000 soldiers and police. But the theft of the passes raises fears that terrorists driving car or truck bombs could still get through. According to sources within Athoc, the Games have been hit by another security failure, after plans to check the backgrounds of staff, contractors and volunteers were dropped as organisers ran out of time. The problems began in mid-May, when organisers began recruiting 7,000 workers to undertake jobs from general receptionists to housekeepers for the Olympic village. But with so many people to process in only three months, the planned background checks were scrapped. Background checks require 20 days for each employee, a source said. But Athoc was trying to hire so many people that the checks have not been done. In many cases the pressure to get staff meant that extremely poorly qualified people were hired, but we dont know the backgrounds of many others. Now thousands of staff and contractors with unverified histories are moving freely around supposedly secure venues because formal accreditation passes, bearing photos of the holder, have still not been issued.

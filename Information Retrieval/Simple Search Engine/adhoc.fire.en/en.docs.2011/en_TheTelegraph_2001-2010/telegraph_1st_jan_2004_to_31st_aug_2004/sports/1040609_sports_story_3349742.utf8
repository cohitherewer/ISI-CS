 France fret over Desailly fitness
Clairefontaine: France are still fretting over the fitness of their captain Marcel Desailly just five days before starting the defence of their European title against England. The experienced defender sustained a knee injury two weeks ago and missed the last two warm-up games against Andorra and the Ukraine, with coach Jacques Santini opting for a central pairing of Lilian Thuram and Mikael Silvestre. Nobody can take anything for granted, Santini said. There is not a player who can say for sure today that he is going to play against England. We will pick the players in the best shape on the day of the match. But Marcel is still our captain and Zinedine (Zidane) will wear the armband if Desailly is not playing. Desailly will end his international career after the European Championship. He has won a French record 115 caps since his debut in 1993, captaining the team over the last four years. He turns 36 in September but the cornerstone of the victorious French campaigns at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 is no longer indispensable. He still has a big influence on the squad, however, with his experience of big tournaments and Santini understands the importance of that. Marcel took some time to talk to (striker) Louis Saha before the match, Santini said. Its important the players get along fine. You need some mutual understanding off the field to play together. Desailly is relaxed about the situation. My knee is still aching but its getting better every day, he said. The coach makes choices and I have to respect them but if he picked me in the 23-name list there must be a good reason for it. Im not worried about what is going to happen.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

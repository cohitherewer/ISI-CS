 Youhana: Pathan did trouble me
Islamabad, May 17 (PTI): Pakistan vice-captain Yusuf Youhana has acknowledged that he was troubled by young Indian pacer Irfan Pathans swing bowling in the recent series but denied that the bowler had gained a psychological hold. You should accept and respect a good bowler. Yes, I did face problems against Pathan bringing the ball in late. He got me out twice in this manner, while the third time I wasnt out in the one-dayers. But I worked hard and did reasonably well against him in the Tests.  Copyright

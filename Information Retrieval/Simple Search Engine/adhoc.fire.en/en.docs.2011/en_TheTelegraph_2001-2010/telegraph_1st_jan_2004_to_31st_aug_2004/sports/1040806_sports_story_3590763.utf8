The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Camp gets underway
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The probables camp for the national football team officially got underway on Thursday, but the workouts will start only on Friday. Twenty four of the 35 probables, along with chief coach Stephen Constantine and his assistant Aloke Mukherjee, have already assembled in the city. Meanwhile, a communication gap led to selector Prasun Banerjee turning up at the SAI ground in the morning, only to learn later that practice sessions start from Friday.  Copyright

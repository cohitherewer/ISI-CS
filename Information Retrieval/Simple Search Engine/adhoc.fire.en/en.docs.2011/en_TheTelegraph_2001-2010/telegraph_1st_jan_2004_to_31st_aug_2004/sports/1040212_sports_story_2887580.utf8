The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Injured captain to return home
New Delhi: England A captain Alex Gidman will return home this week, midway through his teams tour of India, due to a finger injury. The 22-year-old Gloucestershire allrounder missed the first two one-day matches against India A, which his team lost earlier this week to go down in the three-match series. Alex had broken his finger after being struck in the nets during practice in December and he hasnt really done very much since, England A manager Nigel Laughton said over telephone from Chennai. He saw two specialists here and they both felt he needed at least three more weeks of rest, he added. Gidman has scored 965 runs at an average of 32.16 and taken 15 wickets in 18 first-class matches. Fast bowler Simon Jones, sidelined for 15 months after rupturing his cruciate knee ligament in only his second Test against Australia in Brisbane, played the second one-dayer on Tuesday after having missed the first due to knee stiffness. He picked up one for 45 from his 10 overs. Jones is seeking to prove his fitness ahead of a four-Test tour of the Caribbean starting in March.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

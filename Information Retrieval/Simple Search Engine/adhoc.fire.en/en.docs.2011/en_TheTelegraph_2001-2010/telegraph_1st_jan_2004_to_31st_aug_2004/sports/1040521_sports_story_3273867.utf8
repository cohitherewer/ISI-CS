 Coach finds new Olympic hopefuls
 Rajinder is satisfied New Delhi: Indian coach Rajinder Singh Thursday expressed satisfaction over the performance of his experimental side in the four-nation hockey tournament and said a few players could stake their claim for a berth in the Athen Olympics squad. It was an experimental side and I am satisfied with their performance, Rajinder told reporters at the Indira Gandhi International Airport after the teams arrival from Japan. The national coach was all praise for penalty corner specialist Sandeep Singh, defender William Xalxo and Tushar Khandekar. Players like Sandeep Singh, Xalco and Khandekar took the opportunity to prove their potential and could stake a claim in the national squad for the Olympics. The Indian side, consisting mostly junior players, suffered a humiliating 1-6 loss to Asian Games gold medallist South Korea in the final on Tuesday. They, however, defeated hosts Japan and China but lost to the Koreans in the league stage. Rajinder said the other players from the squad also gained valuable experience which would come handy in the campaign during the junior World Cup. When asked whether he was disappointed at not getting the same welcome as last year, Rajinder said it was part and parcel of the job. We are trying to create a bench strength and hence the Indian Hockey Federation is sending experimental sides for the tournaments. It is obvious that when we return triumphant we get a warm welcome, but one should understand that we are taking such steps considering the future prospectives.  (PTI)  Copyright

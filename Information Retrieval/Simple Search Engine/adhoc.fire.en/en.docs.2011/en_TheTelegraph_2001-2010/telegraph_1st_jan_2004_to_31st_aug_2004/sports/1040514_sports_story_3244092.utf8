 Anjus potshots at govt 
 Anju is totally disgusted with existing system Doha, May 13 (AFP): The first Indian athlete to win a world championship medal has launched a strongly-worded attack on the authorities back home for neglecting sports, warning their attitude could lead to another disappointing show at the Olympics. Anju Bobby Georges leap of 6.7 m fetched her the bronze at the World Championships in Paris last year, finally putting cricket-mad India on the medals table of the most prestigious track and field competition. Adulation accompanied by riches followed her success, but Anju is disappointed that the government since then hasnt done enough to help the country win a long overdue medal in athletics at the Olympics this August. The government has failed to do its duty in the improvement of sports, Anju told Qatars Gulf Times newspaper on Thursday. She also took potshots at the Indian politicians while expressing her total disgust at the system in her country. The ministers are not efficient, she said. If the government wants medals in top events they will have to provide world class facilities to the athletes. The infrastructure needs to be improved drastically and scientific methods have to be introduced. Anju said: It wont be just the athletes who will be forced to endure the humiliation but also every Indian who dreams of an Olympic medal, she warned. Still, if an Indian manages to win a medal in Athens, it will be only because of his or her hard work and not due to any help from the government, she said. Anju, currently ranked sixth in the world, said she was tired of asking the government for help and was focusing only on her preparations for the Olympics.  Copyright

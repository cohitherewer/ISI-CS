		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 EURO DIGEST
 Espinho: Germanys Markus Merk will referee the Euro 2004 final on Sunday in Lisbon, organisers announced on Monday. Swedens Anders Frisk will be in charge of Wednesdays semi-final between hosts Portugal and The Netherlands, and Pierluigi Collina of Italy will referee Thursdays semi-final between Greece and the Czech Republic. Merk, 42, refereed the France versus England group B match and the 2-2 draw between Sweden and Denmark which sent both countries into the quarter finals at the expense of Italy. He also refereed the 2003 Champions League final between AC Milan and Juventus. Porto: Denmark striker Ebbe Sand announced his international retirement on Monday after his team was knocked out of Euro 2004. Sand, 31, won 66 caps and scored 22 goals. He started all three Euro 2004 group games but missed Sundays 0-3 quarter final defeat by the Czech Republic because of a leg muscle injury. Sand told a news conference he was no longer physically capable of playing for both his country and German club Schalke 04.  Lisbon: Portuguese soccer great Eusebio says the late Lev Yashin may have helped Portugal defeat England 6-5 in the penalty shootout victory in the quarter finals. Writing in the O Jogo newspaper, Eusebio said he picked up a few tips from Yashin about saving penalties and passed them on to Portugal keeper Ricardo.				 																																	I learned this secret from the great Yashin and fortunately it paid off. I quickly told him (Ricardo) to guess which side the ball was going to go. If you guess right there is then a 70 per cent chance you will save it. He managed to do it and whats more did it without gloves. And then he had the courage to score the winning penalty, something he has already done when he used to play for Boavista. Albufeira: Dutch captain Frank de Boer will miss the 2004 semi-final against Portugal on Wednesday because of an ankle injury.				 																																	A scan on Monday showed he had damaged his ankle ligaments and it was quot;almost certain quot; de Boer would not play again at the tournament, the Dutch said in a statement.				 																																	De Boer, 34, has won a Dutch record of 112 caps and had said he would retire after the tournament. He did not train with the rest of the squad on Monday.  Lisbon: Czech right back Martin Jiranek has been ruled out of Thursdays semi-final against Greece with a muscle injury to his right thigh.				 																																	Team doctor Petr Krejci said Jiranek would not recover in time to play after suffering the injury in the first half of Sundays 3-0 quarter final defeat of Denmark.				 																																	He needs more time to recover because it is a bad injury, said the doctor.

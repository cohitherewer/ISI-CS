(Reuters) Valencia: Valencia clinched their place in the Uefa Cup final after a first-half penalty from leading scorer Mista gave them a 1-0 aggregate win over regional rivals Villarreal on Thursday. The Primera Liga leaders now meet Olympique Marseille, who cruised to a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United, in Gothenburg on May 19 in what will be their third European final in five seasons. For Villarreal defeat brought an end to a remarkable first-ever European campaign in which they have notched up a string of high-profile victims including Galatasaray, AS Roma and Celtic on their way to the semi-finals. Valencia, who are based just 60km further along the Mediterranean coast from their neighbours, remain on course for a first-ever domestic and European double. Rafa Benitezs side laid siege to the Villarreal goal from the start, pinning the visitors back in their own area and forcing a string of corners in a breathless first five minutes. Villarreal keeper Pepe Reina had to react quickly to turn a shot from Mista round the post and defender Quique Alvarez came to the rescue moments later when he cleared a goal-bound Roberto Ayala header off the line. Midfielder Ruben Baraja then fired a metre wide with a 25-metre drive but five minutes later Valencia took the lead with the first goal of the tie. Villarreal defender Juliano Bellettis challenge on Mista was deemed illegal and the striker took the spot kick himself, drilling it past the out-stretched Reina and inside the post. Curro Torres went close to extending the Valencia lead when he snapped over the bar from the edge of the area after midfielder Mohamed Sissoko had cut back a pass from the byline. Villarreal gradually adjusted to the pace of the match with the lively Jose Mari and Argentine playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme probing for gaps in the Valencia defence. Jose Mari eventually managed to create some space for Sonny Anderson in the 26th minute and it took a brilliant one-handed save from Santiago Canizares to stop the Brazilians vicious swerving 20-metre shot. It was Villarreal, who took control of possession as the half wore on, but despite some neat approach play they were unable to prise open the well-organised Valencia defence. Valencia moved up a gear once more after the break and although Villarreal still needed just one goal to turn the tie, they were never given a look-in by the home sides rugged back four. Winger Xisco went close to adding a second early in the second half, but his close-range shot was well blocked by Reina. Benitez brought on Argentine playmaker Pablo Aimar and in-form winger Vicente in the latter stages to put Villarreal under further pressure, but they had to settle for just the one goal. Drogba strikes twice Two superb goals from striker Didier Drogba sent Olympique Marseille through to the Uefa Cup final for the second time on Thursday after a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United. Drogba struck in each half at the Stade Velodrome to settle the semi-final after a goalless first leg. Ivory Coast forward Drogba, the Ligue 1 Player of the Year, showed fine individual skill to turn inside defender Aaron Hughes to net after 18 minutes. His powerful strike from a well-rehearsed free kick sealed the win eight minutes from time. He was only denied a hattrick in the closing moments by a fine Shay Given save and was then substituted to rapturous applause. Drogba has now scored 11 goals in Europe this season  his first with the former European champions since joining from En Avant Guingamp. He hit five in the Champions League, which Marseille exited after the first group stage, and he has been on the mark in every round of the Uefa Cup. Marseille are the second French side to reach a European final in 24 hours after Monacos Champions League semi-final victory over Chelsea on Wednesday. Injury-hit Newcastle, without several key players including Wales striker Craig Bellamy and England midfielders Kieron Dyer and Jermaine Jenas and defender Jonathan Woodgate, rarely threatened to deny Marseille their first European final since 1999 when they lost to Parma in this competition. A cautious opening produced no noteworthy chances, with Given easily dealing with weak efforts from Manuel Dos Santos and Drogba. But the Ivorian then demonstrated why he is the hottest property in French football with a classy finish to net the opening goal. A Newcastle free kick was swiftly cleared out of defence and on a two-against-one break, Camel Meriem released the over-lapping Drogba and his strength and agility allowed him to brush away Hughes and fire home. The game was halted briefly for a fire cracker to be extinguished behind Fabien Barthezs goal but when it resumed Newcastle were almost caught napping again. Steve Marlet was afforded too much space down the right but the pacey striker, having evaded the out-rushing Given, was forced wide and the chance went. The home side put Newcastle under the cosh for the rest of the half, with only a Laurent Robert free kick, skyed over from distance, relieving the pressure for the premier league side. Newcastle came out with greater purpose after the re-start and Shola Ameobi, using his strength to wriggle free in the area, curled narrowly wide. Alan Shearer, like his strike partner starved of service in the first half, then forced Barthez to stoop low to save but Marseilles threat on the break was all to evident when Marlet was denied by a deflection. Newcastle continued to huff and puff without creating a clear-cut chance and their hopes of progressing were extinguished on 82 minutes when Drogba, arriving on the penalty spot, smashed in a free kick rolled into him from the right.

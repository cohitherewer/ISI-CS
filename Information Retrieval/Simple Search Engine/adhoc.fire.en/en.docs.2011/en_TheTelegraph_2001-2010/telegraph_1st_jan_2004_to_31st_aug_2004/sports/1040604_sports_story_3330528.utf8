		 Friday, June 04, 2004  Smarty Jones bids for triple crown 
				 										Newyork: Smarty Jones, bidding to become the first triple crown winner in more than 25 years, drew the outside number nine post position for Saturdays Belmont Stakes. The Pennsylvania-bred colt out of Elusive Quality was installed at the 2-5 morning line favourite for the 136th running of the race.				 										I am happy with the post, said Smarty Jones trainer John Servis.We can sit outside of horses and he doesnt have to worry about what is going on outside of him. With a win, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner would become the 12th triple crown winner and first since Affirmed in 1978. Smarty Jones is unbeaten in eight starts and will be ridden by Stewart Elliott. (Reuters)

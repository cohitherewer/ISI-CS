The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McGrath fit for comeback
Sydney: Glenn McGrath has recovered from a persistent ankle injury and is hoping to return to international cricket. McGrath has not played for eight months after having two operations on his left ankle. I have had a number of excellent net sessions over the past week and the ankle feels fantastic, he said in a statement on Monday. I have been training hard over the past month with my personal trainer and I am the fittest I have been for a long time. McGrath will make his comeback in the Sydney grade competition this weekend but is likely to miss Australias tour of Sri Lanka later this month. The squad will be announced on Friday but McGrath is unlikely to be included because of his lack of match practice. However, the lanky paceman is hoping to be recalled for Australias tour of Zimbabwe in May. I have said all along that I would not return until the ankle was 100 per cent, said McGrath, who has captured 430 Test wickets. McGraths manager, Warren Craig, said it was now up to the selectors to decide when he returned to the national side.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

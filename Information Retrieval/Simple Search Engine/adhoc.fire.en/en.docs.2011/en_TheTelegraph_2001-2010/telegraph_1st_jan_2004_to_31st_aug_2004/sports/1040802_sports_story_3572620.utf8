 ACC to seek rotation policy review
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Colombo: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has decided to formally ask the International Cricket Council to review its policy of rotation with regard to hosting the quadrennial showpiece  the World Cup. It has been unanimously decided at our meeting today (Sunday) to call for a quick review... The present arrangement, whereby the sub continent  which has four Test teams  will get a chance after four editions have been held elsewhere is unacceptable... We want the region to get an opportunity every three times, ACC president Jagmohan Dalmiya told The Telegraph. Incidentally, where cricket figuring in the 2006 Qatar Asian Games is concerned, the ACC isnt very enthusiastic. Apparently, clarifications are going to be sought from the Olympic Council of Asia.

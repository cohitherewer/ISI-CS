 Williams destroys Zimbabwe
 - TRI-SERIES - Australia make it two out of two despite a modest 225  Brad Williams celebrates taking a catch against Zimbabwe at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday. (Reuters) Sydney: Brad Williams captured four wickets in 15 balls in a devastating spell of fast bowling to steer Australia to a 99-run win over Zimbabwe in the tri-series match on Sunday. Williams ripped through the Zimbabwean top order before returning to mop up the tail as the Africans collapsed to 126 all out in the 38th over in reply to Australias 225 for eight. The speedster finished with career-best figures of five for 22 as the world champions cruised to their second win of the competition following their 18-run victory over India in Melbourne on Friday. Were not playing our best cricket yet but its a good start to the series, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. I was a little bit disappointed by how many (runs) we got, but we bowled and fielded well enough to ensure we won pretty easily. Zimbabwe, who had beaten Australia just once in their previous 20 meetings, looked to be in with a chance of pulling off an upset after restricting the home side to a modest total. But their hopes were dashed quite early when their batsmen collapsed to 17 for five within the first eight overs, Williams featuring in all five dismissals. Its very disappointing because we bowled ourselves into a position where we could have been right in this game, said Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak, who top-scored for his side with 46. But I dont think weve got to panic just yet, its only the first game of the series. Williams triggered Zimbabwes collapse when he had dangerman Stuart Carlisle caught at first slip for one in the second over before taking a difficult outfield catch to remove Vusi Sibanada for seven off Jason Gillespie. The Western Australia paceman then removed Mark Vermeulen for five and Grant Flower and Stewart Matsikenyeri for ducks to leave the Africans reeling. Streak and Tatenda Taibu briefly steadied the innings with a sixth-wicket stand of 73, but the end came swiftly once they parted. Williams claimed his fifth wicket when tail-ender Andy Blignaut, sparring at a bouncer, was caught at second slip by Ponting. Zimbabwes dismal batting was in stark contrast to the performance of their bowlers, who had reduced Australia to 118 for five in the 28th over before Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke came to the rescue. Symonds, who made 88 in Australias 18-run win over India, top-scored with a patient 42 from 82 balls while Clarke made 40 off 57 deliveries. Opener Adam Gilchrist blasted five boundaries in a quick 34 off 44 balls but a steady fall of wickets enabled Zimbabwe to stem the run flow. Matthew Hayden went for 14 when he played on to Streak before Blignaut got rid of Ponting for 21 and then Gilchrist with the total on 77. Flower removed Damien Martyn and Michael Bevan in his first two overs, both caught and bowled, before Symonds and Clarke came together. Symonds eventually departed in the 44th over when he top-edged a ball from Sean Ervine to Douglas Hondo in the covers while trying to lift the run-rate. (Reuters)  Copyright

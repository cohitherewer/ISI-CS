The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Englands chance to complete sweep

(Reuters) Nottingham: England head into the final Test against New Zealand, starting at Trent Bridge on Thursday, looking to complete a 3-0 series win. After the seven-wicket win at Lords and an emphatic nine-wicket victory at Headingley, Michael Vaughans men will be firm favourites against an injury-hit New Zealand side struggling to field a proper pace attack. Despite two convincing wins there have been periods in both games where England were on the backfoot. New Zealand lost also because they could not add on the pressure England were under. The most impressive aspect of Englands play success has been the way both seasoned players and newcomers rose to the challenge of fighting back. New Zealands Chris Cairns acknowledges this. The allrounder has announced this will be his final Test. Cairns was the star of the show when New Zealand won the 1999 series in England 2-1 but said the current England side was the most resilient he had known. There are some fantastic players in English cricket. Ive always believed that, theyve just never had the ability to harness it at international level, Cairns said. Now the English are starting to do that. This England team is possibly the toughest Ive been involved against. Their resolve is significant and they seem to be gelling. Thats the one thing Ive always felt the English team has missed. In Harmison with Flintoff, Hoggard and Jones, they have an attack capable of taking 20 wickets. Andrew Strauss arrival to Test cricket (112 and 83 on debut at Lords, 62 at Headingley) and wicketkeeper Geraint Jones century in the second Test have played a big role in Englands series win. Coach Duncan Fletcher said the fact that so many of the new recruits were not callow youngsters had helped them cope. I think the age of the new guys and the fact they are in their mid-20s might be an important part, the coach said. I think the key is that theyve gone away and realised what is required, they realise what theyve got to do to be a Test player. That has certainly been true of fast bowler Stephen Harmison, who has maintained the good form he showed during Englands 3-0 win in the Caribbean with 15 wickets at an average of just over 22. For New Zealand, who saw pace spearhead Shane Bond return home without bowling a ball in the series, there was some positive news. Although Michael Papps was ruled out with a broken finger, Craig McMillan, the man he replaced, came through a net session having suffered a similar injury. Meanwhile, contrary to original assessments, New Zealand said Daniel Vettori had merely pulled rather than torn his hamstring in Leeds and refused to rule out the left-arm spinner from playing at Trent Bridge. England have added fast bowler James Anderson, fit after a heel injury, to their Headingley XI and he could replace Martin Saggers.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Williams boss wants to give up his place
 BY DAVID THOMAS  File picture of Frank Williams with Juan Pablo Montoya Sir Frank Williams is famous for the ruthlessness with which he replaces his racing drivers. Sundays British Grand Prix at Silverstone marked the 25th anniversary of the Williams Formula 1 teams first victory. The driver in 1979 was Clay Regazzoni. At the end of that season, Regazzoni was swapped for another driver, Carlos Reutemann. In 1996, Damon Hill became world champion, driving a Williams. His reward was to be fired, amid howls of outrage from British fans. But now Williams is going one stage further. He is preparing to sack himself. There are definitely people available wholl do a much better job for the company than I can, he says in his thin, rasping and refined English accent. Thats without question. Im looking for someone to take my place. Ive got to. Its common sense. It could be one day, one year, two years, I dont know. But my time is coming. Sooner rather than later, within five years, Ill kick myself upstairs. Hopefully Ill be clever enough to recognise the right time, and the right person, to take over. The very thought that Williams, one of the great powers of Formula 1, is even thinking about stepping aside will send shock waves down the pit lane. But more than once in our interview he insists that he is completely serious. And hes brutally honest about the reasons why, which begin with the effects of his infirmity, after the car crash in 1986 that left him paralysed from the neck down. I never get into work much before 11am because it takes forever to get me up. I leave about 8.15 in the evening. But then I dont get that much done. I cant write. I can dial some of my numbers with my knuckles, but often I f**** it up  excuse the language. It just takes me twice as long to do things, so I come in at weekends to make up for it. Ron Dennis of McLaren once said, Frank must have lots of time for thinking. Bollocks! Ferrari now have 184 points in this years constructors championship, against just 41 for Williams. This is not what Williams and his engine-supplying partners at BMW expect from the resources they devote to the team. There are 500 people working here and maybe 300 at BMW, Williams says. We spend about  90 million a year. BMW spends a bit more than that, but its not for me to say exactly how much. You could say the Ferrari boss Jean Todt does a better job than me and youd be right, he adds candidly. This is all a cycle of meshing wheels, and if we get ours to mesh better and faster than Ferrari, well beat them. Thats what were striving to do, and its the same at McLaren or anywhere else. As for Michael Schumacher, Hes a very special individual, Williams says. Its his mental application that sets him apart. He sets standards. He pushes people. He inspires people. So is Schumacher the best driver Williams has ever seen? Ayrton Senna was just as quick, just as brave and probably more intelligent, Williams says. Ive always thought he could have become President of Brazil. He was a terribly clever guy. In any negotiation, you had to be good at chess because he had always prepared at least three moves and four counter-moves for every possibility. He had astonishing mental preparation. Senna died driving for Williams during the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. I dont miss him that much, Williams says. Its been 10 years and hes gone, so ... So why waste time on what cant be retrieved? Williams is not a man given to undue nostalgia. Looking backwards doesnt help going forwards. This is the steely Frank Williams I am expecting to meet when I walk into his office, a few miles south-west of Oxford. The headquarters cover several acres of brick office buildings and pristine factory workshops. The raison detre of the complex is revealed when one walks into a marble-floored atrium and sees in the middle  standing like a glamorous work of sculpture  a gleaming Williams Formula 1 car. Williams very survival has been a matter of grim determination. He simply cannot afford to wallow in self-pity or wonder what might have been. In a few brusque words he dismisses any discussion of his crash, which happened on the way back from the Paul Ricard circuit in France, where he had been watching his cars being tested. I had an accident because it was inevitable with the way I drove. It was very silly. But Id rather not talk about all that. Its not really relevant. It doesnt affect my outlook on Formula 1. Motor racing is my job. I like it very much and I think its a privilege. Im very fortunate that my lifes worked out this way.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

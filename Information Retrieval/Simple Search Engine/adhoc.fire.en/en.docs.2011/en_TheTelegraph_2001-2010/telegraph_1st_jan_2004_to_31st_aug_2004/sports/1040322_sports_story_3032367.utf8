The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pathan has success in him
 - Bowlers are trying to do too much in this series: Aaqib Javed  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Aaqib Javed says he could have played 4-5 years more Lahore: Lack of aggression has let Indian pacers down in the ongoing series, feels Aaqib Javed. Their body language has not been positive, according to the former Pakistan pacer and Under-19 World Cup-winning coach. The Indians have never been aggressive. Even Jawagal Srinath, who often bowled at 90 mph, lacked the necessary aggression. Zaheer Khan struggled in the first three games and Lakshmipathy Balaji is timid. The only exception has been Irfan Pathan who has it in him to be successful, Aaqib told The Telegraph before the fourth ODI on Sunday. Aaqib  who returned dream figures of seven for 37, including a hattrick, against India in Sharjah 1991-92  was the first player to be fined by the ICC for dissent and also the first to be served a one-match suspension. He feels the bowlers have been trying too much on batsmen-friendly wickets in this series which has led to huge tallies of Mr Extras. Its the run-up up that gives you confidence. If you err there, it upsets the entire rhythm. There shouldnt be no-balls at this level. The wides also happen because of wrong wrist position. In the first few overs one should concentrate only on natural swing and not try anything special, he remarked. To minimise no-balls and wides, the coach in Aaqib is even thinking of inculcating the take-off board used in long jump. The take-off board should be regarded as the point of delivery. If you mark your run-up and run in there, you can get it right in just a couple of days. Shoaib Akhtar, Aaqib feels, is struggling with rhythm. He is going flat out for pace too early in the innings. Pakistans strategy should be simple: Shoaib is the strike bowler, so the rest should only look to contain the Indians. During our playing days, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis were the strike bowlers and my role was not to give away more than 40 runs in the 10 overs. Aaqib believes it is because of genetical, cultural and socio-economic factors that Pakistan have regularly produced quality fast bowlers. Were generally tall and strongly built and that helps a lot. Besides, there is the diet. Pakistanis eat lots of meat. You get lot of aggression from beef and red meat. We also get to play a lot of tennis ball cricket at a young age. The lighter ball needs power to be thrown at a distance. It helps develop your muscles and gives flexibility to the joints and ligaments, Aaqib observed. One also has role models to fall back on. I grew up idolising Imran Khan. Todays boys have Akram and Waqar to emulate. Among the current lot, Shoaib is the most famous. Fast bowling instils thrill and style, he said. Aaqib feels Zaheers problem is his run-up. Zaheer needs to reduce his jump. The flow is missing in his run-up. When he jumps theres a pause and hes stuck for a while. Then he tries to put force through the shoulder. The run-up should be like an aeroplanes take off. The discussion invariably switches to reverse swing. Its something not easy to explain. The wrist position is very important. It should be directed towards first slip so that it creates an angle. This is besides maintaining the shine on one side and leaving it dry. Bowlers who are side-on, will always get the advantage. he said. But did he not quit a little too early? I could have played another four-five years.I finished in December 1998 and in 2001 was a national selector. Then I took over as coach. I still bowl at nets with my boys. The game hasnt left me and Im very satisfied.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We let down all: Dipendu
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 			Calcutta: Even as gloom descended on the Mohammedan Sporting camp in Margao after the 2-3 loss to Dempo on Friday, the Tollygunge Agragami players heaved a huge sigh of relief a few hundred miles away, despite suffering a similar defeat against Mahindra in Mumbai. In the end, one team had survived at the expense of the other, capping a classic three-way battle to stay put in the elite division of the NFL. Three-time champions Mohun Bagan had escaped the ignominy just the other day with a thumping win over Indian Bank in their final match. All of us are devastated today. Its a sad day in my life, Mohammedan Sporting striker Dipendu Biswas told The Telegraph from Margao on Friday evening. We all knew we needed more than a win today. We simply let down everybody  the club, fans and even ourselves, he said. Dipendu maintained his team was not quite up there to come back after conceding three goals in the match. We lost all interest in the match in the first half itself. Its almost impossible to score four goals against a team like Dempo, he added. With one chapter closed, Dipendu now shifts focus to another. Ive to begin afresh. Ive got offers from a couple of clubs, including one from Calcutta, he informed. Tollygunge coach Krishnendu Roy was a relieved man. As he put it, when contacted in Mumbai: Oof! What an end to the league! Krishnendu, though, felt apart from the foreigners and three others  Sandip Das, Gauranga Dutta and Samsi Reza  the rest were not fit to play in the NFL. I dont know whether Ill be retained as coach. But if asked, Ill request the club officials to look for a foreigner in defence, since (Ebi) Bar Bar is set to leave, he pointed out. The likes of Kenneth Onu and Moses Owira could also be tried, he added.  Copyright

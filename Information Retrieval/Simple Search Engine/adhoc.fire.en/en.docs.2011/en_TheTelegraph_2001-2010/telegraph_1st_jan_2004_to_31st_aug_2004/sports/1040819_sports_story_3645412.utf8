The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kenteris retires
Athens: Greeces two top athletes pulled out of the Athens Olympics on Wednesday and apologised to the Greek people for a scandal over missed dope tests that has tarnished the Games return to their birthplace. With a sense of responsibility and national interest I am retiring from the Olympic Games, Olympic 200m champion Costas Kenteris said as he emerged from an Athens hotel after an IOC hearing. He and training partner Katerina Thanou, 100m silver-medallist in Sydney, protested their innocence. Kenteris, 31, said he had broken with their controversial coach Christos Tzekos and blamed sports officials for the mess, saying he had not been notified of Thursdays dope test appointment. My country has waited 108 years for the Games to come home, Kenteris said, acknowledging the national scandal that has cast a shadow over the early days of the 16-day festival. I want to apologise to the Greek people that I will not be at the Games, that I will not manage to race, and that is why I handed my accreditation into the IOC today, Thanou said as she emerged. It is very hard for an athlete to withdraw from the Games especially when those Games are at home. Thanou said: Some Greeks have accused me in the last few days of having used forbidden substances, whereas there is no such issue. Meanwhile, the IAAF will consider the cases of Kenteris and Thanou at a council meeting on August 26, an IAAF spokesman said Wednesday. The IOC, which said the duo had faced expulsion had they not withdrawn from the Games themselves, handed the cases to IAAF. (Reuters)  Copyright

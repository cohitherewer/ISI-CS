		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 The Indian Football Association (IFA) has decided to organise all the National League matches at the Salt Lake Stadium from 3 pm Thursday onwards. The latest change in the kick-off timing will come into effect with the Mohun Bagan-Salgaocar SC match. 				 																																																	The move follows a few senior players reservation against the 2.30 pm kick-off time. Even East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said on Tuesday after the teams morning practice session that the IFA should step in to ensure the matches start a little later in the afternoon. 				 																																																	The IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, when contacted, sympathised with such feelings and said the decision was taken in view of reducing pressure on the players. 				 																																																	It is understandable that the 2.30 pm kick-off will do more harm than good to the players at this time of the season. Since enough sunlight is available till 6 oclock now, we have decided to push it back by half an hour, Dutta said. 				 																																																	Ive already spoken to Alberto Colaco (AlFF secretary) to this effect and also intimated everybody concerned, including the sponsors, he added.				 																																																	 Durgapur Govt College duo Dipankar Das and Arnab Saha emerged best individual athletes in the 15th inter-government college athletics championships. Both garnered 19 points. Saraswati Mahata of Jhargram Raj College was the best among women with 21 points.				 																																																	Chandannagore won the mens team title while Hooghly Mohsin were best among women with a tally of 55.5.				 																																																	 Belgachia United beat Sporting Union by the odd goal in three in BHA League first division group B game on Tuesday. Amal Das and Ranjit Das scored for Belgachia, Ashok Dhal reduced the margin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Becks caught between double and trouble
 On and off the field, its been a bad year for Beckham Madrid: With Real Madrid now destined to end the season without a trophy for the first time in five years, the question on everyones mind is, whats in store for David Beckham? The England captain had won 13 titles in his career with Manchester United and came to the Spanish capital last summer on a promise from Real Madrid president Florentino Perez that more would be on the way. Beckham has experience, class and works hard for the team. I hope hes happy here and he makes us happy in return. If everything goes well, well win everything, Real teammate Luis Figo had said after Beckhams arrival last July. As Beckham himself has no doubt reflected over recent weeks, it has not turned out that way as Real Zaragoza, Monaco, and Valencia  the latter taking the Spanish league on Sunday  have successively thwarted Reals trophy bids. Rumours about a return to England, with Chelsea always mentioned as a destination, started circulating late last year when it became obvious that wife Victoria wasnt going to settle permanently in Madrid. Recent newspaper allegations about Beckhams private life and a rift with his glamorous pop star spouse have also led to more suggestions that he was to bolt back to the Premiership. However, Real Madrid have gone to great lengths to insist Beckham will stay at the club for at least another year. One thing is for sure, 2003-04 has been a season of two halves for Beckham, and it has ended with neither him not Real being happy. Everything started off so promisingly. Beckham scored Reals first league goal of the season to give them a dream start and, for the first few months, sparkled in the centre of the field. But his form has dipped after a series of niggling injuries late last year.  (AFP)  Copyright

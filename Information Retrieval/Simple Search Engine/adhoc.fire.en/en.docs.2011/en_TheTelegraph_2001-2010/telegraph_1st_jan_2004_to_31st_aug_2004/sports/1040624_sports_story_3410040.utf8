 Willy Sagnol out with broken arm
Santo Tirso: France defender Willy Sagnol will take no further part in Euro 2004 after X-rays revealed he had broken his left arm in Mondays 3-1 victory over Switzerland. The 27-year-old re-fractured the same arm he broke while playing for Bayern Munich in March, a team official said on Tuesday. He started Mondays match but was substituted in the first minute of the second half after a challenge during the match in Coimbra. France cannot call up a replacement because Uefa rules only permit that in exceptional cases and Sagnols injury happened during the normal course of a match. Central defender William Gallas and midfielder Patrick Vieira suffered minor injuries in the Swiss match which clinched a quarter-final place for France.  (AFP)  Copyright

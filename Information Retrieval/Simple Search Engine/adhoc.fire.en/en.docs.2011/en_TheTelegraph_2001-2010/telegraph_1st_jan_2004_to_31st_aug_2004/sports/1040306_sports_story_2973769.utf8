The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kartik has to deliver: Prasanna
 - Former great rues lack of quality back-up spinners  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Erapalli Prasanna and Sambaran Banerjee during a press conference on Friday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: During his playing days, India were spoilt for choice. But currently its the lack of quality back-up spinners that may hurt India in the forthcoming one-day series against Pakistan, feels former great Erapalli Prasanna. The former India off-spinner was speaking at a function where it was announced that he will train the budding spinners at the Mainland Sambaran Cricket Academy. True, there arent too many quality back-up spinnersWell have to do with whatever we have, Prasanna said. He feels the time has come for Murali Kartik to put his hand up and start delivering. He has to raise his levelspinners will play a big role in the series. Evading the query whether Ramesh Powar is the right choice for the off spinners spot, Prasanna said: May be its his performance in the Irani Trophy which titled the balance in favour of Powar. In that game Powar took six for 165, but couldnt stop Rest of India from winning by three wickets. Prasanna hoped that BCCIs move to have Kapil Dev for the three-day conditioning camp in the city starting Sunday may help India. Kapils tips can change the line of thinking of the Indian pacers But the BCCI could have called a couple of more seniors for the camp. In fact, he will go to the camp to wish the players best of luck. If the juniors want tips, Im always ready. He also added that in spite of the hype created around the pacers, the spinners do have a big role to play in one-day cricket. (Muttiah) Muralidharan has shown to the world what a spinner can doI hope we take a cue from that. He also sounded hopeful about the future of Indian spin, in spite of the current crisis. I have been working with budding spinners and I can assure you theres talent. Meanwhile, Mainland China will also sponsor a soccer academy in the city. Former India medio Goutam Sarkar will be the chief coach. It will be named Oh Calcutta Football Academy.  Copyright

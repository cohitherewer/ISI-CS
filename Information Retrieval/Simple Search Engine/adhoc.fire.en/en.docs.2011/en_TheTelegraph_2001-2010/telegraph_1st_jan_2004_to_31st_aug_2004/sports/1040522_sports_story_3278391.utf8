 Kapil donates his share
 Kapil New Delhi: World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev on Friday donated his pension of Rs 5,000 from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to an orphanage and called for other well-off cricketers to gift the money to those who are in need. I request the cricketers who dont need this pension to give it to those in need, Kapil said at a ceremony organised by the Delhi and District Cricket Association to give away the first cheque of the new pension scheme to former Test cricketers and umpires. In Mumbai, while welcoming the BCCI gesture, former cricketers Ravi Shastri and Mohinder Amarnath on Friday questioned the rationale behind giving the same amount of pension to cricketers who have played just one Test and those who had played close to 100 or more. After receiving the first monthly cheque from former BCCI president Purshottam Rungta at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday, Amarnath called for making the scheme even better. BCCI should do a lot more for older cricketers. They can generate more money by asking current international players to wear extra logos on their apparel, Amarnath said. Its not fair that all the players get the same amount of pension, irrespective of whether they have played in one or 100 Tests, Amarnath said. Ravi Shastri said that the BCCI should introduce a lumpsum benefit amounting to between one and five lakhs for players who had quit the game before 1975.  (PTI)  Copyright

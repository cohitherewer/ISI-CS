 Greek lifter to be stripped of medal
Athens: Greece looks set to lose the first medal they won at the Athens Olympics after bronze-winning weightlifter Leonidas Sampanis failed a drugs test. In yet more doping agony for the Games host nation after the withdrawal of its top sprinters, Sampanis coach said on Friday that the Albanian-born lightweight had tested positive for excessive levels of the male hormone testosterone. I am stunned. I am going mad. We do not, and I stress this, do not give our athletes testosterone, Christos Iakovou told Greeces Alter TV. Sampanis won the bronze medal in the 62-kg category on Monday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag ready for Pakistan challenge
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ashish Nehra and Virender Sehwag discuss a point at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: Virender Sehwag has just returned from a successful and tough tour and has little time to rest and regroup for another round the corner. Ask him about the tour of Pakistan and youll get a reply as uncomplicated as his batting. Yes, playing and travelling so frequently takes a lot out of you, but a professional player cant complain about it. We all know that we are expected to perform amid this. Thats part and parcel of our job, the dashing opener said after Wednesdays national one-day meet tie at Eden Gardens. Sehwag, with Amit Bhandari and Ashish Nehra, showed commendable spirit and commitment for their state team as they reached the city late last night, leaving Delhi just hours after returning from Australia, via Kuala Lumpur and Hyderabad. The tight schedule doesnt matter as long as you feel this urge to play for your team and want to contribute to its success. The rigours of travelling become secondary once you start thinking that way, Sehwag said. I expect the challenge in Pakistan to be different from what we faced in Australia. Weather and pitch conditions will also be different. The only similarity is Pakistan too have a good set of fast bowlers. Added to that, their spin attack is not bad either. But I think I have reached a stage where I can confidently negotiate this challenge. The tour of Australia has been great for me. In fact, it has been the best tour I have had in my career so far, said Sehwag, who stunned the Aussies with a free-flowing 195 in the third Test in Melbourne. While that innings was most satisfying, I had other decent outings as well and struck the ball really well. I hope this tour of Australia will make me a far better cricketer. The lessons learnt there were invaluable.  Copyright

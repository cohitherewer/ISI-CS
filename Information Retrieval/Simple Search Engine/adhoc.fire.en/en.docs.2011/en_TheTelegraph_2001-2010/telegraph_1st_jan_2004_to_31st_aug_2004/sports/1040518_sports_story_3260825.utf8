 Smith helps WI seal series
 Dwayne Smith in action en route to his unbeaten 62 in St Vincent on Sunday. (AFP) Kingstown (St Vincent), May 17 (AFP): The West Indies erased bad memories of the previous day when they completed an efficient 23-run victory in the rain-shortened second one-day International over Bangladesh on Sunday. Chasing 125, Bangladesh managed 101 for eight after overnight and persistent morning showers had forced a late start and reduced the match to 25 overs-a-side. The West Indies thus took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the ODI series. The last game is scheduled at the Queens Park Stadium in St Georges on Wednesday. In the first match on Saturday, the West Indies had made heavy weather of a small target and scrambled to a one-wicket victory with 20 balls to spare.  I think our bowlers bowled pretty well for us and there is no one individual that I could pinpoint it was a total team effort, acting captain Ramnaresh Sarwan said after the home team wrapped up the series.  Smith, named Man-of-the-Match, curbed his natural instincts to collect his highest one-day International score as the West Indies were restricted to a modest 124 for seven in their 25 overs. Smith hit two fours and two sixes in a run-a-ball, undefeated 62. He was given a reprieve on 25 when Manjural Islam Rana dropped a head-high return catch. Tapash Baisya struck twice each in two overs at the death to finish with four for 16 off five overs  the best-ever ODI figures by a Bangladesh bowler. In the matches I played previously, I got a few starts without carrying on. But I had the opportunity to bat at three this time, grabbed it with both hands I am happy, Smith said.  After the visitors decided to field in overcast conditions, the West Indies batsmen struggled with their timing on a hard, but slow Arnos Vale pitch, and found it hard to score quickly against the medium-paced stuff of the Bangladeshi bowlers.

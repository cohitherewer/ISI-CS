 Sachin to miss Zimbabwe match
Brisbane: Sachin Tendulkar has been ruled out of Indias next game against Zimbabwe. The Little Master defied pain in the ankle to score 86 runs as India went on to beat Australia by 19 runs on Sunday. Indian team physiotherapist Andrew Leipus said Tendulkars injury was not major but indicated that he would have to sit out Tuesdays match. Leipus said he would have preferred Tendulkar to pull out of the middle as soon as he was injured but said it was always going to be the batsmans decision. He has more than likely aggravated his injury by batting so long. We wanted a runner for him but he didnt want one. It was his decision. We strapped him so that he does not do himself any further damage. From my point of view, obviously ice and rest would have been ideal. Sachin played a backfoot shot, he was on his toes and his ankle went over. I will have to look at him over the next couple of days to see how he pulls up. It is not as much the ankle as the muscle down the side of the ankle. It is not a major problem but it would probably keep him out for a few days. Virender Sehwag (shoulder sprain) and Ajit Agarkar (calf strain) will also miss the Zimbabwe tie. The duo did not play on Sunday. Leipus, however, allayed any major fears on the latest list of injured cricketers. Sehwag has an injection in his shoulder. He has a shoulder injury, a bit of rotator cuff strain. It should settle down over the next two days. Ajits break is more of a rotating really. There have been a few niggles here and there and they are not being allowed to settle down. So we have decided to give him a bit of break before he runs himself in the ground. Leipus said that the issue with Sehwag dated back to the second Test in Adelaide and it was being managed well till the ODI series started. (PTI)  Copyright

 Greece rally to hold Spain 1-1
 - Our only error in the second half cost us dear, says coach Saez Today's MatchesEngland vs Switzerland from

	 Croatia vs France from 12.10 am (Friday) on ESPNOporto: The silky skills of Spain were not enough to give them a second win in five days as they were held to a 1-1 draw by a determined Greece side here on Wednesday to leave group A at Euro 2004 wide open. Both teams won their opening games and were looking to take a step closer to the quarter finals, but it will be Spain who feel more aggrieved at being denied another three points having dominated the match and created numerous chances against their technically inferior opponents. Fernado Morientes, who was loaned out to Monaco from Real Madrid last season and helped the French club to the final of the Champions League which they lost to Porto, opened the scoring with a cool finish in the 28th minute only for Angelos Charisteas to prod home an equaliser in the second-half. Greece, 1-0 winners over Portugal in the first match of the tournament, came under the cosh in the opening exchanges with Valencias Ruben Baraja orchestrating almost every move from the centre of midfield and Joseba Exteberria and Rodriguez Vicente making excellent use of the wings. Spains industry should have opened the scoring in the 25th minute, Ivan Helgueras outstretched boot failing to make a decent connection with Vicentes whipped free-kick from the right wing. However, the pressure eventually told three minutes later as Spain captain Raul sliced his way into the penalty box before his deft backheel set up Morientes whose wicked right-footed shot gave Antonios Nikopolidis no chance. They may not have the same pedigree as Spain at international level, but the Greeks have fighting spirit in abundance and they went close to drawing level when Zisis Vryzas goalbound shot was blocked. Vryzas exposed some flaws in Spains defence once more before the Greeks survived a succession of corners just before the interval. The lively Exteberria was replaced by Real Betis rising star Joaquin, reported to be a summer target for several of Europes top clubs, for the start of the second-half. Greece captain Theo Zagorakis led by example after the interval, flashing a shot narrowly over the bar before testing Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas from distance. Roared on by the vast majority of the 25,000 crowd, home of Portuguese first division club Boavista, Spain should have increased their advantage when Raul headed Joaquins right-wing cross over the bar. Georgios Seitardis deflected shot almost crept in before Morientes made way for Juan Carlos Valeron, scorer of Spains winner against the Russians. Spain continued to spurn chances and they paid for their profligacy in the 66th minute when a swift Greek counter-attack ended with Charisteas sliding the ball in off Casillas leg. Joaquin tormented the Greek defence as Spain went all out to restore their lead and Valeron saw his half-volley blocked, but Greece dug in to snatch a hard-earned point, much to the delight of their travelling fans. Meanwhile, coach Inaki Saez said one mistake was all it took for Spain to throw away victory against Greece. We made our only error in the second half and it cost us dear. We attacked well but we just werent able to finish off some promising moves, Saez said after the draw.

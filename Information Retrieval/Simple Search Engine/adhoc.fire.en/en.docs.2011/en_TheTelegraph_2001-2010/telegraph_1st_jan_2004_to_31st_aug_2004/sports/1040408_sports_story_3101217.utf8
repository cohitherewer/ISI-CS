 Ludovic Giuly helps Monaco achieve mission surreal
 - French side shock Real Madrid 3-1 to set up semi-final clash with Chelsea  FROM SAM WALLACE IN MONTE CARLO  Monacos Fernando Morientes after his goal against Real Madrid on Tuesday David Beckham will not look back on this week as one of the high points of his famous career. Under siege in his private life, the England captain will have watched in horror on Tuesday night as his Real Madrid team, favourites to win the Champions League, were dumped out by Monaco thanks in part to the Spanish champions old boy, Fernando Morientes. Morientes was moved out to make room on the wage bill for Beckham this summer but it was his header, and two stunning goals from Ludovic Giuly, that sealed an incredible comeback by Monaco, who trailed 2-4 from the home leg and went a goal down last night. The French sides victory on away goals  they also hit the post and the bar in the closing minutes  means they face Chelsea in the semi-finals on April 20. There was a late chance for Raul, who had a goal disallowed, to win the game for Madrid but he steered his shot wide from Zinedine Zidanes pass. The fallout from this defeat is likely to be huge for Madrid coach Carlos Queiroz, who has presided over the clubs second successive failure to win the Champions League. He will surely be looking for a new job this summer. Beckhams deputy was Fernando Borja, a product of Madrids youth team who was making only his fourth Champions League appearance  and against the running from deep of Monacos excellent captain Giuly, it showed. With 18 minutes gone Giuly cracked two shots in succession at the Madrid goal. The first rebounded back from Ivan Helguera and the second scuttled wide. It should have been mission impossible for Monaco after 36 minutes, when they were hit from the left wing. Zidane found Ronaldo, whose cross was dummied by Guti before Raul tucked in the goal. It was a dauntingly simple goal for the home side to concede but with Giuly pressing on behind his two strikers, Didier Deschampss side had the shape to break down Madrid. In midfield, the Czech international Jaroslav Plasil was solid alongside Edouard Cisse, who looked nothing like the disinterested loan signing who moped around at West Ham last season. Their equaliser came in first-half injury time. From the left wing, Jerome Rothen looped over a difficult cross that was met with shattering precision by Giuly, who hit his shot low across the goal and inside Casillass far post. Monaco struck just three minutes into the second half. The header from Morientes was almost identical to his late goal at the Bernabeu two weeks ago. The ball from the left came from Patrice Evra, who had a fine game against Luis Figo, and Morientes rose above a defence that was simply not equipped to deal with an aerial threat. The tiny stadium at last shook with the conviction that they could pull off a famous victory, and the pressure on the visitors became intense. Monaco had to rely on their goalkeeper, Flavio Roma to twice stop Figo, who struck a free-kick and a cross in the aftermath of the second goal, but from then on they assumed control. Just after the hour Cisse, who grew better with every touch, sent a glancing header past Casillass post and Borja, already booked, was lucky not to be sent off for dragging back Giuly as he raced past. The third Monaco goal was a masterpiece. Cisse picked out full-back Hugo Ibarra and he cut the ball back for Evra to shoot. Giuly, loitering in the penalty area, applied the lightest of touches to redirect the ball past Casillas, and delirium broke loose in what has to count as one of the most reserved home crowds in Europe.

(AFP) Madrid: Valencia closed in on their second Spanish title in three seasons after they opened a four-point gap at the top of the standings thanks to a 2-0 win at home to Real Betis on Sunday. Goals either side of half-time from defender Curro Torres and midfielder Ruben Baraja gave Valencia a deserved win and put them firmly in the driving seat as the title race reaches its climax. With three games to go Rafa Benitezs side lead the table on 74 points, followed by champions Real Madrid, who slumped to their second successive defeat on Saturday when they lost 0-2 at Deportivo Coruna, on 70. Third-placed Barcelona are just a point behind Real on 69 after they stretched their unbeaten run to 17 games, coming from a goal down to claim a sparkling 4-1 win over struggling neighbours Espanyol. Striker Raul Tamudo put the visitors ahead from the penalty spot on 19 minutes, but Ronaldinho produced yet another virtuoso display to steer his side towards victory. The Brazilian equalised with a fine glancing header on 35 minutes and then provided an exquisite back-heel assist for Javier Saviola to put the Catalans ahead on the stroke of half-time. Dutch defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst extended the lead when he curled in a shot after a superbly worked passing move and Saviola completed the rout when he poked in at the far post after a Michael Reiziger pass before the hour was up.

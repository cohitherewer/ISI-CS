 Trescothick leads England charge
 - SECOND TEST - New Zealand pile up 409  Marcus Trescothick, who scored 132, plays one off Daniel Vettori at Headingley on Saturday. (Reuters) Leeds, June 5 (AFP): Marcus Trescothicks 132, his first Test hundred against New Zealand steered England to 248 for four at stumps on the third day of the second Test at Headingley here on Saturday. That left England 161 runs behind New Zealands first innings 409, the follow-on avoided when a second bad light stoppage ended play for the day. Graham Thorpe was on seven and Andrew Flintoff, on four. However, medium-pacer Scott Styris stemmed the England fight-back with two wickets for two runs in nine balls either side of a bad light break to dismiss both England captain Michael Vaughan and Trescothick. Earlier in the innings, Trescothick put on 153 in 38 overs for the first wicket with fellow left-handed opener Andrew Strauss. Strauss, who made a century on his debut in Englands seven-wicket first Test victory at Lords, fell tamely when he holed out against Vettori for 62. England started the final session on 164 for one with Trescothick 78 not out and Mark Butcher four not out. But Butcher went for his interval score, leg-before to Vettori. His departure brought in Vaughan, who left the field early on Friday to be with his pregnant wife but returned for the start of Saturdays play following the birth of his daughter, Tallulah. Although he helped Trescothick add 55 for the third wicket Vaughans share, on his home ground, was just 13. He fell to medium-pacer Styris. However, five balls later, with Thorpe newly arrived at the crease, the umpires offered the batsmen the light and they walked off. After seven overs were lost, play resumed with Trescothick driving Chris Cairns for four. Soon after, a Styris ball kept low and Trescothick, in light not markedly better than when England went off, played on to leave his side 240 for four, nine balls before the close. Trescothick reached fifty with a three off Cairns. The stroke also brought up the 100 partnership in 152 balls. New Zealand, who resumed on 351 for six, saw their last four wickets add a further 58 runs, England fast bowler Stephen Harmison taking four for 74.  Copyright

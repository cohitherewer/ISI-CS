 Bari slams Shepherd
Karachi: Pakistan officials and experts slammed English umpire David Shepherd on Sunday after Inzamams side lost to Australia in the tri-series final in Holland. Pakistans chief selector Wasim Bari called for the 63-year-old Shepherd to retire after he judged Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq caught behind and Yusuf Youhana caught bat-pad during their 17-run defeat. Shepherds decisions were like target killing and cost Pakistan the final. Its time for the inaccurate Shepherd to retire, Bari said. (AFP)  Copyright

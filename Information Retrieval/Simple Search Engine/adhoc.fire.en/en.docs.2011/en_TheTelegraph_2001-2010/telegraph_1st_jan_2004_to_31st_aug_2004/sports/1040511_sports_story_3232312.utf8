The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A chorus of disapproval
 - Muralidharan will remain unique, as the ICC is unlikely to allow anyone develop such a controversial action  BY DEREK PRINGLE  Despite the controversy, there has been an air of inevitability about Muralidharan For all its grand sense of achievement, Muttiah Muralidharans world record for Test wickets will be met with mixed feelings around the cricket world. With his big, expressive eyes, he could be a pantomime villain, but it is his bowling action  a bewildering combination of whirring wrist and bent arm  that splits the fors and againsts. At one end of the pitch down which Murali has sent more than 30,000 balls reside the romantics, who feel this spinning, grinning, maestro has been good for a game short on virtuoso talent. At the other lie the rigorous technicians who consider his controversial action a slight upon those bowlers constrained by straight arms and the even straighter Laws of Cricket, now slowly being tweaked to accommodate those with less than pure actions. There is no doubt that Test matches become compelling viewing when Murali is bowling, as batsmen have their mind and footwork scrambled by his fizzing turn. Yet his success has brought a flood of imitators at home, and on Englands tour of Sri Lanka before Christmas scores of children emulated him with cruder versions of his action. The record-breaker for this eldest son of a Kandy biscuit-maker came against Zimbabwe in Harare on Saturday when he took his 520th wicket to beat the mark set by Courtney Walsh just over four years ago in Jamaica. Walsh, who also passed the world record against Zimbabwe in 2000, sent him a congratulatory telegram. Many felt the big fast bowler to have an impure action, too, though like the man who succeeds him he was well liked. Muralis 520th victim, as Sri Lanka cruised to victory by an innings and 240 runs, was Mluleki Nkala, caught at forward short leg, and his next delivery induced Alester Maregwede to offer a return catch. Zimbabwe, having made only 199 in the first innings, collapsed to 18 for five and were all out for 102 in reply to Sri Lankas 541, which included centuries for openers Maravan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya. The debate about whether the Tamil Twisters action is legitimate goes on. Umpires have twice called Murali for chucking his off-break since his debut in 1992, but only in Australia. The Aussies zealousness over the purity of bowling is well known and yesterday former Test player Barry Jarman, the first ICC Match Referee to raise suspicions over Muralis action, continued the chorus of disapproval. It makes a joke of the game and it makes me sick talking about it, said Jarman, who played 19 Tests in the Sixties. Everyone knows he bowls illegally. I saw his photo in the paper the other day and got my old school protractor out  his elbow was bent at 48 degrees. The latest problem, after the ICC had cleared his off-break, has been the recent introduction of a doosra, a ball that spins like a leg-break and brought him great success against England in Sri Lanka before Christmas. In the subsequent series against Australia, it was the doosra that was reported by ICC Match Referee Chris Broad. Recent tests by the University of Western Australia showed Muralis elbow to straighten by 14 degrees when bowling the doosra, nine degrees more than ICC allow for slow bowlers, though they admit more research is needed. He is on parole at present, allowed to bowl in Tests, though one more report will mean an automatic ban until passed fit by ICCs panel of experts. Despite the controversy, there has been an air of inevitability about him breaking the record akin to watching two blips converging on a radar screen. His only serious competitor is Shane Warne, who beat him to 500 wickets but now trails him on 517. Warne, now 34, plays two Tests against Zimbabwe in a few weeks time, though with more predatory fast bowlers alongside him he will need to strike well if he is to catch the 32-year-old Murali, who has averaged seven wickets a Test since demolishing England at the Oval in 1998. As a spin bowler, Murali is and will remain unique, for the ICC is unlikely to allow others to fully develop such a controversial action as far.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

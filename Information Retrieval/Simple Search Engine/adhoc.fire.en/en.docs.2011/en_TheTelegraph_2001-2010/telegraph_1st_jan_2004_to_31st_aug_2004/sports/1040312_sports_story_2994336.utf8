The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA on top after Day II
 - First Test vs NZ - Gary Kirsten cracks 21st century  Gary Kirsten en route to his 137 on Day II of the first Test against New Zealand in Hamilton on Thursday. (AFP) Hamilton: Gary Kirsten hit a superb century and put the Proteas firmly in command against New Zealand at stumps on the second day of the first Test Thursday. Shortly before tea, South Africa were bowled out for 459 after resuming on an overnight score of 279 for four. Kirsten scored 137. In reply, New Zealand were 102 for two at close, with opener Michael Papps notching a debut half-century off 114 balls including 11 fours. Kirstens century, the 21st of his career, came after 277 minutes off 192 balls with 14 hits to the fence. He survived a scare just before reaching his century when Chris Cairns dropped a relatively simple chance. After reaching his century Kirsten raced on, hitting Daniel Vettori for two fours and a six in one over. Vettori took his man in the next over as Kirsten top-edged to Papps. Early in New Zealands innings, Papps, hit on the helmet by Pollock, was dropped as Smith fumbled several times at first slip. Pollock was however rewarded in the next over when he got Mark Richardsons wicket. The state of the rain-damaged pitch has been of major interest during the Test and on the final session of the day, as it appeared to be breaking up much to the concern of the New Zealanders who will have to bat last. The match also saw a lot of drama in the middle when umpire Russell Tiffin of Zimbabwe issued an official warning to Andre Nel as he appeared to be running on to the pitch in his follow-through. As South African skipper Graeme Smith raced in to protest, Tiffin was seen writing a name in his notebook. The incident seemed to have upset Nel who lost his line and saw a series of boundaries hit off him soon after. For a time, Kirsten feared he would be left stranded on 99 in his 99th Test. Number 11 Nel, however, had no such worries on the second day of the first Test against New Zealand on Wednesday. I told him to watch (spinner) Daniel Vettoris faster ball because he will try to get you leg before, but he just said dont worry about me, Ill just plant my feet well forward, Kirsten said. And thats exactly what he did. New Zealand coach John Bracewell said:Weve got to bat for as long as we can and try and get a lead and put them under pressure in the second innings. Tomorrow is the key to the match. (AFP)  Copyright

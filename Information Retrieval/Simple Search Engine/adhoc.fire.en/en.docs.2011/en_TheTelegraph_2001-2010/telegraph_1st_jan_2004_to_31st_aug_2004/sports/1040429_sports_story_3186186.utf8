Margao: The All India Football Federation has banned Haywards Sporting Club coach Clifford Chukwuma from sitting on the team bench and from performing any football-related activity for assaulting officials at a recent National League match in Mumbai. The notice, delivered to the secretary of Haywards Sporting Club, states that Clifford had abused match officials, threatened them and incited spectators, resulting in stone-pelting and assault on match officials in their match against Mahindra United at the Cooperage on Sunday, AIFF sources said here on Wednesday. The notice also says that some supporters of Haywards Sporting had man-handled the fourth official. The miscreants are being identified from the photographs which appeared in newspapers and other material to be submitted by the local organising committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians fare poorly
 Thongchai Jaidee, who had a hole-in-one in the final round, with the trophy he won in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. (AFP) Kuala Lumpur: The rain didnt really agree with the Indians in fray in the Malaysian Open, with the best finisher Sunday being Jyoti Randhawa at a tied 26th after a one under last round. Harmeet Kahlon finished tied 41st, Jeev Milkha Singh tied 51st and Amandeep Johl tied 55th. Thongchai Jaidee became the first Thai to win on the European Tour, hitting a hole-in-one to help him clinch a two-shot victory. The 34-year-old aced the 16th hole and then birdied the last in a final round 68 for a winning total of 14-under-par 274 for the meet, two strokes better than Australian Brad Kennedy. The victory was the second in-a-row on the Asian Tour for Thongchai, who won the Myanmar Open last week. Kennedy had the chance to force a playoff but sent his second shot at the last into trees from where he eventually recorded a bogey for a closing round 67 and a 12-under total of 276. It was a good day for Thailand with Thongchais compatriots Prayad Markseang and Chawalit Plaphol sharing third place with the best finishing European, Frenchman Thomas Levet, on 10-under. Miguel Angel Jimenez shot a fourth-round 71 to share sixth place with Briton Andrew Marshall on eight-under, enough to send the Spaniard to the top of the European Tours Order of Merit. The high point was Jaidees six iron shot at the par-three 16th, which took a couple of bounces on the green and disappeared into the cup, lifting Thongchai to 13-under and three strokes clear of his nearest rival.

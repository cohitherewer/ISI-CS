		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Auckland: A man convicted of killing his infant daughter was named on Monday as New Zealands only boxing competitor at the Olympic Games in Athens, state owned Television New Zealand (TVNZ) reported. Earlier on Monday the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) named Soulan Pownceby to represent the country in the middleweight division. Pownceby secured his spot by winning the gold medal at the Oceania championships in Tonga earlier this year. 				 																																	But TVNZ revealed that in 1995 Pownceby, then known as Soulan Rikihana, was convicted of manslaughter for the death of his five-month-old daughter Jeanette. He had originally been charged with murder but was found guilty by a jury on the lesser charge after it heard evidence that the infant suffered injuries to her head, ribs and abdomen that Pownceby told police were caused when he dropped her. TVNZ said Pownceby has since had seven other court convictions, the most recent being for assaulting a woman four years ago. 				 																																	New Delhi: It was a new match but there was no change in either the script or fate of the hapless United States, who were thrashed 7-0 by the Indian hockey team in the second and final friendly at Moorpark College in California. The match, played on Sunday, looked like a rerun of Saturdays first game when India won by the same margin.				 																																	Baljit Singh Dhillon followed his two strikes in the first match with two more on Sunday as India pumped in five field goals and converted two penalty corners. Forward Gagan Ajit Singh also scored a brace, while Deepak Thakur, Arjun Halappa and Sandeep Singh scored one each.				 																																	The win capped Indias training in the US where the 26 probables underwent training at the Athletes Performance Centre in Arizona. The probables will leave for Amsterdam on Tuesday and play a practice match against Holland on June 25 before the start of a four-nation meet on June 27. 				 																																	Hamburg: Germany defeated Pakistan 3-2 with an injury time penalty to win the Hamburg Masters mens hockey tournament on Sunday. Argentina finished third after a 5-5 draw with South Korea.				 																																	It was Germanys third win over Pakistan in a week, having won 3-1 and 2-1 in Test matches in Berlin last Sunday and Monday. They overcame a 1-2 deficit in the second half with two goals, including a stoppage-time penalty corner conversion by skipper Florian Kunz. 				 																																	Paris: A Paris court on Monday threw out a request by Lance Armstrong for an emergency ruling ordering the publishers of a book detailing suggestions of doping to insert a denial by the five-time Tour de France champion and fined him. Judge Catherine Bezio rejected the request after hearings on Friday with lawyers for Armstrong and for the publishers of LA Confidentiel, les secrets de Lance Armstrong.				 																																	He was ordered to pay legal costs, a 1,500-euro ($1,800) fine and one symbolic euro in damages for faulty procedure. The verdict noted that the extracts involving the accusations do not necessarily constitute defamation.				 																																	Sydney: The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has banned former world junior track cycling champion Mark French from the Olympics for life after a series of doping offences. 				 																																	French, 19, who was recently suspended for two years for doping, told CAS investigators he was introduced to the drugs by senior Australian Institute of Sport riders. AOC lawyer Simon Rofe said on Monday that AOC secretary-general Bob Elphinston had written to Mark French advising him that he was ineligible for life to represent Australia at the Olympics.				 																																	Tokyo: Real Madrid will play J-League clubs JEF United Ichihara and Tokyo Verdy on a pre-season tour of Japan, the Japanese clubs announced on Monday. The Spanish giants face Ichihara on July 29 at National Stadium and Tokyo Verdy across town at Tokyo Stadium on August 1.Sport on Screen Soccer, Euro 2004, Round I: Italy vs Bulgaria, live from 12.10 am (Wednesday) on ESPN; Denmark vs Sweden, live from 12.10 am (Wednesday) on STAR Sports n Tennis, Wimbledon Championships: Live from 4.30 pm on STAR Sports

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leicester, EB sign historic deal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: English Premier League club Leicester City on Wednesday formally agreed to three-year deals with Calcuttas premier soccer club East Bengal and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on coaching, junior training programmes and possible match exchanges in the second and third years. Though the final signatures are yet to be put on the dotted lines, the overall emphasis seems to be on the coaching benefits that the Indian partners in the deals will derive. As a starter, said Paul Mace, director and chief operating officer of Leicester City at a press briefing, that John Rudkin, academy director of the club and head coach, will be in the country in a couple of months. Rudkin will assist in the coaching of the Indian under-17 team that has qualified for the final round in Japan, of the AFC tournament. The basis on which Leicester City have moved this effort, though, does have long-term financial implications for the English club, though Mace said that as of this deal no money has been talked. Leicester is a city with more than a third in Indian or Indian-origin population. The financial breakdown also somewhat tilts this way and the club quite logically eyes that source of revenue. While the AIFFs gain will be in the assistance at the junior level, East Bengal could see some marketing benefits as well, in guidance to souvenir sales and off-pitch revenue, as Mace put it. That Leicester has a big ethnic population could also see a spurt in sales, and vice-versa. It is the first time that an English Premier League club has had any tie-ups with any Indian club or organisation, but it probably would be too premature to see too much into the deals. Mace said the club would dip into a special fund to sponsor initial expenditure, but no deal will stand sans any two-way flow of interest. Leicester City has the 11th largest supporter base in England and its stadium has a capacity of 32,000, said Mace. Add to this the fact that the Premier League is the best marketed league in the world, and its a winning combination. There was an interesting side-story to the show. Asked whether he was able to talk any other Premier League club to deal with this part of the world, Nigel Empson, CEO of FMM International, the company that brokered these deals, said he found few other teams wanting to deal with India. That was a comment that came after Maces observation that a British government-backed report looking into racism in the Premier League and Football League has given very good points to Leicester City. The club has been termed a role model and their Foxes Against Racism campaign seeks to attract Asian fans to the Walkers Stadium while an anti-racism partnership with Leicester Tigers and Leicestershire County Cricket Club is lauded by the report, with the exhortation that other clubs follow suit with their sporting neighbours. Clearly, Empsons comment shows that the whites only attitude in English soccer will take time to change.  Copyright

 Fan drops case against Shoaib
Lahore: A Pakistani cricket fan has dropped a court case against fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar so that the speedstar can concentrate on matches against India, a lawyer said on Friday. My client Syed Najmul Abbas dropped the case in the interest of the country so that Shoaib can give his best against India, the petitioners lawyer said. Abbas had filed a petition in Lahores civil court last year, seeking a public apology from Shoaib. Shoaib had told the paper:  In Pakistan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis are in decline. They were great but they are not match-winning bowlers any more. So I have to make it all happen on my own. The petitioner had said that Shoaibs remarks tarnished the image of the country and filed a suit against him.  (AFP)  Copyright

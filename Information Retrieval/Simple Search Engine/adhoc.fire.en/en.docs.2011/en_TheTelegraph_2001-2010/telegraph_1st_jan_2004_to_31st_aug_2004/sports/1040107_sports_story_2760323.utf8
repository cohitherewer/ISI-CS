The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Facing Japan a challenge: Bhutia
 - Well miss a striker of Vijayans quality, says India captain  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia launches an East Bengal jersey bearing his name on Tuesday. It will be sold among spectators at the club tent. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury Calcutta: India have been drawn in a difficult group in the Pre-World Cup football tournament. Apart from just one soft team in Singapore, Bhaichung Bhutia and his boys will have to face the mighty Japan and Oman in Group 3. Bhutia, the captain, rated this group to be tougher than the one they had in 2001, comprising the UAE, Yemen and Brunei. India had fared creditably under coach Sukhwinder Singh that time, beating UAE and Yemen once each. While stressing that it would be more difficult this time, Bhutia said he is looking forward to the challenge of facing some of the strongest Asian teams. Japan reached the second round of the 2002 World Cup while Oman is among the top-ranking Asian teams. Its always good to play against a quality side and a tough opponent. Its a challenge and we will love to play against Japan. From a personal point of view, you can always tell your grandchildren that you had played against some of the finest Asian players, Bhutia said on Tuesday. The Indian skipper was speaking at the East Bengal tent, where club sponsors Kingfisher, in association with Reebok, launched a jersey named after Bhaichung Bhutia which will be up for sale. This is the first such project in Indian football and Bhutia becomes the first Indian footballer to be roped in by the sports apparel giants. Bhutia ruled out doing a Sourav Ganguly-on-Jawagal Srinath as far as I.M. Vijayan is concerned. The veteran and gifted striker retired from international football after the Afro-Asian Games last year. Bhutia said he wouldnt try to persuade Vijayan to stage a comeback. Needless to say that we will miss him and replacing a player of Vijayans quality will be difficult. He was equally good in the air and on the ground and could also hold the ball. But we have some talent in the midfield, said Bhutia. He picked Jatin Singh Bisht and Tomba Singh as good finds, adding that India can look forward to them. On defending champion East Bengals unimpressive start in the National League, Bhutia felt things are slowly falling in place. Its not that we are playing badly. Its just that we are not getting the goals. Dempo got just three chances against us and converted them. Though we lost 2-3, we didnt play like a losing team.  Copyright

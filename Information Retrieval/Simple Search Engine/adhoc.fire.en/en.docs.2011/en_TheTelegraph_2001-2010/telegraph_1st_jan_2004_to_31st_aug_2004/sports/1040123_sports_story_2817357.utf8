The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Okoro puts dark days behind 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ashim Biswas in action on Thursday Calcutta: Mike Okoro has gone through a lot over the past one year. From spearheading the East Bengal attack to glory in Jakarta, he came close to being suspended for his whimsical ways. With injuries to the likes of Suley Musah and Douglas da Silva, the East Bengal authorities were forced to persist with the Nigerian ball-player, and its clear as broad daylight that they were not wrong. Okoro himself believes the dark days are behind him and he is close to his best. Its New Year, a completely new beginningI want to look ahead, the Nigerian said. Okoro was the standout man for East Bengal on Thursday in an unaccustomed position in the midfield. He was the main man behind most of the attacks and clinched the game for East Bengal in the 65th minute header. Things did go a little wrong late last year. But Im happy to be back in full flight, a visibly relaxed Okoro said. But what was going wrong? The concentration wasnt there, Im trying to get my focus back. But what he didnt mention was the enormous turmoil he had gone through in his personal life. After losing his baby, he broke off with his long-time fiance. He came back to India a completely disoriented man, and the East Bengal authorities even contemplated on providing psychiatric treatment to him. I want to dedicate this performance to all those who have stood by me during the rough times. Is this the best performance of his life? Dont know, but definitely one of the most important ones of my career, he added. In fact, things started falling in place from the last game against Mohammedan SportingIm happy to keep the good work going. When asked whether it was a little difficult playing in the midfield, Okoro said: A good player has to adjust himself in every position. The coach wants me in the midfield and its my duty to keep delivering. But he agreed to the fact that Jose Ramirez Barretos absence was a factor. When a player of his stature is not around, you feel more confident. Mohun Bagan forward Ashim Biswas also harped on that point. Had Barreto been there, I could have played a little more freely. Its always tough to play with three markers breathing down your throat, Biswas, Bagans lone scorer, said.  German flavour Three members of the Bayern Munich fan club  Michael Barth, Marcos Ross and George Berz were present at the Salt Lake Stadium to get a flavour of Indian football. Were travelling all around the world to watch football and are sponsored by our organisation  Red Munich, Ross said. The group, however, didnt sound too satisfied with the quality of football that was on offer.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Casey, Levet steal Day I honours
 - BRITISH OPEN - Woods, Els slip on second-nine  Ernie Els at Royal Troon on Thursday. (Reuters) Troon: Britains Paul Casey and in-form Frenchman Thomas Levet took full advantage of near-perfect conditions at Royal Troon to set the pace in the British Open first round on Thursday. Casey and Levet upstaged the likes of tournament favourite Ernie Els, world No. 1 Tiger Woods and US Masters champion Phil Mickelson, firing five-under-par 66s on a relatively calm day of bright sunshine. While 2002 winner Els (69), Woods (70), Mickelson (73) and most of the other challengers slipped backwards on Troons treacherous second-nine, Casey and Levet finished strongly. Englishman Casey, 26, reeled off seven birdies and two bogeys to set the early pace before being caught by the 35-year-old Levet, who qualified for the Open championship by winning last weeks Scottish Open at Loch Lomond. A stroke back on 67 was New Zealands Michael Campbell, who led the 1995 British Open at St Andrews after three rounds before tying for third. I havent been playing great golf the last couple of weeks, so its nice to come out with a strong opening round, said Casey, who shared sixth place at this years Masters. I did a lot of work on my game this week and it seems to be paying off. Ive been very relaxed. If Im in that sort of frame of mind, as I was at the Masters, then anything is possible. Levet, who was edged out by Els in a sudden-death playoff for the 2002 Open at Muirfield, was delighted his patient approach had earned him a share of the lead. Seeing your name on the top of the leaderboard is a pleasure, but there is a long way to go, he said. There is still one big step tomorrow, two big steps Saturday and an enormous marathon to come on Sunday. Els had charged into an early lead before stumbling with a late double-bogey, the South African needing two shots to escape from a bunker on the 17th green which wiped out the advantage he had gained from a hole-in-one at the eighth. The world No. 2, looking to lift the Claret Jug for the second time, had moved to four under with three holes to play after mixing two birdies with his ace. He picked up his first shot at the par-five fourth before achieving his ace with a wedge at the famed Postage Stamp, the shortest hole on the British Open rota at 123 yards. The 34-year-old then rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-four 11th before bunkering his tee shot at the par-three 17th on the way to a double-bogey five. Tied for fourth in the clubhouse on 68 was a group of eight, including twice major winner Vijay Singh of Fiji, Britons Gary Evans and Kenneth Ferrie, South Koreas K.J. Choi and British amateur champion Stuart Wilson. Indians Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal are well down the list after carding a 73 and 74, respectively. Woods, with his status as the worlds finest player under threat for the first time in almost five years, picked up three shots on the front nine. He then battled back from bogeys on 12 and 13 with a birdie at the par-five 16th. I played really well today and hit a lot of good shots, but there were some tough pins out there, Woods said. We had very little wind, although granted it was changing directions. Thats probably as easy as youll ever see it, added Woods. (REUTERS)  Copyright

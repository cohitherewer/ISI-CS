The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deportivo blow to Real hopes
 - EURO ROUND-UP 
- AC Milan win 17th Italian League title  Real Madrids Ronaldo in a duel with Pablo Amo of Deportivo La Coruna during their Primera Liga match in La Coruna on Saturday. (AFP) Madrid: A second-string Deportivo La Coruna side dealt a severe blow to Real Madrids title chances when they beat the champions 2-0 at the Riazor on Saturday. A precise shot from striker Diego Tristan and a scorching free-kick from defender Joan Capdevila secured Deportivo a morale-boosting win ahead of their Champions League semi-final against Porto on Tuesday. Reals misery was compounded by the sending off of influential midfielder Zinedine Zidane just before the break after he picked up a second booking for a pointless foul on Brazilian midfielder Djalminha. The result means that with three games to play Real remain in second place in the Primera Liga, a point behind leaders Valencia, who have a game in hand and host Real Betis on Sunday. Valencia top the table on 71 points, Real have 70, third-placed Barcelona have 66 and Deportivo 65. Knowing that a win would give them the overnight leadership and put pressure on Valencia, Real made an aggressive start against Deportivo, who were fielding a shadow side ahead of the Porto game. Luis Figo, given the all-clear to play despite being sent off in last weeks 1-2 loss to Barcelona, swept in a dangerous cross from the right and fellow midfielder Esteban Cambiasso hit the post with an improvised volley after seven minutes. The Portuguese international then set up Michel Salgado for a chance as he cut inside from the wing, but the Real right back fired the ball narrowly over the bar from the edge of the area. Real began to flag, however, as the half wore on and Deportivo took full advantage by scoring in practically their first attack on 29 minutes. Real keeper Iker Casillas blocked a low shot from Sergio after Djalminha had launched a rapid break and Diego Tristan was on hand to snap in the rebound. Real were flustered by the setback and Zidane, Michel Salgado and David Beckham all picked up unnecessary bookings. Ronaldo ame close to settling his sides nerves when he beat the Deportivo defence for pace and cracked a fine shot onto the base of the post. Zidane was dismissed for his rash challenge on Djalminha in the middle of the park four minutes from the break. Reals run of bad luck continued two minutes later when skipper Raul hit the bar with a fine dipping shot from the edge of the box. Coach Carlos Queiroz substituted Beckham on the hour and brought on Argentine midfielder Santiago Solari in his place to the England captains obvious anger, but the decision failed to produce the desired result. Although Real continued their assault on the Deportivo area, it was the home side who gave a devastating lesson in finishing after they won a free-kick some 30 metres out in the 68th minute. Capdevila stepped up and fired his wickedly swerving free kick wide of the diving Casillas and inside the post to deal Real a second successive defeat. Earlier, Atletico Madrid moved up into sixth position and renewed their bid for a place in next seasons Uefa Cup with a breathless 3-2 victory at home to relegation-threatened Celta Vigo. Celta remain in deep trouble in 19th place, a point behind Espanyol and Valladolid who had yet to play this weekend. Roma nine points behind AC Milan won the Italian league title on Sunday after beating Roma 1-0 at the San Siro. Roma were left nine points behind with two games to play. Andriy Shevchenko scored the winner in the second minute  a firm header from Kakas cross  for his 22nd goal of the season. Victory for Milan, their 24th of the campaign, sealed their 17th championship success and their first since 1999. A tense match was marred by trouble on the terraces with Milan goalkeeper Dida twice hit by missiles thrown by Roma fans. Milan got off to the perfect start, taking the lead with less than two minutes on the clock. Kaka skipped past Olivier Dacourt down the right wing and crossed for Shevchenko, whose angled header skimmed off the head of Zebina on its way to the top corner. Roma thought they should have been awarded a penalty four minutes into the second-half. Shevchenko appeared to use his elbow to block Tottis 18-yard free-kick but the referee waved play on, sparking a mass protest from the Roma players. (Reuters)  Copyright

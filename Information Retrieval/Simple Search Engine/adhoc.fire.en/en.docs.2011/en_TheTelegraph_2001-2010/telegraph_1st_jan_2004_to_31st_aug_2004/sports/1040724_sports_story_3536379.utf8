 F1 chief says Schumacher is the ultimate one
 Schumi the best thing to happen to F1 Hockenheim: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has hailed the supremacy of superstar Michael Schumacher ahead of a potentially record-breaking German Grand Prix for the world champion. German Schumacher has dominated the sport in recent years, winning six world titles including the last four, and claiming an astonishing 45 wins from a possible 78 since the start of 2000. His total domination has turned many fans away from the sport, but Ecclestone suggested he should be admired in the same way as golfs Tiger Woods or cyclings Lance Armstrong are praised for their achievements. Michael is a superstar and that is exactly what we wanted. Every sport needs a superstar and he is ours, said Formula One commercial rights holder Ecclestone. Everybody tries to beat him and that is great publicity for Formula One. He is lucky to drive for a team that supports him the way Ferrari does but it was Michael who motivated them after their initial problems. Schumacher joined Ferrari in 1996 and turned them from also-rans to unbeatable world champions within just four seasons and could help them secure their sixth consecutive world title Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachin was like a man possessed
 - Indian bowlers didnt have the pace or bounce to force Afridi on the backfoot  BY RASHID LATIF  Shahid Afridi should always be played against India Here I was sitting in the stands and watching Sachin Tendulkar unfold his genius. Time and again I wondered whether I have seen a better batsman in my life? I couldnt think of anyone. Not even Viv Richards can be compared to him. Tendulkar is crickets Kohinoor. Nobody comes even remotely close. Tendulkar looked a man possessed in the second one-dayer. I have never seen him field with as much aggression as he did on Tuesday. Normally not the one to show his emotions on the field, he was reacting wildly to mis-fields and throws off his bowling. I think the clips of those moments should be preserved for posterity. His eyes were glowing and he was even shouting mouthfuls. It was as if he wanted this game to be the best of his life. Sourav Ganguly must have sensed this rare mood of his top man for he gave him those extra overs. Tendulkars genius was apparent in the way he made adjustments in his batting and therein lies the difference between Tendulkar and, say, Virender Sehwag. While Sehwag does not make any attempt to understand a bowlers strategy and bats in the same gear, Tendulkar sizes up the situation instantly. He was constantly coming inside the line and working the ball on the on-side. Most of his fours came in the mid-wicket, square leg or past fine leg with those delicate flicks off his heavy bat. We are very fortunate to have been born in the same era as Tendulkar and watched him in action. Good as Tendulkar was, I am concerned with Pakistans near-inability to defend a total as big as 330. They played this game with six bowlers and even then almost came unstuck. Moreover, Indians were chasing under lights which is not the best of time for a batting side. Had any of the regular batsmen, like Yuvraj Singh or Rahul Dravid, stayed till the end, the Indians would have been 2-0 up by now. I feel Shoaib Akhtar is having fitness worries. He is not bowling as well as he can. He is not being able to use the new ball the way only he can. The wicket, however, suited Mohammad Samis skiddy style of bowling to the hilt. Shahid Afridi was Pakistans obvious hero. He should always be played against India. The feeling in Pakistan camp is that Indian bowling comes under pressure against Afridi. I spoke to him before the game and he said he was pumped up. He showed us exactly that in the match. The Indian bowlers didnt have the pace or bounce to force him on the backfoot. The only way you can succeed against Afridi is if you can push him on the backfoot. That is why he should always be played on the sub-continents slow wickets. He is not picked to play abroad because he could look awkward against bouncing deliveries. I also liked the way he was willing to go for his pull or hook shots against the Indians. Its a new facet of his batting and its apparent he has worked on his batting in the days spent in wilderness. He also picked up the wickets of Sourav and Yuvraj, which is not easy for a leg-spinner against left-handers. Pakistan did well to cut down on wides and no-balls in this game. It made a crucial difference. There were 22 leg-byes, but thats a different matter. I felt though they goofed up by sending Moin Khan up the order. They should have sent Shoaib Malik instead, for he is a little under-utilised in batting. Abdul Razzaqs position is perfect. He is one of worlds most dangerous batsmen in the final overs. As things are shaping up, the team which makes fewer mistakes will be the winner in this one-day series. However, with a superior bowling strength and having managed 300-plus runs in both the matches, Pakistan, for me, is now the favourite.  (PTI)  Copyright

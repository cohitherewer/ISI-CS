The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravid promises intensity 
 - Anil Kumble desperate to return for Tests New Delhi: India will carry the same intensity with which they played in the recent Test matches against Australia into the Pakistan series, vice-captain Rahul Dravid said Wednesday. The fact that we played some good, intense cricket in Australia will work to our advantage. We want to carry forward the intensity on to the Pakistan series, Dravid said after the unveiling of the trophy for the India-Pakistan one-day series. The stylish right-handed batsman said although he did not have any specific preference regarding the one-dayers being held before or after the Tests, he was pleased nevertheless that India would be playing the ODIs first in Pakistan. This will allow our injured bowlers to regain fitness, said Dravid, accompanied by his teammates  Anil Kumble, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan. The Indian vice-captain said, we are all very excited as most of us would be touring Pakistan for the first time. I think the series is not only awaited eagerly by the fans but by us as well. India will leave for Pakistan on March 10 to play five ODIs followed by three Tests. Dravid refuted the claim that the current series would be a contest between our batsmen versus their bowlers. It is wrong to project the series in this way. It would be a contest between two teams and two units. It is all about team game. On whether he prefers to double up as a wicketkeeper, Dravid said, I have been doing that (keeping) for two years now. I will continue to do what is in the best interest of the team. One has to take into account that the balance of the team is not disturbed. But at the same time, we have to think about the long term and start grooming a young wicketkeeper. Brushing aside suggestions that the team might find it difficult to adjust to the slow wickets in Pakistan after playing on bouncy Aussie tracks, he said, I dont think all wickets in Pakistan are slow. The last series between South Africa and Pakistan was played on bouncy wickets. Anyway, we have to go there and see first the kind of wickets that have been prepared. We have played around the world and adapting to the wickets should not be a problem. Dravid refused to be drawn into the debate whether India need a regular bowling coach who could accompany them to tours abroad. It is something for the captain and the coach to discuss with the board. I dont think I can comment on it, he said. After missing the ODI bus, a desperate Anil Kumble is leaving no stone unturned to become fully fit for the Test series against Pakistan. Kumble, nursing a shoulder injury, had to be left out of the 15-member Indian squad for the five-match ODI series after he failed to prove his fitness. I am not fully fit now but should be fit for the Test matches which I want to play very much, Kumble said. There are still three weeks to go (for the Test team to be named) and I am sure I will be fit by then, he said. I am bowling a little bit in the nets and also undergoing strengthening exercises. Left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan, included in the ODI squad but fighting to be match-fit, said, I have been working hard towards my fitness for the last 8-10 days. I am confident that I will achieve 100 per cent fitness by the time the first match begins.  (PTI)  Copyright

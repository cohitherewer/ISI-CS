The Telegraph - Calcutta
India will take field with Sundays self-belief 
- Pak fate hinges on how Shoaib amp; Co. check extras - Kartik seems to have worked out a strategy to frustrate Hameed 
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasWith two wins apiece, the fifth match in this best-of-five series has become the dream decider that everyone was looking forward to. When the match gets underway in Lahore today, few things will be moving on the streets which will wear deserted looks as millions will remain glued to their television sets on both sides of the border. Such has been the intensity that has marked this series and when it comes to the deciding match, it is bound to be that much more.If the manner of their victory in the fourth game is anything to go by, the Indians will certainly take the field as favourites. However, they will do well to remember that Pakistan had entered the fourth game with that very status but were humbled by the Indians. So, all this talk about favourites will have little effect on the game once it gets underway. But one thing is for sure: of the two teams, India will take a bit more momentum into the deciding game than Pakistan. The Indians will take much heart from the fact that Kaif finally got going and won the game for his side along with Dravid. They will also take heart from Kartiks performance who seemed to have worked out the right strategy to frustrate Yasir Hameed, who has been in fine form throughout the series, but struggles to manoeuvre the ball on the leg side. But what will give India more heart than anything else is the fact that the team was able to come from behind and level the series. This will give them the kind of self-belief and the feel-good factor that are so nice to have going into any crunch game.The Pakistani camp, I am sure, will be on a comparative low. Both their batting and bowling failed in the first fifteen overs of the two innings, and that was one of the key differences between the two sides.  Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on TuesdayThe frustration in the camp found an unexpected expression in the rather uncharacteristically animated gestures of Inzamam, whose normal expression in the field is that of some disinterested bystander. Such wild gestures often put extra pressure on colleagues, while adding to the confidence of the rivals. I can only assume what the atmosphere would have been like in the post-match Pakistani dressing room!What might dampen Pakistani spirits a bit further is the strange bout of fatigue that hit Shoaib Akhtar after his fiery first spell. The way he fell flat on his back in the middle of an over and his subsequent lack of pace, again, was something that would have sent conflicting signals to the two camps.However, it is quite clear that the things that went wrong for Pakistan in the fourth game were the ones that the team itself can bring back under control. Like, for instance, cutting down on the staggering number of no-balls and wides. Pakistanis are generous people and good hosts  as has been found out by a lot of Indians on this tour  but I would prefer this generosity to be restricted to off-the-field interaction. There is no point bowling three to four extra overs every time the Indians are batting. If they can control this  and I hope they will  we certainly have a game on our hands.I wrote in my previous column that the series has become more a test of nerves than skills, and would be clinched by the team that can keep its cool under pressure. The fourth game did nothing to force a revision.The verdict stands. Copyright

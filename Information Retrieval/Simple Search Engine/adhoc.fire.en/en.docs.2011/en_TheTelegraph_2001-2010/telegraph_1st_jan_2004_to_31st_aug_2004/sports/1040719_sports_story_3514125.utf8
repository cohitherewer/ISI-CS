 Hamilton wins; Jyoti ties at 27
	 - Ernie Els goes down in four-hole play-off at British Open  Jyoti Randhawa watches his tee shot from the sixth hole on Day IV of the 133rd British Open in Troon on Sunday Troon: American outsider Todd Hamilton held off the challenge of some of the games biggest names before beating Ernie Els in a four-hole play-off for the 133rd British Open title Sunday. This was even as Indias Jyoti Randhawa earned the best distinction of any Indian golfer ever, finishing a high of tied 27th spot. No Indian golfer has reached a higher spot in any Major. In the same bracket (270) as Jyoti finished Takashi Kamiyang and Rod Pampling. Following up on his 73, 72 and 70 of the first three rounds, Jyoti actually slipped a bit in the final round Sunday, shooting a 72. That was mainly because of his fourth round inward nine (two bogeys for one over), which cancelled his fine two-birdie (sixth and seventh holes) out nine of one under 35. In the meet Randhawa hit 11 birdies against 10 bogeys and two double bogeys. Finishing below Randhawa were players like Nick Price and Mark OMeara, both tied at 30. Hamilton and Els had finished level at 10-under 274, Hamilton bogeying the last for a 69 and Els making three birdies in the final six holes for a 68 at a blustery Royal Troon. Both parred the first two extra holes before Hamilton went ahead at the 17th, Els missing the green to the left on his way to a bogey-four. The pair then produced matching pars on 18 for Hamilton, world-ranked 56, to clinch the title. The American, who considered quitting the game until he won his PGA Tour card last December, appeared to have the title in his grasp when leading by a shot with one hole remaining in regulation play. However, the 38-year-old from Illinois pushed his tee shot on 18 into the right rough and then hit his second well left, just short of the public grandstand, before running up a bogey-five. Els, who seemed to throw away his own victory hopes when he double-bogeyed the par-four 10th, had bounced back with birdies on 13, 16 and 17. The big-hitting South African then had a chance to seal victory at the last, but he narrowly missed his birdie attempt from eight feet. US Masters champion Phil Mickelson had held the outright lead by one with seven regulation holes to play after Hamilton bogeyed the 10th. However, the American left-hander lost momentum after dropping on 13 and, despite a birdie at the par-five 16th, had to settle for third place at nine under with a closing 68. Britains Lee Westwood birdied two of the last three holes, including a 40-foot putt at the last, for a 67 and fourth place at six under. A further stroke back in a tie for fifth was 1997 US PGA champion Davis Love III, who holed his approach at the last for an eagle-two and a matching 67. Level with Love was Frenchman Thomas Levet, after a 72.Tiger Woods, without a major title since the 2002 US Open, shared ninth place at three under with Canadas Mike Weir, after dropping three shots on the back nine. I had a chance this week and felt like I really could have won this tournament, the world number one told reporters. But I just made too many mistakes. I will have to take a look at where I went wrong, and rectify that before the next tournament.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

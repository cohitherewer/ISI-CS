 Humpy loses in tie-breaker
Elista (Kalmykia): GM and top seed Koneru Humpy crashed out of the womens world chess championship on Tuesday. The Indian lost to Russian WGM Grandmaster Ekaterina Kovalevskaya in the semi-final tie-breaker after the players shared the first two games in regulation period. In the tie-breaker Kovalevskaya won the first rapid game and drew the second to ensure a berth in the final, where she meets Bulgarian GM Antoaneta Stefanova. The Bulgarian beat former world champion Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia. Humpy, who suffered a shock defeat in the first game, bounced back superbly to beat Kovalevskaya of Russia in the second game to push the match into tie-breaker. After squandering a winning chance in the first game, the Indian was back in her elements and played the do-or-die second game with absolute concentration. She was also assisted by luck, according to experts. It was a Bogo-Indian Defence that gave Humpy, playing white, a tangible advantage. Kovalevskaya played well and had enough compensation for lost material. But with the clock ticking away she committed a positional blunder on the 27th move that spelt her doom.  (PTI)  Copyright

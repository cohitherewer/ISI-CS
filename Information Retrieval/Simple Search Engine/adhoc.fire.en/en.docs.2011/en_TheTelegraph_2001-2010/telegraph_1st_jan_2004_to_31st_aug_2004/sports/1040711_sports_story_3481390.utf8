The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I am ready to sacrifice league for bigger goals, says Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 10: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick felt his teams 3-0 win over Railway FC in the CFL Super Division opener on Saturday was more than expected and quite in tune with his plans for the bigger goals ahead. My team is 40 per cent ready for this tournament and keeping this in mind, todays result was more than what I had anticipated, Bhowmick told a press conference after the match. Ruling out the possibility that the team was still in early-season rustiness, the coach emphasised that he would continue to experiment with his team throughout the Super Division campaign. Bhowmick said he was focused on greater achievements, beyond the insularity of domestic meets, and winning the Super Division was not one of his top priorities. For me, this tournament is nothing but a phase of experimentation. And in doing so, if I fail to win it, Ill have no regrets. Im ready to face all criticism in case of such accident and never sacrifice my team in full-fledged way for the sake of going after the Super Division. The club supporters must understand that their team is now a different outfit altogether. A student, who is keen to do well in joint entrance exams, is hardly bothered about faring well in Higher Secondary. Similarly, East Bengal must now look beyond the domestic boundary. We are known to Asia for our results in the ASEAN Club Championship and AFC Cup, and not for how many local leagues we are going to win, Bhowmick said. If I dont experiment now, Ill have hardly any time to do so later. I have also heard of the IFA Shield set to be staged in bigger way and for that matter, I may change my outlook on that meet and take it seriously he added.  Bhowmick informed that the clubs website was going  to be revived soon.  Copyright

 Tirkey defends IHF policy
Barog, May 18 (PTI): Defending the experimentation policy of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), captain Dilip Tirkey on Tuesday said the move would help the country come up with a balanced side for Athens. There has been a lot of experimentation due to which our performance may have dipped. But this is being done to ensure that we play with the best-possible team in the Olympics, he said. The problem is that we play good teams with a strong attitude but fail to carry that attitude when we take on weaker opponents.We must overcome this approach, he said. Tirkey said conversion of penalty corners continues to be Indias bane as no player has been able to fill the void created by the absence of Jugraj Singh.  Copyright

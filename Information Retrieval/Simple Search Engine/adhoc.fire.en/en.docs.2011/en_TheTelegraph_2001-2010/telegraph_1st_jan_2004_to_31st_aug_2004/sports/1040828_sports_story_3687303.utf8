 SA bid to end slump 
 South African captain Graeme Smith during practice in Dambulla on Friday. (AFP) Dambulla: South Africa will seek to capitalise on a depleted Sri Lanka team as they bid to end an eight-match losing run on Saturday. Sri Lanka are poised to rest skipper Maravan Atapattu and seamer Chaminda Vaas for the fourth game of the one-day series after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead on Wednesday. South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes the move could backfire on the hosts and allow his struggling team to drag themselves out of a rut. They (Sri Lanka) have had a long run and have won the series, but it only takes one or two games to lose the momentum you have built up, Smith told reporters. It is important for us to go out there and get a win under our belt no matter what the team they field to get our confidence up for the ICC Champions Trophy, he added. The tourists are set to change their strategy, halting an experiment with pinch-hitters in the top order. For Lanka, Rookie pace bowler Lasith Malinga is likely to play. Saman Jayantha will replace Atapattu, probably slipping straight into the skippers No. 3 position. Meanwhile, South African coach Eric Simons has said the team should take collective responsibility for its dismal performance in Sri Lanka.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI face uphill task in rain-hit tie
 - TRI-SERIES FINAL - NZ reach 266 despite slowing down after Fleming-Astle flying  start  Stephen Fleming must have been relieved to see a ball sent down by Tino Best just miss the wickets at Lords on Saturday. (AFP)  The West Indies had made 109  for five from 31 overs when bad light stopped play. Shivarine  Chanderpaul and Ricardo Powell were at the crease on 1 and  2, respectively. Devon Smith had earlier made 44, while  Brian Lara contributed 30. London, July 10 (Reuters):  Stephen Fleming lashed a superb half century to take New  Zealand to 266 against the West Indies in the triangular  one-day series final at Lords on Saturday. New Zealand, playing in their first one-day match at Lords, were bowled out in 49.2 overs and had looked set for over 300 at one stage but were slowed down by rain stoppages, loose shots and a more disciplined West Indies bowling. Openers Fleming and Nathan Astle had dominated some wayward early bowling with some flowing back foot shots, with the captain striking nine fours in his 67 off 66 balls. They shared a 120-run opening stand with Astle playing more conservatively for his 57 from 81 deliveries. Fleming was undone by a loose cut stroke straight to Chris Gayle at backward point off the bowling of the lively Dwayne Bravo. Astle was out in the same manner and was clearly annoyed with his choice of shot. Ramnaresh Sarwan, with one-day best figures of three for 31, and Dwayne Smith, one for 27, helped limit New Zealand after Tino Best in particular had been costly in the first 15 overs. The West Indies were continually poor in the field and Shivnarine Chanderpaul even collided with Ian Bradshaw in the deep when taking a catch off Best to dismiss Craig McMillan for a steady 52. Chris Cairns was dismissed in bizarre fashion for five, a wide from Sarwan hitting wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs and rebounding onto the stumps with Cairns out of his ground. Fleming rode his luck early on, Gayle dropping an easy chance when he was on seven and Astle cut to Ricardo Powell at backward point on 30 only for the third umpire to rule Powell had let the ball touch the ground. The West Indies allrounder left the field with an injured finger following the chance and did not bowl. Fleming, though not at his fluent best, showed great opportunism and pounced on everything that was short and wide outside off. Best provided him with plenty of that stuff and was suitably punished. Astle, on the other hand, was rather quiet to start with but opened up as the match wore on. He was typically strong square on the off side and drove with immaculate timing. The match started in bright sunshine after Brian Lara won the toss and opted to bowl. The teams winning the toss and chasing have won all six completed games in the series so far. But it soon started to rain and the players were forced from the field twice only to return minutes later. Rain remained in the air and if the full 50 overs a side are not completed on Saturday a reserve day has been set aside on Sunday.  Umpires felicitated Elite panel umpires David Shepherd and Rudi Koertzen were honoured with a new ICC award for passing the landmark of 100 ODI matches. Both umpires were presented with the bronze bails award by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed before the start of the tri-series final. Shepherd reached the 100 ODI landmark in the match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Sharjah on April 12, 2002. The English umpire has now stood in 153 ODIs which is more than any other international official. Koertzens 100th ODI was the match between Australia and Sri Lanka at Port Elizabeth on March 18, 2002. Todays game was the South African officials 118th. The bronze bails award will presented to all officials who pass the 100 ODI landmark as part of a recognition programme that includes silver bails (for 200 ODIs) and golden bails (for 100 Test matches), the ICC said in a release. Steve Bucknor and Darrell Hair are the only other members of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC umpires to have passed the 100 ODI landmark and they will both receive the awards over the coming months, the release added.

 Big W cloud over Clijsters
Brussels, June 5 (Agencies): World No. 2 Kim Clijsters has less than a 50 per cent chance of playing at Wimbledon as she needs more time to recover from a wrist injury, her coach said on Saturday. Its impossible to say now whether Kim will be able to play at Wimbledon but her chances are certainly not 50-50. Id even say rather no than yes, Marc Dehous was quoted as saying in a Belgian daily.

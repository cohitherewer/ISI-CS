 Shoaib injury yet to heal, says fresh test 
Islamabad: Pakistani speedster Shoaib Akhtar, currently playing for Durham, was yet to recover completely from his rib injury, a fresh test conducted in England has revealed. Akhtar had a second bone scan done in Newcastle Monday which showed that the Rawalpindi Express still carried the stress fracture on the 11th rib, local daily The News reported Wednesday. The report comes in the backdrop of PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan warning the fast bowler not to aggravate his injury. Akhtar was accused of feigning injury but a medical inquiry set up by the PCB exonerated him. The PCB top brass, however, were surprised when Akhtar soon turned up for Durham and seemed to perform without any hint of trouble. The bowler said he played for Durham because he had rested for three weeks and felt okay. But after two matches he felt stiffness and pain in his lower left back and he requested Durham to give him rest for five days to which they have agreed. They also advised me to get the second bone scan done, the results of which show that I am still carrying that injury, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

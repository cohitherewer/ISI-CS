The Telegraph - Calcutta
 My role has changed
 - Sachin hails fitness, spirit of Team India  Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar enjoy themselves at the pre-Asia Cup camp in Chennai on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh GhoshChennai: Sachin Tendulkar says people who think he has slowed down as a batsman by cutting out risky shots should not overlook the fact that he has matured as a batsman. I dont think I have slowed down as such. Its just that the team consists of 11 players and every individual has a role to play. As you become a senior your role changes, he said on Tuesday. Maybe people think I have mellowed down, but its not really so. There are different ways of scoring runs. I think Im a player whose strike rate is among the highest. If you analyse that, it tells you how fast or slow one plays. Tendulkar said he is playing a different role these days as compared to what he did some years ago. He added that the teams performance matters most. Eventually what matters is the teams performance. If the team wins, I have done my job, the 31-year-old said. Tendulkar said that despite the busy schedule, the present Indian team is the fittest ever. He also said the team is moving in the right direction with the coach and physical trainer doing a good job. We are playing more cricket as compared to earlier times. It means more travelling and affects the players bodies. There is less time to recover. But I can surely say our team is extremely fit now. Tendulkar praised the association of foreign experts with the Indian team. They are doing a useful and good job. It is for everyone to see the fitness level of the players. These things matter a lot. Its getting better. We understand we are trying to achieve one goal  the only way we are going to achieve our target is by working harder and practising in the right manner. If we win, we win together. On his back problem, Tendulkar said: Sometimes it can trouble me. Doctors have said my body will pass on signals and if I can catch them, I can control it. But I cant allow it to aggravate. I take precautions and a few exercises help me. Impressed by the cricketing skills of a disabled child, Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday disclosed plans for building ramps at international stadiums to help physically challenged kids watch big matches. Cricket is the most followed game in the country. Every one wants to play and be part of it. I approached the Mumbai, Hyderabad and Tamil Nadu associations for building a ramp for physically challenged kids and they graciously agreed to that. The next step will be to approach the BCCI and make it a standard thing all over the country for a separate stand for these kids.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia nets winner
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Uninspiring EB get past Tollygunge  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia in a tussle with Tollygunge defenders at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: East Bengal resumed their quest for a second successive National Football League (NFL) title with a performance that ranged from uninspiring to dominating. Playing percentage football for the first half of the match in unbearably humid conditions at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday, the holders managed a goal which ultimately proved enough to conquer Tollygunge Agragami. The picture altered completely after change of ends and East Bengal simply outplayed their rivals. Tollygunge, who had created a few chances in the first half, were lucky to avoid a spanking as East Bengal missed one sitter after another. Bhaichung Bhutias 34th-minute winner helped his team move to 37 points from 17 matches  five clear of nearest rivals Dempo. Tollygunge stay in relegation zone with 17 from 17. The heat and humidity notwithstanding, the match was entertaining as Tollygunge forced a few chances in the early minutes capitalising on East Bengals cautious approach. With East Bengal inviting their rivals into their own half, Tollygunge came close in the fourth minute when Gouranga Duttas shot came off goalkeeper Sandip Nandy and Akeem Abolanle failed to make use of the rebound. Akeem forced a sharp save from Nandy four minutes later and so did Amit Das in the dying minutes of the first half, but in between, it was East Bengal who forced the better chances despite not operating at full steam. Long passes from the deep  aimed at fooling the Tollygunge defenders who had moved up  was the feature of most of East Bengals early forays. Defenders Isiaka Awoyemi and Ebi Bar Bar did well to defuse many moves, but East Bengal still came across a few golden opportunities. K. Kulothungan missed the chance of the match with just the goalkeeper to beat in the 33rd minute. Cristiano Junior, Mike Okoro, Bhutia and Dipankar Roy all let go opportunities they normally convert. Alvito DCunha, who replaced Kulothungan seconds after the unbelievable blunder, was the brain behind the goal. DCunha, with his first touch off a free-kick from the right, floated in a crafty left-footer. The flight of the ball was so tricky that the Tollygunge Agragami goalkeeper could not decide whether to leave his line or stay right back. He ended up reaching no-mans land and Bhutia rose above his markers and flicked in the winner. TEAMS East Bengal: Sandip Nandy; M.

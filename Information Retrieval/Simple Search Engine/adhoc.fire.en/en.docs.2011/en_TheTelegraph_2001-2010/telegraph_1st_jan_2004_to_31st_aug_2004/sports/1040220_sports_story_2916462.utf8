The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangladesh fight back
Harare: Tapash Baisya and Mohammad Rafique took two wickets each as Bangladesh earned parity with Zimbabwe on the first day of the first Test on Thursday. Zimbabwe, who won the toss and chose to bat, were 175 for four when bad light ended play one over early on a day reduced to 74 overs by overnight rain. Seamer Baisya took two for 47 and left-arm spinner Rafique claimed two for 41. Their success negated the early progress Zimbabwe made thanks to opener Dion Ebrahims 65 and 58 from Stuart Carlisle. After the morning session was washed out following heavy overnight rain, Bangladesh made an early breakthrough when Trevor Gripper edged Baisya to Habibul Bashar at first slip without a run on the board. On a sluggish pitch that gave inconsistent bounce Carlisle and Ebrahim then shared a stand of 107. Carlisle who completed his eighth half-century, hit six fours and a six in his 119-ball stay. Ebrahim hit eight fours and was dismissed 13 overs later when he lunged at a short but sharply turning delivery from Rafique and was easily stumped by Khaled Mashud. In Rafiques next over Grant Flower top-edged an attempted pull and was caught by Hannan Sarkar at mid-wicket as Zimbabwe slumped to 133 for four.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

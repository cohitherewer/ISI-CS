The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian GMs make steady progress
 - Suryas consistency rewarded  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Harikrishna nears 2600 mark Calcutta: Leading Indian chess players have made encouraging progress over the last three months. In the latest Elo rating list released this month, most of them have moved up in rankings with Viswanathan Anand leading the way. P. Harikrishna, Koneru Humpy, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda have all increased their rating points after the publication of the previous list in January. As was being estimated after Anands victory in the Corus meet in Wijk Aan Zee in January, the Indian has toppled Vladimir Kramnik from the position of world No. 2. Anands Elo rating is 2774 and Garri Kasparov stays No. 1 with 2817 after having lost 14 points. Kramnik has lost ten points to come down to 2764. Though occupying the second place, Anands 2774 is still well behind the best he had achieved  2797 in August 2001. Harikrishnas steady climb continues and the Andhra Pradesh GM has reached 2599. He will become the third Indian after Anand and Krishnan Sasikiran to cross the 2600 mark if he does so. Humpy, the youngest woman to pocket the mens GM title, has reclaimed her No. 3 spot in womens rankings. She has 2513, behind Judit Polgar (2728) of Hungary and Chinas Xie Jun (2564). The other Indian in the top 50 is S. Vijayalakshmi (2438). Sasikiran, the only other Indian apart from Anand rated in the top 100 in the mens list, has gained five points to move to 2659. However, the Chennai GM stays 39th in the world even after the gain. Bengal GMs Surya and Sandipan have also moved up the ladder and raised hopes of cracking the 2600 mark in the near future. National champion Surya has gained 41 points to shoot up to 2582. The 21-year-old has always been a steady climber, who rarely slipped after crossing 2500. A gain of so many points is a just reward for some very consistent showing in the recent past. Sandipan, who seems to have put the days of inconsistency behind him, has collected 39 points to reach 2561. After some up and down on the Elo list before becoming a GM last July, Sandipan hasnt looked back. Incidentally, Surya, Sandipan and Harikrishna (first, second and third in National A, respectively) have all reached career-best points in the rating list. GM Dibyendu Barua, who fractured his right arm recently, has lost ten points to slip to 2539. IM Neelotpal Das has lost four points and is on 2457. THE TOP TEN 1. Garri Kasparov (Rus, 2817). 2.

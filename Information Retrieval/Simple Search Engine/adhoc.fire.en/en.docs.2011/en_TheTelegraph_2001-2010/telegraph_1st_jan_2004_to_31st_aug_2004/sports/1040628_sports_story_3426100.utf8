(AP) London: An unbeaten 60 from Chris Gayle helped West Indies coast to a seven-wicket win over England in the third one-day triangular International at Trent Bridge Sunday after England had crumbled to 147 all out. Captain Brian Lara hit the winning boundary, striking 32 from 29 balls as the West Indies eased home in 32.2 overs. Gayle and opening partner Shivnarine Chanderpaul had made a slow start in their reply, scoring only 28 runs in the first ten overs in the face of some controlled bowling from fast bowlers Darren Gough and Steve Harmison. But Gayle, dropped on nine by England vice-captain Marcus Trescothick in the slips, then powered to his 21st half-century in one-dayers to put West Indies on track for a comfortable win. Trescothick made some amends by taking two catches off paceman James Anderson to remove Dwayne Smith, for six, and Ramnaresh Sarwan, for 13. Chanderpaul was the first wicket to fall, dragging an Anthony McGrath delivery on to his stumps to depart for 20. West Indies seamer Dwayne Bravo, with three for 26, had earlier helped dismiss England in 38.2 overs for their lowest one-day score at the Nottingham ground. Man of the Match Bravo pierced Englands middle order, which had been lengthened by the inclusion of four all-rounders, removing top scorer Andrew Strauss for 43, Ian Blackwell for four and McGrath for nine. Laras decision to put England into bat on a hard pitch was justified early when left-armer Ian Bradshaw dismissed openers Trescothick and Vaughan in his first two overs. Debutant Geraint Jones, batting at three, then steadied the innings in an 82-run partnership with Strauss before Ravi Rampaul, who had earlier struggled with his line, bowled him for 35 off 45 deliveries. The West Indies gained five points for their win, plus a bonus point.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

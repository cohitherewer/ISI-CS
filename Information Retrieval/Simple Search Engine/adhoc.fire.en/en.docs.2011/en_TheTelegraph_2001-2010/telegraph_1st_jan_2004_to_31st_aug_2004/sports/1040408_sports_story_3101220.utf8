The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenals dreams lie in tatters
 FROM HENRY WINTER IN LONDON  Chelseas Frank Lampard jumps in joy after scoring against Arsenal in London on Tuesday. (Reuters) Four days ago, Arsenal resembled real thoroughbreds, capable of winning the Treble handicap chase but now they risk being branded the Devon Loch of English football. Evicted from the FA Cup last Saturday, sensationally expelled from the Champions League by Wayne Bridges late strike last night, Arsenal can prevent their season from complete collapse only by jumping the final few Premiership fences properly. Their nemesis have been old and new rivals, Manchester United in the Cup and Chelsea in the Champions League. For all the impressive nature of Arsenals goal last night from Jose Antonio Reyes, no one could begrudge Chelsea this victory which left their coach, Claudio Ranieri, in tears of joy. Chelsea now meet Monaco, who pulled off an equally improbable success to send Real Madrid tumbling out. This remarkable, against-the-odds success did more than raise the Blue Flag over Highbury and London. It sent their supporters into raptures and was a personal triumph for their besieged coach whose moment of nirvana was watched by Sven-Goran Eriksson, the man Chelsea had planned to replace him with. Ranieris players have always spoken publicly and privately of their admiration for the engaging Italian and such loyalty to their leader imbued every touch and tackle in this embarrassing of Arsenal. Bridge and Ranieri will get the headlines but the real hero for Chelsea was Frank Lampard, who delivered a phenomenal display in midfield, ultimately eclipsing the great Patrick Vieira in a memorable match. Nip and tuck, end to end, move after magnificent move, the spellbinding tie had become level on aggregate and away goals when the terrific Lampard equalised Reyes strike, the goals coming either side of half-time, the only moment when the players were allowed to pause for breath. It was impossible to take the eye off the unfolding drama. Just when a first half of breathtaking intensity appeared to be heading for a scoreless close, in sped Reyes, sending the Arsenal fans into ecstasy with a confident finish of a flowing break. Here was Wengers high-class side at their high-octane best, the ball whisked between flying feet, bemused opponents left back-pedalling despairingly. Robert Pires accelerated the danger, transferring the momentum from the centre to the right. Lauren raced on to the ball, the right-back relishing the opportunity to speed into space and then lifting a cross steepling to the far-post. Henry, rarely the most dominant in the air headed the ball back into the six-yard box where it bounced off the back of Freddie Ljungbergs heel into the path of the on-rushing Reyes. The little Spaniard enjoys inspecting Chelseas defence for openings. The forward whose brace knocked Chelsea out of the FA Cup accepted this chance with typical relish, drilling it hard past Terry and Marco Ambrosio. Remarkably, given the end-to-end nature of the half, Reyes strike was Arsenals first attempt on target. [However, Henry picked up a hamstring injury in the match and has been ruled out of Arsenals home game with Liverpool on Friday and the trip to Newcastle on Sunday, reports Reuters.] Making light of Reyes goal, Chelsea went for the jugular as the second half burst into life. Edus hurried clearance was seized on by Claude Makelele 25 yards out and the French international returned it back in with considerable interest, the ball catching out Jens Lehmann, who failed to control it properly. Lampard, such an up-market seeker of scraps, was swiftest to the loose ball which he buried past Lehmann. Following one swerving Cole run, Gudjohnsen cracked the ball goalwards only for Ashley Cole to clear. Chelsea came again, Bridge playing a one-two with Gudjohnsen and stroking the ball left-footed past Lehmann. Sensational.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

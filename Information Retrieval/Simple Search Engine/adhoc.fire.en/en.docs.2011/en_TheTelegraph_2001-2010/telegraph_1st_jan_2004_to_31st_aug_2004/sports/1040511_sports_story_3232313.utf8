The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bowlers plight upsets Chappell
Lahore: As batsmen keep getting big scores in ODIs, bowlers are becoming the forgotten people of cricket, former Australian captain Greg Chappell said on Monday. If someone believes you have to have 300 runs in every game at the expense of bowlers, it is damaging for cricket, Chappell said on the sidelines of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) seminar. Cricket is a contest. The closer the contest between bat and ball, the better the cricket. If somebody has decided it is not good for television and spectators, it is going to have a negative impact, said Chappell. Wickets around the world are becoming more batting friendly and bowlers have become forgotten people. I think it is a dangerous trend which needs to be reversed. Chappell said he wants the ICC to create an enjoyable environment where players can learn. We learn under creative, enjoyable environments where we have fun. Taking cricket coaching into the classroom is not a good thing to do, he said.  (AP)  Copyright

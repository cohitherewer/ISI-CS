The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, May 15, 2004  Mumbai season concludes 
 BY HONKY DORY				 										C. Rajendra, with 39 wins, claimed the jockeys championship and Cooji Katraks score of 41 helped him grab honours in the trainers category when the curtain came down on the Mumbai racing season on Friday. 				 										Having won more than Rs 1 crore in stakes, owner MAM Ramaswamy emerged as the leading stake money winner. Heading the stakes table was a creditable feat despite the fact that he failed to win the Indian Derby. However, his ward, Simply Supreme, won an equally rich Indian Turf Invitation Cup which placed him in the number one position.				 										Yogender Singh who had a successful season, lifted the champion apprentice title. He booted home 26 winners during the 55-day season.

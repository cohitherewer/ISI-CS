The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Virender Sehwags defiant stand amid Lahore ruins
 - SECOND TEST - India lose track of plot after taking 4 early wkts on Day III Lahore: India were staring at a big defeat in the second Test against Pakistan on Wednesday after yet another inept batting display by its top order save Virender Sehwag. The Multan triple-centurion was unbeaten at stumps on Day III on a defiant 86 but his team was a dismal 149 for five, still needing 53 to make Pakistan bat again. Only rain, of which there is little prospect, or a Sehwag-engineered miracle can come in the way of Pakistan squaring the three-Test series. Facing a 202-run first-innings deficit, the celebrated Indian top-order collapsed again on a wicket which even the Pakistan tailenders had enjoyed earlier in the day. Sehwag alone stood among the ruins and lived to fight another day. The visions of a great Indian fightback faded fast when opener Akash Chopra was declared leg-before wicket  a doubtful decision by Steve Bucknor  stand-in captain Rahul Dravid (0) ran himself out before facing a ball, Sachin Tendulkar (8) fell leg-before to an incoming delivery for the second time in the match and V.V.S. Laxman (13) was castled by a good ball from Umar Gul. First-innings centurion Yuvraj Singh (12) also faltered, leaving the side tottering at 105 for five before wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel (12 batting) joined Sehwag in an unbroken 44-run partnership. The decision to bat first on a green pitch may have backfired on Day I, but there was no explanation for Indias capitulation in the second innings. The day had begun very well for India as pacemen removed the two best Pakistan batsmen, skipper Inzamam-ul Haq and his deputy Yusuf Youhana, very early. Inzamam fell leg-before to Irfan Pathan in the days first over at his overnight score of 118. His 243-ball knock came in 323 minutes and included 14 boundaries. Lakshmipathy Balaji brought more cheers by removing Youhana who edged an away-going delivery to Patel. Youhanas 72 came off 153 balls and was laced with 13 fours. Hopes of restricting Pakistans lead were further raised as Pathan sent back Kamran Akmal and Mohammed Sami. But the enterprising Asim Kamal (73) joined hands with Shoaib Akhtar and Gul to take the score from 386 for seven to 489. Akhtar fell to a brilliant Yuvraj catch at mid-wicket, Gul was hit-wicket off Tendulkar and Kamal was last man out giving Kumble figures of two for 146. Pakistan thus earned a healthy lead of 202, enough to push the opposition on the backfoot from the first ball. The Indian innings couldnt have shaped up in a worse manner. Five top batsmen were back in the hut before the charged-up Pakistan pacemen had sent down 25 overs. Chopra didnt get the umpires benefit of doubt, falling leg-before to Akhtar. Dravid was then run out by a direct hit from Imran Farhat at the stroke of tea to leave the visitors in a daze before a small but vociferous home crowd at the Gaddafi Stadium. The Indians suffered another big blow when Tendulkar was trapped leg-before by a Sami delivery which kept a trifle low. Gul, the five-wicket hero of the first innings, ended Laxmans promising 44-minute stay at the crease with a gem of a delivery which moved away late to disturb the stumps. Yuvraj paid the price for poking at an away-going delivery from Sami and Akmal took a smart catch behind the stumps. Pace trio asked to stand by Disappointed with the performance of Shoaib and Sami, the Pakistan selectors have asked three pacemen to be on stand-by for the third and final Test starting in Rawalpindi on April 13. They have asked Rana Naveed-ul Hasan, Iftikar Rao and Fazl-e-Akbar to be ready for the third Test, local daily The News quoted PCB officials as saying.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Topalov ahead
Tripoli: Top seeded Grandmaster Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria was lucky to score over GM Zdenko Kozul of Croatia in the first game of the pre-quarter finals of the world chess championship here. Second seed GM Michael Adams of England was well poised to draw the first blood against youngest participant left in the fray, Hikaru Nakamura of US. GM Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan enjoyed a much better position against GM Zoltan Almasi of Hungary.  (PTI)  Copyright

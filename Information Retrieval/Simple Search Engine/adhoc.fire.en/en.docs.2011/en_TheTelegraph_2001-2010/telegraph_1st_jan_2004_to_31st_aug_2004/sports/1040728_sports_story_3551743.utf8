The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Squad by August 10
Mumbai: The national selectors will have to meet sometime soon after the return of the Indian team from the ongoing Asia Cup in Sri Lanka to choose the squad for the tri-series in Holland, the three-match NatWest Challenge one-day series and the ICC Champions Trophy in England. As per the rules of the September 10-25 Champions Trophy, all the participating teams have to finalise their players for the tournament on or before August 10. I suppose the selectors will name the same squad for all three events when they meet next, a top source in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed on Tuesday. The Amsterdam triangular event, featuring India, Pakistan and Australia, is scheduled from August 21-28, and would be followed by the three one-day Internationals against hosts England in the first week of September as a tune-up for the Mini World Cup.

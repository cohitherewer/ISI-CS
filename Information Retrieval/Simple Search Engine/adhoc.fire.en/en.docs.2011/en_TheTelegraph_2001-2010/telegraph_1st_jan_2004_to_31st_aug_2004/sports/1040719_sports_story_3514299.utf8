 Michael Johnson amp; Co. set to lose gold
 Johnson and Young during a typical US relay team effort Grosseto (Italy): The IAAF said on Sunday that the US 1,600m relay team, led by Michael Johnson, should be stripped of its Olympic gold in Sydney as part of the Jerome Young doping case. The IAAF, which held an unusual council meeting here, will now make recommendations to the IOC. Based on this position, we believe that the consequence should be that the medals are taken back, IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai said following the decision. The consequences are implied. If the result is annulled, you dont get the medals for a result that doesnt stand. If someone is not eligible, that athlete cannot have a valid result. The IOC is expected to endorse the IAAFs decision, probably before next months Athens Olympics. The IOC told us that we follow your decision, said IAAF president Lamine Diack. The announcement came two-and-a-half weeks after the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled 400m world champion Young, who ran in the 1,600m relays opening and semi-final rounds, should be stripped of his Olympic gold because of a positive doping test for the steroid nandrolone on June 26, 1999. Young, who has denied taking a prohibited substance, was exonerated by a USA Track and Field doping appeals board on July 10, 2000. We dont consider it a triumph, Gyulai said. We consider it our moral obligation. The gold was the fifth and final for Johnson, the 200 and 400m world record-holder who ran the anchor leg in the relay final. Other members of the team were twin brothers Alvin and Calvin Harrison, Antonio Pettigrew and Angelo Taylor. The team members will be invited to present their case to the IOC at a hearing, either in person or in writing. If the IOC sticks to the IAAFs recommendation, Nigeria would be upgraded to gold, Jamaica to silver and the Bahamas to bronze. Four, including 100m world record-holder Tim Montgomery, face possible lifetime bans after being accused by the US anti-doping agency of offences. The four have not tested positive, but are accused based on information gathered in the criminal investigation of the Bay Area laboratory cooperative in Burlingame, California. Three more US athletes, hurdler Larry Wade, sprinters Mickey Grimes and Torri Edwards, have been identified publicly as testing positive for drugs in the last week. The last American athlete to have an Olympic gold medal taken away for a similar offence was swimmer Rick Demont in 1972. Demont, then 16, finished first in the 400m relay freestyle in Munich. Regina banned World indoor 1,500m record-holder Regina Jacobs has been banned for four years after a positive test for the anabolic steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG).In a statement on Saturday the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said 40-year-old Jacobs, who announced her retirement on Thursday, had accepted the sanction after a positive test at last years US trials. Her subsequent results will now be annulled and she will forfeit all her winnings since testing positive on June 21, 2003.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

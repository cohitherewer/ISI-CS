 Beckham still proud to be captain 
 Beckham during a press conference in Lisbon on Friday Lisbon: England captain David Beckham still believes he can inspire his country to a major title and has no intention of resigning. The day after Englands agonising 5-6 penalty shootout defeat by Portugal in their Euro 2004 quarter final, Beckham was clearly angry that his leadership was being questioned. Do you think I can inspire the team like I could in the past? What do you think? Listen, I am England captain and I will not be resigning my position, Im proud to be part of this team and proud to be England captain, he told a news conference. If people want to doubt me, fair enough, but Im England captain and I wont be resigning unless somebody wants me to and that person is the England manager. Talking about his failed penalty attempt , Beckham said the penalty spot had given way. The night before the match we practised penalties at the other end and out feet kept giving way under us, he said. I think the manager made an official complaint to Uefa about both penalty spots but Im not sure they did anything about it. Beckham also referred to Sol Campbells disallowed goal in the dying seconds of normal time with the score at 1-1. The linesman had given the goal, he was running back towards the halfway-line but the referee made the decision, he said. Meanwhile, England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson says he had words with referee Urs Meier after Thursdays penalty shootout. To get over this will take more than 12 hours, more than 24 hours, much, much longer, Eriksson said. In football things like this happen. I went into the referees dressing room after the game and what I said will stay between him and me. Rooney, meanwhile, will be out of action for six weeks after breaking a bone in his foot during the match, Eriksson said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

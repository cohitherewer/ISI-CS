 Pele leaves himself open to ridicule
 - It was very difficult choosing I tried to make as few mistakes as possible  BY CHRISTOPHER DAVIES  Pele hands over a Fifa trophy to Frances Thierry Henry for being one of the 100 best living players in London on Thursday. (AP) It may be difficult to substantiate an argument that Pele, by general consensus the finest player yet, is a poor judge of those who play the game. But the list of the Fifa 100 greatest living footballers  there are actually 125 names  as nominated by the Brazilian has left the man who graced what he called the beautiful game open to ridicule. While any such list is bound to attract controversy, the inclusion of his namesake Abedi Pele (Ghana), El Hadji Diouf (Senegal) and Hong Myung-Bo (South Korea) smacks of political correctness rather than sound football judgment. Juan Sebastian Veron is unlikely to receive a vote from Manchester United or Chelsea supporters, Hernan Crespos inclusion will raise eyebrows while the omission of Sir Geoff Hurst, the only player to score a hattrick in a World Cup final, from Englands representatives will baffle many. Not a single Welshman was nominated  it was confirmed that even had John Charles still been living he would not have figured  Kenny Dalglish is Scotlands lone representative with George Best and Roy Keane the two top Irishmen. England boast seven players  including present captain David Beckham and striker Michael Owen, plus Gordon Banks, Sir Bobby Charlton, Kevin Keegan, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer. Pele came under fire from Brazil, where the omissions of Jairzinho and Gerson of the 1970 World Cup-winning side proved particularly controversial. Jairzinho is the only player to have scored in every round of a World Cup, while Gerson appeared on Brazilian television and tore up the list in a display of outrage at the slur. Pele defended himself and said: It was very difficult choosing  sometimes you have pain in your heart when you have to leave somebody out. Everyone has their own favourite 100 players and I just tried to make as few mistakes as possible. They asked me to pick 50 current players and 50 retired players from a short list of 300, but I could not manage that so I have picked 50 current and 75 former players. The players have agreed to have pictures taken by leading photographers for a Fifa book that will go on sale in June. There will be 100 pictures, with more than one player figuring in some pictures. Only seven players will not be pictured. Dutch striker Marco van Basten and former Germany international Uwe Seeler both refused to take part, while five could not be contacted: Diego Maradona, Daniel Passarella, Gerd Muller, Ferenc Puskas and Rivelino. As Pele presented Banks with his award, the Brazilian said: Thank God I scored a lot of goals at the 1970 World Cup but every tournament I go to, people forget those and talk about his save.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav warning on complacency 
 - Middle overs still a worry for Indian skipper - Inzamam calls for more positive pitches  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Mohammad Kaif beats Hemang Badani to the catch, dismissing Shoaib Malik during the first ODI in Karachi on Saturday. (AFP) Karachi: Sourav Ganguly believes the five-run victory in the first of the five-match series is a good way to begin with but there was no room for complacency. The series is still wide open with four more games to go, the Indian skipper said. He added that the decision to have Ashish Nehra bowl the last over with Pakistan needing nine runs was taken keeping in view the left-arm pacers experience. India-Pakistan matches are about handling pressure. Nehra was the most experienced available then and it showed in his approach, Sourav explained. Despite the victory, the skipper felt that India needed to get their act together in the middle overs. We bowled well in the first 15 overs. Towards the close we again did well but it is strategy of the middle 30 overs that we need to look into. Despite Laxmans absence  the batsman failing to make it because of a sore left knee at the last minute  the Indian batting prospered in perfect conditions. We batted excellently, said Sourav. He, however, was not satisfied with his own performance. The skipper was dismissed of a Naved-ul Hasan Rana delivery for 45 after hitting a pulled six off the previous ball. I should have got a hundred on this pitch, he did not hide his disappointment. Inzamam-ul Haq did not believe his decision to put India in cost him dear. Chasing 350, we looked like winning at one stage. Chasing is not a problem with us but failing to finish it off is a weakness, the Pakistan skipper said. We should not have left nine runs for the final over. The Indians fielded well and that made the difference, he explained. Inzamam hoped the youngsters will learn their lessons quickly from this defeat. Im happy with our batting. But we need to improve on our bowling and fielding. Hopefully, the youngsters learn and settle down as the series progresses. The home skipper made his displeasure about the wicket quite evident. The pitches should be more positive and have more pace. Having this sort of wickets in one-dayers have now become the norm. I can only hope the wickets are better elsewhere. The Pakistanis conceded ten wides and 20 no-balls and the statistics did not please the skipper. I havent seen Shoaib bowl so many no balls. We will have to reduce these. Inzamam sounded diplomatically correct when a scribe asked him if Waqar Younis experience would have helped. The selectors know their job well. They will be in a position to answer this, he remarked. It seems Wasim Bari and Co. will have to do a lot of answering after todays defeat.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka beat UAE by 116 runs
Dambulla, July 17 (PTI): A fine allround performance by Upul Chandana helped Sri Lanka beat UAE by 116 runs in a group B match in the Asia Cup on Saturday. After an indifferent batting performance saw them being dismissed for a modest 239, the Sri Lankan bowlers skittled out the Emirates nation for 123 in 47.5 overs in the day-night encounter. Chandana, whose cameo 21 off 24 balls was instrumental in the hosts going past the 200-mark, grabbed four for 22 to help the islanders begin on a winning note. Avishka Gunawardenes well-paced 73 off 89 balls was pivotal to the Sri Lankan innings while record breaking off-spinner Muthiah Muralidharan marked his return to international cricket with figures of three for 21. It was a perfect answer to his critics who had derided him for withdrawing from the two-Test tour of Australia citing personal reasons. Left-arm paceman Nuwan Zoysa took two for 11 to complete the UAE rout.  Copyright

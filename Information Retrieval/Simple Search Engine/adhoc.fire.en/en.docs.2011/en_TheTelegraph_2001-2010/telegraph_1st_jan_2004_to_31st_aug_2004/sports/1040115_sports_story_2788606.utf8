The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anirban set to make East Zone debut
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta: Left-arm spinner  Anirban Chatterjee is all set to make his debut for East  Zone in the Deodhar Trophy tie against West at the Kanchenjungha  Stadium in Siliguri on Thursday. He was selected after veteran  left-arm spinner Utpal Chatterjee opted out of the tournament. East arrived in the city on Wednesday evening following a delayed flight. As a result, Devang Gandhi and his men could not take a look at the pitch. Timir Chanda, Dipak Mongaraj and Rajeev Raja, are unlikely to find a place in the team, it was learnt. PTI adds from Siliguri: The two teams are well balanced with wicket keeper-batsman Deep Dasgupta, Laxmi Ratan Sukla, Devang and Nikhil Haldipur turning up for East while Vinod Kambli, Hrisikesh Kanitkar, Sairaj Bahutule will be doing duty for the West Zone. West captain Bahatule expressed satisfaction over outfield conditions but reserved his comments about the pitch. The pitch is an unknown factor, Bahutule said. Though the seam bowlers may get some assistance in the morning session, the pitch may ease out as the day progresses. Tremendous enthusiasm has been generated among the cricket lovers here to catch a glimpse of the stars. West Zone had reached here on Tuesday.  Last year Bengal and Railways first turned up in a Ranji Trophy match at the Kanchenjungha Stadium.  Copyright

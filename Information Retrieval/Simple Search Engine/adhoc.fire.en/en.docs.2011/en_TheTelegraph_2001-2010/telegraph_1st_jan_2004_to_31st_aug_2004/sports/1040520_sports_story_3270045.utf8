The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Miandad unsure about continuing
 Javed Miandad Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) may have decided to continue with the services of Javed Miandad, but the coach is having a rethink about his future. I am hurt and upset at the way the board has created uncertainty and put a question mark on my integrity and credibility as coach. I am not jumping with joy because the board now says that they will allow me to complete my two- year coaching contract. I will now have to think about my future plans, Miandad said. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan had said on Tuesday that it had been decided to retain Miandad as coach until his contract expired next year. But Miandad said, Since we lost to India, there have been attempts to shift the blame on the coach and the board has also really made no effort to defend my role, he said on Wednesday. Miandad also said he would seek a meeting with the PCB chairman and chief executive in the next few days to discuss a number of issues. One of them is the extent of my authority and say in the team, the coach said. My position, honestly, is that I dont even have the authority to ask for a player to be in the team. Then what is my role? To just guide the boys, plan and build a strategy which I have tried to do since taking over as coach?  (PTI)  Copyright

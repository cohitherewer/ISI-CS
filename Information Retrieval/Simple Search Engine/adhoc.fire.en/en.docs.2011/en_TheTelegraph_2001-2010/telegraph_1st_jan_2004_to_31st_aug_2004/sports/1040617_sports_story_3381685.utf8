The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England hope to put failure behind 
 - Erikssons men have talent and technical nous to beat Swiss  FROM PAUL HAYWARD IN LISBON  David James (seen here failing to stop Zidanes penalty on Sunday) says he feels for the fans For England, even the National Anthem went wrong. Against the French on Sunday, Sven-Goran Erikssons men had planned to lock shoulders like the front row of a scrum to inject emotion into God Save The Queen. But the music started too suddenly and the human chain was never formed. Ninety-three minutes later, France claimed the last dance. It was England, though, who ended up with blisters. David Beckham strode into our media marquee Tuesday to tell us that several England players are suffering with sore feet. Blisters on the soles, blisters on the soul. Here, on the outskirts of Lisbon, the English are flailing against the idea that they are stalked by a curse. Sol Campbell, not a dainty figure, used a delicate phrase to describe Frances demoralising victory. Fortuitous, he called it. It just comes down to moments. Which is the problem. How many of these moments have there been? To start on the litany of heartbreaks since the Italy World Cup in 1990 would have the reader reaching for the Prozac. When the French had stopped singing in their dressing room (good luck to them, they deserved it), old doubts bubbled up from the deep. A boxer is never so dispirited as when he throws all his best shots only to be knocked out by an even better punch from his opponent. To some, this was the dark symmetry of the David Beckham-Zinedine Zidane penalties. Beckhams quest has been to become the English Zidane. But he cant get there. No one can. Beckham missed, Zidane scored, under infinitely greater pressure. France closed the deal. England only re-opened old scars. This is how it can look when you piece together Beckhams unconvincing swipe from the penalty spot, Steven Gerrards wonky back-pass and the bullocking charge by David James that brought Thierry Henry to earth for Zidane to stroke home the winner. Some defeats are straightforward. They defy analysis. Eriksson tried to boot this one into historys dustbin by keeping Mondays speech to the players short and sharp (Campbells phrase). For England, who need to beat Switzerland on Thursday and Croatia next to be sure of going through, one voice in the night can end it all: Were not as good as we thought we were. This suspicion, if given headroom, would cause the mind to crumble. The countervailing mantra was spelled out by Campbell, Beckham and James. Tactically we were fantastic, declared Campbell, who talked Ledley King through his stellar competitive debut. For 90 minutes we played some of our best football, and our positional play was probably the best its ever been, asserted Beckham, the light glinting off his diamond earring. Look into the jewel and see the beautiful shapes and colours. This is what the fans want. They need reassurance. They have to believe that the outbreak of violence involving English tourists in Albufeira was not emblematic of another disintegrating campaign. This England team has the talent and the tactical nous to take six points off the Swiss and the Croatians. If they recover from Sundays calamity, as they should, Zidanes double dagger jab may yet be remembered as an example of cosmic bad luck (though, how much bad fortune was involved in Emile Heskey bundling over Claude Makelele within shooting range, Beckham missing his penalty or Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen being taken off?). Studying the demeanour of the players, though, you still see seepages of spiritual blood. James spoke Tuesday of seeing the supporters afterwards  seeing their grief. Im feeling that, he said. Were down, as you would expect, but were professional footballers and weve got a job to do, Campbell emoted. Note the use of the present tense, 36 hours after the match, and 48 before England face the Swiss. One minute its there, then two or three minutes later its lost, Campbell lamented. I can assure you that all the players are in good moods, Beckham told the TV cameras. They will need to be, if not Tuesday then certainly by Wednesday. The bald facts are that England tried to beat France by playing like Liverpool  throwing a defensive blanket over Henry and Company and then trying to snatch a victory through set-pieces and counter-attacks. Once Beckham stroked his penalty the way he always does  to the goalkeepers right  Eriksson opted for 15 minutes of containment, to protect the 1-0 lead. At 90 minutes it had worked. At 93, head-bangers were stomping into the streets of urban England to chuck things at the police. No wonder the country was in shock. Deja vu is a French expression, appropriated by the English. But let us introduce a philosophical note. There is not one crumb of evidence to prove that Englands footballers are pre-programmed to repeat the mistakes of the past. Logically, there is no reason to believe that this generation are trapped in a hall of mirrors from Italia 90, Euro 96, France 98 or the most recent World Cup. Gerrard did not miss-hit a back pass to James because David Batty missed a penalty against Argentina six years ago, or because David Seaman was lobbed by Ronaldinho in Japan. France, on Sunday, was an opening game, not a quarter or semi-final. Next time England can be ready for the National Anthem and the huddle. The trouble is, its no good the country telling them. They have to believe it themselves.

 Rameez quits PCB, chooses TV
 - I felt time was right to hand over Galle, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Rameez Raja has resigned to concentrate on his media career. We have got his resignation and we are sad to let him go, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Saturday. We wish him well in his career as a cricket commentator. Rameez, who was appointed chief executive last year, had been criticised by Pakistan newspapers and cricketers because his role as a commentator clashed with his responsibilities as the top board official. The time had come to move on because after about 16 months we had introduced a strong system and achieved many things, Rameez said in Galle. In addition, I felt it was time for me to choose between my media commitments, which are becoming stiffer, and the chief executives job. There was an understanding from the start that the cricket media was my career now and that I would return to it full-time at some stage. With so much cricket over the coming months I would hardly be in Pakistan and I felt the time was right to hand over. Meanwhile, PTI from Islamabad reports that according to PCB sources, Shaharyar was strongly considering appointing former Pakistan medium pacer and selector Salim Altaf to succeed Rameez.  Copyright

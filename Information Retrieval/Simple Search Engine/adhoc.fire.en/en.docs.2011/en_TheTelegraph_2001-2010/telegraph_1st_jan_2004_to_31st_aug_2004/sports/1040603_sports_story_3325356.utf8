 Fifa bans Kenya indefinitely
Nairobi: World soccers governing body Fifa slapped an indefinite suspension on Kenya on Wednesday because of alleged government interference in the affairs of the Kenya Football Federation (KFF). The ban affects the countrys national team and clubs which will not be allowed to take part in international soccer meets. Kenya are due to play their first 2006 World Cup qualifier on June 5. Fifa general secretary Urs Linzi, in a letter to ousted KFF chairman Maina Kariuki, said Fifa was left with no option after it became clear sports minister Najib Balala was unwilling to reinstate KFF officials.

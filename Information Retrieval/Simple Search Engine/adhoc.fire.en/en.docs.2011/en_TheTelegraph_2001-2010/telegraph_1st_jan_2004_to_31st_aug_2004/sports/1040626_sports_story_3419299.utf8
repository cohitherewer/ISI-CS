 Murali absence may be a ploy, says Warne 
 Warne thinks Murali may yet turn up for the Test series Sydney: Shane Warne suspects Muttiah Muralidharans decision to opt out of Sri Lankas tour of Australia may be just a ploy and the spin rival could still turn up for the two-match Test series starting next week. Warne, who is just 10 short of the off-spinners world record feat of 527 wickets, said the move could just be a tactical thing being tried by the Lankans. It might be a tactical thing theyre trying, that may be in a couple of days before the first Test Muralidharan might just rock up and play, Warne said on Friday. Its just something I feel might happen, I am not saying its definitely going to happen, I just wouldnt be surprised. Muralidhran recently decided not to join his teammates for the Test matches in Darwin and Cairns after coming in for heavy criticism in Australia for his unorthodox action. Warne, who confirmed that he has recovered from a broken hand suffered while playing for Hampshire, also welcomed Cricket Australias decision to recall fellow leg-spinner Stuart MacGill for the two Tests. Hes a quality bowler, hes performed well over the years, he did well up in Darwin and Cairns last year, so if they decided to play two spinners, good, Warne said. I am a bit biased, I always like to see the spin bowlers, the more spin bowlers, the better.  (PTI)  Copyright

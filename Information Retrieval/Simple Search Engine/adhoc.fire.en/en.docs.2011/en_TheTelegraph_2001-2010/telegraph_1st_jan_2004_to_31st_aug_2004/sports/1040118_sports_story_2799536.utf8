The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NFL contest hots up
 - This years battle the toughest, feels JCT coach Sukhwinder  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sukhwinder is the  only coach to have featured in all NFLs  Bhutias return  to form is  a boost for East BengalCalcutta, Jan. 17: The contest is intensifying with each match in the eighth edition of the National Football League (NFL). Never before did so many teams emerge as title-contenders close to the halfway stage of this marathon league where all teams play 22 matches. Dempo SC are leading with 20 points after nine outings, but there is no certainty they will stay ahead at the break to be taken after the 11th round (for the Pre-World Cup camp). Dempos two remaining matches in the first phase are against Churchill Brothers and Salgaocar. Needless to say, Dempo can take nothing for granted. Those who can theoretically edge out Dempo after 11 matches are East Bengal, JCT (both 18 from ten), Mahindra United (16 from ten) and Churchill (17 from nine). For that to happen, the current leaders will have to lose both their remaining matches though. Three-time champions Mohun Bagan (14 points), former champions Salgaocar (16) and runners-up Vasco (12) have no chance of taking over the lead after the first round. They have all completed ten matches and all that they can hope for is a win in the 11th to begin the second phase on a positive note. The competition this season has been the toughest in eight years. Never before did we see four-five teams in the race after so many matches, said JCTs Sukhwinder Singh, the only man to have been associated with the NFL as coach since its inception. Its good that we are getting to see more and more balanced sides. The former India coach refused to admit that the foreign recruits are making the difference. No team can do well if they dont have good balance. Teams where Indian players are combining well with the foreigners to attain this balance are the ones doing well. The first phase so far has also witnessed a fair amount of drama and the arrival of a new star. Both are foreigners and both are connected to city teams. Jose Ramirez Barretos shocking decision to leave Mohun Bagan continues to be the highlight of this NFL. After countless moments of glory on the field, this Brazilian has forced bigger headlines with his off the ball twist this time. On the other hand, East Bengal fans are dreaming big after an unimpressive start following the arrival of Barretos compatriot Cristiano Junior. This striker has already created a record of sorts by scoring in all seven appearances since debut. His scoring prowess, Bhaichung Bhutias return to form, the reserve bench proving to be able and an all-win record at home till date, should encourage the fans. Another factor that may go in East Bengals favour is that they will play just two away matches in the second phase. Having reduced the gap with leaders, Subhas Bhowmicks team must make this advantage count in order to become the first team to defend the NFL title. But its not necessarily an advantage, feels Bhutia. It can be advantage and disadvantage at the same time, to play so many home matches. There is always pressure while playing here as the fans get impatient if we dont score in 15 minutes. In a scale of 100, I would say its 60 advantage and the rest disadvantage, said the India captain.  Copyright

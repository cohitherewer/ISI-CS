The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand a full point ahead of rivals
 - WIJK AAN ZEE MEET - Indian ace in exciting draw with top seed Kramnik  Viswanathan Anand is steadily strengthening his position at the top of the table Wijk aan Zee: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand increased his lead to a full point over nearest rivals with an exciting draw against BrainGames champion and top seed Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the ninth round of the Corus chess tournament. Anand took his tally to an enviable 6.5 points from nine games played so far and was a full point adrift of Grandmasters Michael Adams of England and Peter Leko of Hungary who share the second spot. The Indian stalwart looks set to retain his crown now with just four rounds remaining in this category-19 event. In the next round after the third and final rest day on Wednesday, Anand will take on Michael Adams with black pieces. Kramnik, Loek van Wely of The Netherlands, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and Hungarys Leko were clubbed in a four-way tie for the fourth place on 5 points while Latvian-born Spaniard Alexei Shirov stood sole eighth on 4.5. After three successive victories, the draw against Kramnik was a just result for Anand. The Indian looked like facing an uphill task as Kramnik went for a direct attack against his king but yet again his superior defensive skills came to the rescue. Earlier Anand, black, employed the Najdorf Sicilian and Kramnik opted for the variation that gave him a good position during the world rapid chess a few months back in France. After transposing to a position akin to the Sveshnikov Sicilian, the middle game became wild as Kramnik punted a positional pawn sacrifice that turned out to be fine as the game progressed. With his kingside under firing line, many believed Anand was going to crumble. However, the speedy Gonzales unleashed a brilliant counterattack on Kramniks king with a spectacular rook sacrifice on his 23rd move. Kramnik immediately found that his winning lines did not work at all as his own king became just too vulnerable. Allowing perpetual checks soon after the Russian took the half point on move 26. Anands lead got increased as Adams failed to keep the momentum ticking and went down to local hope Van Wely who played the white side of a Nimzo Indian defence. Adams chose the variation favoured by Anand in his earlier encounter against Van Wely and even as he maintained the dynamic balance in a queenless middle game, Van Wely injected a lot of life after voluntarily weakening his queenside pawns. The Dutch was rewarded for his ambitious approach as Adams lost a pawn on the queen side in the ensuing endgame. Though a lot of technicalities remained, Van Wely played in copybook fashion. Sacrificing an exchange at the right juncture, he swapped all black pawns on the king side and romped home in 98 moves. While the long games have been a regular feature here this year the shortest so far was played by Leko and Peter Svidler. The 14 moves battle from a Sicilian Rossolimo ended in truce quickly. The best game of the day prize went to Shirov who crushed Dutchman Ivan Sokolov in a Ruy Lopez game as white. Uncorking a knight sacrifice as early as on move 16th, Shirov got Sokolovs king under troubles and exactly ten moves later won the queen to carry home the days prize of 250 euros. Veteran Jan Timman of The Netherlands put it across an off-form Evgeny Bareev of Russia while Moldovan Viktor Bologan accounted for Armenian Vladimir Akopian in other decisive games of the day.

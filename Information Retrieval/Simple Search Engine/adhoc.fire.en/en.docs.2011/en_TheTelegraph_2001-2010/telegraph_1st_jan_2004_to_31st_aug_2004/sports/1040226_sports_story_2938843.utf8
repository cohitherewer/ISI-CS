The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer, Kaif fully fit
 Zaheer Khan Mumbai: The Indian cricket board said Wednesday that Zaheer Khan and Mohammed Kaif are fully fit for the tour of Pakistan beginning next month. BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said from Thiruvananthapuram that he has received Kaifs fitness certificate issued by doctor Ananth Joshi on Wednesday, while Zaheer Khan, who is working out at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, is also fit. I have come to know that Zaheer too has recovered from hamstring injury though he has not sent his fitness certificate so far. Kaif, who missed the tri-series in Australia owing to thumb injury, has sent his fitness certificate, Nair said. I am also expecting Anil Kumble, Ajit Agarkar and Ashish Nehra, all sidelined due to injuries, to send their certificates soon, though there is ample time before the selectors meet to pick the squad at Kolkata on March 3, Nair said.

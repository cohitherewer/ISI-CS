The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ clinch a cracker
 - Pollock last-over blitzkrieg in vain as SA lose by five runs Wellington: An injured Shaun Pollock, needing three sixes from the last three balls, hit only two as South Africa lost to New Zealand by five runs in a thrilling third ODI Friday. Batting with a runner after suffering a groin strain, Pollock blasted three sixes among 21 runs in the last over as South Africa nearly scored an improbable victory. The Proteas needed 27 runs from the last over to surpass New Zealands 254 for five in a match shortened to 38 overs per side owing to heavy rain. Pollock got the strike when Ashwell Prince took a single off the first ball and took two runs, then hit a six to leave South Africa needing 18 runs  three sixes  from the last three balls. Such a finish seemed unlikely until Pollock hit each of the next two balls from medium pacer Kyle Mills into the grandstand for sixes, leaving six required from the final ball. Mills gathered his composure to make the last ball of the match a slanting yorker. Pollock, who had stepped away on the leg side to give himself room, could only stab the ball back to the bowler. No runs were scored and New Zealand hung on to win the match by five runs to take a 2-1 lead in the six-match series. Pollock bludgeoned 29 runs from 17 balls and Prince 45 from 38, but South Africa were unable to surpass a New Zealand total which had been inflated by similarly brilliant late-order batting. Brendon McCullum and Scott Styris put on 84 runs in 30 minutes from 7.2 overs at the end of New Zealands innings to propel the home side to a total it only just managed to defend. (AP)  Copyright

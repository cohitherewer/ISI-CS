The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan, Mahindra settle for lacklustre draw
 - National League - Ashim misses the best chance of the day  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sanjay Parte of Mahindra United and Mehtab Hossain of Mohun Bagan in a clinch at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: As if the extreme tedium of sitting through the match wasnt enough, the Mohun Bagan-Mahindra United National Football League (NFL) match Tuesday also failed to produce goals. Team coaches said they were happy with the show, but one believes in between, somewhere, the paying public (even if they were just a handful at the Salt Lake Stadium) does deserve a minimum return for their money. The absurdity dished out Tuesday was not what any fan deserves. With this deadlock, Mahindra moved to 24 points from 15 matches, while Mohun Bagan limped to 19 points from 14 outings. Of the few movements there was this third-minute S. Venkatesh waddle up the left, resulting in a lazy lob to the Mohun Bagan goalmouth. Abhisek Yadav failed to reach on time. The Mohun Bagan ploy  if there was one  seemed too simple; use Mehtab Hossain up the right while Rennedy Singh provides the other prop, as strikers Ashim Biswas and Eduardo Ribeiro were expected to home in. Well, Eduardo, probably didnt know about this plan, and Ashim Biswas looked too unwilling to exert. There was also this acute shortage of passes from the halfline, and though in Leonardo DAlmeida one found a willing soul, the rest of the line looked pretty porous. There was a little more action in the second half and Mohun Bagan managed a few more forays as the Mahindra energy level dropped. In the tenth minute, Biswas made it clear his mind was elsewhere. Hossain ran up the right and sent in another of those regulation, boring lobs to the goalmouth. Only, this time, where wasnt a defender (save goalkeeper Kalyan Chowbey) at the goalmouth. Biswas received, and despite having all the time in the world to control and shoot, he hurried. It was, incredibly enough, off target. That was the action of the day. Except that there was a lot of activity perpendicular to the direction of the goals. Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee said he had no idea why Biswas is off colour, and said he still thought Bagan could be among the top few (though I dont say we will win the League). Mahindra coach David Booth explained that his team played efficiently without scoring, whatever that means. And that a draw was a fair result. One can guess.

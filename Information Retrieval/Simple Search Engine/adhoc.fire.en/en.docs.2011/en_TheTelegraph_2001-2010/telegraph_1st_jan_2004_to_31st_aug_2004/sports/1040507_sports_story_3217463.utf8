The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tatas remain apolitical
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Given that the (undivided) Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) is headquartered in Jamshedpur, its no surprise that election-time finds some candidates indicating they have the blessings of the House of Tatas. Apparently, in the lead-up to Sundays biennial general meeting, lawyer Udit Sarkar  who is challenging president Amitabh Choudhary (IPS)  has claimed the Tatas support. On Thursday, though, former BCA president A.N.Singh clarified that the Tatas remained apolitical. Singh should know  he is a Tata Steel deputy managing director. We arent supporting anybody In fact, the company policy is to steer clear of either backing/opposing a candidate, Singh told The Telegraph, when contacted in Jamshedpur. Incidentally, while Sarkar doesnt seem to have claimed Laloo Prasad Yadavs support, sources have confirmed he certainly has his blessings. Laloo, by the way, has cricket-ambitions too.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its gone, now I can relax, says Murali
Harare, May 8 (AFP): It was mid-afternoon on the third day when Muttiah Muralidharan persuaded Mluleki Nkala to give a catch to Mahela Jasyawardene at forward short leg. Muralidharan took a second wicket with the next ball catching Alester Maregwede off his own bowling with which to begin building a lead over Australian leg spinner Shane Warne, his great rival, who stands on 517. I was thankful it was over, said Muralidharan. I said to myself, its gone, now I can relax. Then off the next ball I got another wicket. I was so anxious that I wasnt putting the ball in the right place. My teammates said to put the ball in the right place and it will come. Eventually it came. Muralidharan praised the help he has received from the team. It was wonderful to get the world record. I was a bit nervous when I was on 519 wickets because wickets were falling, he admitted. I have to thank Chaminda Vaas and Maravan Atapattu for helping me get to the record. Vaas was bowling brilliantly at one end and had he continued the game would have been over. But he told the captain to stop him and give me the bowling to get to that one wicket. It was all a team game. Muralidharan now has the second Test against Zimbabwe, which starts in Bulawayo on Friday, to build on his new tally although Warne will get his chance to surpass the record when Australia tour here later this month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahindra hope to put up a fight
Margao: Mahindra United and Al Wahda of Syria remain wary of each other on the eve of their AFC Cup championship match here Wednesday. Mahindra coach David Booth sounded confident saying he was confident that his team would be able to put up a good fight against the Syrian team. We have been practising hard for a couple of weeks to match our strong opponent. If our team sticks to the strategy adopted by us, I am sure we will collect full points. He, however, added a rider: For us Al Wahda are unknown commodity and we cannot take them lightly. We will be happy if we collect a point since it is a home match. The minor psychological edge that the Mumbai team will be taking to the field will be that they are now leading the three-team group, having beaten Dhoffar (Oman). Mahindras, who are likely to play in the 5-3-2 formation, will start with the two foreigners upfront  Felix Aboagye and Raphael Patron Akakpo. So far that has been the strong point of the team.

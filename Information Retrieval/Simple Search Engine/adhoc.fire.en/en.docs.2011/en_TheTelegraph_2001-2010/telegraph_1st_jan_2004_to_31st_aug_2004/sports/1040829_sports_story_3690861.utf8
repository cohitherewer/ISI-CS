 Rhythmic team gold for Russians
 Rhythmic gymnast Katerina Pisetsky of Israel during qualifying for the individual all-around event in Athens on Friday Athens: Russia underlined their superiority in rhythmic gymnastics by winning the group gold medal with an alluring synchronised performance at the Olympics on Saturday. The defending champions easily outclassed their challengers with their two dramatic routines to earn 51.100, an impressive 1.65 points ahead of second-placed Italy. Performing to the theme tune from the Matrix, the Russian quintet stormed into an early lead with 25.300 points with their twirling ribbon display. Having swapped their black and silver ensembles for hot pink numbers, the Russians produced a routine full of drama and intrigue in the second rotation. With three hoops and two balls, the champions showcased their acrobatic choreography to the music from Kill Bill. The crowd erupted after Italys second routine but their chants of Italia Italia failed to sway the judges and the team ended up taking the silver with 49.450. A theatrical routine to the strains of Bolero helped Bulgaria edge out Belarus for the bronze. The US women took their third consecutive gold medal in Olympic basketball on Saturday, breaking open a close game in the fourth quarter to beat Australia 74-63. The score was tied at 50-50 in the final seconds of the third quarter, but Shannon Johnson sparked an 11-1 run to give the US a lead they never relinquished. Tina Thompson led the Americans with 18 points. Lauren Jackson had an off game, scoring only 12 points after averaging over 24 points in the first seven games of the tournament. Earlier Russia downed Brazil 71-62 to win the bronze medal.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

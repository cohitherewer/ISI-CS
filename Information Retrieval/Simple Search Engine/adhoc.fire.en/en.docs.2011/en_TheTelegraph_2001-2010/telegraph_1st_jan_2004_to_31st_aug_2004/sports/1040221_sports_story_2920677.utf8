 Sasikiran joint fourth
 Sasikiran Moscow: GM Krishnan Sasikiran outclassed GM Alexey Korotylev of Russia and jumped into joint fourth after Round III of the Moscow Open International chess tournament here. Russian GMs Alexander Rustemov, Valerij Filippov and Dutchman Loek van Wely, all of whom won their Round III games, are sitting atop with three points each. Sasikiran, 2.5, shares the fourth spot with top seeded Russian Vladimir Malakhov and 23 other contestants. Among other Indians, International Masters Lanka Ravi and Neelotpal Das, after a rather sedate start, came back firing on all cylinders to down GMs Konstantin Landa of Russia and Bartosz Socko of Poland respectively. Neelotpal and Ravi are on two each and are in contention for GM norms. GM Praveen Thipsay wilted under pressure against GM Alexander Huzman of Israel. The other Indian GM in the fray, Sandipan Chanda played out a fighting draw with Igor Lysyj of Russia. In the Group B open for players under 2450, Tejas Bakre drew his fourth round game to be a full point behind leaders Nikolay Ogloblin of Russia and Beniamin Galstian of Armenia, on four each. Ten players share second spot with 3.5 while Tejasis in joint 13th with 45 others. The other Indians in the fray, I. Dinesh Kumar Sharma, P. Konguvel and S. Kidambi scored easy victories. Meanwhile, Sasikiran, playing white, gradually outplayed Korotylev from his pet Capablanca Variation against the Nimzo Indian Defence. Korotylev was up against a rather harmless looking manoeuvre once out of routine opening but Sasikirans positional advantage kept growing. Korotylov overlooked a simple combination that cost him a pawn and soon after his position fell apart. Sasikiran did not give any chance and picked up one pawn after another before his opponent surrendered on move 43.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mankad set to be top Indian on Tour
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Mankads progress should fetch Davis Cup singles berth Calcutta: Move over Prakash Amritraj, vacate the throne for Harsh Mankad. The son of Test cricketer Ashok Mankad and national champion Nirupama has muscled his way to a world ranking high enough to be crowned Indias No. 1 tennis player. The official coronation will take place next Monday when the ATP entry points list is issued, but numbers dont lie. And the numbers say that Mankad will rise to around a career-high No. 285, while Vijay Amritrajs elder son will drop below 300. Mankad had been enjoying a good run in the Challenger circuit over the past two months. What clinched his remarkable progress to the top-300 was a fabulous upset over American top seed Paul Goldstein at the $50,000 Lexington Challenger on Thursday, according to information received here. Goldstein, currently ranked 151, was in the top-100 in the not-too-distant past. Mankad won 6-4, 7-5 in the pre-quarter final. This was by far the best win of his career. In the first round, he had accounted for American Hamid Mirzadeh 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). A fortnight ago, Mankad had progressed to the last-eight of the Granby Challenger with victories over Amritraj and South African top seed Rik de Voest. Mankads consistency will surely please his Davis Cup captain. While most tennis pundits had dismissed the 24-year-old as the boy-next-door with no big weapon, Leander Paes has always spoken highly of Mankad. His work ethic, willingness to learn and his commitment sets him apart from many others, Paes observed during a recent Davis Cup tie. Despite making his Davis Cup debut four years ago  and playing against the likes of Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick  Mankad hadnt been able to cement his berth as a singles player. Rohan Bopanna and Amritraj had, of late, pipped him on the strength of more firepower. Well, that firepower has so far not taken India back to the Davis Cups elite World Group competition. Now that Mankad has started delivering with pleasing regularity on the Tour, he cant be faulted for taking his India slot for granted. To top his singles status, hes now the highest-ranked doubles player (166) after Mahesh Bhupathi (5) and Leander Paes (29). That should give him added weightage when crunch time comes.  Copyright

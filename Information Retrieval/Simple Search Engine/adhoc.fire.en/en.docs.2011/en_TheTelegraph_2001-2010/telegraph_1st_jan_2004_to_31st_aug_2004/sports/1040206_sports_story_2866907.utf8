 Randhawa breaks into top-100
 Bangalore: Jyoti Randhawa  has become the first Indian golfer to crack the top-100  in world rankings. In the latest rankings released after his second-place finish in the Johnnie Walker Classic, Randhawa moved up to number 98. He joins a host of Japanese professionals and world number 18 K. J. Choi in the top 100, a press release from Globosport, the agency which represents Randhawa, said here on Thursday. I feel my game has really improved over the last year and its great to start 2004 with a bang. It is only just sinking in that I have now broken through a barrier. Now the goal is to emulate Vijay Singh (of Fiji) and Choi and reach the top 20. I am young and my game is still developing ... So I am sure I can do it, Randhawa said.  Randhawa is used to being a trailblazer in Indian  golf. The first-ever Indian to win the Asian PGA order of  merit, Randhawa last year became the first Indian to win  an event on the Japanese PGA tour in his rookie season.  (PTI)  Copyright

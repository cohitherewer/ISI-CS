The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tiger bares claws
 Atwal returned a par first-round card Orlando: Tiger Woods began the drive to win his fifth straight Bay Hill Invitational by shooting a five-under-par 67 Thursday to stand a stroke off the lead after the first round. Britains Darren Clarke, American Chad Campbell and Japans Shigeki Maruyama all shot 66 for the one-stroke lead over Woods, American tour rookie Zach Johnson, Australian Stuart Appleby and another American Jerry Kelly. Orlando-based Calcutta pro Arjun Atwal had yet another slow start, tied at 50th when he returned a par card of 72. The same level card was returned by the likes of Bernhard Langer, Joe Durant and Nick Flanagan. Australians Aaron Baddeley and Adam Scott shot four-under-par 68s and were joined in a tie for eighth by Fijis Vijai Singh along with Americans Brad Faxon, Brian Gay, Scott Verplank, John Daly and Todd Fischer. Playing in his 26th Bay Hill Invitational, host Arnold Palmer shot a 16-over-par 88. Woods was pleased with his round of seven birdies and two bogeys. He stayed near the top of the leaderboard all day and made no critical mistakes. I just played well, Woods said. If you were out there, you would see that I really hit some good shots today. I drove it well and controlled my irons going to the greens. I hit some really good golf shots today. Clarke has had a difficult time making cuts in full-field tournaments since joining the PGA Tour this year. He failed to play on the weekend in three tournaments but finished third in both the restricted-field Mercedes Championships  which had no cut  and the WGC-Match Play Championship. Its just getting used to golf courses, Clarke said. Its easy to keep going back to the same ones in Europe because you get to know them well. I didnt really see myself getting around this one. However, Clarke got around very well in the opening 18 holes.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

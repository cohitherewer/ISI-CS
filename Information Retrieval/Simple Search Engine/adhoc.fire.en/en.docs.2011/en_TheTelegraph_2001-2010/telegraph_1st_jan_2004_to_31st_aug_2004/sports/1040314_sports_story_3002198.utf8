The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ive learnt to live with pressure... I dont have a choice: Sachin
	 - I believe in the Almighty... Whatever is destined, is going to happen  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Karachi: Sourav Ganguly is the captain and Rahul Dravid is regarded as Steve Waughs successor, yet Sachin Tendulkar is the one most sought after in these parts. If one needed confirmation, that came through on Team Indias 747 flight from Lahore on Friday: Dozens of co-passengers headed for seat 24 C, occupied by Sachin, without concerning themselves too much with the other players. In a wonderful gesture, the former captain didnt disappoint anybody. Clearly, he did his bit to further Indo-Pak relations. The other evening, of course, Sachin did his bit to extend a long-standing relationship with The Telegraph  he spoke for around 30 minutes. The following are excerpts Q You were a shy 16-year-old on your first trip to Pakistan and Karachi (1989-90). What were your emotions when you left New Delhi the other day? A Realised were setting out on a big tour... However, just because its Pakistan, doesnt mean weve got to do something different. To produce quality cricket, we will have to stick to the basics. Did you, at any time, feel you were too young for the premier league? Oh, no... Not for a moment. Were you nervous  or, even scared? If anything, I was very excited... Very thrilled... I couldnt wait for my first India cap. Do you recall packing anything in particular? (Laughs) Cant think of something off-hand... Those days, it was (brother) Ajit who helped with the packing. He would draw up a list and keep ticking as the items were put away. Ive begun to do much the same myself... Now, it comes naturally. Apart from being hit by Waqar Younis in the Sialkot Test, an injury that made a man out of you, is there something about that first trip which you recall off-the-cuff? The limited overs match in Peshawar, where I tore into Abdul Qadir... I took some sixes off him and, even though it wasnt an official game (because of interference from the elements), that knock gave plenty of confidence. Is it true that Qadir challenged you? He said I should pick on him instead of going for young Mushtaq Ahmed. He probably asked whether I had the guts... So... How did your first day in Test cricket (at the National Stadium) go? We fielded and, by stumps, I was dead tired. If I remember correctly, I went off to sleep as soon as we got back to the hotel... Of course, I did wake up after a few hours for a light dinner. The exchanges havent been regular, but how do you regard Pakistan as an opposition? Tough... Theyve always had some world class players... I expect the next five weeks to be exciting. Theres been so much talk of pressure... Theres also been a suggestion that Pakistan will be weighed down more. Do you agree? But cricket wont get any easy (for India). I dont expect very many to back us but, if things arent going well for Pakistan, the crowd could turn against the home team. For Pakistan, that will then be real pressure. Your achievements are well documented, but how do you personally look back on over 14 years of international cricket? As anybody else, Ive changed and changed for the better... Ive grown as a person and a cricketer... Obviously, the responsibilities have grown as well and Ive learnt to cope. (After a pause) I must add that support from the family has made things so much easier... Has allowed me to focus exclusively on cricket. In fact, the family has made sacrifices to enable me to become the person and cricketer I am. Do you accept that there have been periods of high pressure, like in Australia recently, till that career-best 241 not out in the Sydney Test? Pressure is always there... Its there when I score; its there when I dont. When I score, people want more and, when I dont get runs, people want me to get them. Ive learnt to live with pressure... I dont have a choice... Having said that, expectations keep growing every second and, so, the individual must be clear about what he himself wants to achieve... For example, only I know best what I can achieve... Actually, Im a bit nervous even before a charity match... That nervousness has become part of my system. Thats an unusual confession... Well, its the truth. Today, what are your thoughts on that Sydney knock? Will always remain special... Things hadnt been going my way, but I was determined. ... I planned the innings, consciously cutting out some shots... I definitely played a tighter game and, looking back, the shot-selection pleases me. That effort was built around discipline and I proved to myself that I could change my style and still deliver. Is that your best Test innings? No. 1 is the 114 I got in Perth, during the 1991-92 tour. How should youngsters handle pressure? By concentrating on cricket and not getting distracted or influenced by things which shouldnt concern them. The basics of cricket wont ever change, though matters around the game could. Generally, enjoyment must be given priority... With enjoyment will come a free mind. Have you a goal for the ODIs and Tests in Pakistan? Not in terms of X number of runs. The other day, what prompted you to say that fans at home must be prepared for both the good days and bad? Because the players can give hundred per cent, nothing more. If, even after that, the result isnt favourable then the players cant be faulted. Basically, fans shouldnt go over the top emotionally. The players mind will be free if a mistake is accepted as one and not given a twist. Talking of myself, I believe in the Almighty... Whatever is destined, is going to happen. Finally, what brings you the most joy? (Grins) A happy dressing room... A jovial dressing room.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sharapova needs to show the way 
	 - A shore away from injuries, early burnouts and over-eager parents  BY CLIVE WHITE  Its the biggest challenge for Sharapova today Like the ecstatic Yuri Sharapov, after his daughters stunning Wimbledon victory over Serena Williams, the tennis world does not want to let go of the 17-year-old Russian sensation just yet. After all, Maria Sharapova could be the saviour of womens tennis. The trouble is, the womens game doesnt have a particularly good record when it comes to longevity among its child stars. From Tracy Austin through to Martina Hingis, the womens game is littered with prodigious talent that never reached maturity, in many cases barely made it out of the teens. The fact girls mature physically much faster than boys, means they arrive on the scene that much sooner, of course, but that doesnt totally explain the alarming number of casualties, of one description or another, down the years. Austin was one of the first to suffer from burnout, retiring, to all intents, before she was 20 from a back injury. Hingis, the youngest Slam winner in the open era at 16 years and four months, retired at 21 from ankle injuries (injuries complicated no doubt by the arrival of the indomitable Williams sisters) while Andrea Jaeger was as good as gone by 19 because of a shoulder injury. Jennifer Capriati went off the rails at 18 after being arrested for shoplifting and drugs offences and was lost to the game for the best part of five years. And the Canadian prodigy Carling Bassett never recovered from the death of her father when she was 18. Some father-daughter relationships in tennis, however, have not run smoothly and indeed have been at the crux of many of the problems facing young players. Yuri Sharapov may have come close to suffocating his daughter during that lengthy embrace on Centre Court, but at least his enthusiasm is much less strident than some, like the father of Croatian Jelena Dokic who is banned from Wimbledon. Gone, at least, this year were the cries of Buena, baby which used to punctuate just about every winning forehand or backhand that was struck by Yuris offspring at last years Championships. Fathers are so protective that it becomes more about the career than the child, said Jaeger, whose own father was also her coach.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

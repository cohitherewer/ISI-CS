The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hingis, Dokic feel Williams are history
 Hingis says a comeback isnt easy, as Venus is finding out London: Theres a whisper going round the tennis circuit  the Williams sisters are history, their domination of the womens Tour is a thing of the past. Some merely suspect it, some speak about it quietly. Others, like Martina Hingis and Jelena Dokic, blurt it out as fact. It seems, however, that nobody has bothered to tell Serena and Venus. The sisters return as a double-act at the $3 million NASDAQ-100 Open next week for the first time since Wimbledon 2003. It is an eagerly-awaited comeback. Injuries sidelined both players following that grasscourt Grand Slam where Serena beat Venus in the final. Their absence precipitated a new order in the womens game. Belgians Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters stole the No. 1 ranking, Grand Slam titles and the sisters thunder. How the Americans will now deal with that Belgian assault is a topic keeping the womens circuit rapt. Nine months away from tennis has made Serena ravenous for court-time and success. I found out my true love is tennis, she said this week. Ive been feeling the hunger for quite some time. Sadly Serena will not have the chance to challenge world No. 1 Henin-Hardenne head-on in Miami. The Belgian has elected not to play, preferring to concentrate on her claycourt preparations ahead of the defence of her French Open crown in May. Serenas elder sister Venus  also a former No. 1  has played just three tournaments since the Wimbledon final and has disappointed on each occasion. Next weeks tournament will give the best indication yet whether or not she is capable of returning to the pinnacle of the sport. The comfort of having her sister at her side will act as a boost to the four-time Grand Slam champion and Serenas return could be the catalyst Venus needs to re-enter the winners circle. Hingis certainly believes Venus needs Serena around to compete at her best. What makes them strong is if theyre together, Hingis said recently. But for one alone its difficult. Dokic agrees with Hingis downbeat assessment. Serena dominated for a year, year-and-a-half and now shes been gone almost a year, the Yugoslav said. Even while she was number one, she was injured a lot of the time. And Venus hasnt done that well. That story is over. Justine and Kim are the ones who are winning everything now.

 Justin Langer ready to face Muralidharan
Melbourne: Australian Test opener Justin Langer says he now feels better prepared to handle Muttiah Muralidharan than before. He said while Muralidharan was still the most difficult bowler to face in world cricket, his own game  with an emphasis on a solid defence and good footwork against spinners  will serve him well. Ive had a great season basically, so I cant wait to get there, Langer said on Sunday. Im a different player now than I was four years ago when I toured Sri Lanka. The diminutive left-handed opener scored just 51 runs in four innings at number three in the batting order. At that stage I was still finding my feet, Id only had a bit in Test cricket. But now I feel really comfortable with my game, Ive been batting well all summer for Western Australia and Australia, so Im looking forward to it. Langer, who scored 1,027 first-class runs at 48.90 in the Australian summer, and captain Ricky Ponting are the only two batsmen still in the side from four years ago. In 1999, Langer was the only left-hander in the top seven with Michael Slater, Greg Blewett, Mark and Steve Waugh, Ponting and Ian Healy all being right-handed. This time, though, there could be up to five left-handers in the top seven  Langer and opening partner Matthew Hayden, Darren Lehmann, Simon Katich and Adam Gilchrist  with Damien Martyn the only right-hander. Left-handers have often had success against Murali because they can either leave his stock off-spinner or pad away a ball pitching outside leg-stump without fear of a leg-before appeal. But Langer rates the Sri Lankan star the best of all the bowlers. Ive always found him to be hardest bowler Ive ever faced, no denying that fact, he said. But theres been left-handers who have had good success against him as well. Brian Lara has success against anybody and Stephen Fleming. So whether its an advantage or not who knows, Ill tell you in a months time.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Burman academy kick-off on June 20
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Former Bengal fast bowler and current state under-17 coach Barun Burman is launching an academy near the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium complex. The Barun Burman Cricket Academy will be inaugurated on June 20, it was announced at a press conference on Sunday. While Burman will be the chief coach, Pradip Pandey and Sourav Bose will be the batting and wicketkeeping coaches. The academy is yet to attract a sponsor. Burman, who has been a coach at the zonal cricket academy for two seasons, has decided to pay special attention to fast bowling and wicketkeeping. A Level I coach, Burman has looked after the state under-17 and under-19 teams in recent years. He has also been a bowling consultant at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. Burman also played an unofficial Test  against Sri Lanka in Nagpur in 1975-76. I have seen many players in Bengal  who have the potential of making it big  finish early due to lack of guidance, said Burman.  Copyright

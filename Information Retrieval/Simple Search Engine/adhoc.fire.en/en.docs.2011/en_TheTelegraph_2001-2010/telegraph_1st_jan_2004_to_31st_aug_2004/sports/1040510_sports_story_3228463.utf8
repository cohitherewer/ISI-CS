Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona has left hospital and entered a drugs rehabilitation centre in west Buenos Aires, Argentine television reported on Sunday. The 43-year-old checked into the Del Parque private clinic in Castelar. He left the Suizo-Argentina hospital by ambulance where he has been admitted twice since April 18, suffering from heart and lung problems. A hospital statement said:  Maradona has recovered from his health emergency and has been transferred to a centre where he will receive specialised treatment.  Though his family members did not disclose the destination, television pictures showed the ambulance entering the private clinic. (AFP)  Copyright

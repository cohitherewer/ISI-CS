The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe crash to sixth defeat
Melbourne: Australia cruised to a 13-run victory over Zimbabwe in a tri-series match at the Adelaide Oval on Monday. Zimbabwe opener Grant Flower, who made 94, was the only major stumbling block for the world champions who posted 279 for seven in their 50 overs thanks to half-centuries from Michael Bevan and captain Ricky Ponting.

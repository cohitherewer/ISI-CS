The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We hold SA in esteem: BCCI 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Monday there was no truth in the allegation that the Indian board was giving less importance to the South African tour in comparison with the Australian tour. This had been claimed in an agency report from Durban, where UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola hinted at taking the itinerary matter to the ICC. Dalmiya said this was the result of a misunderstanding. It is far from the truth, he added. We hold South African cricket in high esteem. But it would be undesirable to curtail four Tests against Australia because this arrangement was agreed upon with Cricket Australia two years ago. He said the BCCI was also exploring possibilities of more cricket in India as part of its platinum jubilee celebrations and this was why it was approaching various nations. But approaching these countries certainly does not mean giving preference to one country over another. It is also not true that the BCCI will enter into new agreements at the cost of existing agreements. The problem vis--vis South Africa, felt Dalmiya, is not one that cannot be resolved. I will be meeting UCBSA president Raymond Mali during an ICC meeting in Dubai on Wednesday and Thursday. We will then discuss all matters, including the question of the matter supposedly being referred to the ICC. It has always been a practice between the BCCI and the UCBSA since South Africas re-entry into international cricket to have reciprocal number of matches during the exchange of bilateral tours, said Dalmiya. When India toured South Africa last there were three Tests and a triangular series. On that basis here there should be three Tests and at least five ODIs when South Africa come here. But we are having to squeeze a two-month schedule into a one-month package hence the suggestion of only ODIs.  Copyright

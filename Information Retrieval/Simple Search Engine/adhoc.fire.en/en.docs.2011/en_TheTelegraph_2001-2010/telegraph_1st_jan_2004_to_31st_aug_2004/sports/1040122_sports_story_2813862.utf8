 Mahesh, Max battle into Round 2 
New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi overcame an erratic performance to advance to Round 2 of mens doubles at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Wednesday. According to information received here, the second-seeded Bhupathi and Mirnyi needed an hour and 40 minutes to prevail over Devin Bowen (US) and Ashley Fisher (Australia) 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Asian wild cards Prakash Amritraj and Hyung-Taik Lee of Korea retired from their first-round match against Wayne Ferreira and Rick Leach. The South Africa-US duo had clinched the first set in a tight tie-breaker. In mixed doubles, reigning champions Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova have been seeded No. 4. Bhupathi and Russian Elena Likhovtseva are the second seeds, behind Mark Knowles (Bahamas) and Virginia Ruano Pascual (Spain). Bhupathi and Mirnyi were up 4-2 in the first set before the Indians serve came under pressure in the ninth game. They saved three break-points to bag the set after seeing through six deuces. Bowen and Fisher broke Mirnyi to take a 3-0 lead in the second set and had two more break-points with Bhupathi serving at 15-40 in the fifth game. The seven-time Grand Slam champion survived both those and then broke Bowen to get back into the match. Just when it seemed they had regained the momentum, Mirnyi dropped serve in the 10th game to lose the set. The Indo-Belarussian pair broke Bowen again in the third set, wasted five more break-points before cracking the rivals in the ninth to seal the issue. (PTI)  Copyright

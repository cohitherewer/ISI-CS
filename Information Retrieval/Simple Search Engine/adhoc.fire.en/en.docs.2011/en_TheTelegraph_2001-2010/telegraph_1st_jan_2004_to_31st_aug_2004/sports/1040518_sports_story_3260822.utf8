 Winners to take it all
New Delhi, May 17 (PTI): It will be a case of winners taking it all at the ICC Champions Trophy 2004 to be held in England in September. The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday said while the winners will pocket a prize money of $525,000, the runners-up would have to be satisfied with what they receive for their semi-final effort and no more incentive for reaching the final. The runners-up will not gain anything (extra), ICC president Ehsan Mani said, while announcing the launch of the 12-national event via a tele-conference on Monday. The total prize money for the biennial extravaganza will be $1.15 million. The group stage winners will earn $50,000, while the semi-finalists stand to gain $125,000. Fleming confident New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming is relishing an early meeting with Australia in this years ICC Champions Trophy in England. New Zealand, who won the trophy in 2000, world champions Australia and the USA make up one of the four groups for the September tournament. We look forward to it, because youve got to beat them or meet them at some stage if youre going to win either the competition or the league, Fleming said at Lords on Monday. Early on is often a good time. But we know we have to play well. Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes his team has a great incentive to win the one major title to elude them. Its one trophy we havent been able to get our hands on and we havent played anything like our best cricket in past events, he said. Its the second-biggest one-day tournament we play and I know a lot of the players are keen to make sure we play well in England this time around, Ponting said.  Copyright

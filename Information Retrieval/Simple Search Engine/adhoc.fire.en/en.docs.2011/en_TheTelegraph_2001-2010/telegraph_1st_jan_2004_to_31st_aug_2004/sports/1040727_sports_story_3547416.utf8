 Sasikiran shares top spot 
 Sasikiran earned a brilliant win over Pelletier Biel: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran scored a brilliant victory over local hope Yannick Pelletier and joined top-seed GM Alexander Morozevich of Russia at the top of the tables after the sixth round in the Biel International chess festival here. Sasikiran and Morozevich are now on four points each and former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine follows the leaders just half-a-point behind. Etienne Bacrot of France and Pelletier remained on 2.5, losing their games while Luke McShane crawled to 1.5 after a hard-earned draw with Morozevich. Four more rounds remain in this category 18 event being played on a double round-robin basis between six Grandmasters. I got a good bind in the middle game. The initiative passed on after he allowed me the central thrust and the advantage soon became significant, Sasikiran said after the game. In the exchange spree that followed Sasikiran quickly exchanged his pieces. After the dust settled, Pelletier was certainly not pleased to end up a piece less and resigned after 27 moves. In the masters section, P. Magesh Chandran lost to Alexander Riazantsev of Russia in the sixth round and will have to score extremely well in the remaining five games if he has to be in contention for his second GM norm. Former national champion P. Konguvel drew with Ciric Dragoljub of Serbia while R. R. Vasudevan continued with his impressive run to hold GM Thomas Pahtz of Germany. National sub junior champion Parimarjan Negi defeated Stephe Fairbairn of Canada. Grandmaster Christian Bauer of France emerged as the sole leader in this section with 5.5 points after beating GM Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine. GM Boris Avrukh of Israel and GM Andrei Shariyazdanov of Russia share the second spot with 5 points apiece.  (PTI)  Copyright

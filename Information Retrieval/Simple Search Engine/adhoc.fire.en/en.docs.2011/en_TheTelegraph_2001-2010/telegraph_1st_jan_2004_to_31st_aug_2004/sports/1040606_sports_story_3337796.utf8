 Umpires ask BCCI for academy
 Dalmiya tells umpires to shape up and be at nets Mumbai, June 5 (PTI): The five zonal representatives of the national umpires fraternity proposed for a national academy for umpires to the cricket board on Saturday. The BCCI, on its part, has asked the umpires to shape up, following a spate of complaints from Ranji Trophy captains and coaches during the one-day conclave on Friday, while proposing to arm the umpires with powers to call bowlers for chucking as a remedial measure in domestic cricket. The board president Jagmohan Dalmiya made it clear to the umpires that there has been no tangible effort to improve the umpiring standards. Just like cricketers improve by constant practice, at nets and by playing matches, the umpires should also stand and officiate during net sessions to see where they go wrong, Dalmiya said. The board said that measures like workshops at the zonal level are the need of the hour to improve the standard of umpiring throughout the country. The BCCI also proposed during the interactive session to arm match referees with more powers to help the umpires perform better. Dalmiya said: BCCI intends to be more selective about referees who would be given more powers. Theres no place for chucking at any level. Umpires have to take an active role (in weeding out chucking). We want to cure chuckers and not consider them as culprits. Umpires have been told to act boldly and freely in this matter to see that Indian cricket is on the right track, he said. The five umpires representatives were A. V. Jayaprakash, K. Hariharan, B. A. Jamula, S. Pathak and S. Asnani. Also present were BCCI umpires committee chairman Ranbir Singh, secretary S. K. Nair and joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty. Jayaprakash said that the suggestion to start an academy for umpires on the lines of the NCA in Bangalore came from their side and was well received by the BCCI.  Copyright

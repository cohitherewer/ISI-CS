 Yuvraj gets ready for opening gambit
 Yuvraj Singh in Bangalore on Monday. (AFP) Bangalore: Yuvraj Singh is getting excited by the prospect of opening the batting for India in Test matches. With Sourav Ganguly making it clear that Yuvraj is one of the options, the Punjab left-hander said he is getting ready for the challenge. Theres going to be a change in the batting order, and I have to go up the order. I am going to prepare for it, I will practise with the new ball. Its a different challenge, he said on Monday. Yuvraj made his ODI debut in 2000 but had to wait till October 2003 for his maiden Test cap. He has done a good job in the middle-order so far, including a century against Pakistan in Lahore. But he knows that facing the new ball in Tests will be a different proposition. I think its an advantage because if one sees through the new ball, one can get big scores. I am looking forward to the challenge, said Yuvraj, who has played four Tests. Yuvraj has usually done well while facing challenges in his career. His ODI debut was against Australia in the ICC KnockOut meet in Kenya, and the left-hander responded with a match-winning knock of 80-plus. Its not going to be much of a change in style. Its just to see off the new ball and then play your shots. I think there is going to be a change in mindset. Yuvraj has already started opening in first class matches and didnt do badly in Ranji Trophy matches last season. He is waiting to form an exciting pair at the top of the order in the national team. Yuvraj admitted he will be in good company if he does make the Test XI as opener. Virender Sehwag has set a very good example. He has done tremendously as opener. If I do the same and be as successful as him, it would be good for the team, he said. Asked whether he will return to the middle-order if he did not succeed in the new role, Yuvraj said: When you play cricket at the international level, you dont think about ifs and donts. Whatever the situation, you have to go through it, and be positive. Yuvraj praised the senior players for reducing the pressure on youngsters. They make us feel very good, and dont put much of pressure on us. We gel together very nicely, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

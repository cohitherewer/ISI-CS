		 Monday, February 16, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Antwerp: A knee injury has forced defending champion Venus Williams to pull out of the Antwerp Diamond Games event which starts on Monday.				 																																	Venus aggravated her knee during (last months) Australian Open... she re-aggravated her knee at last weeks Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, said a statement on the Antwerp tournaments website on Sunday.				 																																	The withdrawal of third seed Williams means she must wait for the chance to win an outright gold and diamond racket worth a million euros ($1.28 million).				 																																	The former world number one triumphed in Antwerp in 2002 and 2003 and WTA tournament rules say a player can keep the racket forever if she wins the trophy three times in five years.				 																																	San Jose: Third seed Mardy Fish claimed one of the biggest wins of his career on Saturday when he beat an angry Andre Agassi 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 for a place in the final of the San Jose Open.				 																																	Fish will meet Andy Roddick, who downed Robert Kendrick 7-6, 6-2. After winning the first set, Agassi lost control of the game with some wayward serving. The five times champion completely fell apart on the third set and was broken twice as he littered the court with errors. Its one of the biggest wins Ive had, if not the biggest, Fish said. Upset with his serving and some questionable line calls, Agassi appeared to mock Fishs fist pumping celebrations in the final game of the second set. It fired me up, said Fish, who blasted 29 aces.				 																																	Melbourne: A golfer born in Adelaide as a man will create a world first by playing in the womens Australian Open next month, the Sunday Herald Sun newspaper reported in Melbourne.				 																																	Mianne Bagger had sex-change surgery in 1995 after a lifetime of feeling something wasnt quite right, the newspaper said. It is a world first, there has never been a transsexual playing in a womens tournament before, Bagger, 37, was quoted as saying.				 																																	Its a dream for me, Ive been playing golf since I was eight but I turned professional only in August last year. So, its been a long time coming.				 																																	London: England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has included Leeds United striker Alan Smith in his squad for Englands friendly against Portugal in Loule this week.				 																																	Smith was controversially sent home from the squad for Englands last friendly international against Denmark in November just hours after being called up. The about-turn came in the wake of his arrest for an alleged bottle-throwing incident during a League Cup match in October.				 																																	On Saturday, Eriksson left Steven Gerrard out of his squad because the Liverpool midfielders girlfriend is about to give birth to their first child.				 																																	Tel Aviv: An Israeli fan was seriously injured by a firecracker before Saturdays Tel Aviv derby match between Maccabi and Hapoel, a police official said. He is in hospital and his condition is critical, police spokeswoman Shlomit Holtzberg said.				 																																	A spokeswoman for Tel Avivs Ichilov Hospital told reporters the fan had undergone an operation for serious head injuries. The supporter, thought to be a male Hapoel fan, was injured by the explosive device before the premier league match. Maccabi won the high-profile clash 3-0.				 																																	Melbourne: Barry Sheenes widow Stephanie will wave the chequered flag when the winner crosses the finish line at the season-opening Australian Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne next month. 				 																																	Briton Sheene, the twice world 500cc motorcycling champion died on March 10 last year, the day after the Australian F1 race. Sheene was 52 and had fought a battle with cancer.

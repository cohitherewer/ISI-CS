The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tearful Baggio bows out
Genoa: He will always be remembered for missing the penalty that cost Italy the 1994 World Cup final, but the Azzurri fans showed just how much they will miss Roberto Baggio. Called up for the first time in five years by coach Giovanni Trapattoni as a gesture of goodwill, Baggio brought down the curtain on his international career here on Wednesday in a 1-1 draw against Spain. What was supposed to be a warm-up for Euro 2004 turned into the Baggio show as the 37-year-old striker made his 56th and final appearance in an Italy shirt. Spain went in front eight minutes after half-time thanks to Fernando Torres angled right-footed drive, before Christian Vieris close range header levelled the scores three minutes later. Baggio showed some delightful touches and came within inches of grabbing the winner, proving to his adoring public that he can still cut it at the highest level. The former Fiorentina and Juventus star, who scored 27 times for his country, was understandably emotional after milking the applause at the Luigi Ferraris stadium. For me it was a great pleasure to play in this match and I am grateful for the affection everybody has shown me, not only tonight but in every game Ive played, he said. The fans have been a huge help in making this goodbye less painful and they will always be close to my heart. It was an unforgettable day. Meanwhile, Trapattoni confirmed he would not be taking Baggio to Portugal, despite pressure from the press and public to take a chance on the injury-prone veteran. Ive made it clear to Roby and he understands perfectly well, Trapattoni said. We have Totti, Cassano, Del Piero. After Robertos performance nothing has changed  theres no future (for him). Nicknamed The Divine Ponytail, Baggio was given a standing ovation when he was substituted four minutes from the end.  (AFP)  Copyright

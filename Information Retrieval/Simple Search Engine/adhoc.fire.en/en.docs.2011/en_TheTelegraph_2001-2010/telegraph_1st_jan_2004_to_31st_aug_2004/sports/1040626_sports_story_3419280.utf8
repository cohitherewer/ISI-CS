 Lua Lua back in squad
Kinshasa: Striker Lomana Lua Lua has been recalled to the Democratic Republic of Congo squad for a World Cup qualifier next month following a three-match ban. The side plays the Cape Verde Islands away in Praia on July 3 in Africa Zone group II. Lua Lua, who has been playing with Portsmouth in the English Premier League, was banned for lashing out at an opponent after being sent off against Tunisia at the African Nations Cup in January.

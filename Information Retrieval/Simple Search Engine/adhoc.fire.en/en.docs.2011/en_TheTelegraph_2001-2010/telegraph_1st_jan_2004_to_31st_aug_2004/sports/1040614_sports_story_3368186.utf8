 Pybus wants no govt role in PCB
Karachi: Former Pakistan coach Richard Pybus wants the governments involvement in Pakistan cricket to be finished. I believe the greatest challenge for Pakistan cricket is to separate the cricket board from the government, every time there is a change in government or government administration there is a change in the key administrators at cricket board level. Pakistans President is the patron of the cricket board and nominates the cricket chief. Speaking from South Africa, Pybus, who had three tenures as Pakistan coach between 1999-2003, also urged use of technology to groom talent saying India and Sri Lanka have shown Asian cricket the way and Pakistan must follow suit. The basics of cricket stay the same, but science can improve preparation and training of players and the Indians and Sri Lankans have shown Asian cricket the way forward, Pybus said. The Indian set up is a reflection of this, what they dont have in coaching and sports science staff they outsourced, it seems to have bypassed a lot of the amateur attitudes that drag performance down. Pybus said Pakistans transition has been on the track despite defeat against India two months ago. The only real hiccup in the rebuilding phase has been the series against India, but this disappointment has to be tempered with the knowledge that India are a superior side, he pointed out. Anti-corruption official The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has said it will appoint its own manager for security and anti-corruption to control, adds another report. The security and anti-corruption manager will liaise with officials of the Anti-Corruption and Unit (ACU) of the ICC as per requirement, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said. It will allow us to control the game in a transparent manner, he added. A retired and qualified intelligence armed forces or police officer will be preferred.  (AFP)  Copyright

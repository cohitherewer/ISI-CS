 PCB may let off Shoaib with reprimand
 Shoaib has been given a last chance to change his attitude Islamabad: The controversy surrounding fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars injury may come to an end in the coming days with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Rameez Raja admitting that the fast bowler is carrying an injury. The latest indications came following Wednesdays reported peace deal between Shoaib and PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan which said the Rawalpindi Express may be let off with a mild reprimand or warning. There is no doubt that he (Shoaib) is carrying an injury. But the medical commission has given its report to the chairman after studying video-tapes of the players including Shoaibs batting and bowling. They also spoke to related people on the issue. They have their views on how old the injuries are, Raja was quoted as saying by local daily The News, suggesting that Shoaibs injuries could have been sustained much before the third and deciding Test against India last month. Raja said the PCB was not upset at the team losing the series to India but it could not accept the lack of effort shown by many of them in the Rawalpindi Test. We are not denying his (Shoaibs) stature as a match winner. We are not questioning his cricketing skills. But one thing we want to make very clear to our players that while we can accept victory and defeat as part and parcel of the game, the sort of attitude and lack of effort shown on part of many of them during the final Test will not be tolerated by us or the cricket loving people of this country, he said. The PCB also acknowledged that the medical inquiry commission had submitted its report on Wednesday on Shoaib and four other players  Shabbir Ahmad, Umar Gul, Moin Khan and Abdul Razzaq. But the report was not made public so far. However, the bone scan report on Shoaib leaked to the media said he has a stress fracture on one of his ribs. The fast bowler had earlier planned to address a press conference and later approach Supreme Court against the PCB for defaming him. But after Wednesdays meeting with Khan at Lahore he declined to speak to the media. He, however, admitted that he was asked to remain silent by the board. Raja said Shoaib was given the message that this was the last chance for him to change his attitude because the captain was the sole authority in the team and every right to feel dejected if his senior players didnt show the required passion and purpose in their game. We could have settled for batting on more placid pitches against India and gone for draws. But we relied on our strength which is our fast bowling and it was disappointing for all of us the way they didnt come through on responsive pitches, he said. Raja said the board was obviously concerned if Shoaib was carrying such an old injury or if other players were getting injured regularly. We can understand Shoaib being concerned because he has a contract with English county Durham about which he has not spoken to us as yet, he said. Raja said the medical commission was formed basically to remove any ambiguities about the injuries suffered by our players in the series. The mandate given to the four-member commission was to look into the injuries including that of Shoaib and give a report outlining the reasons for them and suggest preventive steps. The idea was to get to the core issue and rectify the situation for future matches. Raja also said that he has not yet had discussions with Khan on the issue of Shoaib after their meeting but at the same time he believed that the chairman is not happy with the attitude of the fast bowler and some other players.

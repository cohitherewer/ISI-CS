The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sprinkling of stars for show
	 - Big teams sans big names in soccer  Cristiano Ronaldo will be one of the top attractions London: Following on from Euro 2004, the Copa America and the Asian Cup, the Olympic soccer tournament in Athens may struggle to make headlines. An overkill of the beautiful game in the last two months is only the start of Olympic soccers problems, but as in previous Games the standard of play and the excitement the tournament generates could pleasantly surprise. An age limit of 23 naturally means many of the worlds top footballers will not be in Athens, even if they wanted to be, although three over-age players are permitted in each squad. However, some of world soccers bright young things will be appearing, much to the annoyance of their club bosses with European league campaigns starting up as the flame flickers in Athens. Manchester Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo, 19, was instrumental in Portugals run to the Euro 2004 final and, just over a month later, he will turn out for their Olympic team in Athens. He could miss the first two weeks of the English Premier League season, not to mention Champions League qualifiers, if Portugal reach the final after facing Iraq, Morocco and Costa Rica in the early stages. United manager Alex Ferguson was further angered when new signing Gabriel Heinze was named in Argentinas impressive Olympic squad, despite appearing for the South Americans in their Copa America final defeat by Brazil on July 25. Argentina, boosted by the inclusion of Barcelona striker Javier Saviola and 31-year-old Valencia defender Roberto Ayala, are in Group C alongside Serbia-Montenegro, Tunisia and Australia, whose team selection has also caused controversy. Glasgow Rangers defender Craig Moore was stripped of the captaincy and put on the transfer list after manager Alex McLeish reacted furiously to his wish to play in the Olympics. AC Milan playmaker Andrea Pirlo and Parmas exciting young striker Alberto Gilardino will feature in a strong Italy side, who compete with Paraguay, Japan and Ghana in Group B. The 16-team tournament will lack the sparkle of Brazil and holders Cameroon, who both failed to qualify, but includes hosts Greece, fresh from their shock Euro 2004 win. The euphoria that victory generated will add extra spice even if the Greek team which plays South Korea, Mali and Mexico in the first round contains only one member of the squad that lifted the European Championship trophy. The Olympic movement has always felt uncomfortable including professional soccer in its ranks. Full-time footballers were allowed to participate for the first time only in 1984. The addition of womens soccer at the Atlanta Games, however, helped to restore some credibility to the amateur ethos. (Reuters)  Copyright

 I am yet to peak, feels Anju
 Anju Bobby GeorgeBangalore, May 18 (PTI): Anju Bobby George, who bagged her first Grand Prix gold medal in Doha last week, said she was yet to peak and was still struggling to find her rhythm after a six-month training schedule. I found it a bit difficult to get the right rhythm because I took part in international competitions after six months of training here. I am yet to peak, Anju said on Tuesday. Anju expressed confidence that she has it in her to go past the 7m mark. She will now gear up to take part in international meets in the Netherlands, the USA, the Czech Republic and Great Britain as part of the Olympic preparations. These four events are either Grand Prix or Super Grand Prix events, and her husband and coach Bobby George said the competition would be tougher. Back in Bangalore on Sunday night, Anju has already resumed her rigorous training. Bobby George said Anju will undertake a final 25-day training at the Olympic Games Village in Athens from August 1.

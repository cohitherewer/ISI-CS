The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav prefers shorter tourneys
 Sourav Ganguly at a press conference in Perth on Saturday Perth, Jan. 31 (PTI): As the gruelling tour Down Under draws to a close, India captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday suggested shortening the itinerary of future annual triangular tournaments in Australia. Certain countries have their own systems and customs and thats the way it has been in Australia. But its been a pretty long tour, Sourav said, on the eve of Indias penultimate league match against the hosts Sunday. He said the three teams would have played more matches than one did during the same time span at the World Cup. We played 11 games in the World Cup in that span of time when we qualified for the finals. Perhaps a thought can be given (to shortening the itinerary). Three games each against the two teams and three finals would be nice. It would be fair especially when you have a four-Test series, Sourav said. Sourav added the present tour has already been the most satisfying one for his team, but they must win the series if it was to stay that way. I thought the tour to England in 2002 was pretty satisfying since we lost only a Test and a one-day game. The World Cup was a very successful one but to do it against Australia in Australia  its got to be the best so far. But its a difficult place in the world for the number twos. No matter how good you play. Im not thinking about home and I hope the rest (of the team) doesnt. We are just a week and four matches away. We have had a great tour and we want to finish it off well. Sourav said the present tour and the whole of last year would go down as a defining period in the history of Indian cricket. We were always unbeatable at home. But the way we have played our cricket overseas in the last one year makes it a defining moment for Indian cricket. We definitely have the nucleus which should be around for the next four-six years. If we keep ourselves fit, if we keep on improving, we will be a very, very good side, Sourav said.  Copyright

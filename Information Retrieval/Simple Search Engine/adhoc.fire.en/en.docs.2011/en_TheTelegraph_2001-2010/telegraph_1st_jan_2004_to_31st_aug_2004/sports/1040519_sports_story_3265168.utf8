The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ten from Bengal to get pension cheques
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, May 18: Friday will be a watershed day for the BCCI, vis--vis its welfare schemes for ex-cricketers and umpires. On that day, in 13 centres around the country, the BCCI will inaugurate its Platinum Pension Scheme in which it will hand over the first months pension cheques to retired Test cricketers and umpires. There will be six cricketers and four umpires from Bengal who will receive this pension cheque. The ex-cricketers are Arun Lal, Ashok Malhotra, Syed Saba Karim, Pranab Roy, Ashok Gandotra (a left-handed bat, who played in one Test in 1969, against Bill Lawrys Australians) and Erapalli Prasanna (qualifies here because he is now a resident of Bengal). The ex-umpires who will be getting their pension cheques (Rs 5,000 per month for each plus a medical cover) at the Eden that evening will be Bhairab Ganguly, J.D. Ghosh, Sunit Kumar Ghosh and S. R. Bose. The pension will also be given at the Eden to Bihars Ramesh Saxena. This is because, as a functionary pointed out, it will not be possible to conduct a function in Bihar for just one player. The scheme will initially cover between 150 to 175 former Test players and umpires who stood in Test matches. The pension scheme will continue for the rest of the lives of players and umpires. The medical cover scheme for players and umpires who are suffering for terminal illness has a total insured sum of Rs 3 lakh. The other centres where the pension cheques will be handed on the same day are Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Jaipur, Indore, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh and Pune, says a release from the board. The release points out that if any retired player or umpire is incapacitated and unable to attend the function, a representative of the concerned affiliated unit of the board will visit his residence the same evening and hand over the cheque. On this occasion the board will also record the feelings of these players/umpires.  Copyright

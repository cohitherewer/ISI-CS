The July 3-8 camp, originally scheduled in Bangalore, has been shifted to Chennai. The Asia Cup will be held in Sri Lanka from July 16-August 2. The camp was shifted so that the players can train in conditions similar to Sri Lanka, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said. The final squad for the Asia Cup would be picked during the Chennai camp, Dalmiya added. A group of 26 players is currently undergoing a fitness-specific camp in Bangalore, which will conclude on Saturday.

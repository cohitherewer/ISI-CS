 Thorpe may pull out
 - Government clears Englands tour of Zimbabwe  Thorpe feels its unfair to feel under pressure while making a decision London: The British government on Friday gave its reluctant backing for England to go ahead with their controversial tour of Zimbabwe in October. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) faced a one-year-suspension from international cricket and a 2 million fine under new ICC rules introduced in March if they cited moral obligations and refused to travel. The ECB does not want to tour but needs specific government advice not to go to avoid the stiff ICC sanctions. Foreign secretary Jack Straw said the government did not like the idea of the tour but did not believe the English game should be bankrupted by ICC penalties if it was called off. He said the government had no powers to ban any other sp-o-rting organisation from touring Zimbabwe or any other country. But batsman Graham Thorpe is considering pulling out of the tour of Zimbabwe. Thorpe told Radio Five Live: I dont agree with what is going on in Zimbabwe but I am a cricketer. As the clock ticks more questions get asked and all you can do is be honest about it. I cant definitely say I would tour. It is unfair to feel under pressure to make a decision about whether to tour Zimbabwe or not. If the government doesnt make a decision and your cricket board doesnt make a decision, you have to decide if you become a politician overnight. It is a bit hard to be throwing moral judgements at cricket when that is what they (the government and the ECB) do for a living. But it is like being in the army  sometimes they (the teams) have to go to places they dont want to go as well. England didnt tour Zimbabwe for their World Cup match against Heath Streaks team last year.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

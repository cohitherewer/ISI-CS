 Scolaris Portugal stunned by Greece 
 - Listless hosts fail to recover from Giorgos Karagounis seventh-minute strike  Greeces Angelis Basinas celebrates after scoring the second goal against Portugal at Dragao Stadium in Porto on Saturday. (AFP) Porto, June 12 (Reuters): Greece got the European Championship off to a stunning start on Saturday when they recorded the greatest win in their history by upsetting host nation Portugal 2-1 in the tournaments opening game.Portugal had not lost any of their previous nine European Championship group games and were hot favourites to claim another win but they could have no complaints about the defeat as they rarely troubled a well-drilled and committed Greek team. The Group A outsiders, looking composed on the ball and determined in attack, led through Giorgos Karagounis seventh-minute shot and doubled the advantage with an Angelos Basinas penalty six minutes into the second half. They then held out until injury time when Cristiano Ronaldo got a consolation goal with a close range header from a Luis Figo corner. Greece, who qualified ahead of Spain and drew with Portugal in a November friendly, showed they would not be overawed as they cut through in the first minute, striker Angelos Haristeas mis-kicking in front of goal after a low cross by Zisis Vryzas. It was an encouraging start for a team who failed to score in their three group games during their last appearance in a major tournament, the World Cup in the US 10 years ago. It got better five minutes later as midfielder Karagounis pounced on a misplaced pass out of defence by Paulo Ferreira. With the defenders retreating, he took the ball forward and drove a low shot past goalkeeper Ricardo from the edge of the area. Greece had more chances as Haristeas shot wide and overlapping fullback Takis Fyssas arrived in the box to send a volley over the bar. Portugal eventually settled, with Figo, Rui Costa and Simao Sabrosa beginning to show nice touches in midfield. But their chances were limited. Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari introduced Ronaldo to add some invention in the second half but the wingers first contribution was to bring down Yourkas Seitaridis in the penalty area. Basinas converted.

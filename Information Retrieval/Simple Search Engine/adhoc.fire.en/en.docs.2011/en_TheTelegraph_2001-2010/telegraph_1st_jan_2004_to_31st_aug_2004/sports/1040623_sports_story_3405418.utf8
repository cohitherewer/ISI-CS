The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Looking for one more upset
Anadia: Latvia captain Vitalijs Astafjevs believes his side can extend their Euro 2004 adventure by upsetting the Netherlands in their final Group D match Wednesday. An unlikely victory over the talented Dutch coupled with Germany failing to beat the Czech Republic would put the Baltic newcomers into the Euro 2004 quarters, something beyond the wildest dreams of a player with more than 100 international caps. We keep surprising ourselves, Astafjevs told reporters Tuesday. We surprised ourselves by reaching the finals and now here we are with a small chance of reaching the quarter-finals. If we play with the same spirit as in the first two matches anything is possible. After a narrow 1-2 defeat by the Czechs and a 0-0 draw with Germany, Starkovs said his team would approach the Netherlands match under no pressure. There is no difference between the Dutch and the Germans and the Czechs, they are all difficult to play, full of superstars, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

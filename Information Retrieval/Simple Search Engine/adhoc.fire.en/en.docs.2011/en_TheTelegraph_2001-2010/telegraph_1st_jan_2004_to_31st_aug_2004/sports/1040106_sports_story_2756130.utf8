The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Attack Aussies, they cant get 443: Wadekar 
 BY DWAIPAYAN DATTA  Wadekar feels Souravs boys can make history Calcutta: It was under him some 33 years ago that India had created history. But Ajit Wadekar believes a triumph Down Under  if it materialises in Sydney on Tuesday  will easily surpass what his boys had done. Wadekars India had then beaten the mighty West Indies 1-0 to clinch their maiden Test series against the Caribbeans. They followed it up with a first-ever series win in England a few months later. Winning a Test series in Australia will be bigger than both of these, Wadekar remarked while speaking to The Telegraph from his Mumbai residence on Monday. He is convinced that Sourav Gangulys men have it in them to earn a place in immortality. Of course, Wadekar pointed out a one-point agenda which the Indians must pursue on the final day at SCG to achieve their dream  attack. Not for once should India get defensive 443 is a huge target and there is no way the Aussies can get there, Wadekar said. Why does he think a victory on Tuesday will signal the biggest landmark in the history of Indian cricket? Winning a Test series in Australia is the ultimate dream of any captain. And Sourav has all the attributes to help India pull it off, he said. Talking about possible strategies the Team India captain can adopt at the SCG, the former skipper said: Spinners no doubt will hold the key but Sourav may well get success with a mixed attack. This lends the much-needed variety. And if one among (Irfan) Pathan and (Ajit) Agarkar comes good, it will take quite a load off Anil (Kumble). Wadekar had no doubt that Kumble will be the trump card. When the pressure is on, we all know how deadly can he be He has won so many Tests for us, so why not tomorrow? Wadekar believes Murali Kartik can also be a handful. True he didnt bowl well in the first innings, but let me tell you, this bloke is talented. He might just do the trick tomorrow, observed the former coach of the Indian team. He also wanted Sourav to use Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag as and when necessary. Sachin can give you the breakthrough if a partnership develops. Also, with the pitch playing up, Sehwag can be a handful, said Wadekar. Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting will be the key men, according to Wadekar. Dont allow these three to settle once the Indians get through this trio, it will be easy. Getting back to Kumble, Wadekar said: Chandra (B.S. Chandrasekhar) won me the Test match at The Oval. And I can assure you, Kumble is no less a force than Chandra. Chandrasekhar took six for 38 in that Oval Test, which India won by four wickets. Chandrasekhar himself is quite confident Kumble can do on Tuesday what he had done in 1971. But dont ask me what should be his strategy. He is an experienced customer and knows his job, the champion leggie said from Bangalore. What would he have done going into this sort of a situation? I never allowed pressure to bog me down and enjoyed the game out there in the middle I think this is something important for the spinners. See, all the pressure in the world will be on the Aussies Anil will do well just to concentrate and enjoy the moment. The spinner had a piece of advice for Sourav as well. Always have fielders around the bat he can afford to do so. I always worked with a slip, a forward short-leg and a leg-slip. Such a field-placing helps the spinner immensely. Chandrasekhar picked Steve Waugh as the key man. I bet he wont go down without a fight But the pressure will be on him, so, lets see.  Copyright

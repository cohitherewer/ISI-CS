The Telegraph - Calcutta

	Woods striking the right balance
- 'Ever since Elin came into my life, things just became a lot better' Woods thinks he has some great people around Los Angeles: While some parallels exist between John Daly and Tiger Woods on the golf course, few would think that any existed off it. Both are long hitters, possess strong short games and have won more than one major championship but the pair share a common thread off the course as well... the need for close friends to help them get through lifes rough spots. When Daly won last weeks Buick Invitational, he specifically mentioned the friends and family he has as his support system. After Wednesdays pro-am at this weeks Nissan Open, world No.1 Woods echoed that sentiment when asked about having a balance between personal and professional life. That takes years to find out, Woods said. Your life will evolve through those years. My life certainly has. Im going through some ups and downs. Its nice to have had the friends and family that I had around me. The 28-year-old Woods has always been tight-lipped about his family and close friends. While his impending marriage to Swedish ex-nanny Elin Nordegren is well documented, little else is known about the wedding plans or much of his personal life. By having a balance in your life, it makes things so much more harmonic, he added. I have great people around me, Elin is just fantastic for me. Ever since Elin came into my life, things just became a lot better. Someone you can bounce things off, somebody who is a great friend. We do just about everything together. Its nice having that type of person around you. Shes so much like me. Shes very competitive, very feisty, just like I am. With the rankings gap shrinking between himself and the rest of the PGA Tour, Woods reflected on his career so far and his life as a professional golfer. Youre not as happy, Woods said of a life focussed totally on golf. If you play too much, it will take its toll on you. If you look at guys who lead the best lives, the most happy have the longest careers, they are guys who havent played that much, who have other interests outside of golf. Bearing those facts in mind, Woods has never played in more than 21 events on the PGA Tour since his first full season in 1997. In the last two years, he competed at only 18 events. He is a keen student of the game, its players and his understanding of what has worked for many in the past and what works for him has always been foremost in his decision making process regarding when and where to play. He also understands the need for balance. I think its just having other hobbies, other interests besides hitting high draws, Woods said. We had that responsibility in school; we had other disciplines we needed to take care of. When you turn pro, obviously, you have golf, but you need to have other things to do as well.

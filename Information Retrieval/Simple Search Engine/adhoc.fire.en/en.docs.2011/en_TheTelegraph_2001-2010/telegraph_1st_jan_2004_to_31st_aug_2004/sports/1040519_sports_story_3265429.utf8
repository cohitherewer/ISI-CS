The Telegraph - Calcutta
A special talent called Wie
 Michelle Wies number one ambition is to play in the Masters at Augusta She gave up soccer at the age of six and turned her back on tennis and baseball because they involved too much running. Whatever those sports may have lost, golf stands to benefit richly with Honolulu schoolgirl Michelle Wie already being hailed as the future Tiger Woods of womens game. Wie, who stunned the sporting world in January when she narrowly failed to become the first female to make the cut in a PGA Tour event at the Hawaiian Open, took up golf aged four. I did play other sports, in fact I tried everything, she said. I played soccer, baseball, tennis and swimming but didnt really like them enough to stick with them. Tennis and baseball were a little too hard for me physically, because you have to run a lot. Im probably a little bit lazy, she added with an embarrassed smile. I have to be good at something and I chose golf when I was about seven years old. The other thing about tennis, swimming, baseball and soccer is youre playing the same court, the same field, over and over again while in golf you have different courses. The six-foot tall Hawaiian teenager, who last year became the youngest winner of the US womens amateur public links championship, is a prodigious striker of the golf ball, regularly powering her drives beyond 300 yards. I was always a big hitter. I think playing baseball has probably helped as well, she said. Wie missed the Hawaiian Open cut by a shot after firing a second-round 68 and making birdie at two of the last three holes. A third of the field failed to match her driving distance. Three times major winner Ernie Els described her swing as the best of any women golfer he had seen, while world number one Woods was also excited. I think its pretty neat what shes doing and I wish her all the luck in the world, said Woods, who had been surprised to discover Wie was slightly taller than him after the pair walked a few holes together. For Wie, meeting Els and Woods for the first time was an enriching experience. Ernie Els was great, she said. It was really exciting and fabulous on every hole when we played a practice round together. Hes such a nice guy and I had a wonderful time. I learned from him a few special shots. In my younger years, at six or seven, I learned my golf mostly from Tiger Woods. My dad watched him and I had pictures of Tiger up on the wall and I followed his swing. Everything about him is just wonderful. His focus, you cant beat that. And his attitude on the golf course is so positive. Last year, Wie played in seven LPGA Tour events, missing just one cut with the highlight a tie for ninth at the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the first womens major of the season. This year Wie improved on that, closing with a 71 to secure fourth place and equal the best result by an amateur in the event, set by Caroline Keggi in 1988. She has no immediate plans to turn pro but has targeted a maiden victory in the paid ranks in 2004. For the first couple of years on the LPGA Tour, my goal was to make the cut and see what happens, said Wie, who loves going to the cinema and shopping with her friends. This year my goal is to win. A major would be great but any tournament would do. Im going to play six events this year. Eventually I want to divide my time between the LPGA and the PGA Tours, and my number one ambition is to play in the Masters at Augusta National. I also want to open up my own company, either in fashion or in some other business. But all those are long-term aims ... finishing school is definitely a top priority. (REUTERS) Copyright

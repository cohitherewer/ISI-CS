The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jyoti 16th after first round
Shanghai, May 13 (Reuters): Indias Jyoti Randhawa finished the first round on a decent 70, going over to the second day tied on a hopeful 16th in the $1.5 million Asian Open at the par-72 Tomson Shanghai Pudong Golf Club Thursday. Former world No. 1 Greg Norman, who has not won a European Tour event for tenyears, finished the first round just one shot off the lead after a clinical 67. The first-round leader was Englands Simon Dyson, who shot a sparkling six-under-par 66 to continue his fine form in the region where in 2000 he won the Macao Open, the China Open and the Hong Kong Open. South Korean K.J. Choi tied with Norman, Thailands Prayad Marksaeng and Gregory Hanrahan of the US at five under. Padraig Harrington was left with work to do after a disappointing par finish on the back of five birdies and five bogies gave him a score of 72. Anything to do with China, Im three out of three, Dyson said. Itll be nice to make it four. Dyson was delighted to lead the Great White Shark Norman in the first European Tour event to take place on the Chinese mainland. Nice one to be leading by one over Greg, Dyson said.  Copyright

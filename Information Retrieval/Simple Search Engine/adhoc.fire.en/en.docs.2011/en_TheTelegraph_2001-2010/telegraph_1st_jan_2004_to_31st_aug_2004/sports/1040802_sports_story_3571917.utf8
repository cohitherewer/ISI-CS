The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ive learnt from captains mistakes 
	 - 90-95 per cent of captaincy is the man management component: Smith  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Colombo: Its out of the blue that Graeme Smith was named Shaun Pollocks successor as captain after South Africas disastrous 2003 World Cup campaign. As it turned out, Smith surprised many by not only rebuilding the side, but showing excellent personal form. One of the youngest captains  he was just past his 22nd birthday when the job came his way  Smith spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday evening. As is par for the course at the start of a tour, theres plenty on his mind, but he didnt scrap our appointment. The following are excerpts On the time it took him to actually settle into the captaincy Not long really... Perhaps, I was fortunate that my first tour was to Bangladesh... The tri-series and, then, the Tests... It wasnt only a question of my settling down, but Polly settling into a new role. That we finished joint winners with India, in the tri-series, helped enormously. Later, when we landed in England, we were confident individually and collectively. [Smith has begun the tour of Sri Lanka with eight wins and four losses from 16 Tests as captain. In the ODIs, his record reads: 13 victories and 12 defeats with two abandonments.] On his rapport with Pollock Initially  and understandably  there were teething problems... I have my way of captaining... Polly, however, has been terrific and been of great help. On getting the captaincy I was driving when the Boards CEO (Gerald Majola) called... I had to pull up and it took me ten minutes to get my breath back... I was, predictably, over the moon but I realised that with the excitement would come greater responsibility and increased pressure. For me, that remains the turning point. On the marks he gives himself on captaincy Thats tough... Moreover, let others judge... As a team, we have certainly grown and while the past 16 or so months havent been terrific, we have certainly had our highs and moments of much satisfaction. Do remember that when I took over, some rebuilding and upliftment was necessary. On what he has learnt as captain (Smiles) To trust myself more... Back my judgements more... Captaining and opening the batting can be difficult... Ive learnt to switch on and off  to the extent possible  in the two roles... Tactically, Ive improved and, perhaps, developed as a person too. On whether, in the past 16 months, he has had captaincy-specific discussions with somebody in the fraternity Ive bounced ideas off some teammates... Ive had a series of discussions with our coach (Eric Simons), who has been a big influence... Ive spoken to Gary Kirsten... The learning, though, has to be the individuals own effort. On whether he has had a role model captain No... Ive admired some, but bottomline is that Ive always wanted to be Graeme Smith... Always wanted to be myself... On whether he admires a contemporary captain Every guy is unique in his own way and Ive tried to learn from the mistakes of others... I quite liked the way Steve Waugh went about things... Cricket has some great captains, today, but I dont specially admire anybody. On his biggest challenge as captain Three things: Being more consistent, the guys showing more hunger and us winning more close matches... On the man-management component of captaincy Its 90-95 per cent... As captain, Ive got to make sure all the players are hungry to perform every single day... That they are up to it... My role, I suppose, gets more significant on tours. A good captain must be a leader of men. On whether he is an instinctive captain Well, theres a limit to what you can plan in the dressing room... One has to be somewhat instinctive as the opposition may not play in the expected manner or the wicket could behave very differently. Basically, youve got to back whatever decision you make. On captaincy not being a burden, as he scored two big double centuries in his third (277, Edgbaston) and fourth (259, Lords) Tests (Laughs) Ive developed ways to switch off the captaincy, while batting, but it still is difficult not to have captaincy-related thoughts... Ive been working hard and will be happier once I get more consistent. On his say in picking the XI Thats decided by the coach and I... The selectors name the squad, we do the rest. On how he unwinds after a tough day Do nothing! Actually, much is determined by where I am  its different when Im in South Africa, for I may go to a movie or have dinner with friends... Overseas, it depends... Usually, watching a movie helps me relax. On his interest in other sport I follow soccer  incidentally, Im a Liverpool fan  and, because the South Africans are doing so well, I keep track of golf too... I like watching rugby... On whether marriage is something for the near future No... No... I do have a girlfriend, Minki, but havent thought of taking the vows Finally, whether the forthcoming tour of India (two Tests from mid November) is going to be his biggest challenge It will be tough, yes... But, then, all tours hold out a different challenge... The quicker we adapt (in India), the better our chances.  Copyright

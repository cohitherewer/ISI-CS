 ICC stays firm
 Aravinda de SilvaLondon, May 15 (PTI): The ICC will adhere to the existing rules on illegal bowling action until a newly-appointed sub-committee completes its research on the much-debated issue. The decision, taken after the cricket committee-playing deliberated on the issue during its meeting in Dubai, would mean Muttiah Muralidharan cannot bowl his doosra  the delivery that spins away from the right handers  for now. Murali did not bowl his doosra against Sri Lanka on Friday but captured two wickets. Murali can expect a fair representation in the sub-committee, appointed by the Sunil Gavaskar-chaired cricket committee-playing, as it comprises among others former Lankan batsman Aravinda de Silva. Any review, however, of the existing rules on tolerance levels for bowlers would be made only after the sub-committee completes its research into spin bowling, which is expected only by the last quarter of this year, according to a press release here on Saturday. Besides Aravinda, the sub-committee would have two other members of the cricket committee  Angus Fraser and Tim May. It would also comprise human movement specialists and independent cricket experts. Meanwhile, ICC said on Friday that SLChad provided the ICC with copies of its advice to Murali and his team management requesting the spinner to refrain from bowling his doosra. The ICC also confirmed that Match Referee Mike Proctor had raised the issue with the Sri Lanka team manager before the start of play in the second Test with Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Friday ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said that SLC had provided copies of its advice to Murali to confirm that it had taken this action.

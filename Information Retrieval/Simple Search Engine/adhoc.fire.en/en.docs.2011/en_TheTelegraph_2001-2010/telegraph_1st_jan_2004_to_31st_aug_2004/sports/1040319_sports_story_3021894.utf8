The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Montoya gets a warning from Ralf
 Ralf Schumacher Sepang: Formula One driver Ralf Schumacher warned Williams teammate Juan Pablo Montoya on Thursday that he would force him off the track next time he tried to bully his way past. In a declaration of open hostility, Ralf blamed the Colombian for a coming together at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 7. It was a pretty strong move and next time I will have him off the track, Ralf told a news conference before Sundays Malaysian Grand Prix. The German delivered his words steely-faced and McLarens David Coulthard, sitting alongside, could barely contain his amazement. Wow thats brilliant, he gasped. Oh sorry, I just meant to think that. Go for it, he said. Ralf and Montoya, who is leaving Williams for McLaren at the end of the season, have never pretended to be friends since they were paired up in 2001 and their rivalry has flared up in the past. They collided during the US Grand Prix in Indianapolis two years ago and have had numerous verbal skirmishes since. Montoya had blamed Ralf for the Melbourne incident after the race, saying the German had tried to protect his line too late. It is sad because we could have both been out of the race, he said. When your teammate is behind and quicker, just deal with it. Ralf, younger brother of Ferraris six-times world champion Michael, was having none of that on Thursday. It was just a move which was based on me making space for him which I did so as not to put our positions into danger that early in the race. I just think that move was not the right thing to do at the time. Asked whether he had confronted the Colombian, Ralf added: I dont need to say anything about it. Only what I said before. If someone brakes into a corner with the intention of either crashing into somebody or assuming he gives space, then that is the wrong move. Ralf brushed off a suggestion that the mercurial Montoya knew he could behave as he pleased towards Ralf and the team since he was leaving. He said he was concentrating more on the teams problems than his teammates actions. Williams chief operations engineer Sam Michael played down the incident, saying it was just a normal racing incident and not the end of the world. Spanish Formula One driver Fernando Alonso said that he will dedicate any success in Sundays Grand Prix to the victims of last weeks Madrid bombings. It will be difficult as a victory is very hard to get but probably it is one of the best moments of the year to have a first place.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 South ride Venugopalaraos 228 n.o. to stun England A 
 25th first-class century by Sriram Gurgaon: Propelled by a maiden double hundred from Y. Venugopalarao, South Zone recorded a stunning win over England A in a Duleep Trophy match on Tuesday. Chasing a mammoth fourth innings target of 501, South sealed the win in the third mandatory over with Venugopalarao unbeaten on 228. The winning runs came from S. Badrinath, who clubbed right-arm seamer Bilal Shifayat to midwicket fence to complete a perfect hundred of his own. Another knock, which laid the platform for Souths six-wicket win, came from left-handed Sridharan Sriram who made 117  his 25th first class century. It is one of the rare occasions in the history of the tournament when a team has successfully chased a 500-plus target in the fourth innings. The win gave South four points and put them in strong position to make the final beginning on March 4 at Mohali. East Zone, who had grabbed two points by virtue of the first innings lead against South in the first round, need to secure at least two pints against England A to edge out South and reach the final. Venugopalaraos marathon innings, spanning seven hours and 47 minutes, encompassed two double-century partnerships with Sriram and Badrinath. He added 226 runs for the third wicket with the former and 212 for the unbroken fifth with the latter. The Andhra batsman later said he was not at all tired after the victory. I can play one more day, he said. My plan was to stay at the wicket and let things happen. The batsmen at the other end also played well. Venugopalarao, however, said he had his doubts when Sriram was dismissed. I told both my partners (Sridharan Sharath and Badrinath) after that about my plan, and Sharath was in good form, he said. Syed Kirmani, chairman of the national selection committee, said: Everyone knows about Karnataka chasing a 700-plus total against Delhi in Ranji Trophy, but I cant remember such a big chase in Duleep Trophy, he said. I was thinking (during the innings) about the partnership between Laxman and Dravid in Calcutta (against Australia in 2001), said Venugopalarao. North prevail India opener Aakash Chopra scored a determined 43 as North Zone recovered from a mid-innings slump to beat Central Zone by five wickets.

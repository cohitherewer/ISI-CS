The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jones lawyer hits out
San Jose: Sprint star Marion Jones has continued her counterattack against anti-doping officials by going public with what her camp claims is flawed evidence against her. This reminds me of someone trying to take away your licence for drunk driving, and they didnt do a sobriety test, but a bartender kept a ledger with your name and the amount of alcohol supposedly given, Joseph Burton, a lawyer for Jones, told the a New York paper on Wednesday. Jones representatives showed two newspapers some of the documents they were given on Monday in a meeting with representatives of the US anti-doping agency (Usada). Burton cited what he called flaws in the evidence  which included drug test sample collection on dates when Jones was en route to Sydney for the 2000 Olympics.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Media criticism affecting Pak players: Woolmer
Islamabad: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has said the players are under tremendous pressure because of relentless criticism from the media and it is affecting performance. Woolmer, who submitted his Asia Cup report to the PCB recently, said he had noticed that the players had become very sensitive to criticism, which was affecting their natural game. The report, which focusses on the need for developing mental toughness specially against media pressure, does not criticise any player, local The News quoted a top PCB official as saying. Woolmer has given an honest assessment of all the players and pointed out areas where they need to improve. He has outlined some of his future plans. But he has made no negative comment about any player, the official said. In an attempt to deal with media criticism, Woolmer said he tried to impress on the players the importance of being mentally tough. The cricketers not only have to train for fitness, they also have to be mentally strong. They cannot afford to have negative thoughts. As a team, you cannot afford to have ups and downs on the field. There ought to be a level. That is the area I intend to develop in six months, he said. The coach praised captain Inzamam-ul Haq for his strong character and handling pressure in the dual role of batsman and skipper. (PTI)  Copyright

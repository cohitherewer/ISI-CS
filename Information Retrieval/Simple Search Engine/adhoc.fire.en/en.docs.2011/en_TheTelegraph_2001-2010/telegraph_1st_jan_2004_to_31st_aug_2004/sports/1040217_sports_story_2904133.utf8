 India open with 270-run victory
 Shikhar Dhawan acknowledges cheers after hitting a century against Scotland in the U-19 World Cup in Dhaka on Monday. (AP) Dhaka: India opened their under-19 World Cup campaign with a mammoth 270-run win over Scotland on Monday. A.T. Rayudus team amassed 425 for three after being sent in and restricted the inexperienced Scots to 155 for eight. Opener Shikhar Dhawan led the avalanche of runs with an unbeaten 155  the first century of the tournament. His opening partner Robin Uthappa hammered 97, Rayudu contributed 53 and Suresh Raina smashed an unbeaten 90 off 38 balls. Scotland succeeded in their sole aim of playing out the 50 overs with skipper Kyle Coetzer hitting a polished 62. Indias next match is against New Zealand on Wednesday. The Indians got off to a terrific start as Uthappa and Dhawan plundered 175 runs in a mere 24.1 overs. The former looked set for a hundred but fell just three short. That was not the end of the plight for the Scotland bowlers as Rayudu and Dhawan kept scoring at a good pace. The captain was the more cautious of the two, hitting four boundaries and a six in his 51-ball knock. He fell in the 38th over with the total reading 261 and then came the partnership that took India near the 400-mark. Dhawan and Raina hammered 131 runs off just 62 balls. Raina fell in the 48th over with a century well in sight, but the opener didnt let the run-rate dip and added 33 off 14 balls for the unbroken fourth-wicket stand. Rainas hurricane knock came off 38 balls and included 14 fours and two sixes. The Scotland reply got off to a stuttering start with Gaurav Dhiman bowling opener D. Young in the first over without a run on the board. M.M. Iqbal, the other opener, resisted for some time, scoring 30 off 74 balls and Ranjit Routray made 20 towards the end.  The highlight of the Scotland innings was Coetzers  stubborn 62. The skipper presented a straight bat to almost  everything the Indian bowlers offered and looked determined  to stay till the end before being run out in the 49th over.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

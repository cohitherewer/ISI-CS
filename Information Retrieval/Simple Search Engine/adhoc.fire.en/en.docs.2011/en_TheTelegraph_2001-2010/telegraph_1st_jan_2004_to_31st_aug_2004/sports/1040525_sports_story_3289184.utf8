The Telegraph - Calcutta
 France brace for English test
 Marcel Desailly shakes hands with Thierry Henry as they arrive in their hotel in La Grande Motte on Monday Paris: Frances Robert Pires and Thierry Henry believe that facing England is an ideal way for the holders to start their title defence at Euro 2004. France, champions at Euro 2000, meet England in a Group B opener on June 13 in Lisbon with the two Arsenal teammates believing there can be no room for complacency. Its always tough to play against them. Its always physical and sometimes I have to admit its hard, said Pires of facing English opposition. Looking back to their calamitous World Cup defence, Pires said at Frances training ground last week: France must avoid the trap they fell into in 2002, when we thought it would be easy. With England, it probably wont be. But to start a tournament, there is nothing better. It will mean well have to get things right from the start. Alongside the physical challenged posed by Sven-Goran Erikssons side, Pires said: They also have very technical players like David Beckham, who can change the course of a game. That is why we have be very careful. Henry, the Premier Leagues top-scorer and whose 30 goals helped Arsenal to a second league title in three seasons, also believes England will provide an early wake-up call. For me, England have a very strong side, said the striker, who will also test Switzerland and Croatia in Frances bid to reach the quarter finals. If we lose the first game against them, it will make things awkward because well be obliged to win our remaining two games. Nine of the 23 players in coach Jacques Santinis squad play in the Premier League  four at Arsenal, three at Chelsea and two at Manchester United  making the English top flight the best represented league in the squad. Henry will probably tangle with Englands Arsenal defenders Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole, while Claude Makelele and Chelsea clubmate Frank Lampard might cross swords in midfield. Well meet players whom were used to seeing all the year round, Pires said. But well have to forget about that. On the pitch there will be no friends. Henry also believes that Frances Arsenal players, who include midfielder Patrick Vieira, will arrive in better shape to defend their European crown than they did two years ago for a world title defence which ended at the group stage. The difference is that in 2002 we had just done the League and FA Cup double with Arsenal and wed had no time to rest before the tournament, he said. I arrived in South Korea very tired and had a pain in my knee. This year, we were crowned champions a long time ago and we are in better shape, Henry warned. (Reuters)  Copyright

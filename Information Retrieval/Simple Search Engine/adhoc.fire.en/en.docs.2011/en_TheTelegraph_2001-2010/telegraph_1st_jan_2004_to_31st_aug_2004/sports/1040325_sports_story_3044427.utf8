The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Changes in F1 qualifying 
London: Formula Ones new qualifying format, slammed by broadcasters as boring and far too long, will be split into two separate Saturday sessions as of next weeks Bahrain Grand Prix. The International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in a statement on Wednesday that pre-qualifying would start at 1300 local time, an hour earlier than at present, with final qualifying for the grid starting at 1400. It said the changes had been decided by the FIAs World Motor Sport Council at a meeting in Paris. No further details were given but TV companies could now decide to broadcast only the second part of the session that dictates the starting grid while advertising breaks factored into the first part could be removed to speed up the proceedings.

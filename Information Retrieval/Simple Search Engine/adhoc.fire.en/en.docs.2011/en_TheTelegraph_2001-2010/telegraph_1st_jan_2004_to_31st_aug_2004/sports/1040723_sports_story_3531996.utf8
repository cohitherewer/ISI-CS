The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Still understanding Pak cricket
 - Misunderstanding between Inzamam and Shoaib was cleared in 15-odd minutes: Woolmer  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Woolmer will get a handsome bonus if Pakistan climb from their present ICC standing 
	THE WOOLMER STYLE OF OPERATING Cricket Planning Committee: PCB chief executive Rameez Raja, chief selector Wasim Bari, captain Inzamam-ul Haq and Woolmer himself.
 Management Committee (general): Manager Haroon Rashid, Inzamam, vice-captain Yousuf Youhana, Imran Farhat and Woolmer himself.
 Management Committee (medical): Rashid, physio Darren Lifson, trainer Murray Stevenson, an orthopaedic nominated by the PCB and Woolmer himself.
 Disciplinary Committee: Rashid, Inzamam and Woolmer himself.Colombo: Champions Pakistan tripped at the first major hurdle in the current Asia Cup, on Wednesday, but coach Bob Woolmer isnt hitting the panic button. Moreover, unlike his South Africa-innings which began with defeats in seven ODIs, the latest has started with wins over Bangladesh and Hong Kong. One cant list excuses, but its a fact that nothing went right in the lead-up to our match against Sri Lanka... The team bus had a puncture and, so, we had to rush in taxis... Then, Imran Farhat got injured at training and, somehow, too many people kept coming and going near the players. Basically, the focus got lost, Woolmer told The Telegraph on the morning-after. Ironically, the seven-wicket loss came on the day the Kanpur-born former England allrounder signed his three-year contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The terms, of course, were agreed to last month itself before he replaced Javed Miandad. Im still understanding Pakistan cricket... Ive just been in the job for three weeks... Woolmer added, during a chat at the Taj Samudra. In fact, one of his first moves was to broker a deal between captain Inzamam-ul Haq and the temperamental Shoaib Akhtar. Actually, it wasnt difficult... I got both to sit down with the manager (Haroon Rashid) and myself and, in 15-odd minutes, their misunderstanding was cleared... Today, they are working towards a common goal... The deal, incidentally, was struck during the conditioning camp in Lahore ahead of the Asia Cup, with Woolmer reminding both Inzamam and Shoaib that everyones career had a limit. According to his contract, Woolmer will get a handsome bonus if Pakistan climb from their present ICC standing: Fourth in Tests (behind Australia, England and South Africa) and sixth in ODIs (behind Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India). This assessment is going to be done annually. The PCB has given Woolmer full authority, but he insists that wasnt a precondition from his end: Ive been given total power but, really, Ive put in place committees to help me and the team go forward... Im not seeing myself as the supremo... In any case, on the field, Inzamam is the boss. Looking ahead, specifically to Sundays clash versus India, Woolmer said: Your team has, over the years, developed into a good outfit... We do know what to expect and, dont forget, Pakistan is a very fine side... Perhaps, Inzamam and his boys will respond stronger after yesterdays defeat... Woolmer, by the way, confirmed he was pushing for the introduction of player contracts. Im surprised its not already in place... Cricket, though, isnt only about a secure environment but has much to do with opportunities... Also, making the most, is how he put it. Significantly, right now, Woolmers priority is identifying the 11 best Test and ODI players  however, he isnt exactly looking at separate XIs. Priority No. 2 is getting a top-notch computer analyst. He is focussed on what needs to be done; its for the Inzamams to deliver.  Copyright

 Tough for Indians
 Dibyendu Barua is out of reckoning Tripoli: Its tough going for Indians in the world chess championship. Three of the five in fray are out after the first round, while P. Harikrishna is waiting for the tie-breaker to see if he makes it to the next round. Neelotpal Das is the only player confirmed in the second round following a walkover from Vadim Milov of Switzerland. Krishnan Sasikiran was the biggest casualty. The Chennai-based GM was the only Indian to be drawn against a player rated below him. However, Sasikiran lost both opening round games against German GM Kritz Leonid. Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Dibyendu Barua were also knocked out, following successive defeats against Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark and Alexander Graf of Germany, respectively. P. Harikrishna, the only Indian to register a win in the opening game of the first round, lost the second as Chinese GM Xu Jun took him to the tie-breaker. Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, Vassily Ivanchuk of the Ukraine, Englishmen Michael Adams as well as Nigel Short posted back-to-back victories to make it to the second round. Among top players to bounce back after losing the opener were Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia and Viktor Bologan of Moldova who defeated Irans Mahjeeb Morteja and Mark Paragua of Philippines, respectively. Sasikiran lost a longish game against Leonid, Barua went down after a rigorous battle with Graf, Surya tried too hard and was punished by Nielsen, while Harikrishna missed a tactical trick.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 UCBSA is now less anxious
	 - Possible questioning of Gibbs, Boje by Delhi police  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Graeme Smith, seen working out in Colombo on Thursday, will have to focus on acclimatisation and Muttiah Muralidharan. (AFP) Colombo: Today, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) appears less anxious about the possibility of the Delhi Police questioning Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje on the forthcoming tour of India than it was two months ago. The squad hasnt been announced, but both are expected to be selected. The UCBSA isnt worried as there has been a detailed discussion with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), informed South African teams Media manager Gerald de Kock, when contacted by The Telegraph on Thursday afternoon. He added: We expect things to be sorted out before our visit begins (in mid November). The South Africans, currently in Sri Lanka for two Tests and five ODIs, will feature in a three-day game and two Tests (Kanpur, Calcutta) during their short tour of India. The UCBSAs misgivings arose  out of the blue  towards the end of May and, by way of a response, the Delhi Police announced its (early 2000) match-fixing probe hadnt closed. The UCBSAs own reaction, then, was that the players wont be picked unless they have immunity from questioning. Nothing categoric has been spelt out, but UCBSA boss Ray Mali has been in contact with BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya. The Delhi Police, it may be recalled, has accused both Gibbs and Boje of being involved with match-fixing. Incidentally, the others similarly charged are the late Hansie Cronje, Pieter Strydom and Henry Williams. Strydom and Williams have all but disappeared, so the UCBSAs concern is only over Gibbs and Boje.  Gibbs is expected to be in the India-bound squad with BojeGibbs, of course, has served a six-month ban from international cricket while Bojes denial got accepted by the King Commission and the UCBSA. Meanwhile, the dashing Gibbs  who twisted his right ankle at a preparatory camp in Pretoria just a few days ago  has been ruled out of the first Test, in Galle from August 4. In fact, the team management isnt sure hes going to recover in time for the second Test either, at the SSC here from August 11. Understandably, as captain Graeme Smith pointed out, the biggest challenge for the South Africans is (a) acclimatising  after all, its winter back home and (b) tackling Muttiah Muralidharan.

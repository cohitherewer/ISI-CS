 PCB puts contracts on hold
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Rawalpindi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has put on hold introducing contracts (with three-tiered payments) as, in chief executive Rameez Rajas view, the concept needs to be studied afresh. The idea was mooted before the start of the current season by the then-chairman, Lt Gen. (retd) Tauqir Zia, but didnt take off as some of the middle-rung players werent happy with the B category package. Now, Rameez feels the concept itself be reviewed. Initially, I did support the idea... However, more recently, Ive had misgivings... For example, if we bind the players, they wont be able to compete on the County circuit. And, if they will be allowed, then whats the worth of a contract? asked Rameez, in a chat with The Telegraph on Wednesday. Talking during a break in commentary, he added: Really, now, we must decide whether contracts are necessary. After all, my own belief is that our players should play County cricket... They are only going to improve... Significantly, quite a few players are already contracted to Counties  from the experienced Shoaib Akhtar (Durham) to Danish Kaneria (Essex). Saqlain Mushtaq, of course, is a veteran at Surrey. As with other issues, the contracts bit will be discussed once this series gets over. Incidentally, contracts are on hold in India too.  Dalmiya not coming Meanwhile, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya isnt coming to watch the last three days of the decider. This was clarified by BCCI secretary S.K. Nair. Nair, who came a few days back, indicated he would have an informal discussion with the PCB brass over further bilateral exchanges. Theres talk of Pakistan visiting India for three ODIs later in the year, but nothing has been worked out. Rameez, by the way, favours biennial bilateral exchanges. The PCB chairman, Shaharyar Khan, also feels the same way.  Copyright

Randhawa joins Atwal for British Open
- Jeev Milkha misses out in sudden-death
 Australias Scott Barr with his trophy after winning the Britsh Open qualifying meet in Kuala Lumpur 
on Wednesday. (AFP)Kuala Lumpur: Indias Jyoti Randhawa booked his third British Open appearance on Wednesday when he shared medal honours with Australias Kim Felton and Scott Barr in Asian qualifiers.Randhawa, the Asian No. 1 in 2002, fired a four-under-par 68 for a total of five-under-par 139 at Saujana Golf and Country Club to secure his place alongside the worlds best golfers in July. He thus joined fellow-Indian Arjun Atwal, the only Indian to feature on the US PGA Tour who got his entry directly because he topped the Asian PGAs Order of Merit. Barr, a teaching professional who came good in Asia last season, carded a 72 while Felton produced a 69 to earn starts in the British Open, which will be staged at Royal Troon, Scotland, from July 15-18. Japans Yoshinobu Tsukada clinched the fourth and final available berth after prevailing in a four-way sudden-death play-off with a 15-foot birdie against compatriot Sushi Ishigaki and Jeev Milkha Singh of India. Scotsman Simon Yates, who would have secured his place if not for a missed eight-foot birdie attempt at the last hole in regulation play, withdrew from the play-off, which was halted for an hour following a weather delay. Its always a dream to play in the Open, said Randhawa, who played at St Andrews in 2000 and Royal St Georges last year. I didnt hit it great over the last two days but I just hung in there and waited for something to happen. Randhawa, who shot an opening 71 on Tuesday, bogeyed the sixth hole but bounced back straight away with birdies on the seventh and treacherous eighth hole. Further birdies on 11 and 13 set him on the road to Royal Troon and he clinched his ticket by draining a 15-foot birdie at the 18th. Atwal earned his exemption into the worlds oldest major after finishing as the Order of Merit winner in Asia last season. The 31-year-old Barr was over the moon after recovering from a dismal front nine of 38. Just 12 months ago, the Aussie was clocking 10-hour days earning approximately $20 for 30-minute lessons as a club professional in Singapore but in three months time, hell be teeing up in the worlds oldest major. Itll be great to play in the Open, thats what its all about. One of my goals this year was to play in a major and its nice to achieve that. Its a big feeling obviously but it hasnt really sunk in yet, said Barr. Like the rest of the field, Felton, who was in the last group out, had a two-hour wait before the start his second round following a tropical storm. I played uno during the wait and lost all my games. And then I just played good when I got on the course. Its just awesome, said Felton, who was the low amateur in the 1998 Eisenhower Trophy. Tsukada, playing on the Asian Tour this year after losing his full exempt in Japan, was in trouble off the tee in the play-off, which was held on the 10th hole, but he hit a great recovery from between some palm trees to the front of the green. He then drained the long putt to secure his maiden appearance in the British Open.  (Agencies) Copyright

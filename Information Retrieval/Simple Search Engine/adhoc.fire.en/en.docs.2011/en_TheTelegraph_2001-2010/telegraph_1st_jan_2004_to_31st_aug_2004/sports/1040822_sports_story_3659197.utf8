The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hardik, 4th seed share point
 A CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Unrated Hardik Roy, a class X student of La Martiniere, hogged the limelight on the second day of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan on Saturday. Hardik held fourth seed Mohammad Imran Ali of Bangladesh with black pieces in a Sicilian defence. Both decided to sign the peace treaty on the 29th move after none of the players could make any headway. Imran Alis compatriot, third seed Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar, however, was fortunate to escape the clutches of defeat against Abhradeep Sil of Elias Meyer. Playing with black pieces Minhazuddin was clearly in an inferior position against Abhradeep but the latter mishandled the position and allowed Minazuddin to turn the tables on him. Top seed Debayan Majumdar of St James School faced little resistance from Swarup Dey Sarkar of Nava Nalanda Primary School. Playing his favourite French defence Debayan obtained total control of the c-file which cost Swarup a piece and the game. Rajib Dhar, the Guwahati leg champion, obtained a complete bind on the kingside with his pieces against Ankan Modak of Acharya Prafulla Chandra Boys School. Taking advantage of his superior position, Dhar broke through on the kingside decisively, forcing his opponent to resign. TOP BOARD RESULTS Swarup Dey Sarkar (1) lost to Debayan Majumdar (2); Rajib Dhar (2) bt Ankan Modak (1); Abhradeep Sil (1) lost to Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar (2); Mohammad Imran Ali (1.5) drew with Hardik Roy (1.5); Sagar Kapoor (1) lost to Soumya Thakura (2); Debaditta Sinha Biswas (2) bt Ashish Lillha (1); Saket Kothari (1) lost to Parag Hunny (2); Souvik Chakraborty (2) bt Deepesh Kothari (1); Ankit Srivastava (1) lost to Suman Basu (2); Debashish Das (2) bt Visweswar (1); Ankit Gupta (1) lost to Sk. Shahid Ahmed (2).  Copyright

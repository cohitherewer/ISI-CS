The Telegraph - Calcutta
Subrata is back, as technical director
- Aloke set to quit as coach, wishing team luck BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata is back home Calcutta, April 17: Mohun Bagan appointed Subrata Bhattacharya as technical director of the club on Saturday, a day after the teams humiliating defeat in the National Football League, to Vasco SC in Margao. Subrata is returns exactly after a year. Current coach Aloke Mukherjee reacted to the news by giving a strong hint that he would quit his job if he was made to report to anybody. The clubs assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury had earlier announced: Weve appointed Subrata as our new technical director and he has been asked to take charge from Monday. He added that both Mukherjee and his assistant Satyajit Chatterjee would be asked to continue in their respective posts. Mukherjee, who returned to the city from Goa with the team late in the evening, said he would not work under anybodys supervision. Im yet to receive any official intimation about the developments. But I feel there should be one person in charge of the team, he said. Chatterjee, on the other hand, refused to comment on the issue. I dont want to drag myself into it, he pleaded, when contacted. Wishing the team good luck, Mukherjee lamented his team had a real bad day in office against Vasco. A feeling also echoed by captain Rennedy Singh. Our defence was not at all up to the task, he viewed. I have already spoken to some of the players and have told them they have the final say in the team. Best of luck to them if they can manage to get out of the relegation threat, Mukherjee maintained. Bhattacharya, meanwhile, said his top priority would be giving some respectability to the team. The team is morally and mentally down now. But Ill try to help them finish the league with some respectability, Bhattacharya told The Telegraph, when contacted in the evening. The former India and Mohun Bagan defenders contract with the club will run till May 1 next year. Bhattacharyas job is absolutely cut out since the team is hovering the danger zone in the league and he has to deal with the NFL leaders East Bengal in his very first match on Sunday next. Bhattacharyas return to the teams thinktank is as dramatic as his ouster as coach last year. With the team living dangerously in the bottom-half of the NFL, questions about Mukherjees credibility in shepherding the team were being raised from time to time. The search for a new man in the hot seat was initiated by the club officials and the high court-appointed special officers soon after the news about the teams 1-5 defeat to Vasco  they conceded five goals in a match against an Indian outfit for the first time since the ignominious five goals let in from East Bengal in 1975  reached the club on Friday evening. The club officials and special officers approached Bhattacharya that night itself and asked him to take charge. It was learnt that Justice Shyamal Sen, one of the special officers, took the initiative in bringing Bhattacharya back as the technical director, aided to no little extent by Chowdhury. Veteran coach Amal Dutta, who is now in charge of Ever-Ready, was also approached, but no positive breakthrough was made. Bhattacharya also insisted that the team would stay alive in the league. To me, the very concept that Mohun Bagan are in relegation zone is wrong. In fact, we are still a point ahead of Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami (both on 18 points with four matches to go, while Indian Bank have already been relegated), Bhattacharya said. Bhattacharya, though, has already trained his eyes on the next season. I want a sports medicine expert (from SAI) and a foreign physio-cum-trainer as well as masseur, he said. That just might leave the age-old Govindarajan in a bit of a spot. He also revealed that he would sit with the officials as to forming the team for next season. I want to form a team and get into practice as quickly as possible. However, Ill pay special attention to my defence, he informed. Bhattacharya, it may be recalled, was charged with anti-club activities and subsequently sacked as the coach.  Copyright

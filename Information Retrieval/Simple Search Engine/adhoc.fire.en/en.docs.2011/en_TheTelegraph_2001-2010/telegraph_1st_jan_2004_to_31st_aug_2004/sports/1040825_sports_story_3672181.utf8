 Russians not amused, complain to Rogge
 - Furore over biased judging in gymnastics Athens: Russia lodged a forceful protest with International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Jacques Rogge on Tuesday over what they called biased judging throughout the Athens gymnastics competition. After a people power display, where spectators held up Mondays final horizontal bars event in protest at low marks for Russias Alexei Nemov, Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) president Leonid Tyagachev wrote to Rogge urging him to raise the issue of subjective judging with the IOC executive committee. The example of subjective judging of our gymnasts is so obvious that we no longer have the right to silence, ROC legal chief Tatyana Brilliantova said in a statement. Having looked at the possibility of an appeal against the results, however, she said the ROC had concluded that there was no legal avenue open to them other than to write in complaint. Saying the gymnastics judges understood that they had gone too far in their own subjectivity when they amended Nemovs marks in response to the crowd, Tyagachev wrote to Rogge: We are acting in defence of the interests not only of and indeed not so much of Russian athletes, as much as in the interests of all members of the international Olympic movement. Complaints about judging in gymnastics, where Sexy Alexei Nemov failed to add a 13th Olympic medal to his tally and Svetlana Khorkina was pipped to the all-around gold by American Carly Patterson, come on top of a poor medal showing for Russia. As Tyagachev noted in his letter, South Korea are bitter about a scoring error, acknowledged by the officials, that gave American Paul Hamm gold last week. And Bulgaria has protested against a victory for a Greek gymnast. Khorkina said in defeat: I knew well in advance that I was going to lose. They set me up and fleeced me. In 2002, Russia threatened to pull out of the Salt Lake City Winter Games, saying their team was being victimised by judges. Tyagachev complained of non-objective decisions by judges and officials in figure skating, ice-hockey and cross country. Russia are having a dreadful Games after arriving with hopes that Putins new emphasis on sport after a post-Soviet decline could return them to the top of the medals table with close to 40 golds medals. With six days left, they lie 11th with six, having lost the womens shot put gold after a drugs test.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Srinath open to offer
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: Jawagal Srinath isnt ruling out the possibility of wearing the bowling coachs hat, assuming the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) does offer him that job on the forthcoming tour of Pakistan.Ill definitely consider it, assess what such an offer is really going to hold for me At this moment, though, I cant say anything more, Srinath told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. Its not insignificant, perhaps, that Sourav Ganguly has privately spoken of Srinath being a good option. However, if the captain decides on making a formal representation before the BCCI, he will first have to get coach John Wrights endorsement. Srinath, it appears, is aware of Souravs thoughts. Speaking on his cellphone, he quipped: Actually, if the offer comes my way and I respond positively, the chance of Dada making me play is always going to be there! Unable to regain match fitness, the 34-year-old Srinath retired a shade over three months ago. In a dozen years of top-bracket cricket, he took 236 wickets in Tests and 315 in ODIs. The bowling coachs seat is vacant as Bruce Reid, who did duty during much of Team Indias recent tour of Australia, is unavailable  on account of family commitments and a contract with Hampshire  till September.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Keegan can learn attitude from Owen
 - Manchester City manager parades his vulnerability  BY HENRY WINTER  Keegan needs to calm down The French cockerel was in full strutting mode as Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and Emmanuel Petit toyed with England at the Stade de France, Paris, on September 2, 2000. No shame there, you might think, except England had embarrassingly handicapped themselves through the ineptitude of their then manager, Kevin Keegan. Finally acknowledging the folly of tackling the world and European champions without his best striker, Keegan introduced Michael Owen for Paul Scholes 11 minutes from time. Liverpools little flier promptly equalised, saving the managers blushes. Keegans decision to ignore such a stellar talent as Owens for 79 dispiriting minutes was a defining moment for some powerbrokers within the Football Association. Alarm bells that began ringing at Euro 2000 had grown so loud that ear-drums were bleeding. Within a month, Keegan had resigned, a crushed figure aware of his own weaknesses and the galloping scepticism within the FA and on the terraces. Owen, by contrast, was soon crashing a hattrick past Germany in Munich, assuming the England captaincy (briefly) and even scoring in a World Cup quarter final against Brazil despite being half-lame. The moral of all this is that Owens world-class quality will always shine through eventually, an important point to remember during the Liverpool strikers current barren run. He will emerge from this slump, his goals mocking those who doubted his ability to re-find the target after nine scoreless games. Owens innate gifts, built on quickness of thought and body, will re-establish him as a feared penalty-box force again. But what of Keegan, one of Owens predecessors in Liverpools attack? Keegan Wednesday visits Anfield, where he made his name in the Seventies, returning as a brooding character stalked by doubts following Manchester Citys 13-game stretch without Premiership joy. Keegan has been talking about his role now being to keep the players spirits up. It actually seems that Citys players need to keep their demoralised managers spirits up. Owen is a vastly different individual, far less impetuous than Keegan, far more capable of thinking his way cool-headedly out of a rut. And class will out. Owen will deliver again. At the start of last season, Owen failed to score from open play until the eighth game, prompting conjecture about his form. He then tore City apart, sticking three past Peter Schmeichel at Maine Road. In a manner familiar to Owens admirers, he embarked on a prolific spree, netting four in four. On the field, Owen just needs better service from out wide and through the deployment of a centre-forward sidekick to create space and chances for him. Milan Baros cannot recover fitness soon enough. But the goals will come, far more assuredly than wins will come for Keegan. For Owen shares Alan Shearers toughness and will use that self-belief to come good again. Yet he is also human and any man would be distracted from his professional duties if, like Owen, his partner had been seriously hurt in a horse-riding accident. Owen possesses the mental strength to see him through a troubling period. The body language of Keegan, another committed family man, is far more distressing. People talk about whether Keegan will be sacked after Citys tumble down the Premiership but this bundle of raw nerves tends to walk first. He talks constantly of the pressure he is under, how a parting of the ways may occur if results do not improve. By floating the idea of imminent exit, Keegan risks his words becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Now is the time for him to find some strength. That is what good managers do. Sir Alex Ferguson endures relentless hassle, but he puts on a brave face, showing his players that their leader remains in charge, however wounded. Keegan, the great expressionist, parades his vulnerability at a time when an Owen-style calmness is most required. Their manager may be doing a passable impression of Corporal Jones but not many at City are panicking. The team does not appear bereft of confidence. Citys fans love the warm-hearted Keegan while the board is supportive although mindful that their managers history indicates his tenure could all end in tears very suddenly. It would be wonderful if Keegan relaxed, got his defence sorted out (and Daniel van Buyten and David James will help) and gave Citys wonderful support a season or two in the sun. Keegan has revealed that City will be his last job in management and the landscape of English football would be far more monochrome without this quixotic, very human mix of enthusiasm and introspection. A proud patriotic soul who takes fans criticism to heart, Keegan has never allowed himself to escape the memory of his England failings. As he sits in the Anfield dug-out, Keegan should watch and learn from Owen working so assiduously to turn darkness into light.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

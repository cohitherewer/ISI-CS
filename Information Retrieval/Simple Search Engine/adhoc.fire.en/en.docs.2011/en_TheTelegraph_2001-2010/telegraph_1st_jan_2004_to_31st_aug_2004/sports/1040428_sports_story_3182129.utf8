 India, Pakistan in summit clash 
 India goalkeeper Andrian DSouza celebrates victory in Karachi on Tuesday. (AFP)Karachi: Arch-rivals India and Pakistan set up a final clash after the teams registered contrasting wins in the semi-finals of the fifth junior Asia Cup hockey tournament here on Tuesday. While Pakistan were emphatic in their 5-2 defeat of Malaysia, India had a hard time beating South Korea 4-3 in the second semi-final that was decided on penalty strokes. The final, which is set for Thursday, will be the first clash between the traditional rivals on Pakistani soil in five years. With the victories, both India and Pakistan secured berths in next years junior World Cup to be played in Amstelveen, The Netherlands. Indian, reigning world junior champions, owed the win to their goalkeeper Andrian DSouza who saved two penalty strokes after the energy-sapping match was goalless in the regulation and extra time. DSouza, however, took India to the final by stopping the fourth and fifth penalty strokes from Yong Cheol-shin and Jong Hyun-jang. India lagged behind after their penalty corner expert Sandeep Singh, tournaments top scorer with 14 goals, missed the third penalty stroke but DSouza saved India in the end with two brilliant efforts. Korea will play Malaysia for third-fourth spot. The winners will qualify for the World Cup. In the first semi-final, Pakistans penalty corner expert Imran Warsi scored twice to take his tally to eleven goals but the home team had to wait until the 61st minute to take a decisive two-goal lead as Malaysia threatened to come on level terms with some spirited play. Malaysia stunned the hosts with a fifth-minute field goal when Ismail Abu took full advantage of a sloppy Pakistan defence. Pakistan equalised in the 22nd minute as Warsi struck from his teams second penalty corner. Pakistan then took the lead as early as in the 37th minute when Mahmood Ali scored from a right side move and six minutes later Warsi doubled the lead through a brilliant scoop off the short corner. Abdul Jalil pulled one back for Malaysia in the 49th minute. However, Yasir Islam (61) and Kashif Yaqoob (68th) scored two more goals to seal the fate in Pakistans favour.  (PTI)  Copyright

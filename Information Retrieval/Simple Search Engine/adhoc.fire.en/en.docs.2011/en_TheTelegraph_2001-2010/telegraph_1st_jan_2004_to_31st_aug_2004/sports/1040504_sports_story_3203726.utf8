 Rebels threaten to renew boycott
Harare: Zimbabwes rebels will renew their boycott if the board does not agree to arbitration on the captaincy and other concerns on Tuesday, one of the players has said. If they dont agree, then we walk again, the player, who declined to be named, said on Monday. Arbitration is fair for both sides, and its final and binding. The 15 rebels returned to active duty on Friday, but they have given the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) a deadline of Tuesday to agree to arbitration or face a fresh boycott. The managing director of the ZCU, Vince Hogg, declined to comment on the boards likely response to the players demands. The walkout was sparked when Heath Streaks tenure as Zimbabwe captain ended on April 2 after he questioned the composition of the selection panel.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Major blackout in Greece
Athens: Athens and southern Greece were hit by a major power blackout on Monday, just a month before the Olympic Games are due to begin. Electricity supplies resumed gradually to most affected areas. The breakdown hit at around 12.45 pm, with power coming back 45 minutes later. The power cut occured after the state-owned electricity grids operator took off three power units from the system in southern Greece by mistake. The blackout sparked fears at the IOC that a power cut might hit the Games which open on August 13, despite pledges from the Greek government that there will be no outages during the event.

 Middlesex not to get Kumble
London: Anil Kumble will not be joining Middlesex as their overseas player this summer, it was announced here on Thursday. Vinny Codrington, chief executive of the Middlesex County Cricket Club, said international commitments of the Indian leg-spinner would prevent him from playing for them. Kumble was very keen to come to Middlesex but the Indian board (BCCI) believes that national commitments in the summer would prevent him from playing for us, Codrington said.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Sourav, Sachin will flourish in Pak: Patil
 Very difficult to predict the outcome of the series, says Patil Mumbai: Former Test cricketer and coach Sandeep Patil feels wickets in Pakistan would suit stroke play and that Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly would be back among runs in the forthcoming tour of Pakistan. Patil, who had visited Pakistan twice as a player, said: It is very difficult to predict the outcome of the series but I can assure you that it will be a very exciting one. I have been to Pakistan in 1982 and in 1984 and I can tell you that the tracks over there are harder and the ball comes on to the bat, which will help stroke players such as Sachin and Sourav to flourish, Patil said Friday. On Pakistans talented pace attack, Patil said Indian batsmen should draw confidence from their good show against Australia. After a good showing Down Under, V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid too will be joining the party and Pakistan bowlers will be tested against one of the best batting line-up, he said. Patil, however, cautioned against taking Pakistan too lightly. On Souravs recent statement that India could beat Pakistan even if the team performs 60 per cent of what it did in Australia, Patil said: It is easy to talk but performing is difficult. I have not heard much about their youngsters but we all know that they have a good bowling attack, he said. The former hard-hitting batsman said Indians should not worry about the Pakistani crowd, who he said respects the team that plays good cricket. Kapil ready to help Meanwhile, Kapil Dev said he was ready to help out the fast bowlers going for the Pakistan tour, provided they seek his assistance. The only thing is if they know everything, they will not come to me. If they need something, they will come, Kapil said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne ends up on the losing side
Melbourne: Shane Warne completed his comeback from a 12-month drugs ban as a loser on Thursday, taking match figures of five for 152 for Victoria against Queensland in a second XI match. A slim-looking Warne dropped a caught-and-bowled chance, had two other chances go down in the field and was hit for five sixes. The Australian leg spinner struggled to contain the scoring rate as he took three for 120 from 19.5 overs in Queenslands second innings of 306 for seven from 57.5 overs. Nathan Hauritz (54 not out) hit Warne for a six and a single from the fourth and fifth balls of the final over as the visitors won by three wickets with one delivery to spare. He claimed the wickets of Lee Carseldine, Steven Farrell and Steven Paulsen with some clever bowling. Warnes next match is on Saturday  a one-dayer against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Warne is also set to gain selection in a Victoria state side for the domestic first-class match against Tasmania starting Monday, as he attempts to reclaim his spot in the Australian Test team for next months series against Sri Lanka.

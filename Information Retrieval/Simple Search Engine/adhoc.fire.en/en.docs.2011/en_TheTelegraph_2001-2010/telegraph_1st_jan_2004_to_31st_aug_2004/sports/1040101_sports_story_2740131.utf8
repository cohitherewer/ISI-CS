The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Umar, Kamal for ODIs in NZ too
Karachi: Pakistan batsmen Taufeeq Umar and Asim Kamal will remain with the 17-man squad in New Zealand for the five-match one-day series against the Black Caps to gain experience, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Wednesday. The board has decided after consultations with the team management and selectors that all 17 players presently in New Zealand will remain there for the one-day series, said PCB chief executive Rameez Raja. The team management has informed us that Taufeeq and Kamal are not in the starting line-up for the five one-day games and have been retained for experience sake, he said. Pakistan beat New Zealand 5-0 in a recent series at home and then won the two-match Test series 1-0 with a seven-wicket victory in the second Test in Wellington on Monday. The first game is on Saturday. THE SQUAD Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Imran Farhat, Yasir Hameed, Yusuf Youhana, Younis Khan, Saleem Elahi, Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq, Azhar Mahmood, Moin Khan, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Umar Gul, Danish Kaneria, Taufeeq Umar, Asim Kamal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 September date for Indo-Pak hockey Tests
New Delhi: After cricket, India and Pakistan will slug it out in hockey. In a first-of-its kind in five years, India will host a four-match Test series against the arch-rivals in September and then will cross the border to play the same number of matches in Pakistan, according to Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) chief K. P. S. Gill. The Test series will be an annual affair, Gill said. Gill also said he would not contest for a fourth term when the IHF goes for election in 2006. Meanwhile, Asias top clubs will face off in Singapore in October in the Asian Club Champions Cup, which has been revived after an eight-year hiatus, adds a report from Singapore. The Asian Hockey Federations competitions committee, at its meeting in Karachi on April 28, approved the Singapore Hockey Federations bid to host the third edition of the meet from October 6-10.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Self-belief, intensity key for India
 - Australia somewhat ahead, but the finals should go the distance: Greg Chappell  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Greg Chappell Calcutta: Australia, in former captain Greg Chappells opinion, are somewhat ahead in the lead-up to the tri-series finals, but self-belief could make the difference for Team India. The Indians played very well at the start of the competition, yet appeared to ease off once their presence in the finals was confirmed So, besides being high on self-belief, they must regain intensity, Greg told The Telegraph, when contacted in Sydney. Speaking on Thursday afternoon, hours before the first final at the MCG, he added: Initially, the intensity of the Test series was visible in the one-dayers In time, though, that dropped Basically, that intensity should again be evident. Otherwise, Australia will force a quick finish Elaborating, Greg continued: Bottomline is that weve got to look at the mind-set, which must be positive, allowing the Indians to back themselves After all, nothing works better than self-belief. Significantly, he expects the finals to go the distance. I think the decider is going to be at the Gabba (on Tuesday) I dont expect the finals to get over on Sunday itself (at the SCG) In fact, the first 15 overs on Friday will offer some clue as to what to expect Greg acknowledged Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden hadnt got the runs Australia were hoping for, but pointed out that had been set right by Adam Gilchrist and Andrew Symonds. Australia havent scored as many runs as most expected, but the batting hasnt been fragile After a disappointing Test series, Gilchrist has truly been outstanding. Symonds hasnt been far behind. Greg didnt dwell too much on the Australian bowling, but did talk about Brett Lees explosive outing in Perth. The tearaway finished with three for 22, his victims being Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman and Rohan Gavaskar. Lees burst has definitely been a big plus for Australia and India shouldnt allow him to grow in confidence. If he does, then Speaking of the Indians, Greg felt contributions from Sachin and Virender Sehwag, in particular, would be critical. Perhaps, they didnt exactly switch-on in the last two matches, but both are big-time players and that cant be discounted Given the responsibility that openers have, their contribution is going to be critical Laxmans as well I doubt if he has ever batted better. Greg, by the way, had a word of advice for Sourav Ganguly. He must return to the Gabba mind-set, when he got 144 excellent runs in that first Test Be it one-dayers or Test cricket, the basics never change Sourav needs to back himself and, just as important, realise that while batsmen have a fondness for certain shots, those shots may not always be productive. Incidentally, Greg isnt sure of the impact Anil Kumble can make  assuming he overcomes heavy odds to make the XI. Look, Kumble has been off for some weeks Even if he plays, then, he is bound to be rusty in the early overs. Therefore, its difficult predicting the contribution he may make Signing off with praise for young Irfan Pathan, Team Indias find of the tour, Greg said: As long as he keeps learning, from every outing, he is sure to go far. Ive liked the way he has accepted respons-ibility. Who knows, over the next few days, Pathan could make an even better impression.  Copyright

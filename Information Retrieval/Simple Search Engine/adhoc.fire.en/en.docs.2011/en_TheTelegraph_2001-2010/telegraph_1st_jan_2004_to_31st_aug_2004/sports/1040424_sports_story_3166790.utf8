The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bad night for strikers
 - UEFA CUP SEMI-FINALS - Both matches finish goalless  Villarreals Juliano Belletti (left) in a tussle with Valencias Amadeo Carboni during their Uefa Cup semi-final first leg match in Villarreal on Thursday. (AFP) London: Newcastle United and Olympique Marseille drew 0-0 and the Spanish derby between Villarreal and Valencia also finished goalless on a bad night for strikers in Thursdays Uefa Cup semi-finals. Both places in the May 19 final in Gothenburg will be up for grabs in the second legs in two weeks, with favourites Marseille and Valencia facing the double-edged sword of home advantage but a potential exit on the away goals rule. An injury-hit Newcastle enjoyed the lions share of possession at St James Park and missed good chances through Shola Ameobi and Gary Speed with France keeper Fabien Barthez at their mercy. But Marseille came closest to breaking the deadlock when a spectacular left-foot volley by striker Didier Drogba smacked against the inside of Shay Givens post and bounced out. Despite the setback, Newcastle boss Bobby Robson remained upbeat about his teams chances of reaching the final and perhaps lifting their first major trophy since 1969. Marseille manager Jose Anigo is clearly counting on the cauldron-like atmosphere in the French port city to turn the second leg his teams way. European champions in 1993, Marseille reached the Uefa Cup final in 1999. Villarreal, playing in Europe for the first time, extended a remarkable defensive record of keeping a clean sheet in all nine home ties in a campaign that began last July in the Intertoto Cup. They faded after a bright start on Thursday and Primera Liga leaders Valencia were also left to curse the woodwork after midfielder Ruben Baraja rattled the crossbar with a powerful header in the second half.

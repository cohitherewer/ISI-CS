The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tough for Bagan, tougher for Md. Sp.
 - NFL - Brazilian duo unavailable; Tragedy-struck Basudeb to play  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Noel Kasak and Ashim Biswas discuss a point during practice at the Mohun Bagan ground on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Feb. 21: Neither team is in too comfortable a position. For Mohun Bagan its an uphill grind towards National Football League respectability, while Mohammedan Sporting is fighting to save relegation. But both teams will leave no stones unturned to make a winning start to their second phase campaign at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. The green-and-maroon brigade is surely under more pressure. After the departure of Jose Ramirez Barreto, there hasnt been too much to show for them. But coach Aloke Mukherjee looked determined to change the trend after practice on match-eve. Barreto is a thing of the past weve got to win, thats all, Mukherjee said. He accepted, though, that his team will be under some sort of pressure. Yes, my boys are under pressure, but Im confident they have it in them to come out with flying colours. Noel Kasak, Mohun Bagans Zimbabwean recruit will feature in the first XI. He is a good player Theres no reason why he shouldnt perform. They will, however, not get the services of the Brazilians Leonardo (double booking) and Eduardo, who hasnt returned from his homeland. Meanwhile, Basudeb Mondal lost his father on Saturday and the playmaker wasnt present at the practice. Were leaving it to him, the coach added. Later, it was known that the playmaker would play despite his personal tragedy. Mohun Bagan will play in the 4-5-1 formation, with Ashim Biswas as the single striker. Mohammedan Sportings preparations had been hampered for the last couple of days after the players boycotted practice following the non-payment of dues. But they were back at the ground working under coach Jamshed Nassiri on Saturday. Things have been resolved Our aim is to make a good start, senior player Dipendu Biswas said. The black-and-white brigade, however, will not get the services of Hussein Mustafi and Iqbal Shahnawaz Khan (injured) and Okoli Odafa Onyeka (double booking). A couple of good results here will take us out of the relegation zoneIm sure the boys will give it their best shot, Nassiri said. Meanwhile, Ashim and Dipendu have quit their respective services and become full-time pros.  Copyright

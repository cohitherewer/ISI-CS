Berlin: Some 185 former East German athletes whose health was ruined by performance-boosting drugs they took unknowingly or against their will have qualified for payments from a compensation fund, the German government said. Each former athlete has received $12,087 from the $2.5 million government fund set up in 2002 to help pay their medical bills, the interior ministry said. Four applications are pending and another 111 were rejected due to weak supporting evidence. No names were released. 				 																																	The government estimated that about 1,000 of the 10,000 east German athletes who were doped suffered serious health damage in the systematic programme that turned east Germany into a sports powerhouse in the 1970s and 80s.				 																																	Caracas: Former WBA middleweight champion Felix Tito Trinidad is ready to come out of retirement under the right terms for a bout against rival Oscar De La Hoya, promoter Don King said Saturday. King, visiting Venezuela for an anti-drug charity boxing event, the Puerto Rican was prepared to return to the ring.				 																																	The reason he retired is because Bernard Hopkins would not give him a rematch. So now Tito has said if they meet his requirements, he will come back and he will fight Oscar de la Hoya, King said.

Paris: France coach Jacques Santini faces a selection problem after Djibril Cisses five-match ban was confirmed by Uefa on Friday, leaving the AJ Auxerre striker with no chance of taking part in Euro 2004. Cisse, 22, was potentially the perfect deputy for Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet in a squad which now lacks strength up front.

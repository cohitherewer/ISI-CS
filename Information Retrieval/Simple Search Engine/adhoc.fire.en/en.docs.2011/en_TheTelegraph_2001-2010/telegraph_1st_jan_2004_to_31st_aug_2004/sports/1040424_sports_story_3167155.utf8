The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India beat Uzbekistan
New Delhi: Sania Mirza and Manisha Malhotra scored a thrilling doubles win to give India a 2-1 win over Uzbekistan in the Fed Cup tennis competition here on Friday. This was a fine recovery after Indias 1-2 loss against Indonesia on Thursday. Sania and Manisha defeated Vlada Ekshibarova and Ivanna Isroilova 7-6 (21-19), 6-1 in a rain interrupted match in the Asia-Oceania Zone, Group I. Earlier, Sania helped India level the scores 1-1 with her 6-4, 6-2 defeat of a half-fit Akgul Amanmuradova after Ankita Bhambri lost 4-6, 4-6 to Ivanna Isroilova. Indias fate to advance to the knockout stage still hangs in balance. India and Korea are locked in terms of ties and matches won, but the latter have more number of sets to their credit. Wynne Prakusya did the Indians a huge favour by beating Mi-Ra Jeon 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 after Jin-Hee Kim had beaten Sandy Gumulya 6-3, 6-3 in the singles. Angelique Widjaja and Wynne Prakusya clinched the deciding doubles rubber to give Indonesia a 2-1 victory over India. Widjaja and Prakusya defeated Manisha Malhotra and Sania Mirza 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 to quell Indias hopes of finishing top of pool A in the Asia-Oceania Zone Group I tie on a truncated day.

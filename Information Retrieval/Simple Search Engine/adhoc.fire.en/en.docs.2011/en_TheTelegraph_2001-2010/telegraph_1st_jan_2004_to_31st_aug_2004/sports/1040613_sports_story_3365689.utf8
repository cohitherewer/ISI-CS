 Subrata in the dark as Bagan begin practice 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata Calcutta, June 12: The first day of Mohun Bagans practice for the new season turned out to be a damp squib. Technical director (TD) Subrata Bhattacharya was present, without actually being notified about the session with footballers. I wasnt told that practice would begin today I had gone to the club as I do most mornings, he said. With just four footballers  Basudeb Mondal, Mehtab Hussain, Palash Karmakar and Sanjeev Maria  fetching up, there was precious little the TD could do. How can I have a practice session with four players? Maybe, the other players were in the dark, like me. Having guided Mohun Bagan to safety after taking charge at the fag end of the 8th NFL with the team still very much in relegation zone, Bhattacharya refused to look ahead to the new season. I still dont know the final composition of the team Let me talk with the officials first. AIFF rankings The AIFF has published its first all-India rankings and the state figures on top of both lists. Bengal, with 237 points, are No. 1 in the state list while Mohun Bagan (65) head the clubs chart. Points from the NFL (divisions I and II), Santosh Trophy and Federation Cup have been considered for state rankings, while the NFL, Asian Club Cup and other AFC-organised meets have been evaluated for club rankings. The reason Mohun Bagan are numero uno despite a shocking season is that these rankings are based on performances from the 1996-97 season to 2002-03. East Bengal are No. 2, but will surely displace their arch-rivals. THE TOP FIVE (1996-97 to 2002-03) STATES: Bengal (237), Goa (181), Kerala (58), Maharashtra (51), Punjab (37). CLUBS: Mohun Bagan (65), East Bengal (55), Salgaocar (44), Churchill Brothers (41), Vasco (19).  Copyright

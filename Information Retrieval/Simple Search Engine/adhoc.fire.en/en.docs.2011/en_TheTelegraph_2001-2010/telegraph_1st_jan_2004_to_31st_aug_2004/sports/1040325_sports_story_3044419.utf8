The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Guga maintains boycott 
Rio de Janeiro: Brazil No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten is maintaining his Davis Cup boycott as a deadline set by the countrys tennis federation approaches. The three-time French Open champion is refusing to play in next months American zone match against Paraguay in protest at the administration of Brazilian Tennis Confederation (CBT) president Nelson Nastas. Teammates Flavio Saretta, Andre Sa and Ricardo Mello have joined Kuertens protest while Jaime Oncins, who was appointed as team captain in February to replace Ricardo Acioly, has resigned in solidarity. The sacking of Acioly was the breaking-point in the relationship between the players and the CBF. There isnt a favourable atmosphere for playing in the Davis Cup with these directors, said Kuerten, whose comments were made at a media conference in Miami and reproduced on his official website. Kuertens remarks came hours after Nastas, who last week offered an olive branch by saying he would bring forward the CBT elections to May, said he was giving the players until Wednesday afternoon to respond. I dont understand their silence, Nastas said. Ive now done everything which had to be done. Its not me that theyre hurting. Its Brazilian tennis which is being damaged. Nastas, who has been in charge for 10 years, had also promised not to stand in the elections, which had originally been scheduled for December. But Kuerten replied that he wanted the president to resign immediately. (Reuters)  Copyright

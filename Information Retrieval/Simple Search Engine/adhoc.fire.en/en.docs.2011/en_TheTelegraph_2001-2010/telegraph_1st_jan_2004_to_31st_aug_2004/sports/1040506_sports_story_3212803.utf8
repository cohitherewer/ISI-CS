 Arsenal preserve unbeaten record
 - Gunners now 180 minutes from becoming 1st team to end 38-game season without loss  FROM JOHN LEY IN PORTSMOUTH  Portsmouths John Curtis (right) tackles Arsenals Freddie Ljungberg in Portsmouth on Tuesday. (Reuters) Thirty-six down, two to go. Arsenals march towards a remarkable unbeaten season and a place in history continued in the rain at Fratton Park last night, thanks to a second-half equaliser from Jose Antonio Reyes. Early in the season, Portsmouth spoiled Arsenals perfect start  their best since 1947  when they drew at Highbury to end a sequence of four wins. And, for 45 minutes on Tuesday, Portsmouth threatened one of footballs great records thanks to Ayegbeni Yakubus 31st-minute goal. Arsenals resilience, however, is legendary and now they are 180 minutes  with games at Fulham and at home to Leicester  away from becoming the first team to go a 38-game season without defeat and only the third team in history to avoid a single loss. A year to the day that Arsenal last suffered a reverse in thePremiership, manager Arsene Wenger made two changes, offering David Bentley his Premiership debut, for the rested Dennis Bergkamp, while Ray Parlour came in for Gilberto Silva. Since that 2-3 defeat at Highbury, by Leeds, Arsenal have dominated the domestic game, extending their unbeaten run with Saturdays goalless draw against Birmingham. From the team that won the championship, Arsenal were also missing Edu, Robert Pires and Sylvain Wiltord, but there was no respite for the likes of Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell. Bentleys only previous starts this season were in the Carling Cup, though he scored a memorable goal in the FA Cup when Arsenal beat Middlesbrough 4-1 in January after coming on as a substitute. Though Portsmouth had ruined Arsenals start to the season, they suffered in pain when Wengers team were last here, in the FA Cup. Harry Redknapp, the Portsmouth manager, reckoned that when Arsenal won 5-1 they could go on to win the title, the Champions League and even the Boat Race. The early signs, on a pitch wet enough to accommodate a University Eight, were that Arsenal could administer a similarly daunting lesson. Bentley made an early impression with a 30-yard drive not far wide and then, from Henrys cross, Freddie Ljungberg had an attempt blocked, the ball fell to Parlour and his 25-yard shot was tipped over from under the Portsmouth crossbar by Shaka Hislop. Portsmouth, having secured another season in the Premiership  against the odds  with the 1-1 draw with Fulham on Saturday, twice caught out the visiting defenders with their pace early on. Firstly, Yakubu stole the ball off Cole, saw Parlour slip in a Fratton Park puddle, but Jens Lehmann stretched to save. Then Lomana LuaLua dispossessed Campbell but sent his shot just wide. It was an exhilarating start and it continued when Ljungberg set up Reyes, whose volley was only just off target. Hislop needed to be at his best again when Reyes won a corner, and then the young Spaniard struck the crossbar via a deflection. But, in 31st minute, Portsmouth took the lead. Just as the Portsmouth fans were singing Were gonna sign Henry, local favourite Yakubu chased Matthew Taylors long ball, it bounced off Kolo Toures head and the Nigerian squeezed the ball between Lehmann and his near post. Arsenal came out for the second period in the knowledge that in seven previous Premiership matches this season  including the 1-1 draw against Portsmouth in September  they had come from behind to avoid defeat. Within four minutes, Ljungberg set up Henry but Hislop pushed the attempt on to the angle of right post and bar. The ball was cleared for a corner, Henry was able to return it into the middle and parity was restored when Reyes claimed his first Premiership goal with a low, left-foot volley from 15 yards.

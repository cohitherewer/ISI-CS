(AFP) Southampton: US Masters champion Phil Mickelson stayed in contention for the 104th US Open, carding a two-under-par 68 in the weather-delayed first round on Friday. A par at the last left the 34-year-old American two strokes behind joint leaders Jay Haas, Shigeki Maruyama and Angel Cabrera of Argentina. Two under overnight after early evening fog had halted play at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Mickelson offset a bogey-four at the treacherous seventh with a birdie at the par-four eighth on a cloudy but calm morning. It wasnt easy sleeping last night knowing I had to return to seven this morning, Mickelson said of one of Shinnecocks most difficult holes. Although I dropped a shot there, I got it back with a 35-footer on eight. This gives me a chance with better scoring conditions early on Friday. Im feeling good and Ive been swinging with confidence all year. The big-hitting Cabrera, one of 57 players in the 156-strong field who could not complete their first rounds on Thursday, briefly moved one shot clear with an early birdie at the par-four 14th. Although he slipped back with a double-bogey six at the 403-yard 15th, he rallied with another birdie at the 540-yard 16th before completing a 66. American Jay Haas, bidding to become the oldest winner of a major championship, upstaged Tiger Woods and Ernie Els to share the US Open first-round lead on Thursday. The 50-year-old took full advantage of surprisingly calm morning conditions, mixing five birdies with a solitary bogey at the par-three second on his way to a four-under-par 66. I hit a lot of great shots, kept the ball in play and made quite a few putts, Haas, who has produced four top-10 finishes in 24 US Open starts, said. I was pretty sharp out there today. Haas, who has set his sights on playing at the Ryder Cup this year for the third time, would eclipse Julius Boros as golfs oldest major winner should he win at Shinnecock on Sunday. World No. 1 Woods, however, struggled in the fast-running conditions and had to settle for an opening two-over-par 72. Twice-champion Els hit back from a poor start to card a 70. Three-time major winner Els, who replaced Singh earlier this month as world No. 2 after winning the Memorial Tournament, began poorly with a double-bogey on 11 and another dropped shot on 12. However, he hauled himself back into contention with birdies on 14, 17, one and five, his only other blemish a bogey-five at the 435-yard fourth. Fijis Vijai Singh, who had been two under overnight after 14, parred the last four holes for a 68, joining Mickelson and British Open champion Ben Curtis among a group of nine.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latifs book to reveal fixing details
Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif Tuesday said he will reveal some sensational details about match-fixing in his book, which he expects to be published in September. It wont be an ordinary book, it will have lots of stuff on match-fixing, Latif said from Karachi. There would be lots of off the field incidents in the book. It wont be like other books in which players only give details how they scored runs, took catches and claimed wickets. Without naming an official or a player from any country, Latif said that there were lots of people involved in fixing matches. There are so many officials and players, you have to wait until September, he said. But match-fixing has been curtailed after the ICC established the Anti Corruption Unit. A whistleblower and campaigner against bribery since the match-fixing scandal rocked cricket in 2000, Latif described the ongoing problem plaguing the sport is fancy-fixing. Fancy-fixing does not necessarily affect the result of the match, but according to Latif there could be betting on how many runs a team would score in 15 overs in an ODI, when only two players are allowed to field outside the circle. I dont think nowadays there is any match-fixing going on, but fancy-fixing is prevalent all over the world, Latif said. Latif became captain for the second time after Pakistan failed to go beyond the first round in the World Cup in South Africa. He led Pakistan successfully in the Sharjah Cup in April last year before guiding his team to the final of a tri-series in Sri Lanka. However, he was banned for five one-day Internationals for claiming a false catch against Bangladesh in the third Test in Multan, and Inzamam-ul-Haq replaced him. Latif was not considered in the preliminary squad of 24 announced for next months historic series India. Latif scored 1,381 runs in 37 Tests and took 119 catches and 11 stumpings. In 166 ODIs, Latif took 182 catches and scored 1,709 runs.  (AP)  Copyright

 Rusedski may get a ranking boost
London: British No.2 Greg Rusedski could receive a ranking boost as consolation after he was cleared of being a drugs cheat, his lawyer said on Tuesday. Ranked 100th in the world, Rusedski faces having to qualify for the major meets, including Wimbledon, unless he can strike a deal with the ATP  the sports governing body blamed for his positive nandrolone test. Greg is discussing with the ATP how he returns to tennis. They (the talks) are at an early stage, Mark Gay said at Londons Queens Club. Asked whether an improved ranking was on the agenda, Gay added: That is one factor... there are many others. Neither Rusedski nor his lawyer would reveal details of the talks being held with the ATP. Right now we are trying to come to an agreement which hasnt happened yet, Rusedski said. Once we know the agreement we will figure it out and go from there but they have to be able to do something satisfactory to get my career back. I hope that this is resolved in the next two days to a week because I need to get back to my tennis. Rusedski tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone at a tournament in Indianapolis last July. His life has been in turmoil since he was notified of the positive test at Britains Davis Cup match against Morocco last September. He suffered six months of anguish before an ATP-appointed independent tribunal cleared him of any wrongdoing earlier this month. When I was told I had tested positive, I could hardly speak, the 30-year-old said. I knew I was innocent from day one. I knew I had done nothing wrong. Every single player from Andre Agassi to Lleyton Hewitt takes supplements. It is very difficult as a player to get through day to day and you need supplements because of all the travel and the rigid lifestyle. You cant survive on bread and water and when you take into consideration that you might be playing in 100 degree heat you need something to replace the fluids you are losing. Rusedskis lawyer said it was those supplements, supplied by the ATP to the players, which had caused his positive test. Gay cited a unique fingerprint that linked Rusedskis positive result with that of other male players who have tested positive for nandrolone. (Reuters)  Copyright

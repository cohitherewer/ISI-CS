The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dhoni, Powar in for must-win tie
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dhoni may be used as a medium-pacer Calcutta: East Zone need nothing less than a win against England A in the four-day tie beginning in Amritsar on Friday, to make the Duleep Trophy final. East have one point, courtesy the first innings lead against South in their opening match. But South upset the equation with a stunning outright win over England A to move to two points. If two teams finish on equal points, number of outright wins will break the tie ahead of the head-to-head count and hence, only a victory will get the Deodhar Trophy champions a ticket to the final. There are going to be two changes to the East XI that played against South in Jalandhar. Rohan Gavaskar is unwell, according to skipper Devang Gandhi, and Kiran Powar of Assam replaces him. Bihars M.S. Dhoni is the second change  in place of his statemate Rajeev Kumar  in the XI. The Bihar wicketkeeper will open the innings, but Deep Dasgupta will don the big gloves. East coach Karsan Ghavri said the wicket looked green on Thursday evening. If the grass stays, seamers will call the shots. So I think to win, we have to rely on our quicker bowlers. There seems to be very little for the spinners, said the Bengal coach. He added that apart from Debashish Mohanty, Shib Shankar Paul and Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Dhoni will also be counted as a seam bowler. He is a wicketkeeper-batsman, but can bowl medium-pacers too. Even if not as a quick bowler, Dhonis inclusion, along with that of Powar, should bolster Easts batting, which didnt fire on all cylinders in the first game in Jalandhar. Shiv Sundar Das got a hundred in that game, and Shukla a precious 84 part from Arindam Das half-century. However, despite their efforts, not many of the middle-order batsmen clicked.  Copyright

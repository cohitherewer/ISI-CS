 Murali pitches for Warne: Gilchrist
Kandy: Shane Warne will revel on pitches tailor-made for his arch-rival Muttiah Muralidharan and Sri Lankas curators are playing right into his hands, says Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist. The pitch for the first Test in Galle last week was dry, dusty and favoured spin, with Muralidharan taking 11 for 212, but Warne returned the compliment with a match-winning haul of ten for 159. Ground staff in Kandy were working hard to ensure another dry, turning wicket for the second Test starting Tuesday, where Murali is again expected to show his magic. But Warne is up to the challenge, says Gilchrist. He seemed to have more all-round energy in everything he did, Gilchrist said of Warnes comeback. His stock delivery that he was running in and bowling had more revolutions .... And more venom in everything that he did. Gilchrist said he couldnt be sure if Warnes enthusiasm was because hed spent 12 months on the sidelines since testing positive to diuretics, or simply because he was back in the Test arena.

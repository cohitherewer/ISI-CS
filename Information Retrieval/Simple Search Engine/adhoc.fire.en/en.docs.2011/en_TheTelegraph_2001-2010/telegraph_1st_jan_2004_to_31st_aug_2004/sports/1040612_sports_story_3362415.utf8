 Kapil Dev stresses on injury prevention
 Kapil Dev gives some pointers to Ashish Nehra at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore on Friday (AFP) Bangalore: Kapil Dev said on Friday that guarding the body against injuries is the most important task for cricketers of the present era. Kapil, here as a consultant at the fitness camp for Indian fast bowlers, explained why staying fit is so important. Getting 100 runs or five wickets is not important. Keeping your body fit is, to play longer, said the legend, who had a near-spotless fitness report during his playing days. On his current assignment, Kapil said: Whatever I have learnt, I will pass on to them. If they are ready to take it, I leave it to them. It will be good if they apply it. My job is to try and give them whatever I have learnt from others. The rest for them is hard work. Kapil refused to comment on the issue of appointing a bowling coach. I am not interested in these talks. India had Bruce Reid as bowling coach for a short while during the tour of Australia. The former India captain interacted with bowlers in a closed doors session and was also seen at the nets. Kapil was invited to the camp before the teams tour of Pakistan earlier this year, but refused to take any credit. It is their own ability, he said about the bowlers good showing in Pakistan. Kapil declined to assess the level of fitness of the bowlers. In one or two days we cant say anything. I think they have to work hard individually, depending on their body strength. He added that all the bowlers are conscious of this aspect. Pathan sees Asia Cup Irfan Pathan, meanwhile, is looking forward to the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. He added all the praise after the Pakistan tour has not gone into his head. Pathan even refused to believe that he earned the India cap rather early. I waited for more than one-and-half years after representing the country at the junior level. It did not come so quickly. The left-armer clarified that bowling is the area he is working on and not pushing himself to become an allrounder. Batting will automatically come.  (PTI)  Copyright

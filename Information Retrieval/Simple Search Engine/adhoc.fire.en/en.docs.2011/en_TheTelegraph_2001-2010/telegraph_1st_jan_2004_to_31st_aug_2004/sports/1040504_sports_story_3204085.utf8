The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rain heralds Ancelotti rebirth
Rome: AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said winning his first Italian league title as coach made up for the misery of ending up a loser when he was in charge of Juventus. Milan wrapped up their 17th league title on Sunday after winning at home against Roma. This time Ancelotti was singing in the rain, unlike four years ago when his championship hopes were washed away in Umbria. This rain is certainly sweeter, he said after Andryi Shevchenkos second-minute winner gave Milan a 1-0 victory at the San Siro and left them nine points clear of Roma with two matches left. The rain in Perugia was like acid on my skin. I was burning for a long time, but Im not burning anymore. Lazio had pinched the title from Juventus on that final day of the 2000-01 season. Trailing Juventus by two points, Lazio needed to beat Reggina and hope their title rivals lost at Perugia. Lazio thumped Reggina 3-0 but they had to wait until the conclusion of Juventus match in Umbria where the second half was suspended for 82 minutes due to torrential rain. Referee Pierluigi Collina was considering replaying the match when the rain suddenly stopped and the sun broke out. He restarted the match and the Lazio players watched the delayed second half on television in one of the most bizarre climaxes to a football season. Perugia went ahead in the 49th minute thanks to a superb finish from Alessandro Calori and held on to deny Juventus on a quagmire of a pitch, prompting a huge party at the Olympic Stadium. Delighted to lay the ghost of 2000-01, Ancelotti said: Apart from a few inevitable mistakes we have been brilliant in the big games and that is where the difference lie. (AFP)  Copyright

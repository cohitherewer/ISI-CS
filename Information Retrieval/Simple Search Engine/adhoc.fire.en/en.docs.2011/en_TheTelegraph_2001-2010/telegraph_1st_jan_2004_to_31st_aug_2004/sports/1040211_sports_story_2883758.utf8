The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I had to protect my boys: Paes
New Delhi: Terming the sledging incident he got involved in against New Zealand during a Davis Cup match as a tit for tat to what was initiated by the home team, Indian captain Leander Paes said on Wednesday: If the opposition captain is going to have a go at one of my younger teammates, in this case 20-year-old Vishal Punna, then I am going to do whatever it takes to protect my boy. We have to accept that sledging is common practice in that part of the world and we have to be ready for that, Paes said. I dont know about others but I will stand up to that sort of thing and I think at the end of the day we played with pride, self-respect and dignity. Paes said his sledging of New Zealand debutant Simon Rea had less to do with the pressures of a deciding match and the Kiwis tactics backfired on them. Perhaps it was (because of playing the fifth and deciding match) but Vishal was very upset. I tried to put my arm around his shoulders and comfort him. And then they did the same thing to me as well. But they chose the wrong guy. These things only motivate me to give my best, Leander said. (PTI)  Copyright

 Argentine wait ends
	 - Nine-man Paraguay lose 0-1  Argentinas Carlos Tevez, who scored the matchwinner against Paraguay, celebrates on the podium in Athens on Friday. (Reuters) Athens: Argentina comfortably beat nine-man Paraguay 1-0 in the final of the mens soccer tournament on Saturday to win their first Olympic gold medal in 52 years. Carlos Tevez clinically tucked in a Mauro Rosales cross in the 18th minute of an ill-tempered South American clash dominated by Argentina before 44,000 at the Olympic Stadium. It was the Boca Juniors playmakers eighth goal of the competition for Argentina, who finished with a perfect record of six wins out of six, scoring 17 goals without reply. Paraguay had Emilio Martinez sent off in the 66th minute for elbowing Andres DAlessandro in the face and their misery was compounded seven minutes from time when Diego Figueredo was dismissed for a second bookable offence. Argentina had not won an Olympic gold in any sport since Tranquilo Capozzo and Eduardo Guerrero took the mens double sculls rowing title at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Paraguays silver was the first Olympic medal in the countrys history. Meanwhile, Iraqi dreams of winning only their second Olympic medal were shattered on Friday when Italy beat them 1-0 in a mens soccer bronze match overshadowed by the killing of an Italian hostage in Iraq. Italys players wore black armbands in honour of journalist Enzo Baldoni, and Iraqi captain Abdul Wahab presented his counterpart Andrea Pirlo with a bouquet of flowers in a touching gesture before the game.

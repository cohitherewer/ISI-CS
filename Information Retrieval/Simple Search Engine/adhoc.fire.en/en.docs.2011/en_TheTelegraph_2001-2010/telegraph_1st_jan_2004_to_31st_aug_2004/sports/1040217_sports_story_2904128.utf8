 Magistrate rules out Pantani suicide
 4 types of tranquilisers were found near Pantanis body Rome: A magistrate said on Sunday he believed that Marco Pantani, the Italian cycling great found dead in a hotel room, did not commit suicide although a definitive answer will come only after an autopsy. No-one is talking about suicide and I exclude everything until the end of the autopsy, Paolo Gengarelli, who is investigating the mysterious death, said in the central Italian city of Rimini. He said only the autopsy, scheduled for Monday, could tell for sure what caused the death of the 34-year-old rider, who won the Giro dItalia and the Tour de France in 1998. Police in the Adriatic resort city have ruled out violence and said there were no illegal drugs in the room when Pantanis body was discovered on Saturday night. They told a news conference four types of tranquillisers were found near the body and in the kitchen section. Some 10 packages of prescription sedatives were found, some empty and some started. Italian media reported that anti-depressants also were found. A staff member at the hotel in Rimini, just down the coast from Pantanis home town of Cesenatico, found him on the floor. He was wearing jeans and was naked from the waist up. Gengarelli earlier said that Pantani, who had been treated at a clinic recently for depression, had written some thoughts on hotel stationery but it was not a farewell note.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

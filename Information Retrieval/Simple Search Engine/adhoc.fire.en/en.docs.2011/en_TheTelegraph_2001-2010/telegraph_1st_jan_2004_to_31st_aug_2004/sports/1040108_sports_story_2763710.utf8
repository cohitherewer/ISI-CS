The Telegraph - Calcutta
 New-look India face Germany
 - Coach Harendra expects youngsters to come good in Kuala Lumpur  Pillay should be a source of inspiration for teammates Kuala Lumpur: An under-strength Indian team would be tested to the hilt when they take on formidable opponents in the seven-nation Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament, starting on Thursday. India, fielding a new-look side in a bid to experiment with new combinations before the Olympics qualifiers, face Germany in their opening match, the outcome of which would give enough indication of things in store for the inexperienced side in the prestigious 11-day tournament. Few would readily back India to win the event that also serves as a dress rehearsal for four of the teams  India, Pakistan, Malaysia and Spain, who will travel to Madrid in March for the Olympic qualifiers. While the Indians have opted for a side consisting predominantly of junior players, the others  World Cup champions Germany, Asian Games gold medallists Korea, World Cup silver medallists Australia, Pakistan, Spain and Malaysia  will all be at full strength. The Indians have obviously seen this event, which they have won thrice (1985, 91, 95), as part of their preparations for the Madrid outing and from there on to the Athen Olympics in August. With the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) resting several key players, Indian hopes here would rest on the experience of Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon whom the younger players will look up to. Though some of the younger lot have had a taste of international competition. Viewed in this light, Indias chances of figuring on the podium under coach Harendra Singh, are not bright. Harendra, standing in for chief coach Rajinder Singh who is here as an IHF observer, will have his task cut out. We have a young side and I am hopeful of a strong showing in this tournament, said the coach. The guarded optimism is not misplaced considering the strength of the other teams. Germany, coached by Bernhard Peters, are on a high. They have qualified for the Olympics by winning the European Cup and are also playing at the same venue where they annexed the World Cup in 2002, beating Australia in the final.  (PTI)  Copyright

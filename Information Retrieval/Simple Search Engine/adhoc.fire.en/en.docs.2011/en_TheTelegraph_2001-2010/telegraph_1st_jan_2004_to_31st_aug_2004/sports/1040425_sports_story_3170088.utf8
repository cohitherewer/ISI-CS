 India lose to Thailand 
New Delhi, April 24 (PTI): India lost 0-2 to top seeds Thailand in knockout round of the Fed Cup womens team tennis competition on Saturday. The difference in standards between the two teams was all too embarrassing as first Suchanan Viratprasert subdued Sania Mirza 7-6 (7-3), 6-1, and then world No. 54 Tamarine Tanasugarn swept past Rushmi Chakravarthy 6-0, 6-1. The inconsequential doubles rubber was cancelled. Thailand thus advanced to the World Group play-off while India remained in group I. Captain Enrico Piperno said he was very satisfied with the teams performance this week. I am very satisfied. Ankita (Bhambri) winning three matches, and given the team we had and the injuries, I think we had a great week, he said. Piperno played Rushmi for the first time this week. With the Chennai girl being the highest ranked in the Indian team, that meant Sania was the No. 2 player.  Copyright

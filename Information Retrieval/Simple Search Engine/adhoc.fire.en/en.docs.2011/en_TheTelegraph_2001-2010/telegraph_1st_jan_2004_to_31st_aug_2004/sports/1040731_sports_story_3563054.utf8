 Security ring tightens around Athens
Athens: Security tightened fast around Athens two weeks before the Olympics, with the arrival of a NATO battalion trained to defend against weapons of mass destruction and the securing of venues including the citys vast port. Security officials said Europes biggest passenger port Piraeus would be sealed in days, ready for seven luxury cruise ships, including the Queen Mary 2, the worlds largest, that will act as floating five-star Olympic hotels. While security moved into full gear for the August 13-29 Games, organisers were threatened with a pay strike by hotel workers and a glitch in thousands of Olympic-related phone lines. Piraeus and Athens will be the Games most secure areas as they host world leaders including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Games sponsors and global business leaders who use the worlds biggest sporting event as a backdrop for meetings. A lockdown is in progress. From next Tuesday, the port will be sealed, a senior Piraeus security official said. Gunboats, frogmen, planes and underwater sonars will patrol above and below water round the clock. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Fitness test for Shoaib
Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar has become embroiled in a new fitness row with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in the run-up to next months Asia Cup. The PCB has refused to accept the fast bowlers assurance that he is fit to play in the tournament in Sri Lanka following a rib cage injury. We acted on the basis of a letter sent to us by Durham who informed us that he needed periods of rest between matches to recover completely, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said. We have told Shoaib clearly that if he claims he is fit he has to come down and undergo a stringent fitness test. Only then will he be considered, he said. I am playing for Durham and performing well. If I am not fit would they play me? I want to play in the Asia Cup but the board is not being clear about it, Shoaib said from England on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal up at joint 31st
Pebble Beach, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Even as Britains Luke Donald stormed into the second-round lead of the AT amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am after firing a seven under 65 Friday, Calcuttas Arjun Atwal improved on his first round showing with a two-under second round. He and India-born Swede Daniel Chopra are now both at joint 31st. Chopra kept his one-under score of the first round to log in with Atwal at a two-round total of 142. Standing on 10-under-par 134 after 36 holes, Donald leads world number two Vijai Singh, Tom Pernice Jr, J.J. Henry and Ken Duke by one shot. Phil Mickelson shot his second-straight 68 and is two strokes off the lead in a tie for sixth, along with Arron Oberholser and Robert Gamez. Players will complete one round each at Spyglass and Poppy Hills and two, including the final 18 holes, at Pebble Beach.  Copyright

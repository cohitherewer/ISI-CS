The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Prakash to kick off vs Motomura
Osaka: A singles clash between Prakash Amritraj and Gouichi Motomura will open the Asia-Oceania zone group I second-round tie on Friday. Indian ace and playing captain Leander Paes was drawn to face Japanese No. 1 Takao Suzuki in Fridays second singles at Utsubo Tennis Centre in this western Japan city. The draw for any Davis Cup tie is traditionally held on Thursday, the day before the tie gets underway. But the Japanese Tennis Association had announced a few weeks ago that they will organise the draw ceremony two days before the start of the tie. Saturdays doubles will pit ace Indian pair Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi against Takahiro Terachi and Thomas Shimada, while the reverse singles will have Amritraj clashing with Suzuki, followed by Paes versus Motomura. Of course, as per competition rules, the doubles team can be changed till one hour before the start of the match, while in reverse singles, each team can change one player on the final morning. It will be a huge match for young Amritraj, who missed the tie against New Zealand two months ago. Suzuki, a former top-100 player, is past his prime and highly beatable if Amritraj plays to potential.If Amritraj wins one of his two singles, it will be a real bonus and a major boost to the Indian team which has never stopped relying on Davis Cup maestro Paes. The playing captain won all his three rubbers  for the 16th time in 34 ties  in Invercargill despite playing singles for the first time in 10 months. Japan advanced after beating Indonesia 3-2 in in Jakarta in February. Japan captain Jun Kamiwazumi acknowledged the Paes factor. We need to crush Paes. That will be the key to our success, Kamiwazumi said after the draw. The doubles will be a tough match. We aim to chalk up three wins in the singles. India have defeated Japan 17 times in their 19 Cup encounters  17 times in a row after Japan won 5-0 in 1921 and 1930. THE DRAW Friday: Gouichi Motomura vs Prakash Amritraj, followed by Takao Suzuki vs Leander Paes. Saturday: Takahiro Terachi-Thomas Shimada vs Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi. Sunday: Suzuki vs Amritraj, followed by Motomura vs Paes.  (AFP)  Copyright

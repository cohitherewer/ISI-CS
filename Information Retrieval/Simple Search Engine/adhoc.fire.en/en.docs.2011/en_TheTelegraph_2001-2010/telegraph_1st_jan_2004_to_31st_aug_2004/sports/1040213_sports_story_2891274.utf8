The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ look to World Cup win for inspiration
Auckland: Some say a team is only as good as its last performance, but the New Zealand cricketers prefer to think back a year as the best guide to their chances when they play the first of six ODIs against South Africa Friday. When the South Africans opened their tour on Wednesday without raising the pulse rate in an easy six-wicket win against a provincial side containing five New Zealand representatives, it confirmed their favouritism for the Internationals. But, rewind one year and New Zealand produced one of their most memorable run chases to topple South Africa by nine wickets at the World Cup in Johannesburg. Led by captain Stephen Flemings unbeaten 134, New Zealand broke their awful run against South Africa. Fleming says his teams poor record against South Africa will act as extra motivation  The Black Caps have never beaten South Africa in a Test series and have only won nine of the 34 one-dayers between the two countries. Of the 34, they have won just one of their previous 15 clashes. South Africa held their hand against Northern Districts, resting Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock and Andre Nel, while captain Graeme Smith dropped himself down the order because of a minor side strain and was not required to bat. Smith said the dominant win was important to stamp their mark on New Zealand. Teams South Africa (from): Graeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Jacques Rudolph, Boeta Dippenaar, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Nicky Boje, Lance Klusener, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel, Robin Peterson, Albie Morkel, Ashwell Prince.

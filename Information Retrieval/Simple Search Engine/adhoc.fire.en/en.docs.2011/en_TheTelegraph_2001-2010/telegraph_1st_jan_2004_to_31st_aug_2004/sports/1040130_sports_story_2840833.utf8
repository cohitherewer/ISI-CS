 PCB buys out sponsor
Karachi: The PCB has ended a contract with Pepsico by compensating the sponsor to the tune of $ 3.75 million. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan announced on Thursday that the soft drinks major had agreed to forego its stakes over the India series sponsorship for the said amount. The money would be spent by Pepsi for the development of cricket in Pakistan, according to a press release. The sponsorship deal had been signed by Gen. Tauqir Zia, the former PCB chairman.

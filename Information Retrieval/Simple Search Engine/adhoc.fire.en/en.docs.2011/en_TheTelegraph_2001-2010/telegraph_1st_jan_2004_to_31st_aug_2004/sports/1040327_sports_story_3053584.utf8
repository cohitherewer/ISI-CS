The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barcelona, Liverpool bow out
 - UEFA CUP - Roma eliminated despite 2-1 second-leg win  Inter Milans Ivan Ramiro Cordoba (right) challenges Tomislav Sokota of Benfica during their Uefa Cup match at the San Siro in Milan on Thursday. (Reuters) London: Barcelona, AS Roma and Liverpool were dumped out of the Uefa Cup after a dramatic evening of fourth-round, second-leg matches on Thursday. Barcelona were held 0-0 by Scotlands Celtic, Roma beat Spanish side Villarreal 2-1 but lost the tie 2-3 on aggregate and Liverpools season took another turn for the worse as they were beaten 1-2 at Olympique Marseille. Inter Milan restored Italian pride by defeating Benfica 4-3 to reach the last eight, where they were joined by Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven, French team Girondins Bordeaux, Englands Newcastle United and Spains Valencia. Villarreal looked to be heading out when goals by Romas Emerson and Antonio Cassano levelled the tie. But Brazilian forward Sonny Anderson scored for the Spaniards midway through the second half and Villarreal withstood fierce pressure to advance. Celtic, the Scottish champions-elect and last seasons Uefa Cup runners-up, weathered intense pressure from Barcelona at the Nou Camp to claim a goalless draw that took them through 1-0 on aggregate. Without first-choice goalkeeper Robert Douglas, suspended after being sent off in the first leg, Celtic defended bravely against a team which have won nine straight Primera Liga games and 19-year-old reserve keeper David Marshall made several fine saves. Inter came from behind to beat Benfica 4-3 and on aggregate. Portuguese forward Nuno Gomes put the visitors ahead but young Nigerian Obafemi Martins equalised in first-half injury time. Goals by strikers Alvaro Recoba and Christian Vieri gave the Serie A side a 3-1 advantage before Gomes pulled one back, only for Martins to claim his second goal 20 minutes from time. Inter, three-time Uefa Cup winners in the 1990s, looked to be cruising but Mendes Tiago scored for Benfica with 13 minutes remaining to set up a tense finale. Marseille came out on top in a battle of former European champions, recovering from conceding an early goal to win 2-1 and knock Liverpool out 3-2 on aggregate. England striker Emile Heskey gave Liverpool an early lead but Olympic Marseilles Didier Drogba converted a penalty seven minutes before half-time and Aboudlaye Meites towering header just before the hour-mark sent his team through. Two goals by captain Alan Shearer and a brilliant solo effort from substitute Craig Bellamy earned Newcastle a 3-0 win over PSV. Valencia beat Turkish side Genclerbirligi 2-0 after extra time for a 2-1 aggregate success. Bordeaux defeated Club Bruges 1-0 with forward Maruane Chamakh scoring a late winner to seal a 4-1 aggregate victory.  ( REUTERS)  Copyright

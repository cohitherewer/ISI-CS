The Indian, who had slipped to No. 5 in the latest world rankings, leaped 6.62m behind Australian Bronwyn Thompson, who recorded 6.80. Britains Jade Johnson was third at 6.58. Kenyas Wilfred Bungei set the fastest 800m time in the world this year when he clocked one minute 43.73 seconds. Bungei, a silver medallist at the 2001 world championships, raced home ahead of compatriot Justus Koech to beat Wilson Kipketers previous best mark of 1:43.88 set in Rome this month. Russias Svetlana Feofanova was unable to better her new world record of 4.88 m in the womens pole vault when she failed in her three attempts at 4.90, but she still emerged as the easy winner with a meeting record of 4.80. World champion Dwight Phillips of the United States beat a high quality field in the long jump with his first round leap of 8.36m to finish well ahead of Cuban-born Spanish athlete Joan Lino and Britains Chris Tomlinson. American champion and Olympic shot put silver medallist Adam Nelson defeated another medal hopeful Manuel Martinez of Spain. Nelson heaved the shot 21.25m, while Martinez posted a mark of 20.89 with his final effort to give him second place ahead of Britains Carl Myerscough. Cydonie Mothersill of the Cayman Islands edged Bulgarian Ivet Lalova to win the 200m in her seasons best of 22.47. Mothersill finished strongly to close out Lalova, who has clocked 10.77 over 100 m for the fastest time in the world this year. Former world championship silver medallist Debbie Ferguson of the Bahamas had to settle for third spot, while 44-year-old veteran Merlene Ottey was seventh. World record holder Osleidys Menendez of Cuba was the comfortable winner of the womens javelin with an opening throw of 67.87m which smashed her meeting record by over three metres. In the womens high jump, world champion Hestrie Cloete of South Africa cleared 2m at the third attempt to claim first place, but never looked like bettering her seasons best mark of 2.03. Mushir Salim Jahwer of Bahrain ran an impressive 7:37.49 seconds to win the mens 3,000m ahead of Spains 10,000m specialist Jose Manuel Martinez, who set the fastest time by a European this season in second with 7:39.64. Portugals Francis Obikwelu eased his way to a comfortable victory in the 200m in a time of 20.29.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

Sky the limit for Wayne Rooney 
- Croatian defence is probably their weak point Guest Column Gary LinekerAs a former member of the strikers union I am delighted that Uefa gave Wayne Rooney that second goal against Switzerland, even though it went in off the goalkeepers head. He deserved the goal for having the impudence and ability to get in his shot from such a tight angle.But weve come to expect that from Rooney. We keep saying it, but for his age he is remarkable. He is quick and strong and has wonderful ability.Hes got it all and hes only a boy. Most youngsters at his age are taking their A-levels, while he is taking on some of the best defenders in the world and coming out with top grades.It seems almost ridiculous to talk about his potential but at 18 there is still a lot more to come and if he looks after himself there is no limit to what he could achieve.If he lives properly off the field and keeps improving on it  and one has to remember that some players peak early  he will be one of the best weve seen in this country.The thing that impressed me most in the opening game was that with England operating with two lines of four, all playing very deep, Rooney had huge ground to recover when he lost the ball. But he did it, kept going and looked incredible comfortable against some top French defenders, which speaks volumes for him.Then, having done everything but score against France, he got those two against Switzerland, which leaves England looking for a point in the final game against Croatia to make it to the quarter finals. We have been down this road before.With a draw being good enough, I do not see England playing any differently to the way they have played in the opening two games. The system used by Sven-Goran Eriksson was almost good enough to beat one of the best nations in the world in the first game and we never looked vulnerable against the Swiss. The only surprise in that game was that we looked weak against set-pieces, which is unlike England.There has been some criticism about the way England have defended so deeply but the foundation of a successful side is being difficult to beat, so I dont see any reason for a successful formula to be changed. I also think that Sven will use the same starting 11 as against the Swiss, with John Terry keeping his place alongside Sol Campbell in the centre of defence.One player who has impressed me is Owen Hargreaves, who has done a good job as a substitute in both games. With Paul Scholes seeming to struggle a little bit, it would not surprise me to see him replaced by Hargreaves. Sven, of course, says he has never thought of dropping Scholes but if it ever does enter his head he now knows that Hargreaves would be a viable alternative.England are doing just fine so far. There is always nit-picking, even when we win as comfortably as we did against the Swiss, but one has to take the heat into account and in those conditions it is impossible to dominate teams for 90 minutes.The Croatians are a better side and will pose problems of their own. They could easily have beaten the French and had they done so England would be in a much more difficult position, having to get all three points Sunday.Dado Prso is an obvious danger for the Croats. He is no Thierry Henry but a decent, all-round centre forward. Terry will know all about him from the second leg of the Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Monaco.Terry looked a bit edgy against the Swiss but with Campbell alongside him, they should be able to deal with the threat.The Croatian defence is probably their weak point, which will be an encouragement to England to push up as often as they can. Not that I think we will go out looking to kill the game off in the opening 15 minutes.Its always difficult to know how to approach a game when you only need a draw but I think England will start off in the same vein as they have in the other two matches, looking to break forward when they can.The Croatians like to counter-attack, as well, but the fact that they need to win will force them to be more adventurous as the game goes on and thats when the gaps could appear for the likes of Rooney and Michael Owen.I hope the gaps start appearing for Michael because it has been a tough tournament for him so far. For much of the time he has been left isolated upfront, with Rooney tucked in behind, which means he has hardly seen much of the ball, let alone received it where he likes it most, on the fringes of the penalty area.THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH Copyright

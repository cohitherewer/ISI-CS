The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Huge win for Pak
 - ASIA CUP - Shoaib Malik, Younis Khan do the star turn against hapless Hong Kong  Younis Khan (144) congratulates Shoaib Malik, who scored 118, at the SSC in Colombo on Sunday. (AFP) Colombo: A brilliant allround display by Shoaib Malik and a maiden ton by Younis Khan helped Pakistan drub Hong Kong by 178 runs in a pool A league match of the Asia Cup on Sunday. Malik scored a career-best 118 and was associated in a 223-run third-wicket stand with Younis, who made 144, to take Pakistan to 343 for five in 50 overs. The 22-year-old then had figures of four for 19 to fashion Pakistans second successive victory to emerge group toppers. Pakistan never required the services of their more experienced players as captain Inzamam-ul Haq and Yusuf Youhana did not bat. Pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar was rested. Imran Farhat also tormented the hapless Hong Kong batsmen with three wickets at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground. After Pakistan set an almost improbable target of 344, Hong Kong never looked in the hunt and lost wickets at regular intervals. Only Tim Smart (25), Tabarak Dar (36), Manoj Cheruparambil (30) and Afzaal Haider (22) offered some resistance to delay the inevitable before the minnows were bowled out for 165 in 44.1 overs. This was Hong Kongs second loss following the 116-run defeat against Bangladesh on Friday. Pakistan and Bangladesh now move into the Super League stage where they will be joined by India and Sri Lanka In Pakistans innings, Inzamams decision to send the two players up in the batting order after the dismissals of the openers  Imran Nazir and Imran Farhat  by the 10th over paid rich dividends as Malik notched up his third century and Younis scored his maiden ton. Maliks 118 was his highest score bettering the 115 he made against New Zealand in Lahore two years back. Younis made 144. The two batsmen flayed a listless Hong Kong attack to share a huge third-wicket stand of 223 to steer Pakistan to the highest total of the tournament so far. Pakistan lost both the openers to pacer Khalid Khan who came up with a spirited bowling effort earlier in the match. First to go was Nazir, who was trapped leg-before by Khalid in the sixth over when the batsman was on 10 and the teams score 33. Four overs later, Farhat (20) followed his partner. (PTI)  Copyright

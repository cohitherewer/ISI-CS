 Hussain blasts ICC 
 - I dont see how any side, Test or one-day, could possibly go to Zimbabwe and play now  Nasser Hussain London: Former England captain Nasser Hussain has slammed the International Cricket Council (ICC) for their handling of the Zimbabwe crisis and said he failed to see how any sort of international cricket could be staged in the troubled African state in the present time. I dont see how any side, Test or one-day, could possibly go to Zimbabwe and play cricket now, he told a TV channel on Monday. There are a multitude of reasons  from the moral down to the fact that youre not playing against their best side. And thats just about selection of their team, let alone everything else thats going on behind the scenes in the country. Hussain last week announced his retirement from cricket after scoring a match-winning unbeaten hundred in the first Test against New Zealand at Lords. He gave up the captaincy following Englands first-round World Cup exit last year. England went out after they were docked points by cricket chiefs for refusing to play in the Zimbabwean capital Harare on safety grounds. That last-ditch decision was reached only after months of wrangling. A tense situation was further complicated by the fact that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) revealed the existence of a death-threat letter against the team if they went to Zimbabwe just as the players were on the brink of deciding whether to go ahead with the match. Hussain later labelled the ICCs actions as diabolical, adding the whole affair had been a a low point for world cricket, the ICC and the ECB. The 36-year-old former Essex batsman said: People would come into our room and say whatever happens youre going to Zimbabwe, it doesnt matter whats happening or what you think, were taking you there. The way they went about it and their attitude since about the whole thing has been very poor. I think if you go round asking people in general about what they think about it, they would agree. England are due to tour Zimbabwe this November.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

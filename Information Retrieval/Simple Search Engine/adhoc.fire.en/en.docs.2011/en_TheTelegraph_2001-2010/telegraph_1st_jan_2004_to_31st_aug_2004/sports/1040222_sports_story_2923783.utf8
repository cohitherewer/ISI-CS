 Ranatunga hits back at Warne
Colombo, Feb. 21 (AP): Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga today hit back at Shane Warne for making fun of his bulk and eating habits. Arjuna, hes probably slotting himself around at 150 kilos at the moment, is he? swallowed a sheep or something like that. Warne had said. Ranatunga rebuked Warnes remarks saying: If I swallow a lamb or a goat, it is none of his business. But I must tell him that I dont swallow those pills and blame my mother for it, Ranatunga added. I am fine and fit at 95 kgs, Ranatunga said of Warnes comments. It is better to swallow a sheep or a goat than swallow what he has been swallowing, he said of the diuretic, which among other things, helps weight loss. Ranatunga, who retired from international cricket in August 2000, won a seat in the Sri Lankan parliament in the 2001 elections. He is re-contesting his Colombo seat after the parliament was dissolved and new elections ordered for April 2. I am certainly going to meet him, he said of Warnes visit here. I may even invite him to attend one of my campaign meetings. Though I know I may risk losing some votes, ranatunga said jokingly.  Copyright

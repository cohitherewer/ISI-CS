The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians raring to go
Athens: Indias top athletes will need a spark of inspiration as they seek to boost the measly medal collection in the Olympic arena when the 28th edition of the Games begin on Friday. The Indians have managed just 14 medals, including eight golds brought by the hockey team, in the 104-year history of modern Olympics and it seems extremely unlikely that the script will change in Athens. India have fielded a 75-member contingent this time but any hopes of a medal would largely depend on ace long jumper Anju Bobby George and tennis duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi. The hockey team and the shooters have an outside chance but it remains to be seen whether they actually make it to the podium. Star shooter Anjali Bhagwat, who has some creditable performances last year, will be on view on Saturday in the womens 10m air rifle event along with Suma Shirur. Manavjit Singh Sandhu and Mansher Singh will also test their shooting skills with the mens trap qualifications scheduled on the opening day of competitions. The three Indian shuttlers  Aparna Popat, Abhinn Shyam Gupta and Nikhil Kanetkar  get into the act at the Galatsi Olympic Hall . The 36-year-old Kunjarani Devi, the oldest competitor in the weightlifting arena, will attempt to add a medal to Indias paltry Olympic collection at the Nikaia Hall with competitions in the womens 48kg category scheduled on the opening day. Kunjarani, currently ranked 10th in the world, is said to be the main medal prospect for the country despite the four-member team including Sydney bronze medal-winner Karnam Malleswari who will take part in the 63kg category this time. The Indian hockey team face defending champions The Netherlands in their opening group B match at the Helliniko Olympic Complex on Sunday. Easy draw for paddlers Indian paddlers were handed a relatively easy draw in the table tennis championships beginning on Saturday. Commonwealth champion Achanta Sharath Kamal was pitted against Mohamed Boudjadja of Algeria in the first round of the mens singles event while Mouma Das faces Nanthana Komwong of Thailand in her opener in the womens singles.

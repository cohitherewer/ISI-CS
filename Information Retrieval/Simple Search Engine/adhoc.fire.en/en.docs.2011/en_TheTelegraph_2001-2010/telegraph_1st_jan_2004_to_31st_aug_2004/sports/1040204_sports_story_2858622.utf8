The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India in easier pool
 - Asian champions to meet Pak in group stage  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rajinder will carry the Holland series experience Calcutta: Initial pool placements at the Madrid Olympic hockey qualifiers (from March 2 to 13) see India in comfortable company, sharing space in pool B with arch-rivals Pakistan, apart from Belgium, Canada, Malaysia and New Zealand. In comparison, pool B looks pretty gloomy, incorporating Britain, Japan, Holland, Poland, Spain and South Africa. Seven teams have the ability to move into the Olympics from these qualifiers, six of them directly. India first play Belgium (on the opening day itself), and though Belgium have improved in leaps and bounds in the recent past, Indian form today surely puts them in a better position. On March 4 India take on Malaysia, a team India have been able to beat on several occasions in the recent past. Two days after that the India-Pakistan humdinger happens. On March 8 New Zealand should not prove a big hurdle, except that on March 9 Canada may pose some problems as they have in international meets in the recent past. The cross-pool matches start March 11 and the overall standings, and there is where the trouble begins. It will be difficult for India to avoid clashing with some of the top teams, like Holland, Spain and even Poland (who proved a handful at the Sydney Olympics). Yet, experts believe, India should make the cut within the top six. The seventh finisher has the tough task of taking on Greece (who, even as hosts, have to qualify). Greece are being trained by former Indian national coach Cedric DSouza, who has tremendous experience behind him. The winners make the main meet in Athens in August. Indian coach Rajinder Singh, who has produced stellar results for the country lately, will be taking his team to the qualifiers with the experience of having played a Test series versus Holland at home. That way he will be at a slight advantage in the cross-pool ties as well. The teams who have already qualified for the Olympics are Germany, Australia, South Korea, Argentina and Egypt (the African qualifier). The Olympic competition comprises 12 teams. The Indian teams preparations for the Olympics start with the three-Test series versus Holland, to be played in Hyderabad on February 5, 7 and 8. The team goes into camp thereafter and proceed to the qualifiers in Madrid. After the qualifiers, provided India have made the cut and not made gloomy history, they are scheduled to travel on trips to Australia, among others, to further sharpen their skills.  Copyright

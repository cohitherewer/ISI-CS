The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real look hard at silverware
Madrid: The Spanish Cup may be well down Real Madrids list of priorities for the season as they aim for a 10th European Cup and 30th league title. But with a place in the final looming ahead of Wednesdays semi-final second leg at Seville the trophy has assumed greater importance than usual, particularly as it has not graced the Bernabeu stadium trophy room since 1993. Id certainly like to win it  its something Ive never won, Spanish international striker Raul Gonzalez told Spanish television after the clubs narrow weekend success over Malaga. When Real last captured the trophy Raul, who has scored close on 200 league goals in almost 350 appearances and is the all-time Champions League leading marksman, was only just setting his sights on a place in the Meringues C team. And three Champions League winners medals have not dulled his appetite for domestic fare. Real lead 2-0 from the home leg, courtesy of strikes from Solari and Raul himself. But they will hope Seville do not run them too ragged in chasing after that deficit given that on Sunday fellow championship contenders Valencia come calling for a crucial league encounter. England skipper David Beckham is expected to take his place despite Real revealing he played with a slight temperature and diarrhoea against Malaga. Beckham says he is relishing his football after settling down in Madrid six months after his arrival from Manchester United, though he hinted that one day he might respond if Peter Kenyon, Chelseas new chief executive, sought to bring him on board at Stamford Bridge. Kenyon, who has just arrived at Chelsea after fulfilling a similar role at Old Trafford, was one of the Manchester United officials who brokered Beckhams move to Spain last July. I worked well with him when I was at Manchester United and would have no problem doing it again. I have always had a good relationship with him, Beckham told the Sun newspaper. But he added: I am enjoying my football and I dont want to move anywhere else yet. Real lost their league match in Seville 1-4 on a disastrous evening where they swiftly found themselves three goals down.  (AFP)  Copyright

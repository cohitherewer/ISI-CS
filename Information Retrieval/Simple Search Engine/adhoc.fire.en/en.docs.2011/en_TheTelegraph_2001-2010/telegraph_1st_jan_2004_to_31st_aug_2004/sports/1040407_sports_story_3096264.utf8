The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004  Gypsy King may lift main event 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Imran Chisty				 										Calcutta: Trainer Bharath Singh may call the shots in Wednesdays seven-event race card. The crafty schoolers Gypsy King is definitely at an advantage in the afternoons feature event, the Mysore Race Club Cup over 1,200 metres. The in-form colt by Steinbeck out of Cico Park has been on the up since he won a Class III race on the opening day of the season. 				 										Already an easy winner in the highest class, Gypsy King is all set to cash in on his bright form. Imran Chisty partners the four-year-old.				 										Bharaths duo of Alarico and Deeqa may decide the outcome of the 1,400m Crepes Suzette Handicap, a baby race. Alarico, who was outclassed by La Fantasie in an 1,100m scurry, may relish the slated trip. 				 										But it is Deeqa who deserves another chance despite her poor performance in the Acorn Stakes. In her debut run over 1,400m, the Flitch-Kabuki daughter was an impressive third. Mark Reuben partners the filly. Bharaths Pipsqueak and Seeker also run with fighting chance in their respective events  the Apar Shakti Handicap and the Pourboire Cup.

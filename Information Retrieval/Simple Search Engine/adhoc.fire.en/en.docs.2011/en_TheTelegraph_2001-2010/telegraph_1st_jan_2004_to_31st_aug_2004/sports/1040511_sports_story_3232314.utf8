 34th doubles crown for Bhupathi
Delhi: Max Mirnyi and Mahesh Bhupathi rallied from a set down to win the Rome ATP Masters Series doubles title on Sunday. According to information received here, third seeds Bhupathi-Mirnyi downed defending champions Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. This was Mahesh Bhupathis 34th career doubles crown of which 22 have come with Leander Paes, seven with Mirnyi, two with Fabrice Santoro, one each with Mike Bryan, Jan-Michael Gambill and Mike Kratzmann. The Indo-Belarussian pair, playing in its fifth tournament of the year, went all the way for the first time. Bhupathi has now won nine Masters Series events of which four each have been with Mirnyi and Paes, one with Gambill. Bhupathi and Mirnyis Rome success was really hard-earned. They had to overcome a one-set deficit in three of their four matches in the meet. They earned 500 points which will help them preserve rankings before the French Open later this month.

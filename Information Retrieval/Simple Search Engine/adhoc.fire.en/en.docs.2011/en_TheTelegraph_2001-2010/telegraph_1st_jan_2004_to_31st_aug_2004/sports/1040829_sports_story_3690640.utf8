The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Closing plans
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: The closing ceremony itself, staring at 9.15 pm under a full moon, will be a totally different style of ceremony from the opening. Official documents say the opening ceremony was a celebration of humans, while the closing ceremony will be a warm and human celebration. Top Greek singers will perform and a field of wheat will be made to appear. In between, the mens marathon winner will be given his medal. It was in 1896 when the marathon race was introduced as an Olympic sport, inspired by the Greek messenger who ran from Marathon to Athens to bring the message of victory of the Greeks over Persians. The first gold-medallist was the Greek water-bearer Spyros Louis. Meanwhile, Donovan Bailey, the Atlanta 100m champion, has been seen in the commentators role, working for the largest television network in Europe  Eurosport. The special comments he has made in public includes one where he says: The organising is very good. I feel safe here. The Greeks arent averse to criticism, but they wish to avoid it if they can.

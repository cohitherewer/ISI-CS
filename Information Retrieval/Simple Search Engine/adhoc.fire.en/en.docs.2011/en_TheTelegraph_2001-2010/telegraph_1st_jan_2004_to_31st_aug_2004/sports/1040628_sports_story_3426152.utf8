 PCB gag order on probables
Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has banned captain Inzamam Ul-Haq, speedster Shoaib Akhtar and other Asia Cup probables, attending a fitness camp in Lahore, from talking to the media. The captain and the 25 probables, including fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar have been barred from talking to media, a television channel reported Sunday. The gag order was issued by both PCB chief Shaharyar Khan and chief executive Rameez Raja, the channel said. The PCBs order follows the recent fracas between Shoaib and the board over the bowlers fitness as well as his reluctance to bowl in the third day of the final Test against India in April. Media relations will be handled by new coach Bob Woolmer, who will take charge July 2, and manager Haroon Rashid. Sohail protests Shoaib torture Meanwhile, another copy says that former Pakistan cricket captain and selector Aamer Sohail has lambasted the PCB for its lack of tact in handling the temperamental Shoaib Akhtar and said the mental torture by way various allegations being inflicted on him could cut short his career. Akhtar was mentally tortured by pcb through series of inquiries on non-issues which could hurt his career badly, Sohail was quoted as saying by a local daily. Blaming a player for his loyalty with team and nation, pushing him to inquiries and investigation commissions, demoralising and torturing him mentally is the worst example of teasing a player, and then calling him to the camp of the team after this exercise has no meaning, Sohail told the local daily.

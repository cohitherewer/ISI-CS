The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No play on Day II also 
Bulawayo: The second Test due to start here on Friday between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh has been rescheduled for Saturday due to the prospect of further rain that had already delayed the match. After consulting with the Queens Sports Club grounds superintendent Noel Pick, and listening to distant thunder, umpires David Orchard and Neil Mallender decided it was not possible to start pla, thereby calling it off. A large area of the outfield remains unplayable in spite of long sunny periods and the efforts of ground staff.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 July date for Asia Cup
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Asia Cup is set to be pushed back to July, the Asian Cricket Foundation (ACF) chairman Jagmohan Dalmiya said here on Friday. The six-nation meet was originally scheduled to be held in late April in Pakistan after Indias Test and ODI series there. Dalmiya said the Asian Cricket Council decided to defer the meet as India are committed to play a Test series in Bangladesh after the Pakistan tour. Our itinerary is quite crowded. We have our series against Pakistan, following which we are scheduled to go to Bangladesh, Dalmiya said. He added that the exact dates would be finalised once Pakistan formally agrees to the itinerary. Apart from India and Pakistan, the tournament features Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the two qualifiers  United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong.  Copyright

 Pak court fines Akram
Lahore: A civil court in Pakistan fined Wasim Akram after he failed to appear to defend himself against charges of hurting religious sentiments by modelling in an Indian liquor advertisement. Judge Musheer Rao gave an ex-parte decision against Wasim as he did not appear before the court despite being summoned through newspaper advertisement, an official said. The petition, filed by a civilian, demanded a public apology from Wasim and payment of damages of Rs 25,000. The judge accepted the plea and ordered Wasim to pay damages and apologise, court officials said. (AFP)  Copyright

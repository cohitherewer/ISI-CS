 Martyn keeps Aussies in hunt
 - Visitors extend lead to 229 on truncated day  Damien Martyn after completing his century in Kandy on Thursday Kandy: Damien Martyn ground out an unbeaten 104 as Australia reached 320 for five in their second innings before torrential rain washed out a major part of Day 3 in the second Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday. Australia, resuming on 211 for two after conceding a 91-run first-innings deficit, extended their overall lead to 229 before play ended 46 overs early during the afternoon. Martyn, dropped twice, batted defensively for a marathon seventh Test hundred that spanned more than six-and-a-half hours. It was his second consecutive century in the series, further repaying the selectors faith after his 25-month spell without a three-figure score. We had to fight and occupy the crease and bat as long as we could to make up for the lost ground, Martyn said. His watchful innings frustrated off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who ended the day with one for 126, his only success being the wicket of Adam Gilchrist for 144. We have all got different game plans to play him and all the batsmen have played him pretty well, Martyn added. Andrew Symonds was batting on six after a difficult 52 minutes at the crease. Chaminda Vaas was Sri Lankas most successful bowler, taking three for 78 from 24 overs. Muralidharan trapped Gilchrist leg-before in the fourth over of the day to end a 200-run partnership for the third wicket. Lehmann played positively, hitting four boundaries in his 21, before Vaas trapped him lbw with an in-swinger to leave Australia 255 for four. Ponting, who was able to bat after an intensive 24 hours of physiotherapy, added 49 in 113 balls with Martyn for the fifth wicket. Sri Lanka took the new ball in the 88th over of the innings and broke through after lunch when umpire Dave Orchard gave Ponting out caught behind although the ball appeared to have flicked his pad.

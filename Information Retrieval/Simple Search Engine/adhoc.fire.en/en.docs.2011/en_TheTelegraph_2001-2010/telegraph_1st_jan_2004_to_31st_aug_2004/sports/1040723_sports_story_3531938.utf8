The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Whatmores pick is India
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Colombo: Sri Lanka may have beaten India by 13 runs last Sunday, but Dav Whatmore feels Sourav Gangulys side is still the No. 1 team in the Asia Cup. The tournament is warming-up, but the turning point for India will be the superb recovery that evening  from 71 for four to 269 (for eight) Im convinced the Indians are the ones to beat, Whatmore told The Telegraph on Thursday. Now coaching Bangladesh Whatmore revealed he wasnt at all hopeful his boys would upset India on Wednesday. I didnt tell the players that yet, within me, I knew our best chance would be against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, not India, he pointed out candidly. As it turned out, India won by eight wickets. Whatmore, incidentally, coached Sri Lanka twice  the high point being the countrys success in the 1996 World Cup.  Copyright

Danish sailor kills pedestrian 
 A Danish Olympic sailor was detained and questioned by Greek police overnight after a pedestrian was struck and killed by a car he was driving to a venue at the Athens Games, the Danish delegation said on Monday. Niklas Holm, 23, crashed into the man on a road just outside the Greek capital on Sunday night. The man was killed outright and Holm was taken to a police station where he was held overnight and underwent blood tests. He was released on Monday and the Danes said he had been cleared to compete at the Games. Danish Olympic team spokesman Morten Molholm Hansen said the tveam would decide later this week whether Holm was fit to compete in his first race on Saturday. No one will be brought in as a substitute if he cannot compete in his Star class. Molholm Hansen said the results of the blood tests had not been released but he was sure Holm had not been driving under the influence of alcohol. Greek police said Holm had been released pending further evidence but could face criminal charges.Foul-up costs lifter record  A refereeing blunder robbed Thailand gold medallist Udomporn Polsak of what she thought was an Olympic record, red-faced weightlifting officials admitted on Monday. Udomporn lifted 125.5kg in her final effort in the clean and jerk on Sunday to top the record of Chinas Yang Xia set at the 2000 Sydney Games. But the official result showed the lift as 125kg. It was a big mistake, admitted an advisor to the International Weightlifting Federation, who asked not to be named. She should not have been allowed to lift that weight. He explained that Olympic records must be beaten by at least 2.5kgs while world records can be topped by 0.5kgs.  Copyright

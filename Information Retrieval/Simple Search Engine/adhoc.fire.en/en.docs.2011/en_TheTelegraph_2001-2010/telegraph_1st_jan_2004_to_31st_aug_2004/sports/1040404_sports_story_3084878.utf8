 United end Arsenal run
 Arsenal and Manchester United players in a tussle during their FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park on Saturday. (AFP) Birmingham: Manchester United shattered Arsenals hopes of a third successive FA Cup triumph with a 1-0 victory over the holders in a ferocious semi-final at Villa Park on Saturday. Paul Scholes well taken 32nd-minute strike put United through to the final in Cardiff on May 22 where they will start strong favourites against either first division Millwall or Sunderland, who meet in the other semi-final on Sunday. Uniteds gutsy victory, achieved without injured striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, was especially sweet as it kept alive their only realistic hope of winning a trophy this season and ended their bitter London rivals aim of matching Uniteds 1999 trophy Treble. Arsenal, whose gamble of leaving key striker Thierry Henry on the bench failed, hit the woodwork twice through midfielders Edu and Patrick Vieira. But the Premier League leaders were second best on the day and must now gather their senses quickly for Tuesdays Champions League quarter final second-leg match against Chelsea. The match was a repetition of the 1999 thriller between the two sides, which United won with a spectacular Ryan Giggs goal and, despite both teams starting without their leading strikers, their attacking intent was obvious from the first whistle. In the third minute United goalkeeper Roy Carroll blocked a Dennis Bergkamp shot and Wes Brown cleared the Dutchmans follow-up off the line. From the corner Arsenals Brazilian midfielder Edu chipped against the bar and Carroll did well to keep out Kolo Toures point-blank header. At the other end Uniteds Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo was creating havoc down the Arsenal left and that flank was the source of Scholes strike after 32 minutes. Gary Neville played Ryan Giggs into a gaping hole and his cross was slammed in by the England midfielder from 10 metres. Arsenal responded and on the stroke of halftime captain Vieira glanced a free kick by Robert Pires, who had earlier headed a decent chance over, against the post with Carroll beaten. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger resisted the temptation to bring on Henry at the start of the second half but after 58 minutes sent on the Frenchman and Spanish striker Jose Antonio Reyes for Pires and the ineffective Jeremie Aliadiere.

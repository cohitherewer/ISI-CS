 Harmison brake on Windies
Port-of-Spain: Steve Harmison took three wickets in eight balls to give England the advantage as the West Indies slipped to 110 for three at lunch on the opening day of the second Test on Friday. Chris Gayle and Devon Smith added 100 for the first wicket before Harmison, who completed figures of seven for 12 to help England win the first Test by 10 wickets, struck. He removed Gayle for 62 and Smith for 35 before grabbing the prize wicket of West Indies skipper Brian Lara for a duck to put the visitors on top. Ramnaresh Sarwan was unbeaten on nine at the interval. Gayle was comfortably caught by keeper Chris Read and in Smith was trapped in Harmisons next over. Lara came out to a standing ovation but he lasted just four balls as a lifter from Harmison caught the shoulder of his bat and Giles took the catch diving forward at gully. Rain delayed the start of the afternoon session. (REUTERS)  Copyright

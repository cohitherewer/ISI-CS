The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chandhok in Championship category
 BY SUJIT BHAR  Karun Chandhok Calcutta: Karun Chandhok, Indias ace driver in Formula III, has made progress, moving up from the Scholarship class to the British Formula III Championship class for this season, with his team T-Sport. T-Sport, with Karun, had a successful Scholarship class run last season, winning eight races and finishing a close third in the championship standings, making him the most successful Indian at this level of racing. Not only that, T-Sport were awarded the Team of the Year accolade for 2003. Karun and the team renew their partnership for the 2004 season, according to information reaching here. The Scholarship class is actually the same type of races, run on year old cars (engines and chassis). For the Championship class we use a new chassis (thats regulation) and we need to tune into the driver specs as well, Karun told The Telegraph over telephone from Chennai on Tuesday. Team engineer Alan Woodhead is working on the car and team strategy, with Karun set to roll in his first race on April 4 at Donington Park. The new car is more aerodynamic, said Karun, And though the engine is similar to the Scholarship class, there is a bit more of the electronics (except brake), and all this makes it about a second a lap faster than the Scholarship class car. The tyres are Avon, as per regulation, and the engine is a two litre Honda with six gears. The engine develops 240 horsepower, and acceleration is 0kmph to 100kmph in just 2.5 seconds, a zip as fast as an F1 car, Karun said. The top speed of these cars is 270 kmph, a mark some tracks allow, and the brakes are regular disc on all four. The expenditure comes to a whopping Rs 3.2 crore, borne by sponsors, JK Tyre in the main, Kingfisher, V3 Fun and UCAL Mikuni. Karuns father Vicky Chandhok, president of the federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India said the money isnt recoverable with the prize money in F3 being too small. The idea is to get an F1 drive.

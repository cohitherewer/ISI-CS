 Pak bowlers will test India, says Imran
Karachi: Imran Khan said on Sunday that Pakistans bowling attack would test Indias batting powerhouse in the forthcoming series, with pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar holding the ace. Shoaib is a real match winner and with Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed and Umer Gul to assist him, the home bowling will give (India) a tough time, said Khan. India are on a high and their batting clicked in Australia, but you must consider the fact that Australia didnt have McGrath and Warne, while Lee and Gillespie struggled with fitness, said Khan, who led Pakistan when India last played a series here in 1989-90. Indian bowling is okay but its not lethal and if Pakistans batting stands out it could be the decisive factor, said Khan, who claimed 362 wickets in 88 Test matches and 182 victims in 175 ODIs for Pakistan.

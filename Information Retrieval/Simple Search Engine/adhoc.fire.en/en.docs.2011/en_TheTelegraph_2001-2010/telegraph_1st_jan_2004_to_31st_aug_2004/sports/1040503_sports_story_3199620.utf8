Liberated Sol Campbell buries his demons
- Now I appreciate every minute, every second that I play football, says Arsenal defender BY ROY COLLINS  Campbell feels he can handle anything now The Arsenal and England defender has emerged from a period of personal crisis a stronger and fitter man. A few months ago, Sol Campbell had descended into such a pit of despair that he would have looked up at the rain clouds encircling Highbury on Saturday and taken them personally. Saturday, his only thoughts were how wonderfully the newly-cut grass smelled and how lucky he was to be playing football on it. After emerging from the darkest and most difficult year of his life, plagued by professional and personal demons, Campbells theme song could be Ernest Tubbs Living In Sunshine, even when it is raining cats and dogs outside. Liberated is how he puts it, adding: I took a negative situation and made it positive and it has made me unbelievably strong, ridiculously strong. I believe I can handle anything now. Arsenal play such inspiring football that it is difficult to imagine any of their players succumbing to depression. But Campbells torment began with the four-match ban at the end of last season that ruled him out of the FA Cup final and the championship run-in. After his next competitive match, against Manchester United in the Community Shield, he was charged with violent conduct for a tackle on Eric Djemba-Djemba. A week later, he was sent off in the opening Premiership match against Everton. Campbell was also plagued by family problems, which came to a head when his father died in September. He says: I was thinking, when is this all going to stop? A death in the family really puts your life in perspective. You think you can escape it, you think you can block it out but it starts to affect you. It took a lot of time to get out of that situation but now Im on the other side and I appreciate every minute, every second that I play football. Its taken me back to when I was 10-years-old and played football because I enjoyed it and didnt worry what Tom, Dick or Harry said in the stadium or on the field or on the street. It just kinda washed all that away, the circus around the game, and left football. I am just playing football and thats the greatest thing, the liberation. His move from Tottenham to Arsenal three years ago was another source of anguish but if the anger still lingers at White Hart Lane, it no longer bothers Campbell, which he demonstrated with some class by walking down the tunnel as his teammates celebrated winning the title there last Sunday. He says: Last week was the first time I was actually in control of everything around me, instead of wondering what was happening in the stadium. I decided beforehand that I wouldnt celebrate if we won the title. I wanted to be a gentleman about it and with the situation they (Tottenham) are in, I didnt want to rub it in. The only thing clouding his horizon at the moment is the groin strain that has affected him for the last three months, although he insists it should not prevent him playing for England in next months European Championship. He does not even want to be rested for the warm-up games in Manchester against Iceland and Japan, claiming that he wants to keep ticking over, keep his competitive edge and, in his words, stay in his positive zone. His main concern is not his fitness but that of the players who might partner him in central defence. Jonathan Woodgate has been ruled out with injury and Gareth Southgate is in a race against time, which brings back memories of the 2002 World Cup. Campbell says: I dont want it to be like then, when we had half-fit players in key positions. You need your top-16 players fit and firing on all cylinders. The other key for us is to really believe we can win it. Despite all his problems, Campbell has no doubts that this has been his best season. And with his 30th birthday only four months away, he believes he has got five good years left. He says: Centre-halves normally reach their peak between 30 and 35 because youve got the strength, youve got the energy, youve got the experience and youve been through a lot of situations so it all sort of combines and meets up. So I realise I have no time to muck about. Ive got to knuckle down but enjoy it at the same time. Campbell is not sure, as Robert Pires claims, that he began the Highbury huddle. But he certainly sings off the same hymn sheet as his fellow players, adamant that the Arsenal team can reach even greater heights and fulfil their dream of winning the Champions League. As disappointed as the players were by their quarter-final defeat by Chelsea, Campbell cannot believe that some people have tried to suggest that the Premiership is merely a consolation prize. He says: Winning the league in your country is one of the best accolades you can get. You play in all kinds of weather up and down the country throughout the whole year, people go through all sorts of mental states, family situations and on-field situations. It has been a long and painful journey this past 12 months. But having learned so much about himself in that time, Campbell has never appreciated things more.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

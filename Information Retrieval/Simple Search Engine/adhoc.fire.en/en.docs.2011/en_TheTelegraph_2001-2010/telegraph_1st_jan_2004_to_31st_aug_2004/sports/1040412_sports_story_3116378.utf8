The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barcelona now 3rd
 - European Round-up - Milan manage late winner  Ronaldinho in action in the Barcelona-Valladolid match in Barcelona on Saturday. He was expelled in the 54th minute. (AFP) Madrid: Barcelona climbed to third in Spains Primera Liga on Saturday with a convincing 3-1 win over Valladolid which extended their unbeaten run to 13 games. The victory came despite the expulsion of Barcelonas gifted playmaker Ronaldinho and moved the Catalan side to within eight points of leaders Real Madrid with seven matches remaining. Barcelona held a comfortable 2-0 lead at halftime, thanks to goals from Argentine striker Javier Saviola and Ronaldinho, but a red card for the creative Brazilian in the 54th minute threatened to turn the game. Barcelona lost their composure and Valladolid clawed back a goal in the 65th minute when Oscar Gonzalez drove in a header from a corner. But the home side were unable to make more of their second-half possession and Barcelona substitute Andres Iniesta settled the game with a strike five minutes from time. Ronaldinhos first sending off in Spain means the Brazilian international, the lynchpin of the Barcelona side since his transfer from Paris St Germain last July, is likely to miss Wednesdays home game against Real Betis. Saturdays win leaves Barcelona on 59 points and on track to meet coach Frank Rijkaards target of a return to the Champions League next season. Fifth-placed Atletico Madrid squandered the opportunity to tighten their grip on a Uefa Cup place when they lost 3-1 at Malaga, who moved up to sixth. In Serie A leaders AC Milan needed a debatable 86th-minute penalty from Andrea Pirlo to beat lowly Empoli 1-0 Saturday and maintain their nine point lead over AS Roma, adds a report from Milan. Roma beat Chievo 3-1 with goals from John Carew and Antonio Cassano and an own goal from Chievo defender Andrea Barzagli. Third placed Juventus also left it late  an 88th minute header from French striker David Trezeguet giving them a 1-0 win over Lazio. Milan, who had drawn their previous two league games and were knocked out of the Champions League in mid-week, lead on 72 points with five games remaining. (Reuters)  Copyright

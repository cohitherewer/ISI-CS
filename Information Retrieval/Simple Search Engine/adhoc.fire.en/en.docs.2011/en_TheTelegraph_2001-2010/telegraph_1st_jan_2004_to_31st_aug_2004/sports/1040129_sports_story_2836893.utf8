The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravid exudes confidence
Canberra: Indian vice-captain Rahul Dravid is hoping his team will overcome the grind of a tough campaign all through the summer and rise to the occasion in the finals of the triangular series against Australia next week. The Indians have been criss-crossing the country throughout a gruelling Test and one-day series but Dravid was not complaining and said his side would not find it difficult to put its best foot forward in the best-of-three finals. When you are in the finals, I dont think it is tough. When you are representing your country, it is not tough at all, he said today after the Indians had defeated Prime Ministers XI by one run in a festival cricket match here on Wednesday. Recently-retired Australian skipper Steve Waugh, who led the PMs XI, made no secret of his disappointment at losing his last match against a touring side before a strong 11,000 crowd and said he had probably lost his intensity. It was not the result today. The result was irrelevant but when you get inside, both sides want to win. I have probably lost my intensity, there have been lot of distractions, said a dejected Waugh. Asked who he thought would win the tri-series, Waugh said any team which holds on to its catches will have a better chance of winning. Dravid praised the young guns. There have been a lot of injuries but a lot of young guys have come in and performed very well. A case in point was Amit Bhandari, who in his first match of the tour, was asked to bowl the final over with the Prime Ministers XI needing only seven runs from it. He bowled well under pressure. It is not easy to bowl the last over. He showed a lot of experience of what he has done in domestic cricket. (PTI)  Copyright

 Sanias first crown in US
 Sania Hyderabad: Teen tennis sensation Sania Mirza clinched her seventh international crown by defeating third seed Cory Ann Avants of US 6-2, 6-3 in the finals of the Boca Raton Classic Womens ITF tennis tournament at Florida on Monday. This is her first US title. In a scintillating display of power tennis, unseeded Sania raised the level of her game to dislodge the highly rated American girl, according to information received here. Sania would accumulate nine WTA points with this crown. In addition, she had garnered 3.25 points by reaching the quarter finals of the Chris Evert tournament last week. Her ranking would now be under 400 from 461, a leap by over 60 places in the professional circuit. Earlier, in the semis, Sania upset Chanelle Scheepers of South Africa 6-2, 7-6. (PTI)  Copyright

 Termite helps Iraq get back boxing bug 
 Maurice Termite Watkins London: Texan pest controller Maurice Termite Watkins went to Iraq a year ago to kill bugs. Now, he is preparing Iraqs national boxing team for the Olympic Games. It did not take long before word got around that Watkins had enjoyed a distinguished career as a boxer back home in the US and he was asked to take over the team. With funding from the Coalition Provisional Authority, Termite said goodbye to pests last November and called 24 of Iraqs best amateur boxers to Hillah, a city south of Baghdad, for the first of many pre-Olympic training camps. These guys didnt even smile, Watkins said in London last week. Some of them had been beaten. They were embittered about the world, they had absolutely no equipment, no shoes and no gloves. Saddam Husseins regime had turned the Olympic ideal of Pierre de Coubertin on its head. It was not the competing that counted, only winning. Saddams son, Uday, once head of Iraqs Olympic committee, would punish athletes if he was displeased with their performance. At the very least, they would shave your head to shame you, or you would be imprisoned, said Abdul Zahra Jewad Ali, one of the boxing coaches. But there are many stories of torture. At first, the team was unsure what to make of their new Texan coach and his vow to take them to Athens. I talked to them about it being their time, that they deserved a chance, Watkins said. They used to fight out of fear under Saddams regime, now they fight out of joy. Watkins broke down the barriers by beginning each training session with a team dance and a chant of Iraq is back! Iraq is back!  a phrase that became a rallying cry for the Olympic hopefuls and is now printed across the official shirts. Lucky to have escaped a mortar bomb attack during a stay in Baghdad, Watkins said he and team leader Muhawi Shawkat Shibly had been threatened because not everyone was happy that an American was training the Iraqi boxing team.

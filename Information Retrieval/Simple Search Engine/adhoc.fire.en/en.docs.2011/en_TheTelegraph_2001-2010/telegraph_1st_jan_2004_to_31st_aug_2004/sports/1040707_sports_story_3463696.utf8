 Phelps shouldnt aim for Spitzs 7: Thorpe
Sydney: Ian Thorpe has advised American teenager Michael Phelps to forget about trying to better Mark Spitzs haul of seven gold medals at next months Athens Olympics. Australias Thorpe abandoned his own plans of trying to emulate Spitz when he opted to contest six events at Athens and said Phelps would be wise to do the same. He should be concentrating about getting the best performances out of himself rather than trying achieve someone elses achievement, Thorpe told reporters at an Australian swimming camp in Brisbane Tuesday. Phelps has still not decided how many races he will enter in Athens but has kept his options open by nominating for 11 individual events at the United States Olympic trials starting this week. The Baltimore 19-year-old has been under pressure to try and better Spitz golden haul from the 1972 Munich Olympics but Thorpe said he risked disappointment if he went for too much. I think he will have an incredible trials and I suspect that hell have an even better Olympics, Thorpe said of Phelps. I think that hes going to walk away from it a very successful athlete in the pool. But if hes basing his success, and his reasoning for success, on winning seven or more gold medals, I think hes going to walk away disappointed and he shouldnt. Thorpe was also under pressure to tackle seven events after he won three gold medals as a teenager at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. He won six gold medals at the 2001 world championships in Fukuoka and also at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. After finishing with three gold medals at last years world championships in Barcelona, he decided to restrict himself to six events at Athens.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 33 English fans deported
Lisbon: Thirty-four suspected soccer hooligans, arrested during and after clashes with police in this southern holiday town, have agreed to be deported from Portugal. The 34, one Dutchman and 33 Britons, appeared in court on Thursday and were asked if they would voluntarily abandon Portugal, court sources said. If they agreed they would be banned from the country for one year, if not they could face a five-year ban, the suspects were told. All agreed to go and would be deported within the next 48 hours after making statements about the events of the early hours of Wednesday when a second night of violence erupted in a bar area of Algarve, police said. A tattooed Birmingham City fan from the southcoast town of Faversham, was given a two-year jail sentence, which he will carry out in England. (AFP)  Copyright

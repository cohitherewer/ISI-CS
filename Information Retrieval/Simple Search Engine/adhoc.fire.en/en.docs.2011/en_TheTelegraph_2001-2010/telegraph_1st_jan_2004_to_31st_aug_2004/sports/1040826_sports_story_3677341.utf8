 Dad reveals Bekele secret
 - I wanted him to grow up to be a civil servant  Faith in God clinched it for Bekele Addis Ababa: Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekeles father had initially opposed his sons athletics career but relented when he saw it was driven by religious faith. I prevented him from doing his training, Bekeles father, Byecha, said in a newspaper interview. I wanted him to do something practical with his education and grow up to be a civil servant. I told him to concentrate on his education rather than become overwhelmed by this nonsense he calls athletics. But I saw determination in his eyes and when he called the name of God as a driving force to his achievement, I gave him my blessings, added the 78-year-old. Ethiopias Bekele sealed his reputation as both the present and future of long-distance running by claiming the 10,000m gold, leaving his mentor Haile Gebrselassie to finish fifth. Bekele, who dethroned Gebrselassie as world champion last year, produced a withering burst on the final lap to win in 27 minutes 5.10 seconds and take his injured compatriots Olympic crown as well. A proud Byecha said: I believe the boys I had from Kenenisas mother, Kuli Megerssa, came at a late age as a gift of God. I was happy to get a son at a late age of 56 and named him Kenenisa, which means in the Oromo language you brought me delight.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

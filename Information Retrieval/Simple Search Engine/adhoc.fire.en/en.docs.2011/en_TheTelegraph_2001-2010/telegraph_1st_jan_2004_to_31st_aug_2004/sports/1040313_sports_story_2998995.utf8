 Odumbe denies match-fixing
 Odumbe says his conscience is clear Nairobi: Former Kenyan cricket captain Maurice Odumbe on Friday denied receiving payments from an Indian bookmaker to fix matches in 2002. The ICCs Anti-Corruption Unit, chaired by Lord Condon, is reported to have appointed Zimbabwes Justice Ahmed Ebrahim to preside over the hearing of Odumbes case in May. The hearing will involve the ICC and the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA). The ICC said that if found guilty, Odumbe, who captained Kenya to their first-ever World Cup appearance in the Indian sub-continent in 1996, may face a life ban. However, KCA officials and Odumbe said in Nairobi on Friday that they would not comment on the issue until they received clear information from the ICC. My conscience is clear on this, Odumbe said at a Nairobi physiotherapy clinic where he has been seeking treatment for a broken toe he injured during Kenyas recent tour of the West Indies. I see a lot of intimidation in the whole affair, especially where Justice Ahmed Ebrahim is involved. Hes the same guy who sent me off during the triangular series in South Africa in october 2001 when he was the match umpire, he said. Odumbe is considered one of the greatest cricket players ever produced by Kenya. He scored a century in the countrys stunning 53-run win over Sri Lanka and hit the winning runs to propel the east African nation to the semi-finals of the World Cup in South Africa last year.

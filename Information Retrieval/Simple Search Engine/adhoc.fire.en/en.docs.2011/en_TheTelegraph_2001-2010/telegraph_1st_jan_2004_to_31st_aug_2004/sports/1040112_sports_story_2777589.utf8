 Injured Hinds to return home
Benoni: West Indies suffered yet another injury blow to their tour of South Africa when left-handed batsman Wavell Hinds was forced to return home on Sunday because of a groin problem. Hinds picked up the injury during the drawn third Test in Cape Town and team manager Ricky Skerrit confirmed that the players tour was over. No replacement will be sent for ahead of the fourth and final Test which begins in Centurion on Friday although an extra player may be called up for the one-day series which follows. Hinds is the fourth West Indies player to head home from the tour following injuries to off spinner Omari Banks, pacer Jerome Taylor and batsman Marlon Samuels.  (Reuters)  Copyright

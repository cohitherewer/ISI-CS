The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rana wins 8 in shooters 26
 - SAF GAMES - Richa finishes with 7 golds; India end meet with 191 medals in kitty  The Indian womens team with the national flag after winning the 4x400m relay gold in Islamabad on Tuesday. (AFP) Islamabad: Pistol shooter Jaspal Rana finished with a rich haul of eight gold medals, including three in individual events, to bolster Indias medal tally to 26 gold, nine silver and seven bronze medals at the end of the shooting competition in the ninth SAF Games here Tuesday. Pakistan and Bangladesh ended with two gold medals each. In athletics, though, India fared worse than what they did in Kathmandu, collecting only four gold, two silver and five bronze medals on the concluding day. Indian athletes ended with a tally of 15 golds, 12 silvers and 14 bronze medals from 32 finals, a far cry from their performance (22-18-8) in Kathmandu. In the pool Indias Richa Mishra ended the Games with a rich haul of seven gold medals, including four in individual events, as India swept all the 15 golds in womens swimming. Richa, who had already won five gold medals today, was a runaway winner in the 100m butterfly, with about five seconds to spare over her second-placed compatriot Sivaranjani. It was total domination by the Indian shooters, even without their top stars, and Rana (571) again underlined it winning the 25m standard pistol event. Samresh Jung picked up the silver with a total of 570 but Ashok Pandit lost the bronze to Pakistans Kashif Riaz. In the team event, the Indian trio went on to equal the Games mark of 1700 set by India in Kathmandu in 1999 to claim the gold. Javelin thrower Lijesh Kumar grabbed his first international gold medal upsetting compatriot and national champion Jagdish Bishnoi. In mens long jump, Amrit Pal Singh, who last month bettered T. C. Yohannans 30-year-old record soaring to 8.08m in New Delhi, had to content with the bronze, managing only 7.59m. However, Maha Singh ensured that India won the gold with a leap of 7.80m while Pakistans Ghulam Abbas (7.60m) claimed the silver. India won the relay gold medals in womens 4 x 400m relay and mens 4 x 100m, the latter in a Games record time. In the 4 x 400m relay for men Pakistan won the gold in controversial circumstances. The Pakistani runners first wrongly changed the lane and then close to the tape Rana Sagar Ahmed allegedly elbowed the Indian anchor P. Shankar. However, the Indian coach J. S. Saini informed the officials that he has no complaint. In javelin, Lijesh overshadowed everyone else including Bishnoi, who failed to get into the medal bracket, with a superb throw of 75.71 m in his very first attempt. Though Lijesh could not better the mark in his next five tries, it was enough to win the gold. The other swimming stars were Reshma Millet and Sumi Cyriac. While Reshma asserted her supremacy in the freestyle winning the 200m event Tuesday to go with her 50m and 100m titles, Sumi added the 200m backstroke title to her 100m gold in backstroke. Pakistani men and Indian women dominated the field in the team squash section. Playing their last round robin league matches against the Pakistanis in both sections, indian women exhibited an array of strokes as their rivals were also considered to be minnows amongst the saarc countries. Indian schoolgirl Alisha Mashruwalla lost 9-4, 9-5, 3-9, 8-10, 2-9 to Maria Toor in the first match. Joshna Chinappa then thrashed Aliya Sarfraz of Pakistan 9-1, 9-0, 9-2. Mekhala Subedar then beat Muqaddas Ashraf 9-0, 9-1, 9-1. Among the men Pakistan won the first two matches easily before Ritwik Bhattacharya took six points off top-seeded Mansoor Zaman before losing 0-9, 1-9, 6-9. Earlier, Manish Chotrani had lost 3-9, 1-9, 0-9 to Farrukh Zaman.

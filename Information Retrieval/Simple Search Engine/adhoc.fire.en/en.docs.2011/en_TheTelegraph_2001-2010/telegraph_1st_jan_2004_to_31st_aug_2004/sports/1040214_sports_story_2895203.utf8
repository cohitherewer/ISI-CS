(Reuters) Madrid: Real Zaragoza will play Real Madrid in the final of the Kings Cup after a 0-0 draw earned the Primera Liga side an away goal victory over second division Alaves on Thursday. Zaragoza, who held a slim advantage thanks to their 1-1 draw in last weeks first leg at Alaves, dominated for most of the game, but were unable to break the deadlock. Real Madrid scrambled through to the final with a 2-1 aggregate victory over Sevilla on Wednesday, despite slipping to a 0-1 defeat in the second leg and having Zinedine Zidane sent off before the break. The final is scheduled for March 17. Zaragoza created the first chance of a frantic opening quarter at La Romareda when striker David Villa outpaced the Alaves defence in the fifth minute only to miscue his shot and send it flying over the bar. Alaves responded with a brief period of pressure, but were unable to find the finishing touch to several promising attacks and it was the home side who then took control, Villa missing two good chances to break the deadlock before the interval. The Zaragoza striker sent a low shot past the post on the half hour after turning sharply on the edge of the area and then scuffed wide when he ran on to a measured pass from Argentine midfielder Luciano Galletti. With Alaves still only needing a goal to turn the tie, Zaragoza were never able to relax and it took a superb reflex save from Cesar Lainez to deny the visitors an almost certain goal midway through the second half. Lainez produced an acrobatic block to prevent defender Juan Ochoa from clipping over his head after beating the offside trap, but the Zaragoza keeper injured himself in the process and was unable to take any further part in the game. The goalless draw was enough to earn Zaragoza a place in the final for the fourth time in the last 12 seasons.  Juventus win semis Inter Milans Christian Vieri missed the decisive spot kick as Juventus won their Italian Cup semi-final, second leg on Thursday on penalties to earn a place in the final against Lazio. The game finished 2-2 after extra time and with the first leg last week having ended with an identical score, the match went to a penalty shootout. The first eight players converted their kicks in the shootout but Vieris weak shot was saved by Juventus keeper Antonio Chimenti and Fabrizio Miccoli slotted home Juves last kick to seal a dramatic 5-4 victory. Juve had been seconds away from winning the game in normal time leading 2-1 but Daniele Adani struck in the fifth and final minute of stoppage time to keep alive the hopes of Inter, who had Ivan Cordoba sent off in the 67th minute. On Wednesday, Lazio beat AC Milan 4-0 in Rome to complete a 6-1 aggregate win over the European champions. In an enthralling clash in Milan, Inter went ahead through Adriano in the seventh minute after an error from Chimenti. Dejan Stankovic knocked a ball over the top for his Brazilian teammate to chase. The Juve keeper raced out of the area but failed to clear the ball and Adriano was left to tap into an empty net. Juves defence, exposed in the 4-0 defeat by Roma in Serie A on Sunday, looked leaky again. Inter went close to a second goal when Vieri struck the post after being set free by Argentine Kily Gonzalez who also hit the woodwork with a dipping drive. But Juve got back on level terms four minutes before the break when a deflected Miccoli shot fell kindly to Igor Tudor and the unmarked Croat tapped home from close range. With the game being played at full throttle Inter had defender Cordoba sent off in the 67th minute for a desperate, lunging challenge on Juve substitute Pavel Nedved. Twelve minutes from the end Alessandro Del Piero, also on as a sub for Juve, was left unmarked at a corner and nodded home from close range for what looked like the winner until Adani struck to set up the shootout drama. The Inter defender poked the ball home after an Emre Belozoglu header had been blocked on the line to give both teams another 30 minutes to find a goal. The nearest either side came to scoring in extra time was in the second period when Del Piero cleared an Adani header off the line.Then came penalties and the misery for Vieri and joy for Juve who now have a chance of extending their record nine wins in the Italian Cup.

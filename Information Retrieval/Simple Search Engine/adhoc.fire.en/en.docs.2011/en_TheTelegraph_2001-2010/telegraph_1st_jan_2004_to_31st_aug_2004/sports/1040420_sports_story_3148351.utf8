 Ponting: No Aussie will get time to better Lara
 Ponting says Steves decision to let Hayden keep batting was an exception Sydney: Ricky Ponting said on Monday that Brian Laras 400 not out will likely never be beaten by an Australian because few skippers would jeopardise a winning position by allowing one player to bat for so long. Laras quadruple century for the West Indies against England last week in Antigua  the first in Test history  eclipsed Australian Matthew Haydens former world mark of 380 and took nearly 13 hours to complete. As captain, Lara batted until after lunch on the third day as the West Indies amassed 751 for five declared. It left the hosts without enough time to win and the match was drawn after England won the opening three Tests. Ponting said Australias desire to secure victory as quickly as possible would make it difficult for any of the batsmen, himself included, to beat Laras feat. Its hard to imagine an Australian player doing it, just because of the way we play our cricket. Its generally not the way we play, said Ponting. Ive read some of the reports in the paper over the last couple of days about Laras innings. Their whole first innings might have been geared around one individual performance and they could have let a Test match slip because of it. They ran out of time in the game  thats not the way the Australian team plays. Haydens 380 against Zimbabwe in Perth last October took just over 10 hours in a match Australia won by an innings and 175 runs early on the fifth day. Ponting said then captain Steve Waughs decision to let Hayden keep batting, in an effort to break Laras previous world record of 375, was the exception to the team rule. It was a very rare thing what we did with that Zimbabwean Test match, for Matty to be able to bat for as long as he did and go on and make that big score, said Ponting. He was given the opportunity to go on and break Brians record and he did that. He was going to be given another half an hour, or 20 minutes, to try to get to 400 but unfortunately he got out. Ponting said he was only vaguely interested in individual records. It would be nice if you could be the world record holder but at the end of the day, as weve seen, it doesnt necessarily win you a Test match, said Ponting.  (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Even-par start for Jyoti
 - MALAYSIAN OPEN - South African Martin Maritz in three-way lead  Jyoti Randhawa is placed 57th Kuala Lumpur: South African Martin Maritz, who concentrated on golf after growing too tall to become a rugby flyhalf, was sharing the first round lead in the Malaysian Open on Thursday. The 26-year-old carded eight birdies to lead on six-under-par 66, a return later matched by Briton Jamie Elson and Australian Terry Price. Colin Montgomerie, the former seven-time European No. 1 who is seeking a seventh Ryder Cup team spot in September, dropped five shots over his five closing holes to slip back to one over. Indian star Jyoti Randhawa carded a level-par 72 for a share of the 57th spot with 11 others. Amandeep Johl, Harmeet Kahlon and Arjun Singh were a slot behind at one-over 73 while Jeev Milkha Singh returned a two-over. Vijay Kumar had a poor round of five-over 77. Another of the pre-tournament favourites, Padraig Harrington of Ireland who is the highest ranked European in the world at 11th, is among a group at three-under par. Maritz, the tallest player on the Tour, excelled in rugby, golf and tennis as a youngster but became too lofty for his preferred position in rugby and instead turned his attention to golf. Maritz is now aiming to follow in the footsteps of his countrymen Retief Goosen and last years Order of Merit leader Ernie Els who have topped the European money list for the past three years. Retief and Ernie set a very high standard for us to try to achieve, he told a news conference. If they can do it why cant we? Its something we all aspire to. I have played with both of them just once. I played with Ernie in the last round of the Tour Championship in South Africa about three years ago. Elson recorded seven birdies, including back-to-back birdies to start his round, and then three in succession at the end to catch Maritz. He was struggling earlier in the week with a stomach complaint. I ordered room service on Monday night having chicken nuggets and calamari and just felt terrible on Tuesday, said Elson on Thursday. Price, with former Australian Rugby League fullback, Tim Brasher, acting as caddy, birdied four of his closing six holes in a similar round of 66. The Australian golfer battled a neck injury but was delighted after his first outing with Brasher, who represented Australia 18 times from 1992 to 1997. Malaysias Airil Rizman Zahara is next best on five-under par following his career-best score at the course. Ten players including Irelands Paul McGinley, the Swedish pair of Karlsson and Klas Eriksson along with Welsh golfer, Stephen Dodd and former British amateur champion, Mikko Ilonen of Finland are next best on four-under par.

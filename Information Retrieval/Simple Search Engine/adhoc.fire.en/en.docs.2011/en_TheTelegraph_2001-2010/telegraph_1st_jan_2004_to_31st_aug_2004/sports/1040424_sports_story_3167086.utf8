 Pakistan move into semis
Karachi: Pakistan juniors were the first to reach the semi-finals of the fifth junior Asia Cup hockey competition after registering a comfortable 7-1 win over Japan in their league encounter on Friday. Pakistan, who now lead group A with nine points and are tipped to meet either reigning world junior champions India or Malaysia in the last four, have won all their games with only defending champions Korea to play. Mahmood Ali struck twice for the hosts in 11th and 70th minutes while Imran Warsi, Akhtar Ali, Adnan Zakir, Yasir Islam and Tariq Aziz scored one goal each. Japan, surprise bronze-medallists in the 1996 edition in Singapore, got their solitary goal through Ito Takashi who struck his second goal of the tournament. Pakistan had earlier defeated Singapore 9-0 and Chinese Taipei 17-1. In days other matches, Chinese Taipei beat Singapore 1-0, Malaysia overcame a tough resistance from China to come through 5-2 winners while Bangladesh edged out Sri Lanka 3-1.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Joshna in semis
Mumbai: The countrys top-ranked players Ritwik Bhattacharya and Joshna Chinnappa kept alive Indian hopes in the 12th Asian squash championship in Kuala Lumpur Sunday, while four of their compatriots exited. Joshna stormed into the semi-finals for a meeting with top-seeded Malaysian Nicole David, the world No. 8, with convincing wins in the third round and quarter finals. She whipped Joannah Yue of Malaysia 9-3, 10-8, 9-6 before subduing the challenge of Koreas Lee Hye-kyong 2-9, 9-5, 9-3, 9-3 to enter the last four. Her compatriot Mekhla Subedar, however, was beaten 2-9, 0-9, 9-10 by Tricia Chuah of Malaysia. Bhattacharya kept the Indian flag fluttering in the mens event even as his other two teammates, former national champion Manish Chotrani and Siddharth Suchde, bit the dust. Bhattacharya got past Timothy Arnold of Malaysia 9-7, 9-0, 9-3 which fetched him a tough encounter against top seed Ong Beng Hee, also of Malaysia, in the quarter finals. Hee ended the hopes of Suchde 9-4, 9-3, 9-0. Seed No. 2 Mansoor Zaman beat Chotrani 9-0, 9-6, 9-2. (PTI)  Copyright

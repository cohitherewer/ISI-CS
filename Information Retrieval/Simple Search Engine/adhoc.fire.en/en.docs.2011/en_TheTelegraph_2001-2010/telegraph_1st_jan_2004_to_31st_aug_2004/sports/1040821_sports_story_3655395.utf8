The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3-wkt win for Lanka
Colombo: Maravan Atapattu and Avishka Gunawardene scored fifties as Sri Lanka snatched a thrilling three-wicket win against South Africa in the first one-day International on Friday. Sri Lanka, set a stiff 264-run target after Jacques Kallis had top scored with 74 and Mark Boucher had chipped in with 58, won with an over to spare when young allrounder Kaushal Lokuarachchi smashed a leg-side six to seal victory. Allrounder Chaminda Vaas won the Man-of-the-Match award for his four wickets for 33 earlier in the day, which he followed up with 18 priceless runs in the final tense overs. There had only been one higher successful chase at the venue in 68 matches and Sri Lanka started badly with pace bowler Alan Dawson bowling Sanath Jayasuriya for 12.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

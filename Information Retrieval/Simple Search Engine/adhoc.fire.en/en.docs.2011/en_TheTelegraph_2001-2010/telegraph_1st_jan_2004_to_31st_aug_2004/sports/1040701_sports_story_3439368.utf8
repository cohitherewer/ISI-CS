 Klusener in Test squad after 3 years
	 - TOUR OF SRI LANKA  Kluseners experience in sub-continent will help, feel selectors Durban: South Africa included allrounder Lance Klusener in a Test squad for the first time in three years on Wednesday. Klusener, 32, who played his last Test against Australia in Melbourne in 2001, was named in a squad of 14 selected for South Africas tour to Sri Lanka from July to September. South Africa will play two Tests and five one-day Internationals. Kluseners experience and previous success in the sub-continent will be invaluable, he also brings great variety with the ball which will be critical on the pitches in Sri Lanka, said selection convenor Omar Henry. Klusener has played 48 Tests, scoring 1,904 runs at an average of 33.40 with four centuries. He plundered 281 runs in eight innings at the 1999 World Cup in England, but his game deteriorated from then and he fell out of favour before and after the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. Klusener was omitted for South Africas tour to England in 2003, and he retaliated by taking the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) to the labour courts. The matter was settled out of court. Fast bowler Mornantau Hayward, who took five for 56 against Pakistan in Cape Town in 2003 in the last of his 14 Tests, has also been included for the Sri Lanka tour. Hayward, 27, seemed to turn his back on playing for South Africa in January last year when he secretly signed a two-year contract with Worcestershire that did not enable him to be released for international matches. Hayward, who was contracted to the UCBSA when he signed with the County, said at the time he was unsure of his future in South African cricket. The flame-haired speedster and the UCBSA have recently settled their differences. Both Klusener and Hayward are currently playing for Middlesex. Hayward and batsman Boeta Dippenaar will be replaced by all rounder Alan Dawson and J.P. Duminy for the one-day series. Duminy, the Western Province left-handed batsman who toured England with the South African under-19 team last year, is the only uncapped player in either squad.

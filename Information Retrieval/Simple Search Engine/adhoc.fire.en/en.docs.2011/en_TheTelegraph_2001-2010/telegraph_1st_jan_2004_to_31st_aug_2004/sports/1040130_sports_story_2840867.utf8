(AFP) Milan: European champions AC Milan moved top of Serie A on Wednesday after goals from Kaka and Jon Dahl Tomasson gave them a 2-1 win over Siena. Carlo Ancelottis side lead with 45 points while Roma are two behind with Juventus in third place on 40. Ancelotti, without the suspended Alessandro Nesta, opted to rest regular midfielders Rui Costa and Gennaro Gattuso and gave rare starts to Cristian Brocchi and Fernando Redondo. It took time for the reshaped midfield to settle and Siena enjoyed plenty of early possession. But with Brocchi providing the aggression normally offered by Gattuso, Milan gradually got to grips with the game and took the lead in the 38th minute. Andriy Shevchenko threaded the ball into the path of Kaka who skipped past Siena defender Stefano Argilli and coolly finished, sending Generoso Rossi the wrong way for his seventh league goal of the season. Siena had a great chance to draw level before the break when Tore Andre Flo was pulled down by Milan captain Paolo Maldini, but Fernandos weak 39th-minute penalty was saved by Dida in the Milan goal. Milans second, nine minutes after the interval, came when Rossi failed to hold on to a long range effort from Cristian Brocchi and Tomasson pounced to slot home the loose ball. Former Chelsea striker Flo gave Siena a glimmer of hope in the 87th minute with a left-foot strike after a deflected shot from Roberto DAversa fell to him at the back post, but it was too late to mount a serious challenge. In Madrid, second division Alaves reached the semi-finals of the Kings Cup with a 4-3 aggregate victory over Celta Vigo, despite losing 0-1 to the Primera Liga strugglers in Wednesdays second leg. Real Madrid and Sevilla joined Alaves in the last four by completing emphatic aggregate wins over Valencia and Atletico Madrid in the days other quarter-finals. Real, leading 3-0 after the first leg at the Bernabeu, won the return 2-1 with goals from Raul and Zinedine Zidane to make it 5-1 overall. Sevilla booked their place in the semis, completing an emphatic 6-1 aggregate victory over Atletico Madrid with a 2-1 win at the Calderon. In the remaining quarter final, Barcelona will be looking to turn the tie around after their 0-1 home defeat when they travel to Real Zaragoza on Thursday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

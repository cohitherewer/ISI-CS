		 Monday, February 23, 2004  Palomino may win in Mysore 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Mysore: Palomino, from Michael Eshwers yard, may make it an encore when he takes on seven rivals in the 1,400m Karnataka Racehorse Owners Association Cup here on Monday. The Conquering Hero-Sorceress colt was an easy winner in his last start over an identical trip.				 										The Bangalore challengers, Stilton and Vishnupriya, and the local-filly Hundred Percent are expected to make it an issue, but going by Palominos victory, Ryan Marshall may kick him home.

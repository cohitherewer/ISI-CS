The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Schumacher equals Mansell season record 
 - German caps 200th GP with sixth success in Spain  Renaults Jarno Trulli, who finished third, in Barcelona on Sunday. (AFP) Barcelona: World champion Michael Schumacher celebrated his 200th Grand Prix in Spain on Sunday with a fifth win in a row to equal Formula Ones record start to a season. The German roared across the Circuit de Catalunya finish line 13.2 seconds ahead of Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello to secure Ferraris third one-two of the year. Schumacher punched the air and pumped his fist in delight and relief as he took the chequered flag for the 75th time in a record-breaking career. Its 200, its 75. A lot of numbers come together. Five in a row. A lot of nice numbers which Im proud of, said the six- times world champion. But Im now looking forward to the next one. Schumacher was mentally drained after 66 laps at the wheel, 56 of them knowing that his car had an exhaust problem that could have wrecked his efforts. Presented with his trophy by King Juan Carlos, he remained the unchallenged king of the road in Barcelona with four successive wins at the circuit and six in total. Schumacher rounded off a perfect weekend by also setting the fastest lap. Italian Jarno Trulli was third for Renault, his first podium appearance of the season, after making a spectacular start from the second row and leading for the first eight laps. Spains Fernando Alonso consolidated Renaults second place in the constructors standings by finishing fourth, ahead of Japans Takuma Sato in a BAR and Germanys Ralf Schumacher for Williams. Ferrari have 82 points to Renaults 42 with BAR in third place on 32 ahead of Williams on 30. Schumacher has a perfect 50 with Barrichello second on 32. Italian Giancarlo Fisichella secured two points for Sauber, while BARs Briton Jenson Button, on the podium in the last three races, climbed back from 14th on the grid to take eighth place and stay third overall with 24 points. Ferrari have now won the last eight races and Schumacher has equalled Briton Nigel Mansells 1992 achievement for Williams in winning the first five Grands Prix of the year. Hopes of first corner excitement, with Schumacher on pole alongside Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya after they clashed on the first lap of the last race, dissipated as Trulli seized his moment. The Renault, lighter on fuel than the cars around it, jinked and then carved through the gap in front as Schumacher slotted into second place and Montoya, who later retired, dropped back to fourth.

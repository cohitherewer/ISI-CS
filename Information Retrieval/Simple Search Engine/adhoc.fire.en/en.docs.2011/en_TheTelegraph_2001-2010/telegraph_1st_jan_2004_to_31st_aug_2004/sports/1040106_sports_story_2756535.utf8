 Tennis not an Olympic sport: Kim Clijsters
Perth: World No. 2 tennis player Kim Clijsters has defended her decision to snub this years Olympic Games, saying the sport does not deserve to be there. The 20-year-old announced last month that she would not represent Belgium in Athens in August after a wrangle over sponsored clothing. On Monday she questioned the validity of the sport in the Games, underlining her decision to stay away. Tennis does not feel like an Olympic sport, Clijsters said.I dont think they get the publicity or the crowds they get at Grand Slams. I mean yeah, great, it is in the Olympics, but for me I dont think it feels like an Olympic sport. Clijsters, whose Australian fianc Lleyton Hewitt has also decided not to compete in Athens, came under fire last month for her decision to snub the Belgian team. But having spent the last couple of months in Australia with Hewitt, Clijsters said the criticism had gone over her head. I dont think it reached this far, she smiled, so I am glad I was here and missed that. Clijsters said in December that she wanted to remain fair to her sponsors  Italian clothing manufacturer Fila  after they had shown faith in her two years ago. She had repeatedly said she will not wear tennis clothing from Belgiums Olympic sponsor Adidas. The International Olympic Committees Belgian president, Jacques Rogge, said he felt it was a decision Clijsters would come to regret. I feel sad to hear that Clijsters will not be in Athens, he said,but she is still young and I am sure that as time passes, she will reflect on that decision. She will realise she missed a real opportunity to win a medal but I respect her decision. Clijsters wished her compatriot and world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne  already sponsored by Adidas  luck at the Olympics.  Belgian sweep Meanwhile, Clijsters fired a warning shot ahead of this months Australian Open by overwhelming Daniela Hantuchova in the Hopman Cup mixed teams event here on Monday. Clijsters blitzed her talented rival 6-1, 6-2 as Belgium cruised to a 3-0 win over the Slovak Republic in group B. Her teammate Xavier Malisse appeared set to pay similar scant regard for his opponent in the mens singles but then had to endure a second set comeback by Karol Kucera before recovering to emerge a 6-2, 1-6, 6-1 victor. The Belgians then teamed to take out the mixed doubles rubber in the $ 750,000 event 6-2, 6-4. For Clijsters the win, and the decisive manner in which it was achieved, were justification for a gruelling fitness regime which she said was aimed at finally breaking through for Grand Slam glory this season. We were doing a lot of sprints and stuff in Adelaide, she said of her recent Christmas break in the hometown of Hewitt. Sometimes it can get a little bit boring as well but they definitely pay off. I came pretty close a few times last year (to winning a Grand Slam). Thats what I was training for in December, just trying to stay fit and be fit enough to give myself another chance at a Grand Slam. Clijsters, who reached the semi-final of last years Australian Open, will get another chance to win the title when it starts in Melbourne on January 19. I enjoy playing there and any place I enjoy myself at I have some really good results as well, she said. Its been very pleasant but also a learning experience as well. Life all of a sudden gets a lot more hectic and people want a lot more of you when you are No. 1, Clijsters said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

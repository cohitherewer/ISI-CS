 Pillay in squad for Athens
New Delhi: Striker Dhanraj Pillay has been named in Indias squad for the Athens Games, ending months of uncertainty over his chances of playing his fourth Olympics (as reported in Mondays City edition). The 35-year-old Pillay, Indias most capped player, was controversially excluded from a list of Olympic probables in May but was later added to an Indian training camp after pleas from across the country for his inclusion. Regarded as the face of Indian hockey for over a decade, Pillay was finally picked in the 16-member squad announced by the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) in Duesseldorf, Germany, where India were playing a four-nation practice tournament. The squad, led by defender Dilip Tirkey, also includes experienced striker Baljit Singh Dhillon. Pillay led India to their first Asian Games gold for 32 years in Bangkok in 1998, finishing as the top scorer in the tournament. However, he was among six players axed immediately after the triumph following a payment dispute. He was subsequently recalled to use his experience. Pillays rocky relationship with the IHF has been attributed to outspoken media comments, disputes with coaches and resentment among team mates of his special status. India dominated world hockey in the first half of the last century, but have struggled at the top level since they won their last Olympic gold medal in Moscow in 1980. Meanwhile, Orissas minister of sports Debasis Nayak congratulated Tirkey on being retained captain. On behalf of all the sports loving people of the state, I send my good wishes to Dilip Tirkey, captain of the Athens-bound Indian hockey team, he said. With good wishes of millions of Indians, Tirkey along with his teammates will fight to the last to bring back the lost glory by bagging a medal in the mens hockey event. THE SQUAD Goalkeepers: Devesh Chauhan, Adrian DSouza. Defenders: Dilip Tirkey (capt), William Xalco, Harpal Singh. Midfielders: Sandeep Singh, Viren Rasquinha, Ignace Tirkey, Vikram Pillay and Arjun Halappa. Forwards: Gagan Ajit Singh, Deepak Thakur, Prabhjot Singh, Adam Sinclair, BaljIt Singh Dhillon, Dhanraj Pillay. (Reuters)  Copyright

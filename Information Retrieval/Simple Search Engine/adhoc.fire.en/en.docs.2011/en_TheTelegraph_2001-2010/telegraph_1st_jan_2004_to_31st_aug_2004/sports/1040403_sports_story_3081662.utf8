The Telegraph - Calcutta
Murali awaits verbal report
- Off-spinner goes through 90-minute testing procedure
 Muttiah Muralidharan is measured by a biomechanics researcher during a series of tests at the University of Western Australia in Perth on Friday. (AFP) Perth: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan will receive a verbal report in the next few days following tests on his suspect bowling action, an Australian human movement specialist said on Friday. We are in the process of analysing the data, University of Western Australia biomechanist Bruce Elliott said. When weve had that, well have a meeting with Murali and (bowling advisor) Daryl Foster, who is organising the trip on the behalf of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). We will give the (data) numbers to them. Muralidharans bowling was assessed after the off-spinner was reported to the International Cricket Council (ICC) by Match Referee Chris Broad during the recent Sri Lanka-Australia Test series. The legality of his doosra delivery, which spins in the opposite direction to his stock ball, has been called into question. Elliott put Muralidharan, wearing only reflective markers on his upper body, through a series of testing procedures for 90 minutes in Perth on Thursday. The biomechanist used a system of 12 cameras, shooting 250 frames per second and focussing on Muralidharans wrist and elbow. Elliotts team will analyse data relating to six doosra deliveries from the session. His (Muralidharans) comment to me was that the doosra is a modification of his top-spinner he has perfected over the last two years, said Elliott, whose written report is not expected to reach the Sri Lanka board until late next week. Muralidharan has taken 513 wickets in 88 Tests and is six shy of West Indian Courtney Walshs world record. The 31-year-old took 28 wickets in the home series against Australia last month, while Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne grabbed 26 to move to 517 in total. Muralidharans action has been the source of controversy since he was no-balled for throwing by umpire Darrell Hair in a Test match at Melbourne in December 1995. He was later cleared by the ICC after a University of Western Australia biomechanical analysis concluded that his bent-arm action created the optical illusion of chucking.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

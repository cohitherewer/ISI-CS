 Windies draw after Smith century
 Lara pulls one en route to his 86 in Cape Town on Tuesday Cape Town: Dwayne Smith struck a century on debut to help West Indies draw the third Test against South Africa at Newlands on Tuesday. The 20-year-old Smith reached his hundred off just 93 balls as West Indies, requiring 441 to win, reached 354 for five when South African captain Graeme Smith gave up hope of victory with five overs remaining. Despite Smiths heroics, the draw means South Africa have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Smith finished undefeated on 105 and, with Brian Lara (86) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (69), frustrated South Africa on the final day. However Smiths innings was all the more remarkable in that it came when West Indies were precariously poised with their senior batsmen all back in the pavilion. The young Barbados allrounder did not even have a first-class fifty to his name before the match but became the first West Indian to score a century on debut since Basil Williams against Australia in Guyana in 1977-78. Showing few nerves, Smith carved the South Africa attack to all parts, his most memorable shot a square drive for six off fast bowler Makhaya Ntini while sinking to his knees. His innings came after Lara and Sarwan had defied the South African attack for over three hours in the first two sessions, putting on 156 runs for the third wicket. In marked contrast to his first innings hundred, Lara began at a cracking pace, reaching his 50 from just 58 balls. But he fell to the fast bowling of Andre Nel when he attempted a pull shot and edged through to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. His 86 came off 138 balls and included 14 fours. Bouchers catch to dismiss Lara lifted him into third place in the list of Test dismissals with 271. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Tyson has surgery
New York: Mike Tyson underwent successful arthroscopic surgery to repair the torn knee cartilage the former world heavyweight champion suffered during last weeks loss to Danny Williams, officials said on Tuesday. The 38-year-old Tyson is believed to have torn the complex lateral meniscus in his left knee during the first round of his fight against his unheralded British opponent. Tyson was knocked out in the fourth round by Williams, a journeyman who entered the bout as a 9-1 underdog. Mikes prognosis for a full recovery is great, said Richard Emerson, who performed the one-hour procedure on Monday. The goal is for Mike to be over 90 percent recovered within approximately eight weeks.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

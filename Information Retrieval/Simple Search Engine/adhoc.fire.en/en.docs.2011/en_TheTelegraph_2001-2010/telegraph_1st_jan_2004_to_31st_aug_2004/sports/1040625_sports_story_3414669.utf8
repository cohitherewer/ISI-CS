 Italians make bumpy landing back home
Rome: Italys footballers made a turbulent return home on Wednesday barely 24 hours after their elimination from Euro 2004. The Azzurris aeroplane stopped twice on its way back from Portugal. While the players who disembarked at Milans Malpensa airport were allowed to exit quietly out of a side-door, those arriving at Fiumicino airport in Rome had an altogether different reception. Strikers Francesco Totti and Antonio Cassano managed to slip away unnoticed, but their AS Roma teammate Christian Panucci had to be protected by police as he ran the gauntlet through a crush of several hundred fans. The Lazio trio of Bernardo Corradi, Massimo Oddo and Angelo Peruzzi were given the same treatment. (Reuters)  Copyright

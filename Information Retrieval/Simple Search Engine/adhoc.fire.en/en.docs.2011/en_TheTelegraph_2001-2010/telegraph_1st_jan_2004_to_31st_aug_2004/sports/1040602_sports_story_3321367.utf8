		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004  Online betting exchanges, bookmakers at loggerheads 
London: The latest salvo in the war between traditional bookmakers and online punter-to-punter betting exchanges has moved horse racing from the sport pages to front-page headlines.				 										Chris Bell, chief executive of Britains biggest betting shop chain Ladbrokes, used an interview with the BBC to voice his concerns over internet-based betting exchanges, saying he believed that at least one horse race a day was fixed. I am personally convinced that at least a race a day, if not more, is now being corrupted by the availability of laying horses to lose on betting exchanges, Bell said.				 										It wont be screened before Wednesday, but the BBC film has already added to the row over what consultants Media and Entertainment Consulting Network (MECN) have called the eBay of the betting industry.				 										What eBay and Napster did to the retail and music industries, betting exchanges will do to the betting industry -- they will revolutionise it and change it forever, MECN wrote.				 										Exchanges such as British pioneer Betfair have cut into bookmakers profits by matching up individual punters willing to take on either side of a bet, and say they offer odds 20 percent better than high street turf accountants.				 										Their impact has been likened to other peer-to-peer internet businesses, such as online auctioneer eBay and digital music download service Napster which have radically altered their respective industries. 				 										Betfair and rivals such as Betdaq have adapted the model of a stock exchange to betting, allowing individuals to both endorse or back bets, and lay or oppose bets on exchanges -- something their critics charge encourages corrupt betting. For the first time it is possible for a gambler to profit from causing a horse or a dog to lose, David Harding, chief executive of betting chain William Hill told the BBC.				 										But the exchanges say attacks from Ladbrokes and William Hill -- who together run some 3,600 betting shops in Britain -- are motivated by commercial concerns.				 										Theyre dragging the name of the racing industry into the dirt, Betfair communications director Mark Davies said. What betting exchanges have brought to racing is a transparency that was previously never there, because exchanges record every single detail of every single bet, Davies said. I think racing is an extremely clean sport, he added. I havent seen any evidence on the Betfair site that suggests otherwise and I have a much better handle on exactly what takes place in my company than Chris Bell could possibly have on his.				 										Betfair, which dominates the nascent betting exchange world, says it has a team of 26 people scrutinising bets made on its system. British racings ruling body the Jockey Club said Bells remarks were baseless. It could be that it was a throw-away comment because we know of no basis on which he could make such a claim, Jockey Club executive director Christopher Forster said.				 										In the last year both betting exchanges and bookmakers have signed memorandums of understanding with the Jockey Club, agreeing to alert the Club to any suspicious behaviour. If Ladbrokes had any evidence of a pattern of so-called fixed races they should have shared it with the Jockey Club. They have not done so, Forster said in a statement. 				 										The brainchild of a JP Morgan debt trader and a software contractor, who launched it four years ago, Betfair now matches well over 50 million pounds ($91.8 million) worth of bets each week. It charges a sliding commission scale of between two and five percent on winnings and punters do not pay tax. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India to be at full strength
 - Anil Kumble preferred over Harbhajan Singh  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Coach John Wright and skipper Sourav Ganguly have opted against experimentation Calcutta: The UAE has done precious little besides qualifying for the 1996 World Cup, but Team India will be at full strength versus the Khuram Khan-led side in Dambulla on Friday. According to The Telegraphs sources, captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright have opted not to experiment in the 2004-05 seasons opening game. The thinktank, one learns, has left out Harbhajan Singh and Parthiv Patel from the XII decided upon late on Thursday. Indications are that Ashish Nehra is going to join the duo on the sidelines, with Zaheer Khan making the XI. Whats significant, of course, is that the more experienced Anil Kumble has been preferred for the solitary specialist spinners slot. Harbhajans international comeback, therefore, has to wait. The off-spinner, it may be recalled, has been off top-grade cricket since the Brisbane Test last December. It couldnt be confirmed, but Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag should again open. At one time, however, Sourav was actively considering reverting to an opening berth. Incidentally, the only previous India-UAE match  in the 1994 Austral-Asia Cup in Sharjah  ended in a 70-run win for the fancied team. If anything, the script could be even more lop-sided in a few hours from now. LIKELY INDIAN XI Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Anil Kumble, Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Zaheer Khan.  Copyright

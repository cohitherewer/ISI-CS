 Argentina, Uruguay clubbed together 
Lima: Arch-rivals Argentina and Uruguay were thrown together when the draw for this years Copa America was made in Peru on Monday. The two teams from across the River Plate were drawn in group B alongside Mexico and Ecuador. Norberto Alonso, who played in Argentinas victorious 1978 World Cup team, pulled out the ball which sent Uruguay into group B. Host nation Peru were given an easier draw against defending champions Colombia, Venezuela and Bolivia in group A, which will be based in Lima. World champions Brazil will face Paraguay, Costa Rica and Chile in group C in the Andean city of Arequipa at 2,300 metres above sea level. The tournament, which in recent years has struggled to maintain its prestige in an increasingly crowded international calendar, will be held from July 6 to 25 but it is not certain whether teams such as Brazil and Argentina will send all their top players. The competition takes place in the European close season and in the middle of the South American qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup. The last Copa America in Colombia three years ago was dogged by security worries. It eventually went ahead at only five days notice after previously having been re-confirmed and then suspended. Argentina pulled out as a result of the confusion. Only six of the 12 teams were effectively involved in Mondays draw, the South American Football Confederation (CSF) having previously hand-picked where the other six teams would play. Top seeds Peru, Argentina and Brazil had already been allocated their groups and venues at a CSF meeting in Asuncion last year. The CSF also placed Chile in group C, which is closest to the Chilean border, Ecuador in group B for geographical reasons and Bolivia in group A. THE GROUPS Group A: Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia; Group B: Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador; Group C: Brazil, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Chile. Note: Mexico and Costa Rica have been invited to take part by the South American Football Confederation.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

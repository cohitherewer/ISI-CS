				 																																	Durban: The widow of former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje has re-married in a private ceremony attended by a handful of people here. Bertha Cronje married financial auditor Jacques du Plessis at a small function, attended only by 35 people, held at a city hotel on Saturday. 				 																																	According to the Die Beeld Afrikaans, Bertha wanted to keep the ceremony a private affair so as to keep the media at bay. Only former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes and his wife were the outsiders at the wedding. The newspaper reported that Cronjes parents, brothers and sisters were also present at the ceremony. Bertha will continue to stay with her husband in the town of George in the western cape where she and Cronje had settled before his untimely death two years ago on June 1, 2002.

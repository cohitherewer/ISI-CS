The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Balaji, Pathan swung it our way
 - Victory in Pakistan a giant step towards greatness for the Indian team  BY HARBHAJAN SINGH  Balaji and Pathan overshadowed bigger names in the rival camp Indian cricket is headed towards greatness, and the win in Pakistan is a giant step in that direction. India has finally won a Test series overseas  it has been a long and agonising wait, but what a series to break the jinx. This team has truly created history. My heartiest congratulations to Sourav Ganguly and the rest of the team for producing remarkable cricket. The Indian team was clearly the superior side in the series  be it in professionalism, work ethic, sheer talent, application and coping with pressure. If there was one clear difference between the two teams, it was in batting. I am at a loss of words to explain the great performance of Rahul Dravid. He has been in great form over the last two years and his technique, temperament and commitment is unmatched. He is a team man to the core. I have watched Dravid for many years now, beginning with a domestic game in 1998. I have always admired the skill and discipline of this exemplary man. Dravids fitness regime too touched a peak in the presence of our then trainer Adrian le Roux, whose routine he still religiously follows. Only a supremely fit man could have carried on for over 12 hours in extremely hot conditions for his 270 runs. Well done Rahul you were fantastic. Cricket, however, is a team game, and the support from Parthiv, Laxman, Sourav and Yuvraj ensured that India had to bat only once in this Test, on a relatively difficult pitch. Opening the batting against a rampaging Shoaib Akhtar is difficult for the best of players, but young Parthiv showed great spirit and guts for a non-regular opener. Laxman gave the innings the impetus it needed, and Sourav came back after an injury-break to score a quick 77. I had mentioned in a previous article that Pakistans inexperienced batting would be exposed under pressure. Well, it got exposed twice in two innings in Rawalpindi. Sure, the pitch was doing things on the first morning, but to collapse the way they did showed a lack of experience and application from the top batsmen. Inzamam and Youhana flattered to deceive throughout this Test series, and the rest performed in patches. Indias relatively inexperienced attack performed brilliantly. I cant praise Lakshmipathy Balaji enough. He was outstanding. The way he was moving the ball, it appeared as if he was bowling on seaming, green pitches of New Zealand or Australia and not on the flat tracks of Pakistan. Irfan Pathan was very tight, allowing Balaji to attack from the other end. Nehra also came back and bowled a couple of good spells. Kumble wrapped up the tail very quickly in the second innings, and just like the batting, it was a complete team effort in the bowling department. Pakistan missed Umar Gul badly. Even though Shoaib and Sami were fast, they were rarely able to swing the ball. Wasim Akram once mentioned that the speed gun was killing swing bowling  seeing Sami and Shoaib bowl in this series, this rings true. Both bowlers were looking for the 150 kmph ball, but compromised on swing, line and length. No wonder then that Pakistans most dangerous bowler in this series was Gul, who purely concentrated on swinging the ball. Pakistans profligacy with the ball meant that India was able to score 600 on a pitch that had something for the bowlers. This series was played in a very friendly fashion. The Pakistanis have been gracious hosts, and the crowds have been exemplary. I hope India can reciprocate this feeling when Pakistan tour India. The Indian team has conducted itself very well, and the players have been terrific ambassadors. This is a very different Indian team, and a lot of credit is due to Sourav and John Wright for inculcating that spirit of togetherness. It is a family and not just a team out there in the dressing room. On a personal note, I wish I was there to share these once-in-a-lifetime moments with my mates.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inzy banks on bowling 
 - TRI-SERIES OPENER 
- Indian batting good enough to put any team under pressure, feels Pak skipper  Pakistans Inzamam-ul Haq during a practice session at the SV Kampong training ground in Utrecht on Friday. (Reuters) Utrecht: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Friday said his irrepressible bowling attack has got the measure of the strong Indian batting line-up and would pose a serious challenge to Sourav Ganguly and Co. in the tri-series starting on Saturday. Inzamam said the tight leash under which his bowlers kept the star-studded Indian line-up in the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka was an indication that the mercurial Pakistani pacers were beginning to show new discipline and commitment which they had lacked in the past. It looks like the contest would be between our bowlers and their batsmen. I was very happy the way they (bowlers) picked up in Sri Lanka  bowling within themselves and in right channels. This is the thing which we didnt do against the Indians at home, the Pakistan captain said as he marshalled the nets here. India take on Pakistan in the opening match before clashing with the Ricky Pontings Australia on Monday. Pakistan face off with the world champions on Wednesday before the final on August 28. Inzamam, however, refused to read too much into Indias below par performance in Sri Lanka. Any team cant give top performance year round. They were off-colour in Sri Lanka but such things happen. In one-day cricket you cant predict winners. He had little doubt as to what pressure teams face when they take on the might of Indian batting.  (PTI)  Copyright

	 2004: Aug. 1, Montreal (hardcourt) bt J. Bjorkman/Mirnyi.Calcutta: We won the Canadian Open. The Lord has some strange ways, announced an SMS from Leander Paes in the wee hours of Monday, shortly after he and Mahesh Bhupathi whipped Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi in the final of the Toronto meet. Strange indeed! Having parted ways (for the second time) 27 months ago after a rollicking six-year partnership, the one-time kings of the doubles world have avoided each others company unless its absolutely essential. But whenever fate threw them together on the same side of a tennis court, they have exploded. Sample this: At the Mallorca Open in May 2002, barely two months after an acrimonious split, Paes and Bhupathi decided to team up for a one-off arrangement for lack of partners. They went on to clinch the top prize. Five months later, in Busan, they were back in tandem to serve Mother India. The Asian Games gold was theirs. Injuries apart, they didnt skip a single Davis Cup tie and have won the last five doubles rubbers. And now this. They have played 17 doubles matches (eight on Tour, four at the Busan Asian Games and five in Davis Cup) since their 2002 professional break-up, not once have they left the court as losers. Its a telling statistic. Doesnt it send a strong message to the individuals concerned? If this isnt a signal, I dont know what is, Bhupathi told The Telegraph just before boarding an early morning flight to Cincinnati, where the Indians play another Masters Series meet this week as the final leg of their Olympic preparation. The chemistry is as good as 1999, if not better, was how he summed up their performance. It sounded like he was ready for another reunion, but Bhupathi wasnt willing to go any further. Our focus is wholly on Athens now. Any other matter can wait till the Olympics are over. Paes wasnt willing to commit anything, either. We have professional commitments towards our partners (David Rikl and Mirnyi). Right now, we are only together till the Olympics, said the senior partner who flew out of Toronto later in the day. Like Paes, Bhupathi was surprised that the two were able to operate successfully at such a high level after a lengthy gap. We played high quality tennis, especially in the semis and final, while in the second round, we showed great character in coming back from a set and a break down. Id thought well take a little more time, Bhupathi remarked. This weeks Cincinnati meet will give them scope for some more match-practice, but whatever happens there, Bhupathi is ready for the Athens challenge. Its possible to have one bad day early in the Athens competition, but well be going there with a clear shot at a medal, he said firmly. Paes doesnt think any differently. Im so close to fulfilling my childhood dream of competing in four Olympic Games. Ill try my hardest to cap it with another medal. That was straight out of the heart. But there is an innate determination in both these men which can only augur well for India.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Australia rally to hold India
Sydney: India frittered away the opportunity to record their first win as they conceded a goal in the dying minutes to be held 2-2 by Australia in their second match of the four-nation mens hockey challenge on Thursday. Trevis Brooks sealed the fate of the Indians 68 seconds before the hooter, as Australia rallied to clinch a point in an absorbing tussle at the Hombush Olympic Park. The home team shot into the lead through Jamie Dwyer in the 13th minute but India levelled at the stroke of half-time when Jatinder Pal Singh converted a penalty corner. India then went ahead through Deepak Thakurs field goal in the 61st minute before Brooks drilled one in the last minute. Malaysia beat South Africa 2-1 in another match. (PTI)  Copyright

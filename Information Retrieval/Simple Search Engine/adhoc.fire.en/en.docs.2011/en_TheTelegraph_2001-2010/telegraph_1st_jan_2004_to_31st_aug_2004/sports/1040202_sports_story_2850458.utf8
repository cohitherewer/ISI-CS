 2005 mens final at night
Melbourne: The mens singles final at next years Australian Open will be played at night  a first for mens Grand Slam tennis  organisers said on Sunday. The decision to play the showpiece match in a twilight session mirrors the US Opens policy of playing the womens singles final in the evening. Next year, 2005, is the centenary year of the Australian Open, tournament chief Paul McNamee said. To think that in the centenary year, historic first for a Grand Slam to have the mens singles final in prime time, it is a historic moment. (Reuters)  Copyright

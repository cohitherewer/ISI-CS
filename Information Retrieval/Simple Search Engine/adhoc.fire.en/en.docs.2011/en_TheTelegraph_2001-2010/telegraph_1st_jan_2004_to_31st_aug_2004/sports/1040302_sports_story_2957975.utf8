 Fans banner inspires Kahn
 - Ban puts Carlos out of return clash vs Bayern  As a youngster, Kahn used to identify his own emotional ups and downs with those of idol Boris Becker Berlin: Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was so moved by a young fans banner urging him to forget a blunder against Real Madrid that he gave the boy his gloves. The 11-year-old held up a banner reading Olli, Real is forgotten! at Bayerns game against VfL Wolfsburg. Kahn, who has faced withering criticism after letting in a soft goal against Real in midweek, turned in a faultless performance in Bayerns 2-0 Bundesliga victory on Saturday. At halftime when I was going to the changing rooms I saw the boy with his banner, Kahn told Bild newspaper on Sunday. It was one of those moments in a sportsmans life that really move you. I imagined him carefully making the banner with his marker pens, Kahn pointed out. After the match Kahn gave his goalkeeping gloves to a security guard and asked him to pass them on to the boy sitting above the tunnel leading to the dressing rooms. Kahn said the boy reminded him of how he had idolised sports stars like Boris Becker in his youth. It made me think about when I was younger and always going through my own emotional ups and downs as a fan every time my heroes like (goalkeeper) Toni Schumacher and Boris Becker won or lost, Kahn said. The 34-year old keeper let a Roberto Carlos free kick slip under his body to give Real a 1-1 draw in the first leg of their first knockout round tie in the Champions League on Tuesday. Kahn told Bild the mistake had made him realise he needed to get closer to his team mates. Carlos has been banned for two matches by Uefa for retaliation in the Champions League match. He will miss the return leg of the Champions League quarter final against Bayern Munich in Madrid. He tangled with Bayerns Martin Demichelis in the second half of Tuesdays draw following a rough tackle, and retaliated by hitting him in the face. Demichelis earned a yellow card for the tackle, but Carlos was unpunished and went on to score Madrids equaliser.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

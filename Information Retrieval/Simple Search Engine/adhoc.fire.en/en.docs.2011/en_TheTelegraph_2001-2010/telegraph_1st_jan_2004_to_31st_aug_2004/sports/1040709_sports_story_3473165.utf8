The Telegraph - Calcutta
 George rally to hold Tolly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Gaurangas goal was the best Calcutta, July 8: Tollygunge Agragami kicked off their CFL Super Division campaign on a disappointing note, allowing George Telegraph to equalise twice in a 2-2 draw on Thursday. The National League outfit went ahead through a Surojit Bose strike in the 20th minute. But George Telegraph equalised within five minutes, when Srikanta Das poked home from close. Tollygunge again took the lead twelve minutes into the second session, thanks to a brilliant goal by Gauranga Dutta  inarguably the best in the match. But the muddy, rain-drenched ground conditions at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium  recently in the news owing to a proposal to lay an astroturf there  meant exchange of passes was hardly noticeable. Also, the Tollygunge defenders uneasiness in coping with aerial balls was exposed from time to time. The introduction of veteran Sanjay Majhi in the 57th minute changed things somewhat and turned out to be a masterstroke from George Telegraph coach Raghu Nandy. In the 63rd minute, George defender Arindam Hazra loped up, foxed the rival left-back Babin Biswas with a brilliant turn and sent in a measured cross. Majhi, who had played for both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan with distinction, was there alone inside the box, while the entire Tollygunge backline was surprisingly standing near the top of the box. The substitute striker had the world of time to control the ball and pushed it in without having to face any sort of trouble. Tollygunge paced up for a winner, but lost momentum in the mud. More than that, they looked tired and often failed to check the opponents on counter-attacks. On two occasions at least, George could have pushed Biswajit Das team into trouble. Nine minutes from time, Sanjay again took the centrestage, snatching a ball after Tollygunge goalkeeper Samit Debnath unsuccessfully came out of his line to challenge him. Sanjay managed to float a centre at the other end, but Srikanta failed to head the ball into an open goal. Then towards the fag end of the match, Jamir Ali Mondal was unable to beat Samit from an one-to-one situation and as the ball ricocheted off the goalkeepers hands, Surojit, unchallenged, shot in haste and wide. Tollygunge sparkled in patches and both their goals were products of some commendable wing-play. Gaurangas goal, though, was all individual brilliance as his thunderous strike from the top of the box gave Ganesh Singh absolutely no chance. However, mostly the defence and partly Samit, who never looked steady under the bar, let Tollygunge down.

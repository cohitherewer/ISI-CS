The Telegraph - Calcutta
Pakistan bowlers have a lot to learn from Pathan amp; Co.
Guest Column / Mohinder Amarnath The three main architects of Indias historic win (from left) Virender Sehwag, Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar savour the magic moment in Multan on Thursday. (Reuters)A day of immense joy, after half-a-century of effort. India have won a Test in Pakistan, and how! It was Anil Kumbles match-winning spell (six for 72) in the second innings and the lion-hearted effort of our young pace sensation Irfan Pathan that made this victory possible.Indias win in Multan will make things extremely difficult for Pakistan now. They will have a rather steep climb ahead if they plan to come back from this abyss. Kumbles superb spell mesmerised the Pakistani batsmen, who kept falling into his traps and the innings crumbled.Kumbles control and nagging length shackled the Pakistani batsmen. They were unsure of what to do and surrendered meekly, like soldiers who have lost all faith and determination for battle. It seems Kumbles that reputation had preceded him, playing on the minds of the batsmen. It helped the Indian leggie get the purchase he got.Pathan bowled well in the first innings, but he bowled even better in the second. He was unlucky not to take more wickets, his effort and hard work really keeping the batsmen under pressure. It was a pleasure to see the youngster charging in, getting on top of the batsmen with his controlled swing and pace. Pathan may not have the pace of a Shoaib Akhtar, but his length and movement in the air and even off the good batting wicket announces the arrival of a new star in Indian cricketdom.Pathan is likely to trouble Pakistani batsmen in the remaining Tests, too, with his ability to use the old ball effectively. He will always be more successful against left-handers with his perfect swing and line. Both Pakistan openers were at sea against his genuine swing bowling. He has proved that swing is even more lethal than pace. And, as if all that was not enough, Pathan has also showed tremendous stamina, even in the heat of Multan.Pathan has been the pick of the Indian bowlers (along with Kumble), although Lakshmipathy Balaji bowled pretty well too, moving the ball effectively.The amazing irony is, the Pakistani fast bowlers are known for reverse swing with an old ball, but during the Multan Test it turned out that the shoe was on the other foot. I think Pakistani bowlers have a great deal to learn from their Indian counterparts. They have to learn bowling a better line and length, and with more discipline.The Pakistani batting not only looked immature, but also very unprofessional  there seemed a lack of direction. It wasnt good to see their amateurish approach, in an effort to just occupy the crease in the second innings (except Yusuf Youhana). And their clueless footwork was also one of the main reasons for this miserable defeat.			Their batting revolves around Inzamam-ul Haq. It will be a daunting task for Inzamam now to pick up the broken pieces and put them together again for a possible comeback in the series. If Pakistan want to do well, they will have to change their basic approach and discipline themselves.I have heard that there is likely to be a green, seaming track for the Lahore Test. The big question is, will they have time to prepare such a track; will the warm weather make it possible to produce such a wicket? Also, do the Pakistanis have the batting line-up to handle Pathan and the in-form Indian pace attack as well as Kumble amp; Co? Indian batting has more depth, experience and talent, and are under less pressure than their counterparts. Rahul Dravid captained the side very well. He used his resources and his astute cricket knowledge effectively. And he has this bunch of young, talented cricketers who have made him proud. There is a good mix of experience and talent in the team, very good ingredients to make world-beaters in the near future.There was a lot of hue and cry over Sachin Tendulkars missing a double hundred and the declaration. But, as I have already said in this column, Dravids firm decision shows that team interest comes before personal achievements. I am moved to compare this Pakistan tour with the trip I made The difference I see is in the level of passion. A Pakistan series is always a tough one to be in. It also gives you immense satisfaction and thrill. This time around, the passion seems to far less than what we experienced.My father, Lala Amarnath, never played in Pakistan (though he played them in India), but having been born there, he was pretty much at home in Pakistan. He was a hero there. Way back from then, all series in Pakistan have been fought very vigorously, with passion and emotion. This time I see a subdued Pakistani approach. Maybe they feel they are playing a far better side than the previous ones.  Copyright

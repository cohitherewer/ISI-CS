The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tysons secret rival 
 Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson with his bird outside his training camp in Phoenix on Tuesday. Tyson will fight Englands Danny Williams in Louisville on July 30. (Reuters) Louisville: Danny Williams turned 31 Tuesday, but there was no party. Just a regular training day for his upcoming bout with Mike Tyson. Hes planning to celebrate after the fight. Its all work, no play, Williams said Tuesday in a conference call. Friday the 30th, that will be my birthday present. Williams (31-3, 26 kos) is a former British Commonwealth heavyweight champion, but is relatively unknown in the US. His two previous fights in the US were his only two outside Europe. Williams counts his anonymity as an advantage. Im like a secret, Williams said. These guys havent seen what I can do. Hes also relishing the role of underdog, one hes unaccustomed to having. Its a beautiful feeling, he said. When Im in England as the champion, guys are always coming up to me and Ive got massive pressure on me because everyones expecting me to win. In this fight, Im expected to be knocked out in a couple of rounds. So theres no pressure on me and thats why Im so relaxed. Tyson hasnt fought since stopping Clifford Etienne in 49 seconds on February 22, 2003. Hes been living in a modest house in suburban Phoenix, away from the lavish lifestyle and wasteful spending that landed him deep in debt. Still, Williams knows who the star of the fight is. And though Williams estimates Tysons ability at about 40 per cent what it was when he knocked out 26 of his first 28 opponents, the former world champ is not one to be taken lightly. His 40 per cent is still better than most of our 100 per cent, Williams said. On any given day, he can definitely still win a world title. But he has to get through me and I dont think he will. Gov. Ernie Fletcher and Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson have each said separately that they do not support Tyson, who has served time for rape, being allowed to box in the state. Williams defended his opponent. I believe he should be able to fight, Williams said. Hes paid his price for what hes done. He should get to make a living like everyone else.  (AP)  Copyright

 Hierro sues Real Madrid 
Madrid: Former Real Madrid sweeper Fernando Hierro, who has since joined a Qatar outfit, has claimed more than $630,000 (euros 500,000) from the Spanish club for the termination of his contract, Spanish press reported on Thursday. Hierro initiated legal proceedings in December for euros 600,000, according to El Pais newspaper, though Sporting Daily has said the figure was euros 540,000 and that a deal was likely to be made after a meeting between the players lawyers and club official Jorge Valdano on Wednesday.

 Draw with Japan takes Iran to last 8
Beijing: Three-time champions Iran secured a place in the Asian Cup quarter finals at the expense of plucky Oman on Wednesday. Iran earned the point they needed to go through with an efficient 0-0 draw against holders Japan, while Oman crashed out despite overpowering Thailand 2-0. With a little luck, Iran could have won an absorbing contest in sweltering Chongqing. Instead, they finished runners-up in Group D on five points, two behind Japan. Iran, who won the Asian Cup in 1968, 1972 and 1976, face Group B winners South Korea on Saturday. Japan meet Jordan. It was rough justice for Oman, who were playing in their first Asian Cup finals. The Gulf side hardly deserved to lose 1-0 to Japan in their first match and were left shattered after Iran came back from two goals down to snatch a controversial equaliser in a 2-2 draw. Oman enjoyed a rare slice of luck in the 11th minute in Chengdu, Thai striker Rangsan Vivatchaichok diverting the ball past goalkeeper Punuwat Tangunurat for a bizarre own goal. Striker Imad Ali then doubled Omans lead with a cheeky back-heel four minutes into the second half but it was not enough with Iran comfortably holding Japan in the other match. Talisman Ali Daei squandered a gilt-edged opportunity to score his 96th goal in 128 appearances for Iran, firing over in the 65th minute after good work from Mehdi Mahdavikia. Midfielder Yasuhito Endo could have shredded Iranian nerves when he found space in the 77th minute, only to be denied by a superb save by goalkeeper Ebrahim Mirzapour. But Iran, who were missing three suspended players after their explosive match with Oman, held on to set up a clash with 2002 World Cup semi-finalists South Korea in Jinan. We had a problem to deal with and we dealt with it, said Croatian Ivankovic. Nobody was sent home. We made adjustments to our system. Defender Mohammad Nosrati was banned for the rest of the meet and Ali Badavi and Rahman Rezaei were given two-match suspensions after incidents of off-the-ball violence during the Oman game. Meanwhile, Japan will be favourites to beat Jordan in Chongqing.  (Reuters)  Copyright

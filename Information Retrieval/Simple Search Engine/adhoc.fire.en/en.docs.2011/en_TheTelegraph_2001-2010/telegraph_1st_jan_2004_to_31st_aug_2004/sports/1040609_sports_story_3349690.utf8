 Greene, Montgomery set for showdown
Eugene (Oregon): Reigning Olympic champion Maurice Greene and world record holder Tim Montgomery will stage a 100m showdown at the Prefontaine Classic here on June 19, USA Track and Field has announced. The American match-up between three-time world champion Greene and Montgomery comes in the last major American athletics meet before the United States Olympic trials begin on July 9 in Sacramento, California. Greene won the 100m crown in a wind-aided 9.78 seconds at the US Open on May 31 in Stanford, achieving the second-fastest time clocked under any conditions with the aid of a 3.7-m per second tailwind. Montgomery ran the 100m in 9.78 seconds in September 2002 in Paris with a legal wind of two metres per second. Maurice Greene, who has the two fastest wind-legal times in the world this year, will make his first appearance at the Prefontaine Classic in three years. He will be tested not only by Montgomery but also John Capel, 2003s top-ranked world 100 and 200m runner. Also entered are Bernard Williams, Justin Gatlin, Shawn Crawford, Mickey Grimes and Marcus Brunson.  (AFP)  Copyright

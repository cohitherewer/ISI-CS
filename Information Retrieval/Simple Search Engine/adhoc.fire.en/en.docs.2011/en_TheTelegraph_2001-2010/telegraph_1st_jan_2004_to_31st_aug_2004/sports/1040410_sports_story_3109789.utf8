The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Larsson to Celtics rescue
London: Last seasons Uefa Cup finalists, Celtic, needed a Henrik Larsson goal to rescue a 1-1 draw against Villarreal, while Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba handed Olympique Marseille a slender 1-0 lead over Inter Milan in quarter final, first leg matches on Thursday. Valencia, depleted by injury, came from behind to win 2-1 at ten-man Girondins Bordeaux and underline their status as competition favourites. Newcastle United also gained the upper hand on their travels, drawing 1-1 against PSV Eindhoven to take an away goal back to St James Park for the return leg on Wednesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

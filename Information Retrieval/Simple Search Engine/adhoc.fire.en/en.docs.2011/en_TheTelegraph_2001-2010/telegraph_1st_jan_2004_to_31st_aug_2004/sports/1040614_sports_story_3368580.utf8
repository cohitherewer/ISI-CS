 Anand draws with Gelfand 
Moscow: Former world champion Viswanathan Anand drew a hard fought game with Grandmaster Boris Gelfand of Armenia in the fourth match on Sunday. .  The Rest of the World team maintained its four-point lead over the Armenians with a 3-3 draw in the fourth clash and now looks set for a triumph as there are just two rounds or 12 games remaining in this six-players event being played under Scheveningen system. The world team took its overall tally to 14 points out of a possible 24 while the Armenians are now saddled on 10. The problem for the Armenian team continued as Smbat Lputian lost his third game in the event, going down to Frenchman Etienne Bacrot. In fact, only a late onslaught by former world championship finalist Vladimir Akopian could assure the Armenians of their first graceful drawn result. It may be recalled that the world team had beaten Armenia 3.5-2.5 in the first, 4-2 in the second and again 3.5-2.5 in the third match of the event in last three days. Anand played a patient game against Gelfand who is still looking for an elusive victory here. It was a Petroff defence, a rare choice by the Israeli. Anand tackled the opening quite well despite being surprised and came out with a miniscule advantage but Gelfands timely thrust in the middle game ensured him enough respite. The endgame arose after Anand sacrificed a pawn for initiative but there was nothing to hope for as Gelfand quickly neutralised. The draw was agreed to after 30 moves. Bacrot was in his elements in taking care of Lputian who played the white side of a Slav defence game. The middle game was approximately equal but an oversight in the endgame cost Lputian dearly as he lost a couple of pawns. However, with his king march right to the 7th rank, Luptian kept himself in the game and it took Bacrot 54 moves to eventually score the victory.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gopi comeback in hometown
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Pullela Gopichand is returning to competitive action in his hometown of Hyderabad, where the national badminton championship is getting underway on January 17. The five-time national champion had skipped the two previous editions of the meet because of injury. Gopichand is treating this event as a stage to assess his fitness for upcoming international meets. It should take me about a month after the nationals to get back to peak and I should be okay by the end of February. I will play the All England, French and Swiss Open after that, he said from Hyderabad. Gopichand will have to go through the qualifiers at all these events.  Copyright

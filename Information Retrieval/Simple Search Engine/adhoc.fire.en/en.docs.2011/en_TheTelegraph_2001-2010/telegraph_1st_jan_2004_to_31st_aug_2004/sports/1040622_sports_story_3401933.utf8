The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rooneys 2, and England are through
Lisbon: England made it comfortably through to the Quarter finals of Euro 2004, after all, despite bravehearts Croatia hitting back hard. Sven Goran Erikssons boys won 4-2, starting 0-1 in the arrears. In the process, Wayne Rooney (two goals) has struck four times in three matches of group B and Croatia go home. Niko Kovac put the Croats ahead in the fifth minute through a confused defence, before Paul Scholes brought England back on par on the 40th minute. Rooney took over the job then, striking a minute into first half injury time and then pushing the limits with a solo run score in the 68th. Igor Tudor scored one off a set piece in the 73rd minute, but that was little consolation, Frank Lampard, whose first England goal came in a friendly win over Croatia last August, completing formalities in the 79th minute. England meet hosts Portugal in the quarters. (Reuters)  Copyright

		 Monday, January 05, 2004  Psychic Flame bags third classic crown 
 BY STAR RACER Rajendra, atop Psychic  Flame, acknowledges cheers while weaving his way to  the unsaddling enclosure after winning the Calcutta  Derby Stakes at the RCTC on Sunday. Pictures by Kishor  Roychowdhury  Darius Vijay Calcutta: Psychic Flame  had no peers in the seven horse field as the the double-classic  winning filly romped home with the 2,400m Calcutta Derby  Stakes on Sunday. The Razeen-Eminence daughter had lifted  the 2,000 Guineas and the 1,000 Guineas last month. C. Rajendra  partnered the filly from Darius Byramjis yard. 				 										Darius, incidentally, suffered substantially before the start of the race as his Devils Own was declared a non-starter, for being unruly, and Acquisitive came out of the stalls riderless.				 										Psychic Flames victory looked more impressive in the light of her poor track trials after she claimed the 2,000 Guineas. The stable sources, however, maintained that going easy in trials was part of her preparations in view of her hectic winter season schedules ahead.				 										She, nevertheless, won the Derby in her customary style  off the pace till 600m from home before unleashing her brilliant turn of foot. She took over the running 300m from home prompting Rajendra to comment that he had a very easy ride.				 										The afternoon was, otherwise, dominated by trainer Vijay Singh who led-in four winners. Starting off with a hard-earned victory of Amicable, in the opener, the Kings Academy Cup, Vijay saddled two winners in succession  Shadow Dancing and Thrilling Proposal. Vijays fourth winner, Calorific, gained the short-head verdict over stable-mate Alashaan, thanks to the hard riding and a well-timed effort of Rajendra.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

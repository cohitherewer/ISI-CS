 Robin Singh calls it quits
Chennai, Jan. 24 (PTI): Former India allrounder Robin Singh announced his retirement from first class and international cricket on Saturday. I have no regrets and I was, perhaps, one of the very few to have come back after a seven-year gap at the age of 33 to serve Indian cricket, he said. Known for his athleticism, tenacity and commitment, Robin made his international debut in an ODI against the West Indies in Port-of-Spain in 1988-89. He was not picked again till the Titan Cup in India in 1996 but served the team with distinction after staging the comeback. His last ODI was against Australia in Visakhapatnam in 2001. The 40-year-old was coach of the India under-19 team in the Asia Cup held in Pakistan last year. The Indian youths had won the title. Robin (full name Ravindra Ramnarayan Singh) was born in the Caribbean in September 1963.  He made his first class debut in 1982-83 for Trinidad and started representing Tamil Nadu from 1985-86. The left-handed batsman played in 136 ODIs, making 2336 runs at 25.95. His highest was 100 against Sri Lanka and Robin also took 69 wickets at 43.26. He played just one Test, against Zimbabwe in Harare in 1998.  Copyright

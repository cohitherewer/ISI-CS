The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Army XI enter semi-finals
 - Beighton cup - Punjab Police make progress despite losing 1-5  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Army XI defenders foil a Punjab Police attack during their Beighton Cup match at the CC amp;FC on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: If reputation is the main criteria, Thursdays result at the 109th Beighton Cup hockey tournament at the CC amp;FC was an upset as Army XI shocked Punjab Police 5-1. That put Army XI into the semi-final from the quarter final league as group B toppers with nine points from three wins. Punjab Police, too, made it to the last four stage, having won two to earn six points before this sudden setback. In another match of the group Tamil Nadu XI got the better of Bombay XI 3-0. Both these are now out of the running, Tamil Nadu having earned only three points from one victory, and Bombay XI having failed to log a single point. Punjab Police should take on Punjab and Sind Bank in the semi-final. PSB are leading group A, with six points from two victories. They are virtually through to the semi-finals, and the final say will emerge from their match versus holders Border Security Force. BSF are in the balance, with a win and a loss and Fridays outcome will see them out or in the semi-finals. Corps of Signals are also on three points (a win and a loss), and have a better chance Friday, having to take on Eastern Railway Sports Association, the group A bottom team. It is possible that Army XI will have a nice ride to the final. Respective team strengths have not found Army XI and Punjab Police a mismatch, though, and to that extent the defeat wasnt an upset. It was a total domination that the Armymen had which was surprising. Army went ahead in the fourth minute, S.C. Xalco converting a penalty corner. Before the policemen could take in the reverse, Cyrin Aind rammed home yet another showing fine stickwork as he moved in solo. It was only after the break that Punjab Police managed to make their presence felt as their star international Baljit Singh Dhillon threw one back in the 40th minute scoring off a pass from the rear as he broke into the defence to flick home. The Police defence was, by then, crumbling. There was no stopping the Armymen as Avtar Singh pushed through another in the 47th minute. Dhillon tried a few solo sorties, but was caught every time in the rival back line, lacking little feed from his half line. What little pride Punjab Police were left with went in the 60th minute when Suresh Kumar converted a penalty corner. When the Armymen were awarded another penalty corner, in the 64th minute D. Mandi converted with ease to make it 5-1. Bombay XI were no match for Tamil Nadu XI in the other match. They went ahead in the sixth minute through a Jagan Senthil penalty corner conversion before Prabhakaran made it 2-0 in the 22nd minute. Nagen Dira scored another field goal in the 32nd minute to seal the Bombay teams fate.  Copyright

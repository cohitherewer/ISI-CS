 Smooth return for Serena 
	 - MIAMI MASTERS  Serena Williams in action during her match against Marta Marrero of Spain in Miami on Friday. (AFP) Miami: Serena Williams made a seamless return at the Miami Masters by beating Marta Marrero 6-1, 6-0 to reach the third round on Friday. The former world No. 1 showed no trace of rustiness against the Spanish qualifier as she opened with an ace and breezed to victory in 42 minutes. Serena last played when she beat sister Venus in the Wimbledon final in July. She underwent knee surgery in August before her return was further delayed by a family bereavement. Serena will play Elena Likhovtseva in the next round after the Russian defeated Czech Barbora Strycova 6-1, 6-4. Fourth seed Jennifer Capriati cruised past Czech Klara Koukalova 6-0, 6-1. In the mens draw, third seed Guillermo Coria of Argentina beat South African Wayne Ferreira as he won 7-6 (7-2), 6-0. Seventh-seeded Briton Tim Henman was a surprise loser, going out 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, 6-7 (4-7) to world No. 64 Juergen Melzer. Sixteenth-seeded American Mardy Fish was beaten 4-6, 4-6 by French qualifier Julien Benneteau. Goran Ivanisevic felt pain in his troublesome left shoulder and retired injured from his match against Rafael Nadal when the Spaniard won the first set 6-4. Lleyton Hewitt, seeded 17, demolished Robin Soderling of Sweden 6-4, 6-2.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

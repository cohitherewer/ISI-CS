The Telegraph - Calcutta
England eye historic series win 
- West Indies likely to field all-Barbadian pace attack
Bridgetown: England need at least a draw in the third Test, starting on Thursday at Kensington Oval, to seal their first Test series victory over the West Indies in the Caribbean for 36 years. No one, least of all Michael Vaughan and his side, expected England to be leading the four-Test series 2-0 with two matches remaining. But they have completely outplayed their opponents with disciplined cricket that has highlighted the deep cracks in the West Indies armour. There is even speculation that England could claim their first series whitewash in the Caribbean, although they should cast their minds back to Australias tour last year and South Africas three years ago when those two sides failed in similar bids. The home team have been rocked by the resignation of Ricky Skerritt, their manager for the last four years, but the West Indies Cricket Board has brought in Tony Howard, the former Test off-spin bowler and manager of the Barbados team. The West Indies will be hoping the same virtues that Howard has extolled in those representing his native Barbados  six of whom join him for this Test  will rub off on the rest of the unit and help to transform the complexion of a series. The West Indies are likely to make two changes to their line-up that lost the second Test at Port-of-Spain by seven wickets. Adam Sanford has been dropped and Fidel Edwards has been brought back to bolster the pace attack that will be staffed by all Barbadians. It has been 20 years since Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, Wayne Daniel and Milton Small  all Barbadians  formed the West Indies pace bowling attack against Australia at Port-of-Spain. The other change is likely to come in the middle of the batting. For all his talent, Dwayne Smith batted carelessly in the second Test and his place looks under threat from left-hander Ryan Hinds. A third chance could also be on the cards. Opening batsman Devon Smith injured a finger during a private practice session in his native Grenada and there is some doubt about his ability to last five days. Deciding to be safe rather than sorry, the West Indies selectors have drafted Daren Ganga, who struggled in the position on the recent tour of South Africa, into the squad to cover for Smith. England have no such concerns. They would, however, love for Vaughan or Marcus Trescothick or both to hit some rich form in the Test, but they would be generally satisfied with the way the batting has gone in the Tests. Richard Applewhaite prepares the pitches at the nearby Empire Club, where the strip has been affectionately dubbed the lawn. Although the pitches for the previous two Tests have offered the bowlers pace, bounce and movement, much to the joy of Steve Harmison and company, if Applewhaite and his team can get it right, both sides will enjoy the surface on equal terms.

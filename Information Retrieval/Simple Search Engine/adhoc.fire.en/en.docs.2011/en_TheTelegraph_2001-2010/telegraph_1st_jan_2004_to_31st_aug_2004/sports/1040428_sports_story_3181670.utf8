 Imran blasts PCB over inquiry
	 - HOME SERIES LOSS TO INDIA  Imran feels Pakistan batsmen lack technique Karachi: Former Pakistan great Imran Khan on Tuesday blasted the sports authorities for conducting a medical inquiry over fitness problems following home series defeats against India. Nowhere in the world (has) a medical inquiry of fast bowlers ever been conducted. By doing so, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has made a mockery of Pakistan cricket, Imran, a former captain and renowned fast bowler, said. PCB on Monday opened a medical inquiry over excessive injuries to its players following their first-ever home defeat against India earlier this month. Australian pacers Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath fell injured before and during the series against India earlier this year but did Australia conduct an inquiry? Even Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra broke down during the Pakistan series but India did not launch an inquiry. Paceman Shoaib Akhtar, allrounder Abdul Razzaq and wicketkeeper Moin Khan will appear before a four-member medical commission, headed by orthopaedic surgeon Abdul Wajid in Lahore on Wednesday. The PCB is sidetracking from the main reasons why Pakistan lost the series. Some fast bowler picking injury is not unusual. Why Pakistans bowlers had problems no one bothered to know and no one addressed the need to have a specialised bowling coach, said Imran. Doubts were raised over Akhtars injury during the decisive Test in Rawalpindi after he hurt his wrist and back in a fall on his follow-through on the second day. The 28-year-old Akhtar, who managed a disappointing seven wickets in Pakistans 1-2 series loss, did not take to the field on Day III, and his coming out to bat on Day IV raised suspicions over his injury. To blame one player for a spineless performance is unjustified, Akhtar might be responsible for indiscipline but that should be dealt with then and there. He (Akhtar) won us three series in a row but instead of asking questions and learning lessons from defeats, the PCB has sidetracked. Imran said the main question that needed to be asked concerned the poor batting show against India. Pakistans batting was bowled out in two Tests by inexperienced Indian bowling because our batsmen lack technique due to a poor domestic structure. Apart from captain Inzamam-ul Haq, we have no compact batsman and Mohammed Kaif who finds no place in Indian Test team can walk into the Pakistan side for his technique and temperament, said Imran.

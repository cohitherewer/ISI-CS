The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India likely to play in Pakistan
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: In a step forward to strengthen the relationship with Pakistan, India are likely to participate in a three-nation football tournament to be held in the neighbouring country sometime in January 2005. We have received an invitation from the Pakistan Football Association (PFA) sometime back and we intend to play there in a tri-nation meet, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco told The Telegraph, when contacted over his cellphone in New Delhi. Colaco said that apart from the India and Pakistan, the tournament will also feature United Arab Emirates (UAE). According to him, the tournament was earlier planned for October this year, but as India have their pre-World Cup engagements during that time, AIFF has requested for postponing the schedule to January. Praising the initiative of the Pakistan soccer body, he said the dates for matches are not yet finalised but that will be done shortly. Colaco also said that AIFF will not require any special permission from the government for playing across the border.  Copyright

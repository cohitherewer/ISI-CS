The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ricardo, the goalie who loves to score
 Ricardo at Luz Stadium on Thursday. (AFP) Lisbon: Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo brought a touch of the exotic to the European championship on Thursday when he saved an England penalty before converting the spot kick that propelled the hosts into the semi-finals. At 5-5 in the shoot-out, Ricardo saved Darius Vassells attempt for England. Nuno Valente was already making the dreaded walk from the centre circle towards the penalty area when Ricardo picked up the ball and waved him away. He placed the ball and shot past David James to send the Portuguese half of the Luz stadium wild with delight. Goalscoring keepers are common in South America where Paraguays Jose Luis Chilavert scored more than 50 goals from free kicks and penalties in his career and Rogerio Ceni is regularly knocking them in for Brazilian club Sao Paulo. In the less eccentric world of European football, they are a rarity. Wed talked about it before and decided that if it was necessary, I would take the kick, Ricardo told reporters. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said he agreed with the idea. He takes penalties for Sporting Lisbon, said Scolari. He had made the save and was confident so I gave him the chance to take the kick. Ive seen him in training and his strike rate is very good. Ricardo has been the regular goalkeeper for Portugal under Scolari while Portos Vitor Baia has been surprisingly left out of the squad. Eusebio advice Portugal great Eusebio had some advice for Ricardo before the penalty shootout. Eusebio, European footballer of the year in 1965, said he approached Ricardo before the shootout, and repeated a tip passed on to him by late Soviet Union goalkeeper Lev Yashin. Stay still and look at the player, Eusebio said. Then I told him, Youre going to stop these shots and were going to win. Eusebio, a former Benfica player, was among the first to race onto the Luz stadium pitch to embrace Ricardo, who plays for Benficas crosstown rivals Sporting. He told me, Thanks, King. I told him, Thanks, no, youre rival, but heres the national flag.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

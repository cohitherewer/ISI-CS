 Jyoti cards one-under 
New Delhi, July 17 (PTI): Jyoti Randhawa carded a one-under 70 in the third and penultimate round of the British Open at the par-71 Royal Troon in Scotland. With a three-day tally of two over 215, Randhawa was in the lower rung of the leader-board with the third round still to be completed due to stormy conditions, according to information received here today. Randhawa is the lone Indian contender in the fray after his compatriot Arjun Atwal failed to make the cut applied at 146. He returned a two-round score of 148. Randhawa had scores of two over 73 in the opening round followed by one over in the second round.  Copyright

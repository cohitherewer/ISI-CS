 Anand crushes Karpov
New Delhi: World rapid champion Viswanthan Anand crushed former world champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia to take an unassailable two points lead after the eighth round in the Sao Paulo Rapid chess tournament in Brazil. Anand seems to be in top form after his double triumph on German soil recently, where he won the Dortmund Sparkassen chess meeting 2004 and the Mainz chess classic duel against Alexei Shirov of Spain. Anand now needs just half a point in the remaining two rounds to clinch the title, according to information received here on Tuesday. It took Anand just 39 moves to ground Karpov in a Sicilian defence game with white pieces to take his tally to 6.5 points out of a possible 8 and is trailed by Ivan Morovic Fernandez of Chile, who has 4.5 points in his kitty.

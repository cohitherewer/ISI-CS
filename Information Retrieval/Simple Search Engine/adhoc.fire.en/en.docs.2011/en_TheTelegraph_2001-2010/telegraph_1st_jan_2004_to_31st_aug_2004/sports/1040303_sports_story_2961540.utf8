 Indian juniors drub Malaysia
New Delhi: India scored twice on either sides of the break to drub Malaysia 4-1 in the first junior hockey Test here Tuesday. Captain V. S. Vinay led the goal spree by opening the account in the eighth minute before twin strikes by Girish Pimplay (12th and 62nd) and another by Tushar Khandekar (21st) completed the formalities for the hosts at the Shivaji Stadium. India took 1-0 lead when Vinay dodged several defenders inside the circle and beat the goalkeeper to score a field goal. Soon after Pimplay made it 2-0 when he netted in a long cross from Nitin Kumar from outside the circle. Malaysias only goal was the result of a reverse flick that beat the Indian goalkeeper. But India stamped their authority with two second half goals. Pimpaly and Khandekar combined well to storm past the Malaysian defence for Indias third goal which was followed by a solo effort from Pimplay. The second match of the series will be played Wednesday.  (PTI)  Copyright

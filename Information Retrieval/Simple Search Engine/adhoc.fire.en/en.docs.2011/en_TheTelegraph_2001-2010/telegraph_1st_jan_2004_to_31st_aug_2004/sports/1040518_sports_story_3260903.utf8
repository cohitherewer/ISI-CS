 Ervine wants to start afresh
Perth, May 17 (AFP): Sean Ervine took his first tentative steps here on Monday towards ensuring the next time he mingles with Australian players at an airport it wont be to say goodbye. Ervine, who arrived here on Saturday after crossing paths with the Australians as they arrived at Harare airport for what seems likely to be a horribly one-sided series, made his first formal moves towards becoming an Australian citizen. His long-term aim is to make the Australian team and Ervine hopes to take his first steps by securing a place with Western Australia, which plays in the highly-competitive Sheffield Shield competition. Life as a player has just passed for me in Zimbabwe, he said. Youve got to start afresh and thats what I plan to do. Playing for Australia in the future is a long, long way away. If it comes one day then so be it but Ive got to make sure I get everything sorted out first and then work my way up. Ervine and his partner Melissa, daughter of former Australian batsman Geoff Marsh who now coaches Zimbabwe, met immigration agents to discuss citizenship. He plans to apply for permanent residency status in Australia either by virtue of his cricketing talent or his de facto relationship with Melissa. It was always something which I was going to do in the future, but obviously with the cricket situation back at home it made my decision come a bit quicker, Ervine said. I gave in my retirement letter about three hours before they had an emergency board meeting at which they terminated all our contracts. Ervine and 14 of his white colleagues had their contracts terminated after speaking out against the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. Ervine said several Zimbabwean players had been approached by overseas teams, including one offer from the Tasmanian state side, although he did not say who was targeted or if there was any interest.

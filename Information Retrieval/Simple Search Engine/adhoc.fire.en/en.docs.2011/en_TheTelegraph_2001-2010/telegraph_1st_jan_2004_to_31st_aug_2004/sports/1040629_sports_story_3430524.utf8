 Topalov in semis
Tripoli: Top seeded Grandmaster Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria looked in fine form to march his way to the semi-finals following a much-wanted victory against GM Andrie Kharlov of Russia in the first game of the quarter finals of the world chess championship on Monday. GM Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan lost to GM Lenier Dominiguez of Cuba in his first game. Dominiguez made a mincemeat of Radjabov. Topalovs form is indicative of the champion in the making. Simple and effective was the order of the day for the Bulgarian as he transformed to a minor piece endgame against Kharlov who played black. Bishop often has the final say and it was proved yet again as Kharlovs knight was paralysed beyond control by Topalov who worked his way to the 44-moves victory.  (PTI)  Copyright

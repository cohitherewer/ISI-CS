 School cricket for charity
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Leprosy Mission Trust India will organise a school cricket meet from Thursday to Saturday as part of their leprosy week programmes. Sixteen teams will take part in the knock-out meet, the final of which will be held at the La Martiniere school. The programmes will also include another cricketing showdown among the city churches on Sunday as well as an exhibition basketball tie between two La Martiniere girls teams. Announcing this at a press conference, programme convener Rahul Sequeira said the funds to be fetched out of these tournaments and other donations, will go entirely to the lepers cause.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shikha aiming for semis berth
 Shikha is swimming against the tide New Delhi: With swimmers from the US and Australia all set to make a splash in the Olympic pool, India are pinning their hopes on their lone representative Shikha Tandon, who would be competing in two freestyle events. Swimmers from India, including Sebastian Xavier, have never been able to rise to the occasion in past Olympics and this time it is unlikely to be any different. But Shikha, who would be competing in 50m freestyle and 100m freestyle, is upbeat about her maiden appearance in Olympics although she is aware of daunting task ahead. I am confident and raring to go. The field is tough but I am not losing heart. I am looking for a semi-final place, she said. Despite her high hopes, it may well not turn out to be a dream debut for the swimmer from Bangalore who needs to up her performance by few notches to even cross the heats. Shikha won the silver in Afro-Asian Games last year in Hyderabad, setting a personal best of 26.5 seconds in 50m that secured her an Athens berth. India have never been able to make an impression in the event in past editions of the Olympics despite fielding their best available swimmers. In 1988 Seoul Games, the lone entrant Khazan Singh could not cross the first hurdle - finishing fifth among seven swimmers in the 200m butterfly heats. The last two Olympics  1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games  were no different as Indian swimmers failed to shine with most of them not even repeating their best performances. In Atlanta, Xavier and Sangeeta Rani Puri in the mens and womens 50m freestyle events, respectively, were eliminated in the heats. Xavier, whose personal best was 23.69, clocked 24.15 to end up sixth while Rani, chosen for the Games over Nisha Millet, finished second with 28.02. In Sydney, Nisha got her chance but was not up to the mark finishing 37th out of 39 girls in 200m freestyle. The other swimmer from India, S.H. Hakimuddin fared even worse, finishing 50th out of 51. But these are the things of the past and Shikha, who won the silver in 50m freestyle and bronze in 100m at the Malaysian Open in June this year, promises a better show. I am preparing hard, I am also getting psychological training so that I dont get the big stage fright. And I hope such trainings will help me to do something which no other swimmer from India has been able to achieve. Shikhas confidence oozes from the fact that she is the first Indian girl to complete 50m freestyle in under 27 seconds. She also represented in two Asian Games in 1998 and 2002 and was the lone swimmer from the country to figure in 100m freesytle final in Busan. (PTI)  Copyright

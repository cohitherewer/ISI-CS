 Baros has a ball as Czechs roll on
 FROM HENRY WINTER IN PORTO  Jan Koller celebrates Czech Republics opening goal at the Dragao Stadium in Porto on Sunday For all the neat rapier thrusts of the Czechs nimble attacking, it was not until the beaten Euro 96 finalists employed the broadsword that is the huge Jan Koller that they could find a way through the Danish defence. Kollers towering response to Karel Poborskys corner completely caught out Denmark; the only surprise was that the Czechs had not played to this obvious strength in the preceding 48 minutes, often electing to keep their corners short. Having wielded such a powerful weapon, the Czechs then reverted to the more subtle skills of Milan Baros to exploit spaces opening up as the Danes had to push up more. In the space of three minutes, Baros twice dribbled through to beat Thomas Sorensen first with a lifted finish and then with a thunderous left-footed drive having outstripped Denmarks defence (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). Until Kollers intervention and Baros quick-fire double, two of an average tournaments most attack-minded sides had taken a while to get going here at Portugals most impressive arena. Certainly the drama initially served up was insufficient for a stadium as well appointed as Dragao, home of Porto, the European champions. Despite all the neat movement of individuals such as Tomas Rosicky and Jon Dahl Tomasson, defences had dominated the opening exchanges. Until caught out for two of the Czechs goals, Martin Laursen looked an astute purchase by David OLeary at Aston Villa. The tall centre-half expertly marshalling Denmarks back-line, including an important moment of pressurising of Karel Poborsky as half-time loomed. His subsequent leaden-footed response to Kollers leap was as unexpected as it was expensive. Until then, Denmark kept a steady stream of red waves rolling towards Petr Cechs goal. For all the swift end-to-end nature of the first half, there was little to engage the imagination. The hundreds of England fans present contented themselves with adjusting their flags and staring at the fourth official, a certain Urs Meier. The Czechs were beginning to threaten more on the break, not least when the white-slippered Rosicky cut through Denmarks midfield on a great run before becoming entangled in Morten Olsens excellent defence. As the second half unfolded, only a quick piece of covering by Poulsen prevented the increasingly influential Nedved from getting in a cut-back from close to Sorensens left-hand upright. The danger hardly subsided. Far from it. To the horror of all the Danish fans standing and swaying in that corner of the Dragao, Poborskys corner dropped perfectly for Koller, whose bony forehead sent it flashing like a bullet past Sorensen. Fifteen minutes later, the Czechs struck again, this time through the more delicate skills of Baros, who raced on to Poborskys brilliant pass to embarrass Sorensen with a lofted finish. Baros hunger was not sated; within 100 seconds, he was gliding through again, freed by Nedved, outpacing Laursen to apply the coup de grace.

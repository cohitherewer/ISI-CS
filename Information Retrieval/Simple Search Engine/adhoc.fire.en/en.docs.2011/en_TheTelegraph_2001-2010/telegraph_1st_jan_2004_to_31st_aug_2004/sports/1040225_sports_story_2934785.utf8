The Telegraph - Calcutta
 4th ODI rained off, replay today
	 - SOUTH AFRICA in NEW ZEALAND  South African assistant coach Vincent Barnes (left) and Shaun Pollock in Dunedin on Tuesday. (AFP) Dunedin: The fourth one-day International between New Zealand and South Africa was abandoned because of rain without a ball being bowled on Tuesday. The game will now take place on Wednesday, the official reserve, when rain and strong winds were expected to ease. The rain began shortly before the 2.00 pm (local time) start and did not stop until 4.45 pm. When the umpires then inspected the pitch, they decided the ground would not have sufficient time to dry enough even for a 25-overs-a-side game. The umpires had, earlier, signalled when rain briefly abated that a shortened match might be possible but further showers forced the games postponement. New Zealand lead the six-match series 2-1 after winning the second match in Christchurch by five wickets and the third in Wellington by five runs. South Africa won the opening match in Auckland by five wickets. Harris recalled New Zealands most-capped one-day cricket international Chris Harris was on Tuesday handed a surprise recall for Saturdays fifth one-dayer against South Africa. Just when it seemed his 238-match career was on the skids at just one wicket short of the 200 milestone, the 34-year-old was included by coach John Bracewell in a 13-man squad otherwise unchanged. THE SQUAD Stephen Fleming (captain), Michael Papps, Hamish Marshall, Scott Styris, Craig McMillan, Chris Cairns, Jacob Oram, Brendon McCullum, Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey, Michael Mason, Chris Harris.

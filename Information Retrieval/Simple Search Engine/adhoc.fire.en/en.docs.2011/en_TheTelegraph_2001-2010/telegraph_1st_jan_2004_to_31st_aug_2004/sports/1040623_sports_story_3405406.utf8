 Henry rediscovers himself 
 - Swiss teenager Johann Vonlanthen becomes youngest to score in Euro finals  FROM CHRISTOPHER DAVIES IN COIMBRA  Thierry Henry and Zinedine Zidane in full flow in Coimbra on Monday. (AP) France moved unconvincingly into the quarter finals on Monday thanks to Thierry Henrys first international goals of the year (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). With Switzerland threatening to unsettle the reigning European champions with their speed in attack, substitute Louis Saha, with his first touch of the match, knocked on Zinedine Zidanes 76th-minute free-kick for Henry to break his Euro 2004 duck with a left-foot finish. Henrys relief was obvious as his strike helped to give France their 15th win in their last 16 competitive games, but they are still not firing on all cylinders. The Arsenal striker almost made it 3-1 in the 83rd minute, his header from Robert Pires cross being saved by Jorg Stiel but Henry made up for his miss a minute later. Collecting the ball on the left wing, he went by a defender with the greatest of ease before guiding the ball past a bemused Stiel. Henry has been a shadow of the player who won two consecutive Footballer of the Year trophies in England, but France will hope the closing stages of Monday nights victory are a sign of things to come as the prepare to play Greece in the quarter finals. France coach Jacques Santini dropped captain Marcel Desailly and Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre lined up alongside Lilian Thuram in the centre of defence. Significantly Zidane was given a more central role rather than playing on the left. This enabled Pires to return to his preferred position. Switzerland, who made five changes to the team defeated by England, were without striker Alexander Frei who has been provisionally suspended by Uefa for 15 days after new television footage released by Swiss TV appeared to show him spitting at Steven Gerrard during the game against England. Without Frei, Hakan Yakin assumed more responsibility and the Switzerland playmaker had a 25-yard free-kick acrobatically tipped over by Fabien Barthez as Switzerland took the early initiative. Switzerland paid for their profligacy in the 20th minute when Zidane, proving to be the master of the set-piece at this tournament, rose to beat Jorg Stiel and head in Pires right-wing corner. However, six minutes later the Swiss were level with one of the best goals of the tournament so far. Yakin stepped over Daniel Gygaxs pass enabling the ball to reach Ricardo Cabanas. The midfielders angled pass to Johann Vonlanthen bamboozled the France defence and the PSV Eindhoven teenager outpaced Bixente Lizarazu before beating Barthez with a low shot from 15 yards. Vonlanthen, born on February 1, 1986, is 100 days younger than Wayne Rooney and therefore snatched a record from the England striker who had become the youngest player to score in a European Championship finals only last week by netting against Switzerland. A late call-up to the squad, Vonlanthen made his debut only in the last warm-up against Liechtenstein. The son of a Colombian mother and Swiss father he lived in South America until he was 12, joining PSV from Young Boys last July.

A minute before half-time, Henry had missed a sitter when he headed Zidanes left-wing cross wide with the goal at his mercy. The Arsenal strikers misery continued when he was cautioned for diving two minutes after the interval. France increased the tempo and Pires had a volley blocked but errors in midfield were allowing Switzerland to counter-attack. Despite the promptings of Zidane, France were finding Switzerland stubborn opposition. Eventually, though, Henry found the killer touch to set up a quarter final clash with Greece TEAMS France: Fabien Barthez; Willy Sagnol (William Gallas 46, Jean-Alain Boumsong 90+2), Lilian Thuram, Mikael Silvestre, Bixente Lizarazu; Patrick Vieira, Claude Makelele, Robert Pires, Zinedine Zidane; Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet (Louis Saha 75).

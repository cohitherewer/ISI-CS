		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
 Paul Hamm, the American gymnast whose Olympic mens all-around victory has been protested by South Korean officials, said he would give back his gold medal if the international gymnastics federation (FIG) officials declare that is the proper course. If they decide I should give back the gold medal, then I will, Hamm said on Sunday. I personally believe Im still the Olympic champion.				 																																	The Koreans objected that Yang Tae-young was given a start value of 9.9 rather than 10 on his horizontal bar routine in the all-around final rotation. If Yang had started from 10 rather than 9.9, he would have beaten Hamm for the all-around gold medal by .051 of a point Wednesday rather than finishing third behind Hamm and compatriot Kim Dae-eun. Trevor Graham, the coach of Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlin, admitted on Monday he had been the unidentified coach who sent a syringe of the designer steroid THG (tetrahydrogestrinone) to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). I did it. As a coach it seemed the right thing to do at the time and it still does, he said after Gatlin won the sprint gold in Athens on Monday. Would I do it again? Yes.				 																																	The receipt of the syringe in June last year touched off an international doping scandal. Graham had never previously acknowledged he was the man who contacted USADA claiming to be a well-known athletics coach who had obtained a potent new designer drug which he said was being used by a number of leading athletes. Greek Olympic boxer Elias Pavlidis says piano is the drug that lifts him before he steps into the ring. Yes, I do take drugs, but my anabolics are classical music, piano, said the 26-year-old light-heavyweight, whose country has been rocked by a series of doping scandals since the start of the Games.				 																																	If they tested me, I believe they would find in my blood the notes of (Russian composer Sergei) Rachmaninov, Pavlidis said. I play the piano before every bout, added the Russian-born boxer, who will face Egypts Ahmed Ismail on Tuesday for a place in the semi-finals that would guarantee him a medal. Men are from Mars, women are from Venus and it looks as if Kim Sang-ryul is on another planet altogether after reopening old wounds over who is the fairest of them all when it comes to sport. Kim is the coach of the South Korean Olympic Games womens hockey team who resigned in disgust claiming men were easier to coach than women. Never again will I coach a womens team, said the 57-year-old Kim after Koreas 2-3 defeat to Germany.				 																																	How can I train them? I cant get inside their heads. When I ask them to do things they never say no, never question, they just say yes. They dont get involved. When one player was angry, everybody else goes silent and they slowly go down. Boys are not like that. A Greek prosecutor on Monday launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the positive dope test given by Greek weightlifter Leonidas Sampanis, a judicial source said. Sampanis, who lost his bronze medal on Sunday after testing positive for testosterone, has vehemently protested his innocence saying a drink he consumed after the competition but prior to the doping control had been spiked. He was the first Greek athlete to win a medal at the Games and the first to have it taken away. Piraeus prosecutor Grigoris Peponis, under whose jurisdiction the Nikaia weightlifting centre is, has launched the investigation to examine what happened on the night of Sampanis bronze medal and the doping control afterwards, the source said. There wont be much of a need for a scouting report or film study for New Zealand coach Tom Maher as his team prepares to play Australia in the womens basketball quarter finals. He spent eight years in charge of the Australian programme.I look forward to it with relish, he said. Maher coached Australia to a bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and silver four years later in Sydney. He then became the first foreign coach in the WNBA, but his stint with the Washington Mystics lasted just one season. His old job was filled by current Australia coach Jan Sterling, so Maher took over the other programme in Oceania. Its going to be tough. I love Tommy, said Australian star Lauren Jackson, last seasons WNBA most valuable player in Seattle. Serbia and Montenegro association head Dragan Stojkovic and chief national coach Ilija Petkovic resigned after a string of humiliating defeats by the soccer team and unrelated threats from a group of fans. According to newspaper reports, Petkovic and Stojkovic declined to say why they quit and only gave brief and somewhat emotional statements. I never gave up anything in my life ... But this is about a game in which I cannot win, said Stojkovic. The newspaper reported Stojkovic and Petkovic received threats of physical violence from fans in their homeland.				 																																	The threats were reported to police.

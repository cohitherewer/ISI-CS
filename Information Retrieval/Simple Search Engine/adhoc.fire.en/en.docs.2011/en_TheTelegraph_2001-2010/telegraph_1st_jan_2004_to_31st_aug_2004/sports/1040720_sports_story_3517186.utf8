The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pressure from fans hurts Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Days before leaving for the Leicester City 120th anniversary tournament in England, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick feels sad and frustrated because of invisible pressures. I dont know what do to do as a majority of the fans are not being able to understand my feelings, Bhowmick said at the club tent on Monday. He was pointing to the section of fans who feel being let down and disappointed by the coachs plans to experiment at this part of the season, so that the team can approach the England meet, AFC Cup and the domestic majors in better shape. Only a few club officials were with me when I said that I want to focus on England and not on local league matches. But to satisfy the majority of fans, I have to stop experimenting. This eventually affects the preparation process. He rued that his players have not been able to utilise in full the services of physical trainer Peter McNight. The Englishman was flown in for a six-week deal around a fortnight back. Nonetheless, the prospect of playing in England is exciting Bhowmick. I am thrilled when I think about this meet as this is a much better quality tournament than the Asean Club Cup we won in Indonesia last year. It is not impossible to play the final by winning the first match against Leicester City XI, he said. At the moment, the East Bengal coach is expected to start paying special attention to the set of players who would figure prominently in his scheme of things in England. Stars Bhaichung Bhutia and Douglas da Silva will come under special treatment because they were late in joining the teams conditioning programme.  Copyright

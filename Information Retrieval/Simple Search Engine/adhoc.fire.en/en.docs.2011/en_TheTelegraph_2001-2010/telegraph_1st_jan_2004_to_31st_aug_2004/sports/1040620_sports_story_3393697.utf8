 Figo, Raul in friendship test
 BY SAM WALLACE  Luis Figo It has been almost 23 years since Portugal last beat Spain, but never have the host nation of Euro 2004 needed a victory over their neighbours as much as they do Sunday night when Luis Figo has vowed to put aside his friendship with Raul, his Real Madrid teammate, and keep his country in the competition. Portugals captain, 31, said Friday that his countrys showdown with Spain to earn a place in the knock-out stage was the most important game of his career and that the elimination of the tournament hosts would be unthinkable. The winger was switched from right to left by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari for the 2-0 victory over Russia, but this time the Brazilian is expected to stick largely with the same controversial starting line-up  again excluding Fernando Couto and Rui Costa  with which he began on Wednesday. The only change could be the inclusion of Manchester Uniteds winger Cristiano Ronaldo whose dazzling displays as a late substitute in both Portugals games could well see Scolari drop Simao to make room for the teenager on the opposite flank to Figo. The performances of Ronaldo, who comes from Funchal on the island of Madeira, have captured the hearts of the home fans. Laszlo Boloni, his former Sporting Lisbon coach and the man credited with discovering the player, said: Its true that Cristiano is sometimes over the top with his step-overs but the pass to Rui Costa for the second goal was that of a great player. Boloni, now with French club Rennes, added: He is assured of a future as a great player. I hope he takes his success with the same modesty as Eusebio and Figo because that will make the Portuguese happy. Meanwhile, caoch Inaki Saez makes two enforced changes to the Spain side. He is without defender Carlos Marchena, who is suspended after picking up a second booking against Greece, and Joseba Etxeberria is injured. Raul, Spains captain, said: I have a lot of good friends in the Portugal side like Luis Figo. When we played them in a friendly earlier this season we won, so that will help our confidence. Obviously, Portugal will have more fans but we are playing near to home and we have had great support so far. Petr Cech, Chelseas new goalkeeper who faces Holland Saturday in a key group D match for the Czech Republic, has pledged to claim the No. 1 spot from Carlo Cudicini. The 22-year-old, who cost 8.5 million from Rennes, said: Ive seen every match Chelsea have played in the Champions League and some of their games in the Premiership, and I know I will have to fight hard against him to win my place but Im confident.

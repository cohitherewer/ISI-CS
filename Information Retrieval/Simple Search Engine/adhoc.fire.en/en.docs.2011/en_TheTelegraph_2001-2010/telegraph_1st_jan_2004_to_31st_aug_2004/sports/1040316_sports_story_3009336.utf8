The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Loose soil under Fergusons feet
 Ferguson has a lot to answer for London: Manchester Uniteds humbling defeat at rivals Manchester City on Sunday summed up the champions decline this season and raised questions over manager Alex Fergusons leadership. United lost 1-4 to City after a display that starkly exposed the teams defensive frailties and left them looking a shadow of the side that fought back from a 1-3 derby defeat last season to surge to the title. They showed some nice touches in attack and had the best of the first half but when things began to turn Citys way after the break nobody in a red shirt seemed able to get hold of the game and drive the champions on. Ferguson was scathing about his sides performance: We produced the kind of sloppy defending that has been endemic in our play over the last couple of months, he said. But the 62-year-old must accept responsibility for a series of events that have overshadowed Uniteds season. United failed to reach the quarter finals of the Champions League last Tuesday for the first time in eight years after losing 2-3 on aggregate to Porto. Two points from their last four league games have seen them slip to third in the Premier League, three points behind second-placed Chelsea and 12 adrift of Arsenal, leaving them in danger of having to face an unwelcome and risky qualifying tie to reach next seasons Champions League. The reshuffled defence has not kept a clean sheet since beating third division Northampton Town in the fourth round of the FA Cup in January. If (Sundays) defeat doesnt emphasise the current weaknesses in our squad them I dont know what will, one United fan wrote on the clubs website. Ferguson may have resolved his dispute with Irish businessman John Magnier over breeding rights for racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, but the settlement 10 days ago was too little too late after months of wrangling that appeared to distract the manager from his on-pitch responsibilities.

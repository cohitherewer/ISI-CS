The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengals Paul emerges dark horse
 - ASIA CUP PROBABLES 
- Selectors may pick more than 20; Bihars Dhoni in the frame somewhat  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sourav has had a tete-a-tete with KirmaniCalcutta, June 19: Bengal medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul has emerged a dark horse ahead of tomorrows selection of the probables for the July 16-beginning Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. According to The Telegraphs sources, also in the frame somewhat is Bihar wicketkeeper Mahender Singh Dhoni. Well-placed, of course, is Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar. While the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has announced 20 probables are going to be picked, chief selector Syed Kirmani has gone on record saying he preferred choosing 24. Obviously, the beneficiaries should largely be the new-ball bowlers. Speaking from home turf Bangalore, where he and his colleagues (Kirti Azad, Pranab Roy, Kiran More and Sanjay Jagdale) will have yet another sitting, Kirmani said a formal proposal is going to be placed before the BCCI once secretary S.K. Nair reaches the city. Incidentally, contacted on his cellphone, Nair didnt exactly give a clear-cut answer as to whether the BCCI is game for a larger probables pool. The probables will head to Chennai for the 2004-05 seasons only full-fledged preparatory camp, from July 3-8. Apparently, Team India captain Sourav Ganguly had a chat with Kirmani during the just-ended (general) fitness camp in Bangalore and both favoured more than 20 being picked. If the BCCI gives the green signal, Paul and Dhonis chances are going to improve dramatically. Paul had a terrific 2003-04 season; Dhoni too was impressive, both behind the stumps and with the bat. Be it 20 or 24, most of the probables are certainties  its for a few slots that the selectors bargain among themselves and, in the process, somebody or the other does get unlucky. Easts Pranab will probably have a restless night before boarding the first flight for Bangalore. Paul and Dhoni apart, the rookies in contention are tearaways Munaf Patel and N.C. Aiyappa. Also, it wont surprise if U-19 wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik  another rookie  figures in the discussions. Even if he doesnt, now, this Tamil Nadu lad is one to watch out for. Sadly, though, nobody is talking about the gifted Sridharan Sriram. He has taken time to mature but, today, wheres the place? Where do we fit him? asked one of the selectors, who actually admires the allrounder. Sriram must be asking even more questions.  Copyright

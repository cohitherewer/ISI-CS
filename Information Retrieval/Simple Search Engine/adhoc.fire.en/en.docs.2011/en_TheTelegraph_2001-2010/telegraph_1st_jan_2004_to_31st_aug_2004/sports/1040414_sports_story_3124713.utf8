 Mickelson is now a major threat
 FROM LEWINE MAIR IN AUGUSTA Now that he has finally cracked it, Phil Mickelson could win plenty of Majors. He will start as favourite in the US Open at Shinnecock Hills in June, while it will be interesting to see what becomes of him in the British Open at Troon at a stage in his career when he has learned to control the ball so much better. His best Open effort came at Troon in 1997. Then, in his only top-20 finish from 11 starts, he claimed a share of 11th place. At the start of the US Masters last week, the general view was that golf needed Tiger Woods to win again, after a low-key 2003 season in which Mike Weir won the Masters, Jim Furyk the US Open, Ben Curtis the British Open and Shaun Micheel the PGA Championship. None of them made major waves. Yet huge admiration though one has for Woods, the truth was that this Masters did not need him. Mickelson and Ernie Els more than carried the show. Augusta had set the stage by giving the players the chance to make things happen on the back nine, and the pair seized their opportunities. Mickelson notched a remarkable five birdies in his last seven holes to edge past Els, whose 67 had included a couple of eagles.Els was a broken man at the finish. Usually no one takes defeat better than he does, but this really hurt. An Augusta crowd are always going to be pretty fair, but Mickelson was patently their favourite. Els had no trouble in handling that, but he must have been stung on Saturday when, in the wake of the drop he had been given from deep in the woods at the 11th, an American pressman asked him to address the subject of his lucky drops in majors. There were also e-mails coming in to the Golf Channel from viewers noting that his ball had moved in the undergrowth  something of no consequence as he was given a drop. If he knew about that, it would doubtless have made him still more determined to claim the green jacket. There were plenty of other dramas, what with Padraig Harrington and Kirk Triplett both hitting on a hole in one as the best way to keep the ball on the green of the short 16th. K.J. Choi contributed that holed second at the 11th, while what of Sergio Garcias running jump up the leaderboard? The Spaniard, who missed eight out of 20 cuts in the United States last year, finished eagle, birdie, birdie, par for a 66, the lowest round of the tournament. He said the press would say that the old Sergio was back, when he wanted the world to know that they were seeing a new one. A more mature version.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

 Saini slams IHF experiment policy 
New Delhi: Slamming the experimentation policy of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), hockey star Baljit Singh Saini questioned the rationale behind his exclusion from a pool of 30 Olympic hopefuls, on Sunday. Saini, alongwith Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon, failed to make to the side for a four-nation meet in Japan as well as a fitness camp in Barog, and the player admitted that the doors were closed on me by the controversial decisions. It is too late to experiment with the team with the Olympics just a few months away. Had the experimentation been done last year, there would have been some justification, the 30-year-old full-back said. The experiments have not helped. Last year there was a feeling that the Indian team could beat anyone but that impression is fast fading away. Reacting to IHFs explanation to the absence of the three stalwarts from the pool that they needed players who could withstand the pressure of playing tough games for the entire duration of the match, he said, who said I cant play for 70 minutes. Just a few days back I played the full duration in some matches in Calcutta in a departmental tournament. I dont see any reason behind the decisions... I cant understand why I was not picked. I am disappointed obviously, but not shocked. The developments in the last few days were enough to indicate that we three were on our way out.  (PTI)  Copyright

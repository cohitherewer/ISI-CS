The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Guga battles pain into last eight
 - Mahesh-Max in semi-finals - Four Argentines in Grand Slam quarters for first time  Russian Marat Safin hits a backhand to Argentine David Nalbandian in the fourth round of the French Open at Roland Garros on Monday. Safin lost 5-7, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 3-6. (AFP) Paris: If love conquers all, Gustavo Kuerten already has one hand on the French Open crown. The Brazilians lasting romance with Paris and the Roland Garros Centre Court crowd enjoyed another twist on Monday when he meandered into the quarter finals of the Grand Slam. His 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 victory over Spains Feliciano Lopez thrilled the Parisian crowd and was a triumph of determination over pain, the Brazilian shrugging off a hip injury to progress. Kuerten will face eight-seeded Argentine David Nalbandian in the last eight after the 2002 Wimbledon runner-up beat Marat Safin 7-5, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3. Nalbandians victory means there are four Argentines in the quarter finals of the mens singles at a Grand Slam event for the first time. Third seed Guillermo Coria, Juan Ignacio Chela and Gaston Gaudio are the three others. Safin, suffering from severe blisters on his hands, was powerless to prevent Nalbandian advancing. My hands are bleeding... I couldnt play at the end. Lleyton Hewitt joined Kuerten and Nalbandian in the quarters with a 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) win over Belgiums Xavier Malisse. The Australian will face Gaudio next after the Argentine ended Russian Igor Andreevs run 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. Champion here in 1997, 2000 and 2001, every time Kuerten takes to the Centre Court, the stands ring with fans chanting his name. On Saturday, that support helped him beat world No. 1 Roger Federer in the third round. On Monday, it helped him block out the pain of a persistent hip injury. 			After my surgery (in 2002) my hip is not able to work as before, the 27-year-old said. Its sometimes very painful and frustrating on court. If I am out there trying hard for one hour I start to get some pain in my leg. Nalbandians win over Safin put him into the quarter finals of the French for the first time. I am very, very happy to reach this stage, he said, before sympathising with Safin for the state of his hands. Safin, who reached the fourth round with two draining five-set wins, bravely played through the pain of several blisters on his left hand but finally ran out of steam. Leander-Martina out Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova, meanwhile, crashed out in the second round of the mixed doubles, while Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi progressed to the mens doubles semi-finals. The sixth-seeded Indo-US pair lost to unseeded Angelique Widjaja of Indonesia and Lucas Arnold of Argentina 5-7, 5-7. Earlier on Monday, Bhupathi and Mirnyi of Belarus scored a clinical 6-3, 6-4 win over Karsten Braasch of Germany and Sargis Sargsian of Armenia to book a berth in the semis. In the boys singles, Tushar Liberhan came from behind to upset 10th seed Jun Woong-sun of Korea 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 to make the third round. Twelfth seed Karan Rastogi, however, went down to Martin Fisher of Austria 2-6, 6-1, 3-6. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hari, Ramesh split point 
Abu Dhabi: GM P. Harikrishna settled for a draw with GM R.B. Ramesh in the sixth round of the 14th Abu Dhabi chess festival. The result put both Indians in joint-sixth spot. GM Ghaem Maghami Ehsan of Iran emerged sole leader with 5 points in this $16,000 prize-money tournament. Half-a-point behind Maghami are Armenian duo of Ashot Anastasian, Artashes Minasian, Russians Evgeny Gleizerov, Mikhail Kobalia and Kazakh Pavel Kotsur. Harikrishna, Ramesh and GM Tejas Bakre are among the next set of players with 4 points each. Top seed Evgeny Vladimirov (Kazakhstan), Dmitry Bocharov (Russia) and Mahjoob Morteja (Iran) are also in that group. Former Asian junior girls champion Tania Sachdev inched closer to her second WGM norm after beating IM Neelotpal Das in a well-contested game. Up against the Neo-Grunfeld, Tania gave ample demonstration of her growing positional sense and capitalised on an inferior plan by Das to achieve victory. The Delhi-based girl now has 3.5 points and needs one more from the next three games to get the coveted norm. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Afridi likely to make squad
Lahore: The Pakistan squad for the first two one-dayers against India will be announced on Friday with allrounder Shahid Afridi in contention, chief selector Wasim Bari said Wednesday. We have decided to announce the team for the first two one-dayers on Friday, Bari said. The first match will be played in Karachi on March 13 while the second is in Rawalpindi on March 16. We think that two matches provide a player ample opportunity to gain rhythm and after that we will announce the team for the remaining matches, said Bari. Bari admitted Afridi is in the picture for one of the two allrounders spots but ruled out any chance for former captain Waqar Younis. He (Afridi) is in the frame for he has been shaping up well in the camp and we need two good allrounders. But since Waqar did not play any first-class game, we are not considering him, Bari said. Our preference is to select those players who have been playing and performing in the domestic matches. Pakistans tune-up camp in Lahore with 26 players in attendance will shift to Karachi on Monday.

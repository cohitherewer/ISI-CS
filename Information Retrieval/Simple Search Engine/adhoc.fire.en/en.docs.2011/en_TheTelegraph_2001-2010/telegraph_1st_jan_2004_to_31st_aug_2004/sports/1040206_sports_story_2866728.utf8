 India hold Holland 
 - Gagan Ajit scores spectacular equaliser  Indias Prabhjot Singh dribbles past Holland defenders in Hyderabad on Thursday. (AFP) Hyderabad: Star forward Gagan Ajit Singh scored a spectacular equaliser in the 45th minute as the first hockey Test between India and Holland ended in a 1-1 draw at the Gachibowli Stadium on Thursday. Trailing 0-1 at halftime, the Indians rose to the occasion as Gagan took a fine pass from Baljit Singh Dhillon to beat the Dutch goalkeeper hands down and restore parity after Taeke Taekema put the visitors ahead. Taekema converted a penalty corner with superb skill as the visitors went up 1-0 in the 32nd minute. India equalised after Dhillon took a long pass from Vikram Pillai and relayed it to Gagan, who beat the Dutch goalkeeper Guus Vogels with a fine scoop. The sparse crowd greeted the goal with a thunderous applause. Earlier, the three-Test series got off to sparkling start with both sides showing shades of aggression. But it was Holland who had the upperhand in the first half as they earned as many as eight penalty corners. After dominating the proceedings with most of the action in the Indian midfield, Holland took the lead making full use of a penalty corner. Teun Nooijer pushed the ball with precision and Taekema baffled Indian custodian Devesh Chauhan with a fine shot.  (PTI)  Copyright

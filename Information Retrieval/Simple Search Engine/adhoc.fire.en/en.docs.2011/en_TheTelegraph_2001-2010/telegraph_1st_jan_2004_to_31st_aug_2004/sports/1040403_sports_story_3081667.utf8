 Akram wants early settlement
Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram said on Friday he was distressed over court cases against him and wanted to settle them once and for all for his peace of mind. People seek publicity through cases and this jeep case is also one of them. I cant think of taking anyones vehicle, Akram said. A civil court in Karachi on Thursday rejected Akrams appeal for bail before arrest after a family friend, Shahadat Hussain, filed a case against him for stealing his jeep a year ago. The Clifton police lodged an FIR against the legendary fast bowler last year and issued warrants against him. He (Shahadat) left the jeep at our home but its sale never came in discussion and now he has come up with a case, said Akram. Court cases against cricket celebrities are common in Pakistan. Akram got bail in another case last month after a private citizen Najmul Abbas filed a case against the former great for modelling in an Indian liquor advertisement. Akram had denied ever appearing in a liquor ad. Another case, against the only bowler to take more than 400 wickets in both Test and one-day Internationals, to restrain him from offering tips to Indian bowlers was dismissed recently. In the jeep case, Akram is set to hire the services of former Supreme Court judge Fakhruddin Ibrahim.  (PTI)  Copyright

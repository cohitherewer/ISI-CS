The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes, Bhupathi in same half
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes have been drawn in the same half of the Wimbledon doubles draw, thus avoiding a possible clash before the semi-finals. Third seeds Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi, last years losing finalists, will open their campaign against Hicham Arazi and Joshua Eagle. The Indo-Belarussian pairs likely quarter-final opponents would be sixth seeds Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett. Paes and David Rikl, seeded No. 11, will first face little-known Italians Giorgio Galimberti and Daniele Bracciali. If the seedings hold good, Paes and Rikls first real test will be in Round 3  against Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor  followed by a quarter-final meeting with second seeds Mike and Bob Bryan.

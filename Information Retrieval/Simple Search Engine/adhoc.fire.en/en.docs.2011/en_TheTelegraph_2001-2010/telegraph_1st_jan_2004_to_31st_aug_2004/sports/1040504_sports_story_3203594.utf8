 Dhillon blames Rajinder 
 Dhillon says IHF decision may cost country dear New Delhi: A day after being excluded from a pool of 30 Olympic hopefuls, striker Baljit Singh Dhillon said on Monday the Indian Hockey Federations (IHF) plan to ignore senior players and blood youngsters could cost the country dearly. They should not take chances in the Olympics by picking youngsters, who lack international exposure. Its quite tough at the highest level and there is a big gulf between senior and junior matches, Dhillon said from Jalandhar. I dont think the inexperienced players have the temperament required in big matches. They may not able to handle the pressure. You cant replace experienced players in the Olympics with juniors. It may cost the team a lot. Dhillon, who has so far played over 300 international matches in a career spanning over a decade, blamed coach Rajinder Singh for his omission. I played fairly well in the Azlan Shah Cup, test series against Holland and the Olympic qualifiers. I am also completely fit. I dont know why I was not picked. Its beyond my comprehension. May be the coach does not want me in the side, the 30-year-old said. I dont think fitness was the criteria for selection. I can very well meet the need. I have played in tough conditions over the years. Even in the Olympic qualifiers in Madrid, we played in sub-zero conditions, he said. Dhillon, who was not part of the experimental side that played two tournaments in Australia last month, said just a few days back the IHF secretary and coach Rajinder had asked him to be ready for a call. They said that just be fit as we may call you at any moment. But to my utter surprise I never got the call. Rather they ignored me both for the fitness camp in Barog and the four-nation tournament in Japan. I dont understand why they did so. Dhillon as well as two other seniors  Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Saini  were not included in an 18-member experimental side to play in Japan and did not feature among the dozen names for the fitness camp in Barog starting May 10. IHF chief K.P.S. Gill said that the probables for Olympics would be picked from these 30 players but added that one or two players could be considered from outside this pool. I dont know whats in store for me. But I am keeping my fingers crossed, Dhillon said. (PTI)  Copyright

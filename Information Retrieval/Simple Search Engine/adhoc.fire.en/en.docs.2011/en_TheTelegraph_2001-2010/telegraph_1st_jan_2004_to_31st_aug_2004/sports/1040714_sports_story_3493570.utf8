The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Club football will continue to rule the roost
Free-Kick
P.K.BanerjeeEuro 2004 came to a hugely unexpected end, not just throwing up a new champion, but also raising a few questions that will linger and trouble the traditionally big nations ahead of every tournament of such stature.																								Were the big names not all jaded  overworked and emotionally dry after sweating it out months on end for their clubs in the most demanding and lucrative of club leagues?																								There is every reason to believe they were and also a temptation to predict that things will not change in the World Cup two years later. The Korea-Japan experience in 2002 was probably a right indicator.																								It has to be accepted that this state of international football, for events featuring national teams, will have to comply with the arrangement that is governing the commerce of the game. Club football will rule and the World Cup, European Championship will suffer.																								The absence of stars and lukewarm media attention towards the Copa America, Asian Cup or even Olympic football illustrate this point. Rehhagel just wanted to survive and slow-poison the oppositionThis is not to deny Greece credit for the Herculean job they did. I have a feeling that the ensuing Athens Olympics inspired the footballers and this success will inspire the whole of their country ahead of the greatest show on earth.																								An upset of this magnitude is unprecedented. Denmark did win the crown as wild cards in 1992, but it was nothing compared to the steadfastness and ruthlessness shown by Otto Rehhagels team.																								Sadly for Germany, they will not enjoy the services of the biggest star of Euro 2004. It was surprising to see the top brass of German football administration rooting for Rehhagel after his instant success. It was too ambitious and very un-German.																								With due respect to all concerned, it is tempting to believe that Rehhagels success surpassed his own expectations. It was a relentless exercise to survive, not win, the formula being to slow-poison the opposition.																								I dont think this method will produce another champion outfit unless the rigours of the increasingly demanding club calendar eclipse the European Championship.																								This championship underlined the demise of the historically big teams like Germany and Italy. Of course, the Czech Republic  unquestionably the best side in Portugal  deserved better than a semi-final ouster.																								The Czechs lit up the championship just as Portugal had four years ago and, coincidentally, lost to the eventual champions in the semi-finals. The number of chances they created against this stoic Greek defence underlined their class.																								Germany and Italy cut a very sorry figure. I know their roots are very strong, but cant help worrying about the future of their national teams. Their club teams are still among the top ones, but that hardly reflects in their patchy performance in international events over the last few years.																								Though Germany have an inspirational leader in Ballack, the others just dont seem to pick up the cue. The ones like Schweinsteiger impressed in patches, but the overall showing was below-par for a team which will be the home favourites in a World Cup in two years time. 																								I wonder what happened to the team that went on to win the European title against all odds in 1996.																								While its unwise to think that a Lothar Matthaeus or Mattias Sammer will surface every five years, but what happened to the likes of Miroslav Klose? I thought he was the one who could fill the gap left by Bierhoff and left unused by Karl Heinz Riedle. 																								Just two years after the last World Cup, this striker is not to be seen. Germany must unearth something new very quickly in order to protect pride in two years from now.

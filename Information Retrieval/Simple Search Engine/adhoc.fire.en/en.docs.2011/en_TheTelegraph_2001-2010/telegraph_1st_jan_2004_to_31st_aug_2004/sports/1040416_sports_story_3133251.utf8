 Mind power lifted Lara: Viv
St Johns: Sheer genius and power of the mind propelled West Indies captain Brian Lara to his world record innings of 400 not out against England, Sir Vivian Richards said on Wednesday. It could only be a genius who can achieve things like that, said Richards, the former West Indies skipper and master batsman who is now chairman of the selectors. I believe it was totally magnificent. Richards, the highest run-getter for the West Indies until Lara eclipsed him last year, said the southpaws mental strength was the most important factor of the innings. The power of the mind was more important that anything else, he said. Lara batted for more than 13 hours and faced 584 deliveries in Antigua to reclaim the world record from Matthew Hayden. Richards said it would be foolhardy to suggest that another batsman or Lara could not surpass the record. Once Brian Lara is playing you should never say never ever, Richards said. We should leave all things open because anything is possible.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

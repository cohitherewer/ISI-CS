The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak cruise past Bangla
	 - Shoaib buries fitness doubts  Yasir Hameed, who hit a century against Bangladesh in Colombo on Saturday. (AFP) Colombo, July 17 (PTI): Yasir Hameed cracked a sparkling century as Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 76 runs in a group A match of the Asia Cup on Saturday. The opener paced his innings brilliantly for his third ODI century (102 off 123 balls), against a modest Bangladesh attack as Pakistan posted 257 for six. Shoaib Akhtar then put to rest all speculation about his fitness by producing a devastating spell and claimed three for 30 as Bangladesh folded up for 181 in 45.2 overs. Javed Omar waged a lone battle, scoring 62 off 86 balls, before being controversially ruled run out as replays showed Shoaib Malik disturbing the bails before collecting the ball. Alok Kapali struck 28 off 27 balls to provide some late sparks but the required rate by then had climbed beyond manageable limits. Omar and Mohammed Ashraful had started well, adding 48 in ten overs, before Mohammed Sami took two quick wickets to halt their progress. Sami had Ashraful caught behind and then trapped captain Habibul Bashar plumb in front. Bangladesh never recovered from the twin blow although the late order delayed the inevitable. Electing to bat, Pakistan were off to a steady start courtesy the 26-year-old Hameed and Imran Farhat who put on 86 before debutant Abdur Razzaq removed the latter. Bangladesh, who have virtually sealed a berth in the Super League with a 116-run victory over Hong Kong, got another wicket soon when Shoaib Malik was run out. Hameed and Inzamam-ul Haq then combined to add 109 runs for the third wicket. The skipper was the dominant partner and hit a 66-ball 58 which included four fours and two sixes. Hameed, dropped by Ashraful at long-off off Khaled Mahmud when on 61, struck ten boundaries. He drove well and was not afraid to lift the ball, while Inzamam displayed a wide range of shots on both sides. Inzamam stepped out to left-arm spinner Razzaq and was stumped by Khaled Mashud while Hameed holed out to Mushfiqur Rahman at deep mid-wicket off Mahmud. The remaining batsmen failed to accelerate in the closing overs and it was up to vice-captain Yusuf Youhana to ensure the defending champions went past 250.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bowlers failed, admits Ponting
 - Tri-series - Brett Lee to get new ball; Haddin to replace Gilchrist in Adelaide,  Melbourne  Ponting wants his  players to keep their noses in front  Gilchrist will be  rested after Thursdays matchSydney: Australian captain Ricky Ponting conceded on Wednesday that his bowlers have failed to execute their plans against the in-form Indian batsmen but said his world champion team was not too far away from taking early wickets and putting the opposition under pressure. We probably have not bowled as well as we could and our execution with some of our plans with some of their players has not been good, Ponting said on the eve of Thursdays tri-series encounter against India. I dont think its going to be too far away before you see us take a few early wickets and put them under pressure. So far right through the summer that has not happened, he said. The Australian captain said Simon Katich will replace Matthew Hayden to open the innings with Adam Gilchrist on Thursday. Katich will open the innings. Its a direct swap with Haydos (Matthew Hayden). Hes been in great nick for a long time. Its a great opportunity for him. Brad Hogg was out of the twelve, he said. Ponting asked his players to keep their noses in front against India tomorrow. Its been a good, even contest right through the summer in Test and one-day cricket and wed just like to get our noses back in front before the finals come around, Ponting said after his side had a strenuous training session at the Sydney cricket ground. India raked up a 300-plus total against Australia at the Gabba on Sunday, which set up their 19-run win over the world champions. India now have 17 points from four games, having won their last three games. Australia have 18 points from as many games with a similar win-loss record. The Australian skipper admitted that Indian batting has given them no chance whatsoever in the current summer and it has been hard work for his bowlers. The stand-out thing, the difference so far is just how well they have batted. They havent given us a chance, really. Australias misery has been mirrored in the form of fast bowler Brett Lee who was taken to the cleaners by the Indian batsmen. But Ponting declared that Lee would play on Thursday. He (Lee) was disappointed with the way he bowled in Brisbane. But hell take the new ball tomorrow. I just think it is his length more than anything else. He was either bowling too full or too short. He wasnt really hitting that in-between length, Ponting said. May be hes trying to bowl too quick. I have spoken to him and every time I have mentioned something to him, he has responded really well. So I am sure you will see that happen again. Ponting asked one of his openers to stay till the end and make a big score in every game and the other batsmen to bat around him. We need someone in the top order going on to make a big score in every game and have the other guys bat around them, he said. We know we have to do it against India. If you get on top against them, you can score heavily but if you let them get on top, they are a hard side to beat, Ponting said. The Australian skipper wanted his side to hit form before next months best-of-three finals and play better cricket than they have done so far this summer. We want to play better than that. Weve got the next three or four games leading into the finals to make sure we are hitting our straps and playing some good cricket when those finals come around. Ponting said he was disappointed at the defeat at Gabba but said his side was keen to redress the issue tomorrow. We are a little disappointed with the way we played in Brisbane. We addressed that yesterday, having a training session which was the best Id say for 12 months. We have been presented with a huge challenge. We were not good enough to win that last Test. The challenge is right there in front of us, he said. Looking back over the last couple of years, whenever this side has been challenged, it generally has managed to find that little bit extra, the Australian captain said. Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist has been rested for two matches after Thursdays day-night game at the SCG against India in which he will open with Simon Katich. Brad Haddin will replace Gilchrist for the matches versus Zimbabwe on January 26 and 29 in Adelaide and Melbourne, respectively. Gilchrist will join the squad in the lead-up to Australias match against India in Perth on February 1, a statement from Cricket Australia said on Wednesday. Haddin (26) has made just one appearance for Australia at the ODI level, replacing Gilchrist for the Carlton series match against Zimbabwe in Hobart in January 2001. He had also toured with the Australian Test side to India in that year, playing a first-class match against the Board Presidents XI in Delhi, again as a replacement for Gilchrist, who had then suffered a hip injury. As selectors we believe this break will benefit Adam as he sets himself for the rest of the series and the challenging period that lies ahead, Trevor Hohns, Australian national selection panel chairman, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA bow to Zoysa
 Zoysa took 5 wkts Colombo: Sri Lanka left-arm fast bowler Nuwan Zoysa ripped through South Africas top-order to pave the way for a 37-run victory in the second one-day International on Sunday. Zoysa finished with career-best figures of five for 26 as South Africa were bowled out for 176 in 48.5 overs in reply to Sri Lankas modest 213 for nine. Part-time off-spinner Tillakaratne Dilshan wrapped up the South Africa innings with a return of four for 52 as Sri Lanka went 2-0 up in the five-match series. The tourists had slumped to 94 for seven in the 33rd over before former captain Shaun Pollock, with 54, and allrounder Lance Klusener, with 40, gave the total a measure of respectability. Kumar Sangakkara anchored the Sri Lanka innings with 63, while Upul Chandana, the victim of a road-rage attack the previous day, made a patient 61 not out. The pair put on a record 93 for the sixth wicket against South Africa, rescuing the home team after they had slumped to 86 for five in the 25th over after winning the toss. Zoysa broke through in his third over, uprooting Herschelle Gibbs off-stump as the opener tried to pull a good-length delivery. Nicky Boje, promoted up the order as a pinch-hitter, smashed a couple of straight boundaries off Zoysa before he triggered a collapse, looping a catch to backward point for 14. From 35 for one, South Africa slumped to 40 for five as Graeme Smith (14) played on, allrounder Jacques Kallis was adjudged leg-before.  (Reuters)  Copyright

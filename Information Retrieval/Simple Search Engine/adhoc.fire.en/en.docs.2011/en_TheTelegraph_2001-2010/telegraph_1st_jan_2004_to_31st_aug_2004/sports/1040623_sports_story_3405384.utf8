 Ronaldo eager to unsettle England 
 Cristiano Ronaldo during a press conference in Lisbon on Tuesday. (AFP) Alcochete: One year ago, English clubs were involved in a scramble to sign teenage Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo. On Thursday, England defenders could find themselves chasing the shadow of a player who seems to take pleasure in tormenting his markers. Ronaldos trickery has given an extra dimension to the Euro 2004 hosts as they attempt to win their first major tournament. Even if his jinking runs sometimes end in over-hit crosses or one wiggle of the hips too many, his sheer unpredictability brings the Portuguese crowd to life and unsettles the opposition every time he gets the ball. Thursdays quarter final against England will give Ronaldo another showdown against Arsenal fullback Ashley Cole, who he has already faced at club level, and a first confrontation with Manchester United teammate Gary Neville. Cole is a good defender, very strong, it will be an interesting duel, Ronaldo said on Tuesday. I hope I can win but the most important for me is the team. Scolari still sees Ronaldo mainly as a substitute and he began the first two European Championship matches against Greece and Russia on the bench, coming on during the second half on each occasion. He made an impact each time, scoring an injury-time consolation goal in the 1-2 defeat by Greece and providing the cross for Rui Costa to score Portugals second in the 2-0 win over Russia. He was rewarded with a start against Spain on Sunday, when an historic 1-0 win sealed the hosts quarter-final place. Ronaldo admitted on Tuesday that the step up to international football had been a big one. It was difficult at first but I got a lot of help, he said. Its a lot faster but I think Im adapting well with the help of the older players such as Luis Figo and Rui Costa, who are reference points for me because they are people I respect. But he is not worried about whether he starts on the bench or the pitch against England. The main objective is to win, he said. Whether I score, or dont score, play or dont play  it doesnt matter. I have to have respect for Simao (Sabrosa) and Figo.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

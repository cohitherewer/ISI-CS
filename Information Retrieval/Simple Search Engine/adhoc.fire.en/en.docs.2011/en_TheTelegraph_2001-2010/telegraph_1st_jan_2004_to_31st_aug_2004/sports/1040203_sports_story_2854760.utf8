				 																																	Hamburg: Australian Open champion Roger Federer and Juan Carlos Ferrero have agreed to play in the Hamburg Masters Series in May, tournament officials said on Monday.				 																																	Hamburg chairman Boris Becker and director Walter Knapper said the world No 1 and 2 had signed up for the May 10-16 tournament, which was saved from financial collapse last year by Becker and his Switzerland-based marketing agency BCI.				 																																	Federer won on the clay in Hamburg two years ago while Ferrero, the French Open champion, lost in the final three years ago to Spanish compatriot Albert Portas.				 																																	Becker said Federer, 22, had promised late last year at a meeting in Switzerland to take part in the 2.4 million euro tournament. He is the most complete player on the tour and has now managed to turn his great talent into success, Becker said. 				 																																	Madrid: Manchester United players trying to cope with the pressure of the bitter scrap between coach Alex Ferguson and the clubs majority shareholders received some advice from a former teammate.				 																																	United old boy David Beckham, tackled about the crisis enveloping his former team after Real Madrids win over Valladolid, said on Sunday: There are always things going on at Manchester United  front page and back page.				 																																	The England skipper said that as long as his former colleagues carry on with the football they would not lose their way as they joust for the Premiership title with Arsenal and Chelsea. 				 																																	Berlin: Germany international Sebastian Deisler returned to training with Bayern Munich on Monday following two months of treatment for depression. I feel very good, Deisler said after his first training session since going into hospital in late November. Its been a long time. Ive gained a few too many kilos.				 																																	The 24-year-old, one of Germanys most gifted players, was released from a psychiatric institute in Munich on January 26, a week after his partner gave birth to a baby boy named Raphael.				 																																	Colchester (England): Former England fast bowler Darren Gough, who ended his 15-year career at Yorkshire last month, joined Essex for the 2004 County season.				 																																	Gough, 33, picked Essex over Warwickshire.				 																																	Gough quit Yorkshire in January, saying he wanted to be closer to his children in south England.				 																																	Goughs move to Essex means he will team up with former England captain Nasser Hussain.				 																																	Pyrgos (Greece): The Greek first division match between Paniliakos Pyrgos and Olympiakos was nearly called off on Sunday after it was discovered the pitch was filled with nails.				 																																	Someone broke into the Pyrgos National Stadium during the night and spread 10 kgs of nails throughout the pitch.				 																																	Stadium crews worked all day to collect the nails and the match was eventually held with league front runner Olympiakos winning 3-1. As if the nails were not enough, fighting broke out between rival fans before the match with riot police called in to bring order. 				 																																	Madrid: Real Zaragoza have signed former Barcelona and Spanish international striker Dani, the club announced on Monday.				 																																	Dani rescinded his contract with Barcelona last week, after hardly figuring in the first team for three-and-a-half years.

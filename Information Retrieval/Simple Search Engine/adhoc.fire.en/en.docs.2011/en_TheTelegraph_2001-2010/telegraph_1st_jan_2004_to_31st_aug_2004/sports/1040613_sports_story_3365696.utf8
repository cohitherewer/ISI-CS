It is now back to fitness training  beep test, cardiovascular, core stability, speed endurance tests and more. And it is going to be a real sweating out for them, as physical trainer Gregory Allen King, in charge of the camp, will say. Wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel has already arrived here for the camp in the lead up to Asia Cup in Sri Lanka next month and other engagements including ICC Champions Trophy and home series against Australia and South Africa.

 Vijai Singh pips Daly to title
Grand Blanc (Michigan): Vijai Singh fired a closing five-under-par 67 to rally past John Daly to win the $4.5 million Buick Open on Sunday. The Fijian finished 23-under on 265, one stroke ahead of Daly (66). World No. 1 Tiger Woods (66) and Paraguays Carlos Franco (66) tied for third place on 267 while Stewart Cink was fifth on 270 at the Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club. Singh, 41, who had won the Buick Open in 1997, became only the third multiple winner of the event, joining Julius Boros (1963 and 1967) and Tony Lema (1964-65). The victory was also his fourth on the PGA Tour this season. Those guys are legendary, Singh said. If thats a club, Im really happy to be in that club. Singh had to work hard to gain entry. His two-stroke, third-round lead was erased after Daly birdied the first hole and then holed a nine-iron approach for an eagle at the par-four second. American Daly, 38, also birdied the third to nudge one shot in front of Singh. (Singh) said he was going to kick my ass this morning on the range, Daly said. And then after I holed out on two, he says, Oh, I take it back. We had a lot of laughs, it was a great match today. The tall Fijian refused to panic after Dalys early blitz. I knew there were a lot of holes out there that you could catch up to make a move, Singh said. I was just playing my game and I was patient. I was trying to hit good shots and rolling the putter really nicely, that was good. I wasnt too worried out there. Singh moved back alongside Daly with a birdie at the 12th and regained the outright lead with another birdie at the 14th. Both players picked up strokes at the 16th before Singh carded a bogey on 18 while Daly missed a five-footer for par to tie. Trying to put pressure on Vijai is very difficult on its own, but I did it, Daly said. Woods, still without a strokeplay title to his name this year, posted four rounds in the 60s and did not make a bogey over the final 39 holes. He continues to be positive as he prepares for the US PGA Championship in two weeks time. To play that well and not win is obviously frustrating but things are coming together and thats a positive going into a Major, said Woods.  (Reuters)  Copyright

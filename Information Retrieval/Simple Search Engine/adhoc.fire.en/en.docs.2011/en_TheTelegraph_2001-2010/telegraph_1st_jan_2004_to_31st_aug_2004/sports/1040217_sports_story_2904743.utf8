The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ to target Pollock
 Graeme Smith is down with a flu Christchurch: New Zealand plan to mount a full scale assault on South African bowler Shaun Pollock in Tuesdays second ODI. South Africa won the first of six matches on Friday and remain heavy favourites to take a 2-0 lead. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said their batting would revolve around trying to upset the oppositions best bowler. Pollock has slowed his pace, he uses line and length, and on a good wicket if we can break him up, then we go quite a long way to breaking up their patterns, Fleming said of the former Proteas skipper who is five short of becoming the first South African to take 300 ODIwickets. If we can interrupt Graeme Smiths routine with his bowlers, well have a better chance of beating them. Gaining some dominance in the top order will represent a turnaround from the series-opener when the Black Caps were always battling after being 79 for four. There are still question marks over the recent form of newcomer Michael Papps and Hamish Marshall but they will enjoy the change to a better, faster Jade Stadium pitch where they can deflect the ball. A bonus came New Zealands way when the in-form South Africa captain left training early to visit a doctor after picking up the flu in recent days. Coach Eric Simons, though, was not overly concerned. Hes a bit bunged up in his throat and chest. Hes been on antibiotics but hell be all right, Simons said. He batted well in the nets and Im sure hell be fine. Well check him in the morning. Simons said New Zealand played much as his team had expected in Auckland where South Africa reached their 226-run target with two balls remaining. They (New Zealand) are a side that doesnt panic. They play clever cricket and they know how to go about their jobs, said Simons.

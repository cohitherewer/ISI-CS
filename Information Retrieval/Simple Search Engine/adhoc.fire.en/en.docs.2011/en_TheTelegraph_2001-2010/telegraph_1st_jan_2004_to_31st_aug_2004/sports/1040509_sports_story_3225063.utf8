The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pole for Schumi 
Barcelona, May 8 (Reuters): Ferraris Michael Schumacher will start Sundays Spanish Grand Prix from pole position, 59th of his career. He will be favourite to win the race for the sixth time but he has the Williams of Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya alongside. Schumacher is chasing his fifth win in five races, a run of success that would match that of Briton Nigel Mansell in 1992.  Copyright

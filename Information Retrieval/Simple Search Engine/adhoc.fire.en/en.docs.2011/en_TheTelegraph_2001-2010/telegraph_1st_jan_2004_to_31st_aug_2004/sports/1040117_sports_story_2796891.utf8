 Thipsay beats Chanda
Mumbai: GM Praveen Thipsay defeated compatriot GM Sandipan Chanda of Calcutta to remain in joint lead after the seventh round in the Commonwealth chess championship here Friday. Thipsay (6) now shares the lead with top seed GM Nigel Short of England and third seed Pavel Smirnov of Russia. The leaders pack is a full point ahead of a pack of 16 on 5 points each. Prominent among them are Dzhumaev Marat, Tahir Vakhidov (both Uzbekistan), Sergey Iskusnyh (Russia), Niaz Murshed (Bangladesh), Pendalya Harikrishna, S. Kidambi, Lanka Ravi and 14 year-old Abhijit Gupta. Short scored his fourth successive win at the expense of Russian Alexander Fominyh who played black. Smirov gave a fine attacking lesson to Dzhumaev Marat and Gupta inched closer to his second IM norm with a hard fought draw over GM R. B. Ramesh. Also having a chance for a WGM norm is Dronavalli Harika whose impressive run continued with a draw with English GM Stuart Conquest. (PTI)  Copyright

Hussain steers team home
 - FIRST TEST

(AP) London: Former England captain Nasser Hussain stroked his 14th Test century to guide the hosts to an ultimately untroubled seven-wicket win over New Zealand in the first Test at Lords on Monday. Hussain atoned for an inexplicable error of judgement when he ran out Andrew Strauss for 83 to score an unbeaten 103 in Englands total of 282 for three, which gave them a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. He was partnered in an unbeaten fourth-wicket partnership of 139 by the teams other most experienced batsman, Graham Thorpe, who scored 51 not out, his 35th Test half-century. The victory, with eight overs to spare, was only the third by a side chasing more than 200 to win a Test at Lords. It was also Englands fourth win in five matches after their recent 3-0 victory in West Indies. There was only one sour note for the home side with the needless run out. It denied Strauss the chance to make history by becoming the first England player to score a century in each innings on Test debut. Strauss departed disconsolately when Hussain called him for an impossible single. The Middlesex opener, who was named Man of the Match, scored 112 in the first innings to become only the second Englishman to score a debut century at Lords. The pair added 108 for the third wicket after England had lost acting captain Marcus Trescothick and Mark Butcher in the morning session. Left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori, the tourists potential match-winner, bowled a series of short spells from both ends and was unlucky not to get an early wicket when Butcher appeared to glove a catch to Mark Richardson diving forward at short-leg. But what little turn he gained was slow and he was reduced to coming over the wicket in an attempt to land the ball in the bowlers footmarks. Hussain, who should earn a coveted 100th Test cap this year, battled with his usual grim determination at the start, using his feet well to Vettori to drive through the covers and sweeping to good effect. His second Test century against New Zealand and third at Lords contained 15 fours and was scored off 204 balls. Thorpe nudged the ball into the gaps and pulled strongly off the back foot, reaching his 50 with six fours. Daryl Tuffey gave New Zealand early hope after England resumed on eight for no wicket. He claimed his first wicket of the match when Trescothick pushed the first ball of his third over of the morning straight back up the pitch and the bowler lurched to his right to grab the ball with both hands. Butcher played a loose slash at the third ball of Martins opening over for Stephen Fleming to take a fine two-handed catch at first slip, and England had plenty to think about when they took lunch at 87 for two. Strauss and Hussain calmed their nerves with a century partnership off 121 deliveries before Hussain attempted the impossible single off the first ball of the 50th over from Martin. Strauss belatedly set off but never had any chance of making his ground as Chris Cairns raced in from cover and lobbed the ball to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

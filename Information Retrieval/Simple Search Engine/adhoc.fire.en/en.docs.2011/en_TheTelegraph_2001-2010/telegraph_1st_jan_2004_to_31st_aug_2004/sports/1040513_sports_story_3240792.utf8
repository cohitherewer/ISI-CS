The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Olympics could be fifth major, says Harrington
Shanghai: Irelands Padraig Harrington believes the Olympics could become the Major of all Majors if golf is introduced at the 2008 Beijing Games. World No. 8 Harrington said on Wednesday ahead of his defence of the BMW Asian Open in Shanghai that he was passionate about the royal and ancient game taking its place in the Olympics. He added his voice to growing pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to include golf for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. A decision on the issue is expected when the IOC meets in Singapore next year. Some golfers say we now have four Majors (and that is enough). But the four Majors were not the four Majors 70 years ago, he said. You never know in 50 years time maybe the Olympics will be the No. 1 Major. It has to start somewhere. Harrington said the Olympics was a big deal for people from small countries like Ireland and he would definitely compete. Only five Irish athletes have won gold medals at Olympic Games since the country became an independent nation, with swimmer Michelle Smith picking up three in Atlanta in 1996.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Lloyd takes India to task

Sydney: The Indian team has been fined for slow-over rate during the tri-series match against Australia at the SCG Thursday. Each player has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee while captain Sourav Ganguly was slapped with a 30 per cent fine, ICC Match Referee Clive Lloyd said. 
Sourav was also charged with a level two breach of the ICCs Code of Conduct as a result of which he received an additional fine of 50 per cent. 
Lloyd informed the Indian players and the team management this evening that the side finished the game three overs short of the required rate. 
Under the sanctions outlined in the ICCs Code of Conduct, each player receives a fine of five per cent of his match fee for each of the first five overs that the side is behind, while the captain receives a 10 per cent fine for each over that his team is down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India routed yet again 
Amsterdam: Germanys Bjorn Michel scored a hattrick as India crashed to their third successive defeat in the four-nation Rabobank hockey tournament on Thursday. Michels goals in a ten-minute blitz helped his side emerge 4-0 winners and secure a place in the final where they face Holland on Sunday. India would now play for the third-fourth places against Pakistan. After managing to put up a fight in the first half, during which they conceded a goal scored by Christopher Bechmann, the Indians hardly offered any resistance after the break as Michel cut loose, converting three penalty corners. This was Indias third defeat in a row following their 0-2 defeat to Holland and the 1-6 humiliation suffered against Pakistan. India rested veteran strikers Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon, who both failed to impress in the first two games. But the move failed to yield any positives as rookies Hari Prasad, Inderjit Singh and Sunil Yadav failed to trouble the German defenders. (PTI)  Copyright

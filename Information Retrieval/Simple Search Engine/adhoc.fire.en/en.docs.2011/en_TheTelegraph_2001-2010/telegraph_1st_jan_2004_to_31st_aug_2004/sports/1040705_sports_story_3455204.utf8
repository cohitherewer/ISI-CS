The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A time to reflect, a time to rebuild
 Rudi Voeller is one of six coaches to have fallen from grace Lisbon: To the winners go the spoils, to the losers the sack. Parting is sweet sorrow at a European Championship as with every other major event which comes around only once every four seasons  and this one will signal the biggest changing of the continental guard in recent memory. No fewer than six of the 16 nations who turned up to joust in the Portuguese sun over the past month have dispensed with their coach and more are likely to follow, although Portugals Brazilian mentor Luiz Felipe Scolari and Greco-German Otto Rehhagel are both sitting comfortably. French coach Jacques Santini was already on the way out before the event even started. He announced his upcoming liaison with Tottenham in the English Premiership after the French football federation wanted to await the outcome of Euro 2004 before extending his contract. That proved a smart move as the lacklustre title-holders crashed out to Greece in the quarter finals and now Santini will also feel vindicated after not having to fall on his sword, the fate of contemporaries such as Germanys Rudi Voeller, Spains Inaki Saez and Italys Giovanni Trapattoni. Joining those four in the out tray were Croatias Otto Baric and Bulgarias Plamen Markov while The Netherlands Dick Advocaat held out the strong possibility that he will also head for the exit door next week. Never before in the international game has the coaching merry-go-round spun at such a rate. Forced into a period of rebuilding, several top countries will have to effect that process from the top down, as well as the bottom up, after a swathe of retirements from the international scene by top stars who Father Time has caught up on. Dutch defenders Jaap Stam and Frank de Boer are stepping down, while Portuguese midfield star Rui Costa said Sunday he will do the same after the final. French skipper and World Cup and Euro 2000 winner Marcel Desailly also brought an end to his 116-cap career with Les Bleus, while defender Lilian Thuram is nearing the end of his career. Speculation even surrounds how long midfield star and creative hub Zinedine Zidane will continue. Pavel Nedved, a survivor of the 1996 Czech side which reached the final that year, is also on the way out, as is fellow-veteran Karel Poborsky. The Portuguese will, along with Costa, soon likely bid farewell to 34-year-old defender and erstwhile skipper Fernando Couto. Even the leader of the hosts golden generation, Luis Figo, while still young enough to make the 2006 World Cup, is unlikely to feature after that. Disappointing Italy have to inject new blood as the likes of Christian Vieri come under threat from emerging talents such as Antonio Cassano. Sweden will have a job replacing the evergreen Henrik Larsson. The tournament has been marked by the emergence of a clutch of new young stars, led by Englands Wayne Rooney and Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo. But replacing coaches and installing new infrastructures is not an overnight process and with countries such as England, Portugal and Greece increasingly turning to foreign coaches the chase is on to track down tomorrows mentors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain hints at retirement
	 - Former skipper doesnt want to deny any deserving youngster  Nasser Hussain is ecstatic after his matchwinning unbeaten century on the final day of the first Test against New Zealand at Lords on Monday. England won by seven wickets London: England batsman Nasser Hussain has hinted he may consider international retirement after guiding his side to a seven-wicket victory in the first Test against New Zealand at Lords on Monday. The 36-year-old former captain scored an unbeaten 103 in the second innings to give England the lead in the three-match series, but was quoted in Tuesdays media reports as saying he was set to make a decision about his future within the next two days. Ive got to make some decisions in my life and Ill be making them in the next 24 to 48 hours, Hussain told a newspaper. Despite needing just four more appearances to register 100 Test caps, Hussain revealed he was thinking about calling it a day because he did not want to stand in the way of younger batsmen, such as Andrew Strauss. Brought into the side as opener for injured skipper Michael Vaughan, Strauss (112 and 83) made an assured entry into Test cricket and has given the selectors a problem before the second Test starting on June 3. The last thing I want to do is hold anyone up in their career. I only want to play in a side and for a country that wants me to play, Hussain added. It was a very special day for me and Id hate to go out of the game just playing a few more games and getting by and seeing other people who have done well being left out. Im certainly not going to do that. Im just going to have to talk to some people in my life and come to a non-emotive decision about when would be a good time to call it a day. Hussain added that thoughts of retirement were not new and that he had spoken to coach Duncan Fletcher about the matter on Sunday. I want to go away and speak to my dad and my family about when would be a good time to call it a day. There are so many pluses and minuses. I dont really want to go in the middle of a series. I want to beat the New Zealanders, but I dont want to see any young lad who got 200 in the game left out for me. I dont want to pre-empt the selectors, but Im sure he wont be. I dont want to be hanging around and youve got to put in the equation what a special day this was. People have talked about me wanting to play 100 Tests, but other people have thrown that around. It was the same with the captaincy. The most important thing for me is to end on a high like I did with my captaincy so people look back and say, Yes, he was a good captain. I want to do that as a player as well and it would be a great way to finish at the home of cricket. Strauss urges Nasser to stay Strauss, meanwhile, on Tuesday urged Hussain to keep going in Test cricket.  I think it is his decision to make. Given that fairytale finish yesterday I could see why he would be tempted to bow out on such a high, Strauss told the BBC. But the England team would be worse without him. He has shown time and time again when we have needed someone to do something special he has come up and done it for us  but it is completely his decision. On Monday, Englands second innings of 282 for three was anchored by the who added 83 to his first innings 112. Seventeen more would have made him the first England player to score two centuries on debut. Instead, he fell victim to a serious misjudgement by Hussain, who called for an impossible run after tapping the ball into the covers. We went for a run and there was a bit of indecision, Strauss said. Its one of those things that happen all the time in cricket. I started running just as he stopped. I suppose it looked like I sacrificed myself but it was just one of those things. To dwell on it after such a victory would be wrong. Marcus Trescothick, deputising for the injured Vaughan as England captain, said Hussain had responded in typical fashion. Hes at his best when hes under pressure. England won their first series in the Caribbean for 36 years when they beat West Indies 3-0 this year. Mondays victory over a tough New Zealand side demonstrated the progress they have made under Hussain and Vaughan since losing to the 1999 New Zealand side. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming paid tribute to the revitalised England team. I think it was a pretty good effort from England. We would have liked to get a few more runs and create a few more opportunities.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

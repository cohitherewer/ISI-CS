The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Trescothick to lead, Vaughan out
	 - Series will give good indication of whos catching up with Australia: Fleming  Marcus Trescothick poses with the Test series trophy at Lords on Wednesday. (AFP) London: Two lefthanders will lead from the front on Thursday in the opening Test between England and New Zealand at Lords, the first significant encounter of another crowded English summer. Somerset opener Marcus Trescothick was named on Wednesday to lead the home side in a Test for the first time after captain Michael Vaughan withdrew with a knee injury sustained at practice on Monday. Middlesex opener Andrew Strauss has been called up as cover for Vaughan. At a news conference on the eve of the three-Test series, which will be followed by four Tests between England and the West Indies before concluding with the Champions Trophy one-day tournament, New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming said several countries were vying for second place in the world rankings behind Australia. I think there are some teams that are catching Australia up, Fleming said. I think this series will give a pretty good indication of where we are. Trescothick, who has led England in the one-day arena but not yet in a Test match, struggled with his form in the off-season, averaging only 27 in Sri Lanka and 23 in the West Indies. Fleming said it would be interesting to see how captaincy affects Trescothicks batting. I think that the pressure will come from within, he said. You know that Vaughan is going to come back and theres no time to stamp your authority on the team. That is difficult if you have got a different system to employ. Trescothick said the captaincy had not affected his batting in the past, whether for Somerset or in one-day cricket for England. He scored an unbeaten century against South Africa in a one-day International last year while substituting for Vaughan. New Zealand have omitted their express bowler Shane Bond to give him more time to recuperate from the stress fractures in his back which threatened to end his career prematurely. If Englands bowling looks stronger on paper, with Harmison backed up by Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones and possibly James Anderson, New Zealand have the more impressive depth in batting. Umpire Aleem Dar was ruled out Wednesday of standing in the Test with a knee injury. The Pakistani has been replaced by South Africas Rudi Koertzen.

 Human error, bad weather to blame 
Johannesburg: Human error and bad weather led to the June 2002 plane crash which killed former South African captain Hansie Cronje, a report by civil aviation authorities said Thursday. The report indicates the probable causes to be human factor related, with weather and mechanical as well as technological factors contributing, the Civil Aviation Authority report said.  The pilots did not follow the correct procedure after executing a missed approach and became lost. They flew the aircraft into a valley and crashed into the side of the mountain range, the report said. Meanwhile, according to Dr Ali Bacher, Cronje could have rehabilitated himself by working with children in deprived townships. Bacher, 61, was head of the UCB when Cronje was banned for life after admitting taking money from bookmakers.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

Dont mess with us: Parreira
- Brazil coach accuses Argentina of provocative behaviour in last six minutes  Tournament top-scorer Adriano (7 goals) of Brazil with the Copa America trophy at the Nacional Stadium in Lima Lima: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said that Argentina had paid for toying with the five-times world champions in the Copa America final. Brazil won 4-2 on penalties after Adriano equalised with the last kick of the game to force a 2-2 draw. Argentina had gone ahead through Cesar Delgado in the 87th minute and were set to celebrate their first Copa America since 1993. Parreira accused his opponents of provocative behaviour in the six minutes between Argentinas second goal and the Brazilian equaliser. Its not any team which gets a result like this, we never gave up, it was a lesson for everyone, a delighted Parreira added. Nobody messes with Brazilian football, five-times champions of the world, he said, referring to his teams unique record in the World Cup. Its a game we will never forget  nor will our opponents. There was some gamesmanship as usual and we were very happy with this young teams powers of reaction. They were winning the game, there were five minutes to go ... they were tapping the ball around, deliberately trying to get fouls. Its a technique which irritated us. Brazil won their seventh Copa America despite resting top players such as Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka and Roberto Carlos. But the replacements, including Adriano who finished as the competitions top-scorer with seven goals, proved just as good. This is an important title which will enrich our collection, Parreira said. This competition is just below the World Cup and is as important as the European championship. All these players are regulars with important teams and are internationally recognised. The only thing they hadnt done was play for the Brazilian national side. Brazil once again converted all their penalties just as they did following the 1-1 draw in the semi-final against Uruguay.  Disappointed Argentine players after their loss on SundayI told all the players not to get desperate, that they all had marvellous games, Parreira added. We had to change the order because we lost (midfielder) Alex (to injury). Their tranquillity and technical ability was amazing, he added. Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa said his side were unlucky to lose. Its clear that if the aim of todays game is to decide which of the two teams was best, the final position obtained was contradictory to what each of the teams did, Bielsa said in his inimitable style. This pre-supposes not taking anything away from the opposition. Bielsas team dominated the match but allowed their opponents to equalise with the last kick of the game. Some teams turn around the scoreline deservedly and others do it casually. One of these two happened today, Bielsa said. What should we have done to not deserve what happened today? When I was talking to the players after the game, we asked ourselves what we should have done and not have done (when it was 2-1). In the end, we convinced ourselves that there was no path to follow which we had failed to follow. (Reuters)  Copyright

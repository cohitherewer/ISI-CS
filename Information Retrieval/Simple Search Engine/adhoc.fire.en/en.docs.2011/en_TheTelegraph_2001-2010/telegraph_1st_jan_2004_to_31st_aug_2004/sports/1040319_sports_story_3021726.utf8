The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB tread cautious path versus JCT
 - Worries galore for Bhowmick as his team enters home stretch  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia and Cristiano Junior during practice on Thursday, the eve of East Bengals National League clash with JCT. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta:The general feel-good atmosphere has failed to rub off on Subhas Bhowmick. It has a lot to do with the old adage, uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. As the battle for the eighth National Football League (NFL) championship approaches the home stretch, no team is in an unassailable position. East Bengal hold a slight edge over Dempo, the Calcutta outfit having played a match less (15) though both are on 31 points. Bhowmick is well aware that any slip-up at this juncture of the 22-round marathon run will invite danger. Everybody is talking about the feel-good factor, but Im in a feel-bad situation, the coach said on Thursday. Bhowmick may have stated this in jest, but there is no denying his seriousness about the task at hand. After all, its time to maintain the slender lead intact. No wonder then that Bhowmick is only cautiously optimistic on the eve of the match against JCT, who are on 25. I know three points against JCT will help our cause. But in doing so, I dont want to lose all of these at any cost, he said. Debjit Ghosh is unavailable owing to a double-booking while the injured Shasthi Duley skipped this mornings practice. The good news is, prolific striker Cristiano Junior will be back in fray after having to sit out the Dempo match, which ended goalless. If East Bengal have anything to fear about the visitors, it has to be the one and only I.M. Vijayan. He may have quit international football, but is still a force to reckon with in the domestic circuit. Like the French wine, this striker from Kerala seems to be getting better by the day even as he approaches the twilight zone of a remarkable career. Just the other day in Margao, Vijayans matchwinner against Vasco drew praise from all quarters. Bhowmick, in his customary fashion, refused to attach too much importance to such individual brilliance. The intelligence of (JCT coach) Sukhwinder Singh is more worrying to me. Sukhwinder returned the compliment, saying East Bengal look like the real team to take home the title. They are the frontrunners and are strong favourites to win this competition. I have to take stock of this fact, the former India coach said of his opponents. Sukhwinder also brushed aside the idea of man-marking Bhaichung Bhutia or any other individual. East Bengal have many dangerous players like Bhaichung... Alvito (DCunha), (Mike) Okoro and Juniors goal-scoring ability  Ive to keep in mind all of them, he said. On the other hand, its the speed of JCT that concerns Bhwomick. Weve played three crucial matches in a week. Even a change in the kick-off time (3 pm) has hardly made a difference. Our players are thus bound to get tired today or tomorrow, he lamented. Add to this the injury concerns over DCunha and Mahesh Gawli, and its clear why Bhowmick is a worried man. The defending champions may be favourites to retain the crown, but the niggling problems in Bhowmicks camp cannot simply make him feel good. Dempo, Vasco win PTI adds: Dempo moved to 31 points from 16 matches after beating Indian Bank via a Clifford Miranda goal in Chennai, despite playing with 10 men in second half(Stanley Colaco was sent off). In Margao, Vasco beat Salgaocar 3-1 with goals from Marcos Parreira, Agnelo Colaco and Kamal Thapa. Climax Lawrence pulled one back for Salgaocar. Vasco are now on 20, Salgaocar on 18.  Copyright

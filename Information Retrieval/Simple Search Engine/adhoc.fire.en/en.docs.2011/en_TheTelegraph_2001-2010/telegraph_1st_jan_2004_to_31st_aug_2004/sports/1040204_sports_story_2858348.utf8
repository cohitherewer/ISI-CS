 Astle to undergo knee scan
 Nathan Astle Auckland: New Zealand batsman Nathan Astle, who has been troubled by persistent problems in his left knee, is to undergo scans to determine the cause of discomfort in his right knee, the New Zealand Herald reported on Tuesday. Astle, who had surgery on the patella tendon in his left knee in April, missed the mid-year tour to Sri Lanka and returned home from India in October after the second Test in an effort to get fit for the domestic international programme. Nathans knee has given him some discomfort over the past couple of days and it was decided the prudent move was to have it examined more closely, manager Lindsay Crocker said. Crocker said Astles right knee was not causing him pain and he was still practising in an effort to be available for the six-match one-day series against South Africa beginning on February 13.

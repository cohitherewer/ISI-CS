 PCB promises Shoaib fair deal
 Shoaib explains his case to Shaharyar Khan in Lahore on Wednesday. (AFP) Islamabad: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar was on Wednesday promised a fair deal by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) who also issued him a gag order, pending its verdict on whether he had faked an injury during the Rawalpindi decider against India. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan met Shoaib for 45 minutes at the PCB headquarters in Lahore, after receiving the medical inquiry commission report on the nature of injury sustained by the bowler during the Rawalpindi Test. The PCB chief also assured Shoaib that he would be given an opportunity to explain his conduct before any action is taken. The basic objective of the meeting was to give Shoaib Akhtar a complete background of the situation that led to the appointment of the medical commission as also related cricketing issues, Shaharyar said in a press release after the meeting on Wednesday. Shoaib Akhtar was assured that the PCB would be fair to him and that he would be given every opportunity to explain his conduct. Shaharyar, in turn, asked Shoaib not to address any press conference or make public statements, which the fast bowler obliged by declining to speak to the media soon after the meeting.

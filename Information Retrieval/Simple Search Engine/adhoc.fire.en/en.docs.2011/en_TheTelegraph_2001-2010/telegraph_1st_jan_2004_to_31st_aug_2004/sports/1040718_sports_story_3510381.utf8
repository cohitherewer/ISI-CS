 Marion Jones advances in 200m bid
Sacramento, July 17 (Reuters): Olympic champion Marion Jones eased through the quarter finals of the womens 200 metres after Shawn Crawford ran the fastest mens 200 of the year at the US Olympic trials on Friday. Jones qualified 10th of 18 advancers in a pedestrian 22.93 seconds as she began her bid to return to the Olympic Games in Athens next month in one of the three events she won in Sydney four years ago. Crawford, already the fastest man in the world this season in the 100m, added that honour in the 200 with a stunning first-round performance of 19.88 seconds. Jones looked strong around the curve in her 200 metres race. Then she began to slow and dropped her pace dramatically in the last 60 metres. Torri Edwards, who has tested positive for a stimulant and faces a two-year ban that would keep her out of the Olympics, had the fastest time of the women, 22.60 seconds. Olympic trials 100mwinner LaTasha Colander pulled out of the 200, as did Olympic relay medallist Chryste Gaines, who has been charged with a doping offence by the USADA. Colanders coach Trevor Graham said that his star sprinter quit on me. She faked an injury at the warm-up track because she did not want to get on the track, he said.  Copyright

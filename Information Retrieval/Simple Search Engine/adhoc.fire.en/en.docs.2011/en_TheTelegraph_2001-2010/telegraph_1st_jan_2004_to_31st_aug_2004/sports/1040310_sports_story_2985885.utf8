The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Discussion to resume after Pakistan tour
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid on the final day of the camp at the Eden on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: The plan of having a bowling coach for the Indian team has been shelved for the moment. Captain Sourav Ganguly has said the issue will be discussed after the Pakistan series. As of now, we are going to Pakistan without a bowling coach, so there is no point in talking about it now. We will discuss this with Board once we return from Pakistan, Sourav said on Tuesday. Bruce Reids appointment as bowling coach for the tour of Australia had produced good results and there was a chance of employing somebody else for the trip to Pakistan. Sourav is somewhat concerned about his bowling options in the absence of Ajit Agarkar, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. Murali Kartik and newcomer Ramesh Powar are the spinners in the squad. It will be a challenge for me, how I handle Kartik and Powar. But in the past we have seen newcomers doing well and I hope these guys will also be successful. Sourav felt the absence of the leading Indian spinners has caused a shift in focus as far as the build-up to the series is concerned. Thats what has raised this issue and we are talking mainly about Shoaib, Sami and Zaheer. The Indian captain informed that as of now, he is looking at himself, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag as the options for the slots of openers in the ODIs. Its between the three of us. Whoever is in better form will get the chance.  Copyright

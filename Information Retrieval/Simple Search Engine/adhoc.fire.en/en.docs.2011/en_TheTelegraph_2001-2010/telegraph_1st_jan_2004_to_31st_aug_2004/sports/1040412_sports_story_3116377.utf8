 Mahindra beat Salgaocar 2-1 
Margao: Mahindra United staged a superb comeback to score a 2-1 win over Salgaocar in an NFL match on Sunday. Salgaocar, who are hovering around the relegation zone, took the lead when Tomba Singhs 40 yard-strike left the Mahindra custodian stranded. A momentary lapse by the Salgaocar defence allowed Raphael Patron Akakpo equalise. Abhishek Yadav got the winner. Mahindra are in third place with 30 points from 17 matches while Salgaocar remain ninth with 18 points.  (PTI)  Copyright

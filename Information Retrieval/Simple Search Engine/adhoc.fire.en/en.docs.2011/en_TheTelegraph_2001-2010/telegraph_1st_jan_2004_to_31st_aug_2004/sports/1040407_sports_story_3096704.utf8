The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC no to Pakistan suggestion
	 - CODE OF CONDUCT FOR FORMER PLAYERS Nairobi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has rejected a call from Pakistan for a Code of Conduct to prevent former cricketers from making unsubstantiated match-fixing claims. [That the Pakistan Cricket Board is thinking of approaching the ICC on this was reported by The Telegraph on Tuesday.] We are asking people making such allegations to follow the laid down process and provide as much evidence as possible but the ICC wont set up a code of conduct, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed told reporters in Nairobi on Tuesday. Speed, accompanying ICC president Ehsan Mani on a tour of Kenya, said players and other commentators with evidence could use a 24-hour ICC hotline to provide evidence. He said making such allegations in public did not help the sport, adding: Put your allegations up or stop making them. The PCB said on Monday it would send a letter to the ICC with its request. It came after former captain Rashid Latif suggested Pakistan could have thrown their fourth one-dayer against India last month. The PCB is considering taking disciplinary action against Latif. I am aware that Latif made some public comments. He has written to us and he has been interviewed (by the ICCs anti-corruption and security unit) three times, said Speed. But what we are telling players and other media commentators making allegations that are not substantiated is to put them up through the laid down process so that they are dealt with expeditiously. Latif request Latif on Tuesday urged the PCB to give him a chance to present his case in camera to explain match-fixing allegations made by him, adds PTI from Lahore. The PCB is coming up with statements to take action against me on match-fixing allegations but they should listen to my point of view before taking any decision, he said in a statement issued here. The former wicketkeeper batsman said the PCB must view the videotape of his interview on a TV channel on the basis of which a false impression has been created that he openly alleged that the match was fixed. I have my own opinion based on my standing in the game and being a former Pakistan captain, the PCB must give some consideration and importance to what I actually stated in that interview, he said.

 Bagan, JCT in goalless tie 
 - Green-and-maroon brigades battle for relegation still hangs in balance  Bhattacharya has a steep mountain to climb now Ludhiana: Mohun Bagans battle for relegation still hangs in the balance when the three-time champions played out a goalless draw with JCT in their Round 20 clash of the National Football League here on Thursday. The sharing of points means Mohun Bagan are now on 20 points as against JCTs 31. Mohun Bagan will next take on Churchill Brothers back home on Monday, and then travel to Chennai to face Indian Bank in their final-round match. The Mohun Bagans newly-inducted technical director Subrata Bhattacharya, thus, has a steep mountain to climb as his team struggles to stay in the elite league. While East Bengal have already clinched the league, any one of Calcuttas other teams  Mohun Bagan, Tollygunge Agragami (19 points) and Mohammedan Sporting (18)  are now certain to join Indian Bank in the relegation. Bhattacharya spelt out his survival agenda  six points from four matches  soon after taking charge of the beleaguered team. Since then, his team lost to East Bengal 1-2 before Thursdays draw with JCT. Bhattacharyas strategy against Sukhwinder Singhs side was clear and heavily influenced by the need of the hour. He put Ashim Biswas and Eduardo upfront while the main emphasis was on the fortification of his own area. Sometimes, six to seven men fell back to defend against the JCT attackers, who didnt have much sting in them without the presence of I.M. Vijayan. On the other hand, in the absence of captain Rennedy Singh, who was red-carded against East Bengal, the green-and-maroon brigade hardly found a shepherd in the midfield to make inroads into the rival area. However, Eduardo and Palash Karmakar took a couple of shots which missed the target closely. While in the second half, Mohun Bagan survived a close call when the woodwork came in the way of a Jaswinder Singh attempt. Meanwhile, the Mumbai District Football Association (MDFA) has sought a two-year ban on Haywards Sporting Club, whose supporters allegedly assaulted a fourth referee after the Goan team suffered a defeat on April 25.

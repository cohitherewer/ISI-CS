Late-strike win in the Maldives

 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung drew first blood Okoro clinched the issueCalcutta: East Bengals winning run against foreign opponents and in the AFC Cup continues. In Wednesdays away group league clash with Islands FC of the Maldives  their third match in the AFC Cup  the India champions won 2-1. It was East Bengals third win in as many matches in group E, which puts them in a strong position to qualify for the next phase as group-toppers. It was also their seventh straight win over foreign clubs, the run starting in the ASEAN Cup in Indonesia last year. It wasnt easy going for Subhas Bhowmicks team against the Maldivian league leaders who neutralised Bhaichung Bhutias 36th-minute strike deep in the second half. Mike Okoro hit the late winner in the dying moments of the match. According to information received here, East Bengal dominated the first half during which they missed quite a few chances. Islands FC, boasting eight players from the national team which held South Korea in a recent World Cup qualifier, played well in the second half. Bhowmicks comments after the match suggested it wasnt a flawless performance from his boys, missing regulars like Cristiano Junior, Dipak Mondal and Subhas Chakraborty. Sometimes they were good and sometimes they were bad. Also, we missed many chances. There are areas of concern, which I wouldnt like to discuss at this moment, Bhowmick told The Telegraph over phone after the match. The coach claimed he was expecting a tougher fight. I had always maintained that this team would make us work hard. They did so and thats why I think my prediction has come true. In fact, I was prepared for a tougher challenge. It was also learnt that East Bengal found it difficult to cope with the sandy turf. They could not train at the main venue since another Maldivian club had a match against a Hong Kong outfit there on Tuesday. East Bengal started with Bhutia and Okoro up front and fielded striker Bijen Singh in the midfield. He had to be replaced with Alvito DCunha in the first half itself. The home team, playing in front of a near-capacity crowd of around 15,000, seemed to run out of steam when Bhutia struck. The India captain did the needful by heading in Douglas da Dilvas centre from the left. Douglas received a yellow card later, but that doesnt put him in any kind of problem. Douglas and Okoro both missed simple chances in the second half and a Bhutia effort hit the woodwork in that phase, but more importantly, Islands FC got the equaliser. Goalkeeper Sandip Nandys charge on a rival attacker was deemed illegal by the referee and the resultant penalty was converted. But East Bengal were not to be stopped. Following a pass from Chandan Das, who replaced Dipankar Roy in the second half, Bhutias cross from the right was cleverly volleyed home by Okoro.  Copyright

 Injury-hit Dempo face Churchill
			Margao: Their early lead is not looking secure any longer, and though they are still the lone team on top, a setback against Churchill Brothers on Friday will put Dempo on a par with East Bengal. The Goan teams face each other in the final match of the first phase of the National Football League. After Fridays fixture, all teams will complete 11 matches. Dempo have 21 points and Churchill 17. Dempo will miss a number of regular players. Striker Sunday Seah, defenders Stanley Colaco and Melvin Rodrigues are out with injuries and their bench strength will be tested against a Churchill side desperate to win. Alex Ambrose will replace Seah and will lead the attack with R.C. Prakash. Mohammed Gafari, Nacimento Silveira, Raju Singh and Sameer Naik will man the midfield. But Dempos defence will face a test against Churchills strike force of Yusif Yakubu and John Kingsley. (PTI)  Copyright

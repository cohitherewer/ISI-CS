 India should play 2 spinners, feels Azhar
New Delhi: Former skipper Mohammed Azharuddin feels that the absence of skipper Sourav Ganguly in the first Test against Pakistan will not affect the morale of the Indian team which should look up to Rahul Dravid for inspiration. Rahul is a different type of captain. He has different ways of leading the team. Players should follow him, Azhar told reporters here. Azhar feels that India could win the Test series in Pakistan by picking the right combination. India have a good chance (of winning the series). But they need to pick the right combination. We should play two spinners as the wickets in Pakistan are very dry, said Azhar. The former captain also said that the bowlers, after a good work in the one-dayers, should be patient during the Test series. The young fast bowlers have a long way to go. I would say that in the Test matches they should be patient. Azhar was all praise for statemate V. V. S. Laxman, who scored a fine century to shape Indias win in the series-deciding fifth and final one-dayer in Lahore on Wednesday. (PTI)  Copyright

 Sasi begins with win 
 Sasikiran worked out his plans in style Moscow: Grandmaster K. Sasikiran started his campaign with a hard earned victory over GM Vladimir Kosyrov of Russia in the first round of the international open chess tournament that got underway here on Wednesday. The players are fighting for high stakes with a total prize pool of $ 15,00,000 for groups A, B and C. In other group A matches, Sandipan Chanda held higher-rated GM Levon Aronian of Germany to a draw while Praveen Thipsay too shared a point with GM Mikhail Ulibin of Russia. Neelotpal Das, too, drew with Russian Alexander Areshchenko. International Master Lanka Ravi, however, went down to GM Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine. Sasikiran gave an emphatic display of his positional prowess against Kosyrov who played black. The opening was a Queens Gambit declined where the Indian obtained a little advantage in one of the popular variations. Sasikiran worked out his plan in style with thematic manoeuvres to exert pressure on the king side. In group B, second seed Tejas Bakre who completed his third and final GM norm in the just-concluded Masters tournament in Gibraltar, made most of a rather reckless play by Ilusha Tsigelnitskiy of Russia to win quite easily with black pieces. IM Dinesh Kumar Sharma had little trouble in defeating Turkan Mamedjarova of Azerbaijan. But IM P. Konguvel and IM S. Kidambi suffered losses at the hands of Spyridon Ilandzis of Greece and Umut Atakisi of Turkmenistan, respectively.  (PTI)  Copyright

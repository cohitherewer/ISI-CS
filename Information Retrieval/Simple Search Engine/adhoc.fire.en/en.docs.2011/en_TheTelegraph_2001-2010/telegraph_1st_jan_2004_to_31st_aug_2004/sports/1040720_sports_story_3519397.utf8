 Zidane admits Vieiras Real link
 Zinedine Zidane Zinedine Zidane has admitted that he has been consulted on the possibility of his France teammate Patrick Vieira leaving Arsenal to join Real Madrid. Speculation in Spain and England is rife that Zidane has told Florentino Perez, Reals president, that the club needs Vieira to bolster its midfield and give a much-needed defensive element. But Zidane has played down his influence at Real Madrid, even though he confirmed Perez had asked his opinion on Arsenal captain Vieira. I cannot confirm all the things that were written in the press, Zidane told his website, www.zidane.fr. Saying who should be coming to the club is not my role. I spoke with the president because he asked me for information on Patrick. But he is the boss and he will decide whether or not the deal must be done or not. I just said to him, like everybody else, that Vieira is one of the best at this position. But it is not me who makes the decisions on the team. Meanwhile, Vieiras manager, Arsene Wenger, is planning to add two more players to his squad following the arrivals of striker Robin van Persie and goalkeeper Manuel Almunia. Wenger has made getting cover for central defenders Sol Campbell and Kolo Toure a priority, but he has refused to name his transfer targets. There is still a possibility someone will come in soon. One or a maximum of two. I dont know the position yet, he told Arsenals website. But there is a big possibility that one player will join us before the season starts. On Saturday, Wenger said he had urged Patrick Vieira to commit himself to the club and insisted no firm offer had been made from Real Madrid for the Gunners fearless captain. Reacting for the first time to intense speculation linking the French midfielder to a move to Spain after eight years at Highbury, Wenger said he had held secret talks with Vieira and was hopeful he would agree to stay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Madugalles vote for cricket
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Karachi: Let cricket be the winner, was (Chief) Match Referee Ranjan Madugalles advisory to the team managements of India and Pakistan during the customary pre-series briefing, held on Friday evening. Incidentally, the former Sri Lankan captain was the International Cricket Councils m-an on the spot during Indias last tour of Pakistan as well, for three ODIs in September-October 1997. Madugalle himself wasnt available for comment, but The Telegraphs sources revealed he made two points besides the one about ensuring that cricket is the winner. First that theres more than just cricket to the five ODIs and three Tests and, second, that every action is going to be watched live by millions worldwide. In other words, everybodys conduct should be exemplary. Apparently, the very positive response of both team managements pleased Madugalle.  Copyright

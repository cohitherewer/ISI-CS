 Eriksson adds fuel to friendly fire
 - England head coach on collision course with Blatter  BY HENRY WINTER Sven-Goran Eriksson, Englands head coach, put himself on a collision course on Friday with Fifa president Sepp Blatter by agreeing with Portugal coach Felipe Scolari that they could use up to 11 substitutes each in Wednesdays friendly in Faro. Blatter has been campaigning for only five replacements in friendlies. Erikssons desire to use all but the third goalkeeper of his 23-man squad will add tension to next months Fifa International Board meeting in London to discuss new rules. Ever since last years subs-fest of a friendly with Australia, Eriksson has been criticised for cheapening caps. Yet the head coachs policy is rooted in his desire to test younger players  as happened so constructively with Darius Vassell in Amsterdam before the 2002 World Cup. Eriksson must also appease club managers concerned about exhausting their precious playing assets at a sensitive stage of the season. Next weeks friendly comes three days before Chelsea-Arsenal, and with Champions League ties looming. Before the usual second-half charge of the understudies, Eriksson is expected to start with his main men: David James; Glen Johnson (or Danny Mills), John Terry, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole; David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, Frank Lampard; Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney, injuries permitting. James remains No. 1 but Nigel Martyn, Evertons in-form goalkeeper, is expected to make the squad, putting pressure on James and Paul Robinson. At right-back, Chelseas Johnson vies with Mills as cover for the injured Gary Neville. As for the other defenders, Matthew Upson and Wayne Bridge should also make Faro while Eriksson mulls over the strengths of Wes Brown, Anthony Gardner and Gareth Southgate. Lampard should start in midfield as Steven Gerrard has asked to be omitted because his girlfriend is expecting their first child. Midfield should also be drawn from Owen Hargreaves, Kieron Dyer, Joe Cole and Phil Neville. Chelseas Scott Parker is a genuine and deserved contender to cover for Gerrard while Celtics Alan Thompson will be watched by Englands scouts this weekend. Attack should see Owen and Rooney joined by Vassell and Emile Heskey. With such talent, Eriksson could be forgiven his remark that we will meet France in the final of Euro 2004. No doubt.

 Ntini, Nel force WI to follow on
 Makhaya Ntini and Graeme Smith celebrate the dismissal of Ramnaresh Sarwan in Centurion on Sunday Centurion: Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, with assistance from newly-wed Andre Nel, claimed his third five-wicket haul of the series as South Africa took a major step towards victory on the third day of the fourth and final Test against the West Indies at Centurion Park on Sunday. Ntini took five for 49 and Nel three for 64 as the West Indies were shot out for 301. Ntini then bowled Daren Ganga and took his series total to 27, a South African record for a four-Test series  and forced Chris Gayle to retire hurt at the start of the West Indian second innings. Nel dismissed West Indian captain Brian Lara for the second time in the day. The Windies were reeling at 44 for two in their second innings at close of play, needing another 259 runs to make South Africa bat again. South Africa lead the series 2-0. Gayle received a heavy blow on his abdominal protector when he missed an attempted leg-side shot against Ntini. After lengthy treatment on the pitch he resumed batting only to call for more treatment in the next over from Shaun Pollock before leaving the field with his score on 14 and the total on 18. In the following over, Ntini produced a vicious off-cutter to uproot Gangas off stump as the batsman went back in his crease to play a defensive stroke. Nel replaced Ntini and for the second time claimed the prize wicket of Lara in the first over of a new spell when the West Indian star went across his stumps and failed to play a shot against a ball which cut back at him. Ntini had the West Indies in early trouble in the first innings when he had Ganga caught at second slip and bowled Ramnaresh Sarwan to become the fifth South African to take 150 Test wickets.

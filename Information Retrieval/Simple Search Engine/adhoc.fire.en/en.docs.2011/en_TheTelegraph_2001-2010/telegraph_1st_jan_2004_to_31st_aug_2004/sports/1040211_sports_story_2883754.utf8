 Laxman ready to take on Shoaib amp; Co. 
 Sachin Tendulkar on arrival at the Hyderabad airport on Tuesday. (Reuters) Hyderabad: With a highly successful series in Australia under his belt, stylish middle-order batsman V.V.S. Laxman is now ready to take on Shoaib Akhtar amp; Co. during the upcoming cricket tour of Pakistan. It is a season I am looking forward to. It will be highly challenging, Laxman said on Tuesday on his return from Australia where he cracked five centuries. I am not afraid of Shoaib Akhtar and I will play my natural game. Terming the tour Down Under as a very satisfying despite the disappointments, he said almost every player had contributed to the teams success. It was not my batting alone but there was good contribution from other players as well which is very satisfactory. We fumbled in the tri-series finals and it was disappointing. But we lost to a better team and always have a chance to improve, said the player who will tie the knot with software professional Shailaja on Sunday. Laxman, who scored two centuries in the Test series and three in the tri-series, rated his centuries in the Adelaide Test and the one-dayer against Zimbabwe as memorable since India had won on both occasions. The right-handed batsman owed his good show in Australia to the effort he spent in improving his technique after he was dropped from Indias World Cup squad. I had a good run this season but it stemmed from my hard work after I was dropped from the World Cup squad. I worked hard with the coaches and computer analyst and improved certain grey areas. I think this really paid off during the (Australian) series, the 29-year-old said. On his perfect understanding with Rahul Dravid and their record-breaking partnership during the series, Laxman said: We know each other from our under-14 cricket days and have a better understanding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC defends Broad, snubs SLC
Colombo: The International Cricket Council hit back at Sri Lankas cricket board on Wednesday, saying it has received no evidence to support allegations of wrongdoing against ICC Match Referee Chris Broad during last months Test series against Australia. The allegations that have appeared in the media and attributed to Sri Lanka Cricket are serious and significant yet there is not one piece of evidence offered to support them, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said in a statement. The state-owned weekly newspaper, The Sunday Observer, reported that Sri Lanka Cricket had reported Broad to the ICC for allegedly attending a party given by the touring Australian team. It was Broad who reported Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan for a suspect bowling action on the completion of the three match Test series against Australia. There are no specifics, no places, no dates, no times  and it is disappointing that a national board would elect to make disparaging comments about an ICC match official without providing any material to support these comments, Speed said of the allegations. The issue has been discussed with Mr Broad and he is unaware of any behaviour or incident during his time in Sri Lanka that would prompt such allegations. The ICC statement quoted Broad as saying he was disappointed by the claims. It is disappointing for me that such allegations have been made without any substance to back them up, said Broad. I enjoyed the opportunity to officiate on this series in Sri Lanka and entirely reject any suggestion that I acted improperly during my time in the country, he said. Speed said that, as a matter of course, Cricket Australias views on the allegations were also sought. Cricket Australia has confirmed that Mr Broads personal and professional behaviour was entirely appropriate during the tour, said Speed. In light of the advice from Mr Broad and Cricket Australia, if Sri Lanka Cricket has a different view, it must now detail its claims and support them if they are to be taken seriously. Responding to the ICC, Sri Lankan cricket board Wednesday said that it has been quoted out of context by the newspaper. The board also said if there are any complaints to make against Broad, it will send them directly to the ICC, through the proper channels.  (AP)  Copyright

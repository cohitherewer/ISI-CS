The Telegraph - Calcutta
Woods races into quarters
- World No.1 sets up date with Ireland's Padraig Harrington
 Tiger Woods at the WGC World Matchplay championship in Carlsbad on Friday. (AFP) Carlsbad (California), Feb. 28 (Reuters): Tiger Woods raced into the quarter finals of the WGC-World Matchplay Championship by brushing aside Swede Fredrik Jacobson 5 and 4 in the third round on Friday. Woods, the world No. 1 and defending champion, now meets Irelands Padraig Harrington, who put out last years beaten finalist David Toms one up at La Costa Resort amp; Spa. Britains Ian Poulter and Darren Clarke also reached the last eight. Poulter defeated John Huston 2 and 1 to set up a clash with Australias Stephen Leaney, who defeated Britains Colin Montgomerie one up. Clarke downed Kenny Perry 3 and 2 and next faces Jerry Kelly, who edged Chad Campbell one up. The fourth quarter final will be an all-American showdown between Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson. Love swept past Australian Adam Scott 4 and 3 while Mickelson knocked out Chris DiMarco 3 and 2. Meanwhile, Vijai Singh of Fiji was upset in the third round itself when he lost 4 and 2 to American Jerry Kelly. I really wanted to beat the No. 2 player in the world who is feeling like No. 1, eighth-seeded Kelly said. It feels great. I used the adrenaline. It feels like aggressiveness not nervousness. The quarter finals and semi-finals will be held on Saturday after heavy rain washed out play on Thursday, forcing the competitors to play the second and third rounds on Friday. Woods first-round struggle in a one-up win over John Rollins was a distant memory as he powered past South African Trevor Immelman 5 and 4 before dismissing Jacobson by an identical margin. Never behind in either contest, Woods was six-under-par for 28 holes as he took his record in the championship to 17-3 and his winning streak to nine matches. I played well all day, Woods said. I think whats important is I kept the pressure on my opponent all day. I got off to early leads but its just about keeping the pressure on your guy, driving the ball in play, putting the ball up there close (to the cup), making them have to work for holes. Harrington was pleased to progress beyond the second round here for the first time in four attempts. Relieved to get through in the end because I was struggling a little bit on the back nine, the Irishman said. The birdie that I made at the 16th was a big one and came at a vital time because I was starting to get a little fatigued and because of that the timing on my swing was a little bit disconnected. Harrington knows he faces a difficult encounter with Woods. Going into any match with Tiger Woods is tough and you have to be at the top of your game and playing well, he said. Its 18 holes of match play and, as weve seen this week already, anything can happen in that.  Copyright

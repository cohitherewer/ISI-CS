 Last thing tennis needed: McEnroe
 BY CLIVE WHITE  McEnroe is surprised Rusedski tested positive The New Year has begun for tennis in the same disappointing vein as the old one ended with allegations of corrupt behaviour by its participants  and further embarrassment for the Association of Tennis Professionals. John McEnroe has called for the governing body of the mens game to put its house in order and impose sternest possible penalties against offenders, whether it be for illegal betting or drug-taking, adding: Surely its time now for tennis to have its own commissioner. Greg Rusedskis admission to a positive drug test has come like a hammer blow to the sport after the betting scandal that was uncovered late last year. We have enough problems in the sport. Its the last thing we needed, said McEnroe. McEnroe called for the ATP to come down harshly on him or anyone else proved guilty of taking performance-enhancing drugs. It would be sad if this was the case, said McEnroe, eluding to the British number twos attempted comeback from injury, because it shows the desperate measures people will go to in order to keep up. But he was surprised that Rusedski should have proved positive. Watching him play, Ive never noticed anything about him that struck me as different, but I dont know him that well. It would be surprising if it were true. In fact, even not knowing him, it would be surprising, he said. McEnroe had suspicions that players were taking drugs back when he was playing. I dont think it was widespread but Im sure it did go on, he said. McEnroe was disappointed some of the testing nowadays was inconclusive. Seven players who tested positive for traces of nandrolone last year were absolved when it came to light that ATP trainers were unwittingly administering the illegal drug to players in electrolyte replacement products. Its partly on basis of these findings that Rusedski has launched his appeal.  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

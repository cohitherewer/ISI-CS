The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB raising the bar, feels coach 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Cristiano Junior after scoring his second goal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: What East Bengal does today, India should do tomorrow. Well, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick says his team is setting an example for the generation to follow. Wednesdays 4-2 verdict over Negeri Sembilan of Malaysia was East Bengals sixth successive win over clubs from other countries  a rare occurrence in Indian football. I told my boys lets prove we are doing something. Even the Indian team is doing well, so we felt lets complement each other. Lets do something and make everyone take notice, Bhowmick said. My players have set a new standard. No Indian team has managed so many successive wins against foreign teams. And we didnt do it against teams like Nepal, Bhutan or Bangladesh. Bhowmick had a point there, since most of the teams East Bengal have beaten, represent countries ranked higher than India. What my boys are doing should be the target for the national team as well. Bhaichung Bhutia, arguably the first player who dared to dream at a time when Indian football was hitting new lows, said the need of the hour was to be consistent. What we are doing is good. The players are believing in themselves. So there has been a change in attitude, but this is not the end of the road. We must concentrate on the grassroots and not rest here. Bhowmick refused to read too much into the fact that his team conceded two goals at home. This is international football. The Malaysian team sees better football than we do. Thats why they succeeded in fighting back the way they did. But this win puts us in an advantageous position. The lesson is, no match will be easy. Mike Okoro dedicated his goal to fellow-Nigerian footballer Lawrence Enyilord, who passed away earlier this month in the city. This is for him, said Okoro, who lifted his jersey after scoring to show his vest bearing Lawrences picture. The Negeri Sembilan camp took heart from this defeat. They felt they were defeated but certainly not disgraced. We didnt have two of our main defenders. With them, I am sure we will give East Bengal a good fight in the return game in Malaysia, said coach K. Devan. The game turned on its head when East Bengal scored the third goal and we lost composure after hitting the equaliser. It could have been a different story had our frontline defenders been here. Devan felt the quality of foreigners made the difference between the two sides. The Malaysians and Indians are more or less the same, with the possible exception of Bhutia. But East Bengal prevailed because their foreigners were better than ours.  Copyright

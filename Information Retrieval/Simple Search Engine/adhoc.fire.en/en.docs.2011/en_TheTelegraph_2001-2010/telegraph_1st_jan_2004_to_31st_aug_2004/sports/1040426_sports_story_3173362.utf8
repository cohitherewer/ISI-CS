The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gul deposes
Karachi: A five-member medical panel Sunday began its inquiry into the spate of injuries to key Pakistan players in the recent series against India by interviewing Umar Gul. The panel will interview fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar on Tuesday (not on Monday, as reported earlier), a PCB official said. Others who will depose before the commission are fast bowler Mohammed Sami and wicketkeeper Moin Khan. Two other cricketers, pacer Shabbir Ahmed and allrounder Abdul Razzaq will not appear before the commission as they have already left for England to play county cricket. The commission will now consider the medical reports of the two players in their absence, the official said. Shoaib, whose injury at a crucial time in the series-decider in Rawalpindi prompted the PCB to form the inquiry panel, had conveyed to the board that he would not be making it on Sunday. The medical commission will now meet on Tuesday after Shoaib requested that due to his pre-occupation he would not be able to appear before the commission today, a PCB official said. Shoaib, who is in Mumbai for the past one week to shoot for a commerical, is scheduled to return on Monday and had informed the board that he would be available for hearing only on Tuesday. Meanwhile, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan denied media reports that the board would soon advertise for a full time chief executive to replace Rameez Raja.  (PTI)  Copyright

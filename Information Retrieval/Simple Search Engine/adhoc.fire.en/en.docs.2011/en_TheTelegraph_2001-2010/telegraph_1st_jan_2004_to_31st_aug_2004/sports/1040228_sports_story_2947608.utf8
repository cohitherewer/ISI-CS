The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Australia clinch series
 - FOURTH ODI - Sangakkara ton in vain; Kasprowicz takes career-best 5/45  Ricky Ponting sweeps one en route to his 67 as Kumar Sangakkara looks on. (Reuters) Colombo: Fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz grabbed career-best figures as Australia defeated Sri Lanka by 40 runs in the fourth one-day international Friday and clinched the five-match series 3-1. Kasprowicz snapped up five for 45 from nine overs as Sri Lanka, set a 234 run target, lost their last eight wickets for 50 runs and were bowled out for 193. Adam Gilchrist took six catches in the innings for the third time in his career, equalling the world record he shares with West Indian Ridley Jacobs and Englishman Alec Stewart. Kumar Sangakkara had threatened a Sri Lanka victory with a scintillating run-a-ball 101, his third ODI hundred. But the hosts, cruising on 143 for two with 18 overs remaining, collapsed dramatically after Jason Gillespie broke a 65-run stand for the third wicket. Earlier, Ricky Ponting (67) and Andrew Symonds (53) had top scored for Australia, rescuing the tourists after they had slipped to 62 for three after opting to bat first. Sri Lanka spinners Muttiah Muralidharan and Upul Chandana sparked a late-innings collapse taking three wickets each as Australia slumped from 201 for five to 206 for nine. Michael Clarke and Gillespie averted a total collapse, putting on 27 runs for the last wicket on a difficult pitch. Sri Lanka made a disastrous start to their run chase, losing Sanath Jayasuriya in the second over as the left-hander edged a rising delivery behind. But after consolidating briefly, Sangakkara cut loose with a flurry of boundaries, racing to his 11th one-day fifty from just 45 balls. Wrist-spinner Brad Hogg broke through as Marvan Atapattu miscued a lofted drive and was caught at long on.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

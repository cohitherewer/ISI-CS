(AFP) Melbourne: Roger Federer climbed to the top of the world on Friday, felling Juan Carlos Ferrero to reach his first Australian Open final and clinch top spot in the rankings. The manner of his 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 victory could hardly have been more fitting as he secured the world No. 1 spot for the first time. Having knocked all life out of his Spanish opponent in 89 minutes, Federer knelt on centre court and saluted the awe-struck crowd. I knew I had the chance to be number one in the world, the Wimbledon champion sighed with relief. Those nerves were never on show as the stylish Swiss hit shots lesser players only dream of, humbling the French Open champion and world No. 2 in the process. I am confident. I mean, have you ever seen a number one in the world who is not that confident? he said. Federer will face mighty Marat Safin in Sundays final. Looking forward to Sundays showpiece, Federer said: (Marat is) a great player, it will be a great match. Its very nice to see him in the final. If Federer can reach the heights he scaled in this semi-final, it is hard to see how the 86th-ranked Safin could live with him. Ferrero could not handle the Swiss and was left staring into space. How good I was today? Not so good, he smiled wryly. Ferrero said he could feel pain in his legs when he was stretching or recovering and could not run enough balls down. The comment did not give Federer credit for a superb performance. At the Rod Laver Arena he bore down on the net, setting out his gameplan from the beginning. Slashing his serve out wide or into the Spaniards body, he followed his first one in and cut off the rangy Spaniards angles. On his second serve he stayed back, thrashing groundstrokes from side to side as Ferrero scampered to hunt the ball down. Far from opening defensively, though, Ferrero patrolled the baseline looking for the smallest of openings, pummelling the ball into the smallest of gaps in Federers armour. Little could separate the men in the first set. Federer fought off three break-points in the seventh game, fighting back from love-40 to nose ahead once more. Again Ferrero drew level, unerring in his accuracy. In the 10th game, Federer pounced. Unloading on the Spaniards serve he cracked a series of returns and on his first set-point, an under-pressure Ferrero flicked a forehand long. Opening the second set, Federer kept the heat on, drilling a serve at the Spaniard to hold as Ferrero simply shrugged his shoulders and returned to his seat. Ferrero was broken instantly, hooking a crosscourt forehand into the tramlines before falling behind 0-3. Dressed in black, the Spaniard tore a bandage from his left thigh at the next changeover, desperate for anything to change his luck. A clutch of solid first serves allowed him to get on the scoreboard for 3-1. The Swiss players deft touch rescued him, a delicately floated backhand forcing the Spaniard off balance and he missed as Federer eased 4-1 ahead. Another piledriver of a forehand gave Federer another break and a 5-1 lead, leaving Ferrero to thump his racket into his left thigh in fury and frustration. Two minutes later the Swiss was two sets up after less than an hour and Ferrero could only stare into space. Ferreros fragile confidence was shattered in the seventh game of set III when Federer broke him for a fourth time in total, tearing a return back onto the Spaniards toes. Serving comfortably, he moved to 5-3. Ferrero held for 4-5, but then Federer forced his opponent to return a forehand long after yet another heavy serve. Earlier, top-ranked womens duo Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suarez added to their growing list of doubles titles when they claimed their first Australian Open. Spains Ruano Pascual and Argentine Suarez easily accounted for the Russian pair of Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Likhovtseva 6-4, 6-3 in only 75 minutes. This was Suarez and Ruano Pascuals fifth Grand Slam womens doubles crown. The two right-handers already have two French Open and two US Open crowns in their kitty. (Reuters)  Copyright

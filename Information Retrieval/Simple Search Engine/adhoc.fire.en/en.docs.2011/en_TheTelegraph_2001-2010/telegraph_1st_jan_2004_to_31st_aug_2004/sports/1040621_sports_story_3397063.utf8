 Ballack wants precision
Porto: Germanys chances of a Euro 2004 quarter-final spot were hit hard as they were held to a dismal 0-0 draw by Latvia on Saturday. Germany will be eliminated if they cannot beat the Czechs in their last group D game after failing to repeat their convincing performance in the opening 1-1 draw with The Netherlands. I cant blame the team, Germany coach Rudi Voeller said. They tried everything right up to the final whistle. Its no disgrace. Naturally we hoped for more. We certainly didnt take them too lightly. They played a compact defence and thats where we had big problems. Now we have to beat the Czechs. Michael Ballack said the players were disappointed. We did everything we could, we dominated the game. We needed to be more precise with our crosses but the thing is, in the end, it was just not to be.   (REUTERS)  Copyright

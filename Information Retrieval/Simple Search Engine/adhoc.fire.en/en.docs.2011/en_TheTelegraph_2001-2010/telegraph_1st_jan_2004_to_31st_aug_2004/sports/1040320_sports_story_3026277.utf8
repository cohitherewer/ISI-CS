The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jayasuriya gives Lanka hope 
 - SECOND TEST - Hosts need 51 on tight leash to level series; Martyn hits 161  Sanath Jayasuriya celebrates his century in Kandy on Friday. (Reuters) Kandy: Sanath Jayasuriya smashed a brilliant 131 as Sri Lanka, chasing 352 for a series-levelling victory against Australia, ended Day IV on 301 for seven on Friday. Jayasuriya, dropped on 25, thrilled a small but vocal crowd with a withering assault that gave the hosts an outside chance of a remarkable win. The 34-year-old former captain reached his first Test hundred for 17 months off just 107 balls, cracking 17 fours and two sixes during his 145-ball innings. Allrounder Chaminda Vaas survived till bad light stopped play on 30 with rookie Kaushal Lokuarchchi on 13 not out to leave Sri Lanka needing 51 runs to win on the final day. Damien Martyn earlier scored a career-best 161 as Australia, who resumed on 320 for five after conceding a 91-run first-innings deficit, were bowled out for 442. Australia made early inroads with the new ball as both Maravan Atapattu (eight) and Avishka Gunawardene (nine) were trapped leg before to leave Sri Lanka tottering on 36 for two. Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara launched an aggressive fightback, though, scoring 62 from 82 balls for the third wicket before Sangakkara was caught and bowled by Shane Warne for 29. Mahela Jayawardene (13) stayed with Jayasuriya for 65 minutes as 76 runs were crashed from 97 balls before he nibbled at a rising delivery from fast bowler Jason Gillespie and was caught behind. Gillespie, who finished with three for 61, bowled a crucial 10-over spell and was rewarded with the prize scalp of Jayasuriya, who edged a catch to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist. Captain Hashan Tillekeratne (seven) added 21 for the sixth wicket with Tillekeratne Dilshan before Australia skipper Ricky Ponting took a diving one-handed catch at silly point. Minutes before the close Dilshan, Sri Lankas last specialist batsman, was bowled by a sharp leg break from Warne that clipped the top off his off stump and the spinner finished with figures of three for 83 from 18 overs. Sri Lankas highest successful run chase was 326 they made to defeat Zimbabwe by five wickets in January 1998. Martyn, dropped three times by Jayawardene, batted for 536 minutes and faced 347 balls during a marathon innings that included 21 fours and one six. It was his seventh Test hundred and surpassed his previous best of 133 against South Africa at the Wanderers in 2002. Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan finished with five for 173 from 50.3 overs, the 42nd five-wicket haul of his Test career. Andrew Symonds scored 23 before being trapped leg before as he swept an off-break from Muralidharan, who also dismissed Warne and Gillespie.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

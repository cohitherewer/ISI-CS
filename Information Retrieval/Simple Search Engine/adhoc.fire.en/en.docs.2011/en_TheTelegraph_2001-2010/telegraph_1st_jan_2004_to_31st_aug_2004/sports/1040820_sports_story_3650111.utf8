The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India A thrash Pak A
 M.S. Dhoni hit an unbeaten 119 Nairobi: Riding M. S. Dhonis unbeaten 119 off 134 deliveries, India A registered a thumping eight-wicket victory over Pakistan A in a triangular one-day cricket tournament match here on Thursday. In reply to Pakistan As 234, India A achieved the target in 45 overs. Gautam Gambhir assisted Dhoni well and scored 79. Earlier, India A scalped seven wickets in their last 10overs to restrict Pakistan A to 234. The Pakistanis, who were cruising at 197 for 2 after the 39th over, were pegged back by some fine bowling by medium pacer Shib Shankar Paul and skipper Sairaj Bahutule to take the last seven wickets for just 37 runs. Bahutule finished with four for 38 while Paul claimed three wickets for 44 runs. Electing to bat, Pakistan made a disastrous start losing two wickets for just eight runs but a brilliant 189 run stand between skipper Misbah-ul-Haq (106) and Bazid Khan (87) not only restructured the innings but laid the foundation for a big score. But with Bazid getting run out in the 40th over and Misbah-ul-Haq bowled by Bahutule soon after the Pakistan A batting collapsed like a pack of cards. None of their batsman showed any application. Brief scores Pakistan A 234 in 46.2 ovs (Bazid Khan 87, Misbah-ul Haq 106, S. S. Paul 3/44, S. Bahutule 4/38). India A 236/2 in 45 ovs (M. S. Dhoni 119 n.o., G. Gambhir 79). India A won by 8 wkts.

 Give torch only to Olympians: Padukone
Bangalore: Badminton legend Prakash Padukone said on Tuesday the Olympic torch, which is coming to Delhi on Thursday, should have been carried by only those who have represented the country in the Olympic Games. It should be the privilege of sportspersons, ideally ex-Olympians, who have brought laurels to the country. People like Milkha Singh, members of the hockey team, so many Olympians are there, he said. The torch will actually be carried, among others, by filmstars Aishwarya Rai, Vivek Oberoi, Aamir Khan, Rani Mukherjee, sarod players Ayan Ali and Aman Ali Bangash, in addition to sportspersons like Rahul Dravid and Kapil Dev.

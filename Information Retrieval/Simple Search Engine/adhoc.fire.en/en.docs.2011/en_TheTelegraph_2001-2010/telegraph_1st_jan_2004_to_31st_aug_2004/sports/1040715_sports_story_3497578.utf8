 Shane Warne raring to go 
 Warne is determined to change his ordinary record vs India Cairns: Shane Warne thinks he is finally ready to conquer India after equalling Muttiah Muralidharans world record of 527 wickets in the drawn second Test with Sri Lanka. Although Muralidharan is sure to regain sole ownership of the record when Sri Lanka host South Africa in two Tests next month, Warne will get the chance to overtake him when Australia tour India for four Tests in October. But the 34-year-old leg-spinner said he was more concerned about winning the series than any personal milestones. Australia have not won a series in India since 1969-70. There is a lot to play for this time when we go to India, Warne said. Its the one place we havent won in my career. Its probably the last time Im going to play a Test series in India, so hopefully well do okay. In six previous Tests in India, Warne has captured 20 wickets at an average of 52.25. The two tours Ive been there, they played me really well and I wasnt fully fit either, he said. This time Im fully fit and bowling as good as I ever have. Hopefully I will hit India ready to go and we win the series. That would be fantastic, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

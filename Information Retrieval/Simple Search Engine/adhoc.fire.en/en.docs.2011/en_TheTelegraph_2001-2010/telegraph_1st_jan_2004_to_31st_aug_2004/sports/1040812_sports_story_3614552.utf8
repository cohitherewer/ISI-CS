 Torri gets two-year ban 
Athens: World 100m champion Torri Edwards was banned for two years on Wednesday after a positive test for the stimulant nikethamide. Edwards, who had been included in the US team for the Athens Olympics opening on Friday, has appealed to the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Edwards, 27, was banned for two years from all sanctioned competition beginning in July 18, 2004, and all her competitive results were disqualified from that date, the USADA said in a statement. The statement said Edwards had decided to appeal to CAS. Edwards inherited the world title after compatriot Kelli White was also banned for two years after admitting taking a variety of banned drugs. Edwards tested positive at an April meeting in Martinique. Her ban opens up a place on the 100 team, which will now go to twice Olympic gold medallist Gail Devers, who finished fourth at the US trials. Edwardss place on the 200 team will be taken by LaShauntea Moore, the US collegiate champion. (Reuters)  Copyright

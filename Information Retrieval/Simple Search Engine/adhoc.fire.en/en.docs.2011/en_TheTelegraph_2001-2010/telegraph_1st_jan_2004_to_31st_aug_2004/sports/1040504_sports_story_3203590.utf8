 Pillay omission stuns Shahid, Ballal
 Pillay is still the popular choice New Delhi: Indias Olympic hockey preparation was hit by controversy on Monday after former stars slammed the omission of veteran Dhanraj Pillay from the list of 30 probables for the Athens Games in August. Pillay, 35, the face of Indian hockey for over a decade, saw his dream of playing a fourth Olympics evaporate over the weekend amidst reports he was being penalised for reported differences with national coach Rajinder Singh and junior teammates. Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) chief K.P.S. Gill justified the move by saying the team needed players who could last for 70 minutes under pressure. But former players rubbished Gills selection priorities. The speed at which modern hockey is played, no one in this Indian team can last a full 70 minutes, said former goalkeeper Ashish Ballal. Anyway, Dhanraj can give you in 10-15 minutes what others cant in 70. Former India international Mohammed Shahid added: People all over the world are still scared of Dhanraj. Why cant we use that to our advantage? The list of 30 probables, which includes 12 players who won the junior Asian title in Pakistan last week, doesnt include two other seniors, Baljit Dhillon and Baljit Saini. While Pillay declined to comment on his exclusion, Saini took a swipe at the IHF for keeping the seniors out. The way the IHF was targeting us, I knew our days in the national team were numbered. Former Indian Olympic captian M.M. Somayya thinks the IHF should have given Pillay a chance to prove his fitness by inviting him to the camp. He should have been given a chance to show that he has recovered from his knee injury because his experience would have helped the team at Athens, Somayya said. Agreed that knee injuries are a bit dicey but if he has fully recovered as he claims he has, then his inclusion would have been an asset for the team as he still has lots to give. Somayya felt Pillay should speak to the federation and coach Rajinder and resolve the issue. Every team has its share of misunderstandings and the differences between Pillay, if any, is too minor a thing when compared to the teams cause. By not selecting three experienced players like Pillay, Baljit Saini and Baljit Dhillon the team cnt have proper balance, Somayya said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I wont play, insists Barreto 
 - Bagan hope against hope, keep Brazilian in XVIII vs JCT  today
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 		 Barreto may come back  next seasonCalcutta, Jan. 10: Would he or wouldnt he, that was the only issue that dogged Mohun Bagan on the eve of their National Football League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Jose Ramirez Barreto has made it clear that his stint with the club is over and its just a matter of time before he leaves the Indian shores. Im not playing tomorrow, whatever conditions there may be, Barreto told The Telegraph on Saturday night. He insisted there shouldnt be any doubt about his return to Brazil, but added: I may come back next season. Mohun Bagan, however, are hoping against hope that their mercurial Brazilian will take the field on Sunday. The Bagan team management has kept him in the XVIII, though there was no sign of him in the practice. In fact, sources close to him informed that Barreto has already got his return ticket and will head back to Brazil very soon. Coach Aloke Mukherjee and Basudeb Mondal went to Barretos place on Saturday before match-eve practice, but he was unavailable. Barreto is a great player and well obviously miss him badly, Mukherjee said. The coach informed that the planning for the game is being done taking into account that Barreto isnt playing. Well play in the 4-4-1-1 formation with Ashim Biswas as the lone striker and Hardeep Saini playing a little withdrawn. Mohun Bagan will also miss Lolendra Singh and Sanjeev Maria (injury) and Eduardo (dehydration). JCT, on the other hand, will be missing I.M. Vijayan, who is nursing a groin injury. Were making our plans taking into consideration that Barreto will play, coach Sukhwinder Singh said. However, if he doesnt take the field, Im quite sure the other Mohun Bagan players will take the field doubly charged, trying to prove a point, he added.  The blame game Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra alleged that Barretos dues have not been cleared for the last two months and that is one of the main reasons behind his decision to leave the club. He informed that the cheques are lying with him and he can only clear them if the requisition comes from the Special Officers who are in charge. But assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury claimed the dues have been cleared and Mitras allegations are baseless. However, he could not show the receipt of the cheques signed by Barreto.  Copyright

 ACA wants ICC to intervene
Melbourne: Australias leading players representative says the ICC should take urgent action to resolve Zimbabwes player dispute because it is making cricket look stupid. There must be quality controls to maintain the standard of Test cricket, Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief executive Tim May was quoted as saying in The Australian newspaper on Wednesday. May said he was concerned about the state of Test cricket with top-ranked Australia to face a depleted Zimbabwe side in a two-Test series starting in Harare on May 22. These matches will go down as Test matches, but they are not Test matches. May was travelling to Dubai on Wednesday to attend an ICC cricket committee meeting on playing conditions, ACA operations manager Paul Marsh said. He will also make an attempt to convince the ICC to intervene in the Zimbabwe crisis.  They (ICC) have the power to act, May was quoted as saying in Melbournes Herald Sun. May added in The Australian: If this cannot be resolved, the (10-nation Test championship) programme should be thrown out and the top six nations should play against each other. Test-playing nations face heavy fines from the ICC if they withdraw from tours for reasons apart from safety and security. The 15 sacked white players missed meeting Sri Lanka but can still play the touring Australia side, ZCU chief executive Vincent Hogg said. All they have to do is to notify us of their willingness to practice and be available for selection. He said the players could do this individually or as a group. They would also be allowed to play on contract or be paid for matches they choose to play in against Australia, who arrives Thursday for a tour of two Tests and three one-day Internationals. He said the door is still open for the players if they showed commitment to Zimbabwe cricket. Hogg said contrary to reports, Streak told him he would retire from all forms of cricket if his demands were not met.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

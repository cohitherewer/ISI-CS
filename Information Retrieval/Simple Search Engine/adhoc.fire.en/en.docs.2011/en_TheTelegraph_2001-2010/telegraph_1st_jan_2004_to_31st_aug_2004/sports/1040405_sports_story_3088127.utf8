 A few tips dont make a Pathan: Akram
 Pathans credit was learning quickly, feels Akram Islamabad: Former Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram Sunday swept aside criticism that his tips to Indian seamer Irfan Pathan has backfired on the hosts in the on-going series. One or two tips do not make an Irfan Pathan. I just gave him few basic tips on how to bowl and how to train and its his greatest asset that he learnt quickly, said Akram. Akram was attending a seminar on diabetes in Islamabad before flying back to Singapore. It is amazing how people think. Pathan has worked really hard and it is his credit that he came out with flying colours on a placid track in Multan, he said. Akram did not even think the 19-year-old Indian speedster did anything special, other than bowl with discipline in Multan where India beat Pakistan by an innings and 52 runs for their first-ever Test triumph in this country. I dont think Pathan bowled extraordinarily. He just bowled straight and made batsmen play five out of six balls and was ably supported by Laxmipathy Balaji, he said. Pathan, who looks up to Akram as his idol, took some tips from the seasoned pacer during Indias tour of Australia earlier this year. He (Pathan) came to me to ask about some basics of bowling and how to maintain fitness, said Imran. Akram also tried to boost the morale of Pakistani bowlers, saying: To me Pakistan bowling attack is still the most potent in the world. He added a word of caution, though, noting that Pakistani bowlers must learn to bowl straight and remember that batsmen nowadays dont fear pace. He lamented that Pakistan went into Multan Test with a negative mindset. (agencies)  Copyright

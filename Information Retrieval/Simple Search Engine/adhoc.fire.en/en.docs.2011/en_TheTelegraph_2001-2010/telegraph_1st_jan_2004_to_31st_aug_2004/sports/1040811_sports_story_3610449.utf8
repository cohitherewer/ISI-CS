The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Yao, the symbol of new China
Athens: Yao Ming is not only the most prominent Asian athlete at the Olympics in Athens. Chinas flag bearer at the Games is also the tallest ever to compete. But the 2.29 metre (7 feet-6 inches) Yao not only towers above the competition, he also has become the symbol of emerging China and an integral part of the globalisation of sport. Yao, 23, was one of the first Chinese nationals to be allowed to head to the US to play in the NBA. After three years in the league, he was taken by the Houston Rockets as the top draft choice in 2001 where he has established himself as one of the games premier players. Just as important for the ever-growing NBA, the centers marketability has made him Asias hottest- selling sports commodity. Hes very much a national icon, part of a patriotic fervor that is occurring in China, said Margaret Ogilvy-Stuart, managing director for sports marketing firm CSS Stella in Beijing. It almost was not that way. By kindergarten, Yao was so tall he was paying adult bus fares. In first grade, he was as big as his teacher. At 13, he was likened to a crane towering among a flock of chickens. But up to that age, Yaos Olympic dream was to be on the water polo team. Soon he found the deep end of swimming pools easier to walk in than to swim in. Caught with his feet on the pool floor one too many times, his interest, as well as his body, grew and Yao quickly earned a spot on his local youth basketball team  the Shanghai Oriental Sharks. A youthful sense of humour and self-deprecation has won him fans in a league characterised by brash defiance and individuality. It has also earned endorsement contracts galore, including one with Reebok who recently signed a five-year deal to sell NBA gear in Asia with an eye on Yao as the cornerstone. Yaos popularity is such that more than half of the visits to NBA Web sites this season were from outside the US, the first time that has happened.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

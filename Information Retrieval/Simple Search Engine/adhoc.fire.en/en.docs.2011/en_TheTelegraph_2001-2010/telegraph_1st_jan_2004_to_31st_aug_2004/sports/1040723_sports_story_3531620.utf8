 Soumyajit creates history
 Soumyajit helped India win their first-ever gold in any Asian-level table tennis meet New Delhi: Thirteen-year-old Soumyajit Sarkar made history, defeating Kim Gang Woog of Korea in the final of the junior Asian championship here on Thursday to help the country win its first-ever table tennis gold at the Asian level. In a gruelling five setter in the under-16 section, the Bengal player, who is seen as a top future prospect for India, held on to his nerves to overcome his Korean opponent 9-11, 14-12, 7-11, 12-10, 12-10 at the NDMC Stadium here. Soumyajit, who seemed to be overawed by the big stage initially, went down tamely in the first game allowing Kim to take it 11-9. But he overcame his nervousness and showed his class to win the second 14-12. Kim, who was cheered throughout the game by a vociferous Korean contingent, came back into the match when he took the third set 7-11. The Korean was in complete command in the third set as his powerful drives caught Soumyajit on the wrong foot time and again. The Indian then showed tremendous courage to match his Korean counterpart in every department of the game. He also gave a glimpse of his big match temperament as he saved two match points in the fourth set before winning the game 12-10. Playing in the deciding game like a man possessed, Soumyajit forced a 5-0 lead against the Korean. However with victory firmly in sight, he faltered allowing his opponent to get back into the match. Kim rallied to level the scores 8-8. Soumyajit, however, prevailed in the end, taking the game and the match at 12-10. In the girls under-16 final, Jan Dal Rae of Korea beat Wakamiya Misako of Japan 7-11, 5-11, 12-10, 11-8, 11-9 to win the crown. Jan came back into the match after being two games down before going on to win the last three games to pocket the match.

 Arsenals title grip strengthens
Newcastle: Arsenals grip on the Premier League title strengthened on Sunday when they increased their lead to seven points with a battling 0-0 draw at Newcastle United. Arsenal, with six games remaining, have 78 points, seven more than second-placed Chelsea who knocked them out of the Champions League on Tuesday. Newcastle have 49 points with fourth-placed Liverpool, the final spot for Champions League qualification, but are a place behind on goal difference. Newcastle started strongly and Craig Bellamy forced a fine save from German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann with a flick at the near post in the sixth minute. Arsenal fought their way back and French forward Sylvain Wiltord was given a clear shot on goal by a poor back pass by Jermaine Jenas. However he scuffed it wide with his left foot. The second half was evenly matched although Henry, the leagues top scorer, should have netted in the 63rd minute. Reyes also should have scored in the 76th minute when his free header six metres out hit Given. Chelsea drew 0-0 at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday and champions Manchester United, in third, beat Birmingham City 2-1. (Reuters)  Copyright

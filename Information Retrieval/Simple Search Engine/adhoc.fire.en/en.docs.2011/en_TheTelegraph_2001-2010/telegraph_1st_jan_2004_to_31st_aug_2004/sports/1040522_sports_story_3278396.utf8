Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) Platinum Pension Scheme was launched at the Eden Gardens on Friday evening when its former president B.N. Dutt handed over cheques to six former Test players and three umpires. Twelve other centres around the country also hosted similar programmes simultaneously. The 40-minute function was well organised and attended among others by chairman CAB Board of Trustees Chandi Ganguly and BCA president Amitabh Choudhary, besides BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya. The former players to be handed over the first monthly pension of Rs 5,000 plus a Rs 3 lakh medical cover were Erapalli Prasanna, Ramesh Saxena, Ashok Malhotra, Pranab Roy, Arun Lal and Syed Saba Karim. Ashok Gandotra, Dilip Doshi and Subroto Banerjee could not attend the function as they are all overseas. Bhairab Ganguly, J.D. Ghosh and Sunit Kumar Ghosh were the umpires to be honoured. S.R. Bose could not make it because of ill-health and his cheque was handed over at his residence. Dalmiya termed it as an historic occasion, not just because it was an attempt to recognise the efforts of stalwarts, but also since it was a solemn promise to stand by all who have served the country. Its a token of appreciation and a humble beginning, Dalmiya said. Were also looking forward to your valuable experience to guide and help Indian cricket. Dutt, who was persuaded by Dalmiya to attend the function, said it gave him immense pleasure to be present at the function. I told Bishuda that this is a BCCI function and as a former president he will lend stature to the event, Dalmiya said. Prasanna felt tremendously excited to be part of the scheme and thanked Dalmiya for making it happen. He also reminded the BCCI president of his willingness to offer help whenever needed. While Saxena said the recognition was more important than the monetary aspect, Malhotra felt the money was a life-saving thing for the ones who played in the 50s and 60s. Malhotra also lauded Dalmiyas astute leadership in running the Board which has been reflected in Team Indias performance. Current national selector Roy felt honoured while for Lal it was a solemn and emotional occasion. Its historic because the BCCI has embarked on a huge responsibility with a fine gesture. This will go a long way in making life a lot better for many. Its intertwined till death, Lal said, adding that he hoped first-class cricketers would also be part of the scheme in future.  Copyright

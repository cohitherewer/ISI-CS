The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Time for Kelli to pay: Marion
 Kelli White has agreed to help anti-doping officials clean up the sport Los Angeles: Marion Jones said Kelli White should pay the price for getting caught using performance-enhancing substances, but she shouldnt be held up as a hero. Ive always said that if you do something wrong you should pay the penalty, Jones said. USADA commended Kelly for her courageous act of admitting she was guilty. I dont think you should be commended for that. Jones was speaking at the Home Depot Invitational track meet Saturday where she won the 100 m and long jump. White was suspended this week by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for two years and stripped of the two world championship gold medals she won in Paris last year. White is the first American athlete barred from the Olympics based on evidence from documents collected from Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO). The evidence of Whites drug use was collected by USADA in part from material given to them by the senate commerce committee after an investigation by the federal justice department into BALCO. That evidence included the use of erythropoietin, a blood-oxygen booster more commonly used by distance runners. White has agreed to assist anti-doping officials in their efforts to clean up the sport. People make bad choices, said reigning Olympic sprint champ Maurice Greene on Saturday. Unfortunately she (White) has to pay for it. Im all for drug testing. Its time for our sport to be clean. Jones testified in November, along with her partner Tim Montgomery, in front of a federal grand jury looking into BALCO. Jones has never tested positive and has denied taking banned drugs. Personally, Im not the least bit concerned, Jones said of sports officials attempts to weed out drug cheats with information from the BALCO case. Why are they (trying to ban) athletes without a positive test? Jones is threatening to sue if she is prevented from taking part in Athens without a failed drug test. Jones also requested a DNA test on any samples that allegedly relate to BALCO, and asked this week to meet with American anti-doping officials to explain her BALCO connection. Greene was also questioned about BALCO Saturday after the San Jose Mercury News reported that his coach John Smith met with BALCO founder Victor Conte in October 2001 and signed a non-disclosure agreement. Personally, I dont have any pressure on me, and Im not worried at all (about doping), Greene said. Yes, there is a cloud of suspicion at the moment, but lets get focused on the positive. I was told about the article (linking John Smith and Victor Conte) but I dont have any comments. The story came five days after Greene made a major anti-doping stand at meetings with the media in New York, endorsing the USADAs bid to banish dope cheats even if there is no positive doping test against them. Emanuel Hudson, president of Greenes HS International (HSI) track club, defended Smith Saturday. If you are going to do something illegal why would you sign a disclosure document? Hudson said. Do you think a crack dealer on the corner would say he would want you to sign a disclosure agreement before he sells you the crack? Conte is among four men indicted on steroid distribution charges stemming from last years discovery of the previously undetectable steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG). (AFP)  Copyright

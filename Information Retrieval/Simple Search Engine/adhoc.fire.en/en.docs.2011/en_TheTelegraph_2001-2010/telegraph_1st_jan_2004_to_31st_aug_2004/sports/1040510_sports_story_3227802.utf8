The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tiger shares 11th spot
Charlotte (North Carolina): World No.1 Tiger Woods tumbled down the Wachovia Championship leaderboard after a three-over-par 75 dropped him five shots behind third-round pacesetter Arron Oberholser on Saturday. Oberholser, 29, in his second year on the PGA Tour, moved into the lead with a four-under 68 and an 11-under total of 205. Woods, who had been two strokes clear of the field following his 66 on Friday, slid to joint 11th place on 210. Australian Geoff Ogilvy had one of the best rounds of the day, firing a 66 to vault into a tie for second with Notah Begay III (69), one shot behind Oberholser. Jeff Maggert (67) was fourth on 207. Paraguays Carlos Franco, Joey Sindelar, Australias Stuart Appleby and first-round leader Kirk Triplett shared fifth position on 208, eight under. The Wachovia, which offers a prize of $1,008,000 to the winner, has attracted one of the strongest fields of the season, with five of the worlds top six players appearing. None of the five, however, figured among the leading competitors after 54 holes. Woods problems at Quail Hollow Golf Club began when he bogeyed the opening hole. He followed with two more dropped shots and a birdie to make the turn at two-over-par. He also bogeyed the 12th before rallying with birdies at the 14th and 15th. Following another dropped stroke at the 16th, Woods hung his tee shot at the 17th out to the left and found the water, leading to a double-bogey five. His 66 on Friday was an uncharacteristic.

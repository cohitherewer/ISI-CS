The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, January 29, 2004  Obligado was made to sweat 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Good fields and competitive sport have blessed the city turfites over the past few weeks, and last Friday was no exception. Odds offered on the days favourites, too, had been far too expansive, for a change, but it is another matter that they failed in most of the eight-event card. If hot-favourite Obligado, in feature event the Indian Champion Cup over 2,000m, triumphed, it was his superior upcountry class that got the better of an aged horse, Allodium. But the eight-year-old deserves kudos for his efforts. His advancing age apart, the Twist and Turn-Dangerous Romance son was vying for the Rs 4 lakh-plus purse at very crammed terms, yet he stretched the half-money favourite to the fullest.				 										Recently in the 1,600m Eveready Gold Cup, he had taken Darius Byramjis challenger the full distance when at 7-1/2 kg weight advantage. At level terms, it really came as a surprise when the two fought a lively duel in the last furlong of the race. One, therefore, is tempted to conclude that the Indictment-Ensenada son is more at home over a mile trip than any other. 				 										The 1,400m Indian Champagne Stakes, by contrast, was easy picking for rank-outsider Bollywood Dreams, another Bharath-trainee. Neither his bloodline nor the preparatory gallops of the Steinbeck-Liberty three-year-old boasted of anything special compared to some fine specimen in the field of ten.				 										It was, perhaps, the craftsmanship of Bharath that turned an ordinary mortal into a champion galloper. Bollywood Dreams was, indeed, a trifle lucky, as the erratic leader Lake O Gold had taken the potential horses very wide at the final turn. But the fact that the winner was trailing the field till 300m from home and unleashed the required acceleration when jockey Mark Reuben urged him for efforts, speaks highly of a debutant.				 										Horseracing may not be all about the timing clocked by the winner yet it helps at times. Prime Contender, for instance, had won his previous start, albeit narrowly, from Flying Dash, and the time recorded by him was very smart for his class of horses. With favourable weight also by his side, the Young Senor-Primo Donna mare repeated the winning performance, and in a very fluent manner in the 1,200m Republic Cup to leave Final Round and Brighter Future far behind.				 										Amicable, a 4-1 chance, had the last laugh over Athenia and Queen Of The Nile, the two fillies who had cornered a bulk of betting at 2-1 each in the Star Contender Cup over 1,600m. Athenia was expected to lead the challenge but the Storm Trooper-Shift Over filly failed to produce her Oaks form over the slated mile. In fact, it was Queen Of The Nile who dictated the terms from 600m onwards but with Amicable jumping into the fray 250m from home a long tussle for supremacy followed. With lead changing with every stride C. Alford managed to snatch the verdict from A. Merchant at the all-important end.

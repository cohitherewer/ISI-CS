		 Sunday, July 11, 2004  Elite Zone holds the edge 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore, July 10: Trainer S. Ganapathy holds the key to the 2,000m Kingfisher Derby Bangalore, tomorrows main attraction here. Of the 13 horses in the line-up, including a filly, he is represented by Elite Zone, Spectacular Quest and Star Admiral who look a cut above the rest.				 										In fact, going by their recent performance, there is little to choose between them. But, the race being all about speed and stamina, one finds Elite Zone better suited to the trip. The Placerville-First One Home son was a fluent winner of an 1,800m race in which he had an easy measure of Spark Of Glory. With C. Rajendra to partner, he is expected do the trick again.				 										SELECTIONS				 										1.30 pm: Miami Gold 1. Aiyana 2. Camarioca 3.				 										2 pm: Pamela Bordes 1. Faustino 2.

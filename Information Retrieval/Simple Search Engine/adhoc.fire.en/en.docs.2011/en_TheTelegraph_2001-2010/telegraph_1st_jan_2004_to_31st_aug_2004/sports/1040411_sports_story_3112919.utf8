 14 players may resign, says Goodwin
London: Zimbabwe are on the brink of collapse as an international cricket team as 14 players are considering resignation, according to former Test batsman Murray Goodwin. Now at English county Sussex, Goodwin said several of his former team-mates were considering a boycott following the decision by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) to strip Heath Streak of the captaincy. Ive spoken to some of the players and they are not very happy with the situation, Goodwin said on Friday. Now 14 of them are thinking of resigning, Goodwin said at Lords where he was appearing for Sussex against an MCC team led by former Zimbabwe skipper Andy Flower in the opening fixture of the English season. I dont know what will happen to Zimbabwe. Its a bit of a lottery. I was talking about this with Andy Flower and he said the players were on a hiding to nothing. What I do know is that there isnt enough depth in Zimbabwean cricket to cope with the loss of 14 players and still compete effectively at international level. Goodwin, 31, played the last of his 19 Tests for Zimbabwe away to England four years ago before calling time on his international career to pursue a more lucrative working life in the first-class arena. All-rounder Neil Johnson quit at around the same time, the pairs decision to stop playing cricket at the highest level leaving Zimbabwe without two of their most experienced players. But Goodwin, 31, who emigrated to Australia as a 13-year-old, said he had no regrets after bowing out of Test cricket with an impressive record of 1,414 runs at an average of over 42 with three hundreds. No, not at all. Im just happy to be playing cricket all year round. Goodwin notched up over 1,500 first-class runs at an average of nearly 60 as Sussex won their first ever county championship title last season.  (AFP)  Copyright

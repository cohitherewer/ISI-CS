The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cameroon docked six points
Zurich, April 17 (Reuters): Cameroon have been docked six points ahead of their 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign after breaking a pledge to Fifa that they would not wear their controversial one-piece strip in the African Nations Cup knock-out phase. Cameroon, who were beaten in the quarter finals by Nigeria in Tunisia in February, have also been fined 200,000 Swiss francs ($154,000) by Fifa. Fifa had shown leniency at the time over Cameroons attire in the group round of the competition after the (Cameroon soccer) association had given assurances that the team would wear authorised playing kit in the knock-out phases, Fifa said in a statement on Friday. Despite this agreement, Cameroon subsequently wore the same equipment in the quarter-finals. Fifa wanted Cameroon to wear regulation shirts and shorts. Cameroon, who turned up for the 2002 African Nations Cup in Mali, sporting sleeveless shirts which were subsequently banned by Fifa, wore athletics-style kit this time round.  Copyright

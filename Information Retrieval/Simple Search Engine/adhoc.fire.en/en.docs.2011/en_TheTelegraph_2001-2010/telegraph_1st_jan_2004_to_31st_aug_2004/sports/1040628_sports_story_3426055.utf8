The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dutch paint the town orange
Amsterdam: Dutch fans spilled into the streets chanting Holland, Holland in celebration on Saturday after The Netherlands beat Sweden to reach the Euro 2004 semi-finals where they will play hosts Portugal. The packed centre of the Dutch capital was a sea of orange with exuberant fans dressed in the teams colours waving Dutch flags to cheer their 5-4 victory on penalties over the Swedes. The teams had drawn 0-0 after playing 120 minutes before Arjen Robben, the 20-year-old winger, scored from the penalty spot to spark celebrations in bars decked out in orange balloons and streamers where fans had gathered to watch the match. Many bars were so crowded they had to turn fans away. Its simply unbelievable. It was an exciting game and a real nail-biter to the very end, said Mannon Mulder, 32, an advertising executive. Our team was just fantastic. They kept it together and have made the whole country proud. Unseasonably cool rain did not stop people cramming into the main squares in towns across the country to celebrate. Cars driving along Amsterdams central canals hooted in unison and Dutch supporters dancing in the streets in The Hague briefly stopped traffic in the centre of the city. The mood was in sharp contrast to that a week earlier when angry fans burned the Dutch flag and smashed windows after their team gave up an early lead to lose 2-3 to the Czech Republic. It was amazing that the Dutch won on penalties, said Henk Dekker, an employee in a flower shop. It is something that you just dont expect after so many losses (after a shootout) in the European Championship and World Cup, he said. Most fans in the streets on Saturday seemed to have forgiven coach Dick Advocaat, who was slammed for substituting Robben against the Czechs. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Many Indians dope: Milkha
 Milkha has only 25 per cent hope in Anju Chandigarh: Predicting a dismal performance from the 75-member Indian contingent in next weeks Athens Olympics, track legend Milkha Singh Thursday alleged that the countrys athletes qualify for major international meets through the back door. Sportspersons here qualify for bigger international events with the help of drugs and incorrect measurements by the officials, Milkha alleged while talking to reporters here. The sports ministry, meanwhile, denied Thursday that any member of the Athens-bound Indian contingent had tested positive for performance enhancing drugs. All the sportspersons identified as probables for Athens Olympics have been tested regularly and all those qualified and selected for Olympics have been tested recently. None of them were found positive for dope, a statement by the ministry said here. The statement was made in the context of a report that two athletes, including a leading track and field star, had reportedly tested positive for a performance enhancing drug. Milkha, meanwhile, expressed little hope even in long jumper Anju Bobby George. Even Anju after crossing 6.80 m twice had never been able to touch the mark. I have only 25 per cent hope on Anju as the world level girls are jumping around 7m, said Milkha, who missed the bronze medal in 400m in Rome Olympics by a whisker. India can win one or two medals in weightlifting and shooting, but there is not much hope for athletes. He also deplored the sending of big contingent to Athens when there was limited hope for winning medals. It is a waste of money... Participation can be of only ten players. (PTI)  Copyright

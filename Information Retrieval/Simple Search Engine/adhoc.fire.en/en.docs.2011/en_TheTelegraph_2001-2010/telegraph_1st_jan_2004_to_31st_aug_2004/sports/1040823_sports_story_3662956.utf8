The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India in semis with 2-1 victory
	 - Vietnam 6-nation meet  Prakash displayed fine opportunism to score both goals New Delhi: R. C. Prakash displayed admirable opportunism as he struck a brace enabling India enter the semi-finals with a 2-1 win over Myanmar in their LG Cup football tournament lung opener in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on Sunday. The Indians, striving to reclaim the title which they had won in 2002, led 1-0 at the breather before the Myanmarese drew level nine minutes from time through Win Nawng before a modest gathering at the Thong Nhat Stadium, according to information received here. But the sigh of relief on the faces of the Myanmarese officials and players was short-lived as the wily Prakash netted the decisive goal only two minutes later to give India full points from the group A match. The Myanmarese, who had suffered a 0-5 humiliation against Vietnam in their first game on August 20, put up an improved performance against the Indians, but that wasnt enough. Prakashs telling 83rd-minute blow made their efforts fruitless, according to information received here. The result ensured Indias passage into the last four along with the hosts. Myanmar are now out of the six-nation tournament after losing both their matches in the three-member group. The group winners will now be decided on August 24 when India clash with the hosts, on what promises to be an exciting contest.  (PTI)  Copyright

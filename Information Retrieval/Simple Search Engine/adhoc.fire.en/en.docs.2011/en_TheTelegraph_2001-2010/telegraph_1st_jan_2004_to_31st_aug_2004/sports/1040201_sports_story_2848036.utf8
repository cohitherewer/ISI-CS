The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, February 01, 2004  The professional opinion 
 FROM HONKY DORY				 										Mumbai, Jan. 31: Most professionals here agreed that the year 2004 Indian Derby is the most open one with half a dozen horses in with a chance of winning. The following are the opinions of those who matter:				 										Trainers				 										D. Byramji: Psychic Flame has travelled very well and she selects herself on her Calcutta classic form.				 										B. Chenoy: Simply Supreme and Estonia are the two form horses. The race is between the two.				 										S. Jilla: With 62 kg on his back Simply Supreme trounced the field. He has shown great improvement this season.				 										C. Katrak: My two fillies Estonia and Londoner have been producing				 										consistent form over the months. I give a slight edge to Estonia.				 										I. Sait: Simply Supreme is the horse to beat.				 										Vinayak: Artois ran poorly in his first start this season but he was badly ridden in the Ruia Cup. With little luck he may win.				 										S. Zadmal: Dont count out my filly Sprungli. Ignore her last run. She is a thorough stayer.				 										Jockeys				 										N. McCullagh: Forget about his recent failures. Artois is almost near his Pune form.				 										M. Narredu: The race is strictly between K. N. Dhunjibhoys two horses Artois and Estonia. I hope, I have not made a mistake of selecting Estonia ahead of Artois.				 										C. Rajendra: Luck favouring, Londoner may win the fourth Derby in as many weeks.				 										P. Shroff: Watching the tapes, I was impressed by the fashion of Psychic Flames victory.

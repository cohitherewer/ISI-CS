 Lalithakumara regains crown
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  B.G.Lalithakumara with the trophy after winning the all-India amateur golf meet at the RCGC on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: B.G. Lalithakumara of Sri Lanka demolished South African Matthew Kent in the final of the Eveready 103rd all-India amateur golf championship at the RCGC on Sunday. The 25-year-old Lalithakumara was in amazing form, winning by seven holes with six to spare in the 36-hole final to reclaim the premier amateur title of the region, which he had won in 2001 in Chandigarh. The Sri Lankan made a double bogey, but was still five-under for the 30 holes he played. Kent birdied the opening hole to go one up. But Lalithakumara replied with a birdie putt to restore parity on the next. Kent went ahead again on the sixth as the Lankan made a bogey, but it was even soon when the South African youngster bogied the very next hole. The stalemate continued till the 12th hole. Lalithakumara cut loose at this stage. On the long and difficult 13th, he sank a massive 35-feet putt for a birdie to go one up and increased the lead when Kent bogied the next. Lalithakumara went three up when he birdied the 16th. There was no stopping Lalithakumara in the afternoon session. He increased the lead further when Kent lost the third and fifth with bogies. A birdie on the sixth virtually settled the issue. After making a double bogey on the eighth, Lalithakumara closed the match by winning the tenth and 11th holes with birdies. This is one of the happiest moments of my career. It is even more satisfying for me because I have played some very good golf this week, said the Colombo-based player.  Copyright

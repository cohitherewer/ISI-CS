The Telegraph - Calcutta
My pick is Roger Federer
Serve amp; Volley Naresh KumarThis article was written before the start of the Wimbledon ChampionshipsIts Wimbledon time once again. The Old Lady of SW19, as Wimbledon is affectionately called, has been dolled up for the Championships. Ten thousand petunias and 3500 hydrangeas, the ivy-covered Centre Court, the manicured grasscourts with the scent of freshly-mowed grass, the colourful hospitality tents create a unique soul-stirring ambience for tennis lovers.The reigning champion, top-seeded Roger Federer, and second-seeded Andy Roddick are the strongest contenders. Both have won Grand Slams and are at their very best on fast surfaces. Of the two, I prefer the chances of Federer who has a fluent net-attack and a more balanced game.Roddick is more comfortable at the baseline, has a big serve, very powerful forehand, but isnt a natural volleyer. He may have the fastest serve in the world, but the same job can be done by a serve 20 mph slower but accurately placed. On grasscourts, specially at Wimbledon, the ability to attack at the net is of paramount importance. This could tilt the balance in Federers favour.The danger in Federers quarter of the draw could come from the unpredictable giant Russian Safin, who has to tackle ninth-seeded Spaniard Carlos Moya and Hewitt before finding a spot in the quarters. Hewitt has been struggling to find form and is a shadow of the Hewitt who won Wimbledon in 2002. His shouts or, should I say, screams of come on are not evoking any discernible response from his tired body.In the semi-finals, Federer could meet Ferrero, the sixth-seeded Spaniard, or Grosjean of France, the 10th seed. Ferrero is at his best on claycourts, and may not have fully recovered from his injuries. He will find it very difficult to beat Grosjean, a most under-rated player. In the top half of the draw, all seem to be well within Federers compass, but for the unpredictable Safin who, on his day, can beat anybody.In the lower half of the draw Henman, who is being hailed by the British press as a possible winner after his great performance at the French championships, has a tough draw. Henman is seeded to meet last years runner-up Philippoussis in the round-of-16. Free from injury and at the top of his form, nobody would like to take on Philippoussis at Wimbledon.A win over Philippoussis would put Henman up against fourth seed Nalbandian, runner-up in 2002, a testing rock-solid opponent who held a match-point against Roddick in the semis of the US Open last year. Waiting in the semi-finals for Henman will be Roddick who does not have any dangerous floaters or seeds in his quarter of the draw. But British hopes are higher than ever before and the sporting public would do well to fasten their seat belts for yet another roller-coaster ride this year. At the end of the fortnight, I expect a Federer-Roddick final  a clash to look forward to  with Federer retaining his title.In the ladies draw, the absence of Henin-Hardenne and Clijsters and the suspect fitness of the William sisters have reduced the event to a farce. No. 5 seed Davenport, champion in 1999 and runner-up to Venus Williams in 2000, has also been struggling with injuries.Mauresmo and Capriati, who are experienced Grand Slam-level performers, have both come back from injuries. They were playing well and progressing satisfactorily in the French Open, but then flopped badly against the robust Russians. The question is, have they been able to hone their games to match-winning sharpness? Or will the confidence the young Russians Myskina, seeded No. 2, and Dementieva, seeded No. 6, are bound to have gained after the French Open prove to be too much for them. Mauresmo has an all-court game and should play well on grassHaving said all this, I am still inclined to favour the Williams sisters. Especially Serena, who is so far ahead of the field that she could keep everyone at bay even with niggling injuries and lack of enough match-practice. Venus, in the lower half of the draw, could contain Myskina at the French Open Champion and make 2004 the third consecutive year the William sisters play each other in the final. Their matches are of a high standard but the public find their clashes boring.If the Russians want to succeed at Wimbledon, it would help greatly if they could attack and volley more. They all have powerful groundshots but lack power on the serve. Of the others, French No. 1 Mauresmo has a beautiful all-court game, is a natural volleyer who should play well on grass. Unfortunately, she is in Serenas half of the draw, else, at her best may have made it to the final. Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Korean disrupts China monopoly
 - Ukrainian woman wrestler makes history Athens: South Koreas Ryu Seung-min upset Wang Hao on Monday to win the mens table tennis singles gold and disrupt Chinas Olympic domination in the sport. Ryu won 11-3, 9-11, 11-9, 11-9, 11-13, 11-9 in a thrilling final to become the first Korean to win the title since Yoo Nam-kyu at Seoul in 1988 when the sport was included at the Olympics for the first time. Even though I won, I have to admit that Wang is a better player than I am, Ryu said. Its just that he was under a lot more pressure than I was. Chinese head coach Liu Guoliang said Wang had crumbled under the huge weight of public expectation. Wang was unconcerned, saying his loss did not change the fact that China remained the worlds best table tennis team. We won all the (four) golds in 1996, we won all the (four) golds in 2000 and we won three golds here, so we are still the strongest and most invincible team, Wang said. Earlier, compatriot and world No. 1 Wang Liqin took the bronze medal play-off against experienced Swede Jan-Ove Waldner, who was making his last appearance at the Olympics at age 38. The Chinese won 10-12, 11-3, 11-8, 11-7, 11-9 to deny Waldner, who won gold in Barcelona and silver in Sydney, a full set of medals. Waldner, who has been to all five Olympics where table tennis has been included, said: It would have been fun to have won the bronze but life goes on. Im going to rest for a while, then start training again in September. I will compete at next years world championships but Im not going to take part in the 2008 Olympics. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), fearing Chinas domination was unhealthy for the sport, changed the rules in Athens so that players from the same country could not meet in the final. ITTF president Adham Sharara announced on Monday that there would be more changes for Beijing, but denied they were being introduced to end Chinese domination. All the changes were made in order to render table tennis more attractive and more modern, Sharara said. They were by no means against Chinese players. Ukraines Irini Merleni made history by winning the first ever female wrestling Olympic title on Monday. She won a thrilling contest against Japans Chiharu Icho to take the womens freestyle 48kg class. Merleni, 22, jumped into the arms of the mat referee after three minutes of added time to the mandatory six-minute bout before a judges decision awarded her the gold. Patricia Miranda of the US took the bronze beating Frances Angelique Berthenet. Kaori Icho of Japan won the womens freestyle wrestling 63kg gold beating US Sara McMann. Japan had a second title when Saori Yoshida won a clear-cut decision over Canadas Tonya Verbeek to take the womens freestyle 55kg class. The US won the softball gold beating Australia 5-1 on two home runs from Crystl Bustos and masterful pitching from Lisa Fernandez. The win in Athens marked the third-straight Olympic title for them. Yao Ming led China to one of the biggest upsets in mens Olympic basketball history on Monday, netting 27 points as his team beat Serbia and Montenegro 67-66 to knock the world champions out of the tournament.

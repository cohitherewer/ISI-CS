The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif to be summoned next week 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  The disciplinary committee will first study Latifs tapes, says Rameez Rawalpindi: Former captain Rashid Latif, who alleged that last months fourth ODI in Lahore was fixed, will probably be summoned by the Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCBs) disciplinary committee next week. Pakistan lost that match by five wickets. The three-member committee is headed by Justice (retd) Amir Alam Khan, with Maqbool Elahi Malik and former Test player Mohammed Nazir (Jr) being the other members. Latif has forwarded some tapes, containing a recording of his controversial TV programme... They have been sent to the committee and, once studied, Latif is going to be summoned. I reckon that will be next week, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph. Meanwhile, according to Rameez, international fixtures are going to be moved out of the Pindi Cricket Stadium  which isnt in the PCBs control  and allotted to the facility that will come up in neighbouring Islamabad. Its going to be exclusively for cricket  like Multan  and should be ready within two years. The construction, by the way, will begin soon after this series, Rameez added. One hopes the similarity with Multan wont extend to poor crowds as well.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cornered Bagan eye full points
 - Aloke looking up to strikers vs Vasco Margao: Goan heavyweights Vasco take on Calcutta giants Mohun Bagan in a crucial National Football League (NFL) match at the Nehru Stadium here on Friday. Neither team is in the hunt for the coveted crown. In fact, the spectre of relegation hangs loosely over both. Vasco, who have 20 points from 17 matches, are currently in eighth position in the 12-team competition, while Mohun Bagan (19) are in ninth spot. Indian Bank will certainly be relegated, the other team to be demoted is still to be identified. Full points for either team on Friday will help Vasco or Mohun Bagan to breathe that much easier. Mohun Bagan are in this predicament because they have managed just one win in their six second-leg matches. Their morale is understandably at a low ebb and Aloke Mukherjees men will have to raise their game a couple of notches if they are to buck the trend. The Mohun Bagan coach blamed the teams poor performance squarely on his forwards. The inability of our strikers to find the target let us down in many of our matches they have to improve, he added. Our team has been playing well all along, but somehow we have not been able to convert the clear chances that have come our way. Even our reliable striker Ashim Biswas, who usually does not miss too much, has struggled to score. Mukherjee also mentioned the Jose Ramirez Barreto factor. His absence has made a difference. Luck has not been favouring us many balls have hit the woodwork. The Mohun Bagan coach said. If we lose, we will be under tremendous pressure to avoid relegation. We have to go all out for a win, Mukherjee said, adding that he would effect some changes from the team that lost 1-2 to Dempo the other day.  (PTI)  Copyright

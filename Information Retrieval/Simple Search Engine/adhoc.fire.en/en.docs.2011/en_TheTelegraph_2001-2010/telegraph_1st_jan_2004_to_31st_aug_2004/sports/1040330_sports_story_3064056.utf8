 ICC to probe Murali action
London: As the controversy over Muttiah Muralidharans bowling action began afresh, the ICC on Monday announced the commissioning of a special team to look into the spinners action. The ICC admitted that the issue, particularly with regard to slow bowlers, needs to be probed further. This report has been made based on concerns relating to a specific delivery, not the entire bowling action of the player, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said. (PTI)  Copyright

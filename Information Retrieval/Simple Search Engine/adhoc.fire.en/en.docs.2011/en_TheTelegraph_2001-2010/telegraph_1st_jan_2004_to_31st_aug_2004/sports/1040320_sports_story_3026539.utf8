The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Trouble averted
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Peshawar: Not that it was anything significant, but the third ODI saw the first hint of crowd trouble, if it can be called so, in this series. Ramesh Powar, fielding near the boundary ropes, was hit on his leg by an object during the 34th over of the Pakistan innings. The off-spinner promptly reported the matter to skipper Sourav Ganguly who spoke to the umpires. All the players assembled in the middle of the field before the umpires spoke to security personnel over the walkie-talkie and gave the necessary assurance. Only then did the players retreat to their positions. Its very insignificant, Team Indias chief security liaison officer, IG Yashovardhan Azad told The Telegraph. A 6,000 strong police force was present at the stadium on Friday.  Copyright

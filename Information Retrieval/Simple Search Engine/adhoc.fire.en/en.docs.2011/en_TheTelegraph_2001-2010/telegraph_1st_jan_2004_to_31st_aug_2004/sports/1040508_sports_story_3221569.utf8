The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Prasanna thanks Murali for reviving art of spin
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Prasanna also lauds Warnes effort Calcutta: Muttiah Muralidharan and Shane Warne have revived the spinners role in cricket and made everyone sit up and take notice. This, Erapalli Prasanna feels, has been the sports biggest gain from Muralidharan equalling Courtney Walshs world record of 519 Test wickets. The Australian is on 517. I am delighted spinners can now be placed on a par with fast bowlers. That spinners are setting targets for pacers is highly satisfying, Prasanna told The Telegraph on Friday. It caused a lot of pain to hear that spinners have no role to play in modern cricket. People started saying cricket lacks quality spinners. Its a matter of great pride that Murali and Warnes achievements will be widely talked about now, he added. The legendary off-spinner feels the Sri Lankans biggest asset is his ability to turn the ball on any surface. Murali is a big turner of the ball and his strength lies there. His ability to maintain an excellent length also comes in handy. The moment he fails to turn the ball, he finds things difficult to handle. An example that comes to mind is the 1999 World Cup tie against India at Taunton where India made 373. He was getting little help from the conditions and Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid made merry, Prasanna pointed out. Muralidharan has achieved an awesome success rate (519 wickets in his 89th Test) because he has been awesome in the middle overs. When the opening bowlers have failed, Murali has changed the complexion of a match. He gets a longer spell and can bowl more frequently at the batsman. There are not many strike bowlers with Sri Lanka  its either Chaminda Vaas or Murali and the offie makes sure the opportunity is not wasted. During our days, it was always three spinners bowling in tandem and the spoils were shared. That was one of the reasons why we were left around the 250 mark. Alternatively, Lance Gibbs 309 victims spoke volumes of his capabilities in the golden era of West Indies pacers, he said. Prasanna, who respects Muralis bowling and his achievements, regards Subhas Gupte as the best ever.  Prasanna says Murali makes every opportunity countMurali is the best off-spinner in his era, but Gupte will remain the all-time great among spinners. A leg-spinner of his class will never be born again, Prasanna said. He is not in favour of comparing cricketers of different eras. The game has changed and the parameters are entirely different. You cant compare a Sunil Gavaskar with a Brian Lara. Prasanna feels Murali will set a mark which Warne has to chase. Their success is a reminder to followers of the game that spinners have a great role to play and will bring back memories of the past. The spinners role will be taken more seriously. Indian cricket will also gain from it, he hopes. The BCCIs role will also be important and must not end with the much-hyped launch of the spinners wing at the NCA. There have been three meetings but nothing beyond that. Im still waiting for it to take off.  Copyright

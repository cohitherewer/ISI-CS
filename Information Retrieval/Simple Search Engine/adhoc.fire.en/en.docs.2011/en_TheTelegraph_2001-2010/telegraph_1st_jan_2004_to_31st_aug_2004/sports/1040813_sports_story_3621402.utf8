Athens: Spains Olympic basketball players were forced to train with their shirts and shorts inside out on Thursday due to a dispute over logos. The Spaniards turned up with kit covered in the logos of team sponsors who had not paid to be part of the central Olympic sponsorship system. Olympic officials made them reverse it to hide the logos from photographers recording the open session. Some players, seemingly in response to the Athens heat as much as the official ruling, chose to play bare-chested instead.Athens: Greece called on Britain on Wednesday to use the occasion of the Athens Olympics to promise to return the Elgin Marbles. The Olympics are starting now and we would very much like a commitment for their return, said culture ministry official Elena Korka.				 																																	In London, no British officials were available for comment, but Britains line has always been it has no plans to hand back the 5th century BC masterpieces that were taken from the Parthenon temple by Thomas Bruce, the Earl of Elgin, in 1803. Athens: Australias swimming stars Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett are to put their feet up  on doctors orders. Team doctor Brian Sando has advised athletes competing in the first few days of the Athens Olympics not to march in Fridays opening ceremony. He said it would be unwise for them to stand for long periods over what would be an eight-hour exercise.Athens: US swimmer Larsen Jensen can become an overnight millionaire aged 18 if he can beat Australian distance champ Grant Hackett at the Olympics.				 																																	Its a tall order. World record-holder Hacketts best over 1,500m freestyle is more than 20 seconds ahead of Jensen, his nearest rival. That world record is just insane, says the American.				 																																	USA Swimming put up the seven-figure sum as the ultimate incentive to break Australias lock on the event but will only pay up if Jensen, or another American, can win the gold and set a world record in the process.				 																																	Hackett, who won gold in Sydney over 1500, was told about the cash carrot on Tuesday and said he would hand over the money to charity in a similar position.

 Lack of sponsors hurting Advani
 Advani, though, is appreciative of SAI and Union govt Bangalore: Last year when Pankaj Advani returned home after winning the IBSF world snooker championship, he was given a heros welcome, accolades pouring in from all quarters. One thought then that corporate sponsorship would come in good measure to promote the teenage sensations career at the international level. But several months later, there isnt any to speak of. The Bangalore boy, who has big dreams, is beginning to stare at stark reality  his plans to enter the professional circuit is in jeopardy. I am hurt at the response to a world title and I just thought that the response would be better, Advani said. Advani said he has to go to England five times in a year to participate in as many tournaments, perform well in them, get a certain amount of ranking and points which would enable him to enter the professional circuit. These five tournaments  called the Challenge Tour  are not back-to-back, taking place in September, December, January, February and May. Each trip is estimated to cost around Rs 5 lakh. Training itself is a huge expenditure, Advani says. While the 18-year-old is appreciative of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and the Central Government for giving him grants to go abroad and participate in world and Asian championships, he still requires corporate sponsorship as far as professional engagements are concerned. There has to be some corporate sponsorship... Some involvement from companies. Otherwise, I may not be able to take my career further as far as professional ranking is concerned, he says. With companies not coming forward to support him, Advani is now planning to knock at the door of corporate houses himself. I am trying to approach companies now for sponsorship and for endorsements. I just hope it works out. I just hope people would respond in a much more positive way. That way at least the sport should be encouraged. Today we say we want to win an Olympics gold medal... The day we feel that we can win an Olympic medal is only when that encouragement comes in terms of cash awards and incentives. Advani said its not true that India is not performing well in any sports. We have been doing well in snooker and billiards, shooting, badminton and chess. India has also won as many 17 world titles as well as ten Asian crowns in snooker and billiards, he reminded. While there is no taking away credit from cricketers who have been performing well, at the same time I feel that performance in sports like ours, badminton, chess and shooting needs to be looked at in terms of sponsorship, Advani said. Whats due and entitled to us, we should get. Then we feel happy and motivated to perform better. I see no reason why the corporate world should not come forward and extend sponsorship to sports like these. At least achievers should be supported. Its true that cricket sells but you also have to look at the bigger picture. Today, if Indian sports has to flourish, all sports must be given equal encouragement. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Switzerland stalwart hangs up boots
Lisbon: Three senior Swiss players, including long-serving striker Stephane Chapuisat, announced their international retirement Tuesday following the teams elimination from Euro 2004. Chapuisat, goalkeeper and captain Joerg Stiel and midfielder Fabio Celestini are making way for a new generation headed by 18-year-old striker Johann Vonlanthen, whose goal in Mondays 1-3 defeat by France made him the youngest goalscorer at a European Championship. After a dismal tournament that produced two defeats and a 0-0 draw with Croatia, just one goal and a series of disciplinary problems, the Swiss football association (ASF) needs to make a fresh start. Top of their agenda will be to deal quickly with the furore surrounding claims that striker Alexander Frei spat at Englands Steven Gerrard. The Uefa, which had originally cleared Frei of spitting, Monday gave him a provisional 15-day suspension and will hold an appeal hearing in July to deal with his case. He did not tell us the truth and we cannot tolerate this kind of behaviour from any of our players, said ASF president Ralph Zloczower, adding that since the case was still pending his organisation would take no action against Frei until Uefas appeals body completed its job. Freis behaviour, his withdrawal from the squad that played France, and the red cards shown to Johann Vogel and Bernt Haas overshadowed flashes of promise shown by Koebi Kuhns youngsters. It has been a very good experience for the younger players and we will be much stronger from it for 2008, said Kuhn.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 For us, the meet actually begins today: Sourav
	 - An Asia Cup Special From The Telegraph - The Indian And Pakistani Captains Unwind Exclusively In Colombo  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Colombo, July 24: By his own admission, Sourav Ganguly has become quieter (I get less excited) but, equally, the Team India leadership is now a job with no breaks. The countrys most successful Test captain was in a reflective mood last evening, when The Telegraph interacted with him for well over half-an-hour at his Taj Samudra suite. The following are excerpts Q For Team India, the halfway stage of sorts has been reached in the Asia Cup... What are your thoughts? A That, for us, the tournament actually begins with the match against Pakistan... That we must focus on one game at a time... Given everything associated with an Indo-Pak match, how will the nerves be controlled? By not talking of the additional pressure, by treating it as just another game. Is there one lesson from the last series (in Pakistan) which could be handy this time? Yes  the need to be disciplined. After all the controversy and the questioning of his commitment in the last Indo-Pak match (Rawalpindi Test), are you expecting Shoaib Akhtar to explode? Look, where Im concerned, Shoaib was the best on view when we toured Pakistan... To speak of you as a batsman, it has been ages since you last posted a one-day hundred... One big reason is that Ive not been opening... Ive been coming down in the teams interests... (After a pause) Be it in Test cricket or ODIs, Ive reached a stage where I should peak... I expect to be at my best between now and the next couple of years. [Souravs last ODI hundred, his 22nd, was the unbeaten 111 in the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Kenya.] Specifically, where do you need to improve? Ive never regarded myself as being a 100 per cent technically correct batsman... Having said that, Ive got strengths which many others dont. Essentially, then, Ive got to work on the weak areas and keep scoring off my strengths. Obviously, youre conscious of averages and records... I wont pretend otherwise but, at the end of the day, everything falls into place if you play well and are consistent. Moreover, cricket is a team sport and the final judgement rests on how the team fares. To talk of captaincy, whats your own take on the last four years? I was definitely excited when I got the captaincy (March 2000) and my priority was for India to be successful... Today, we do need to go forward even more but, at least, weve taken significant strides. The dressing-room then had two-three former captains. What was your message? I didnt have a problem handling anybody... I made two points: That the team comes first and, as important, we need to win at any cost but within the laws. Back in March 2000, what was your understanding of captaincy? That, to be a good captain, I must have a good team... That bit hasnt changed and, probably, wont ever. Frankly, how long did it take you to settle down? (Grins) A year... I felt absolutely comfortable only after we beat Australia in the 2000-01 series at home. Isnt it a blessing in disguise that the match-fixing controversy broke just weeks into your captaincy, eventually cleaning the dressing-room? I wouldnt like to comment. But, surely, youve been fortunate to have the Sachin Tendulkars and the Rahul Dravids for company... Indeed, as I told you in Pakistan, its because of their support that the Team India concept has grown... Whats your style of captaincy? Im pretty open, dont have a closed mind... I invite suggestions, keep the players involved... Thats the best way to go forward. In the first couple of years, did you discuss captaincy with any of the former captains? With Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri... Even Wasim Akram, in the 2000 ICC KnockOut in Nairobi. What did they tell you? Gavaskar pointed out its a hard job and that I should be patient... Shastri suggested I remain aggressive and not get into a defensive mode... Akram, if I recall properly, said I must enjoy captaincy... You always had a high regard for Steve Waugh. Did you, at any time, learn anything about captaincy from him? As a batsman, yes, but not as captain. After all, he always had a great side at his disposal. Is there a contemporary captain who has influenced you? I admire Stephen Fleming, the way he leads and the way he conducts himself on and off the field. A captain, I suppose, should be judged by results only? Not entirely. Why? Because the result is dependent on the contribution of others as well. Whats been the toughest decision youve had to make? Leaving out Anil Kumble... Each time that I had to do so in the past... From last season, of course, he has perhaps been at his best. Dropping Akash Chopra in the Rawalpindi Test? Wasnt as difficult a decision. What have been the most satisfying moments? (Grins again) Beating Pakistan in Pakistan, playing very well in Australia and making the 2003 World Cup final. Who is the one player to have made the most progress in the past four years? Dravid... Has become tougher in the mind... Then, more recently, Veeru (Virender Sehwag) has improved tremendously. And, who has disappointed the most? (After a somewhat lengthy pause) Nobody. Well, how does a team improve? Improvement is assured once everybody realises there are more steps to climb. We already have the self-belief, the confidence... Now, its all about going forward. The last question: Youve turned 32 this month... Have you begun to think of life after cricket? (Laughs) Hopefully, I wont have to think of another career for the next five years... After that, well... Theres the family business, but I may also keep myself busy with something in cricket.  On being Bengals hottest brand: Its a nice feeling, feels good...  On his prescription for Bengal: Get industry back, get fresh investment.  On the ills hurting Calcutta: Look, one cant avoid traffic snarls and so on... After all, look at the population and look at the population which is mobile... The city, though, has to go forward and must be counted as a destination.  Copyright

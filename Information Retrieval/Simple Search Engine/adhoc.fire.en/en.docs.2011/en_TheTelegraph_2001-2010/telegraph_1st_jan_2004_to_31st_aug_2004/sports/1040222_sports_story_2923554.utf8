 Afridi among probables
Karachi, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Allrounder Shahid Afridi, out of favour for nearly a year, was recalled among Pakistan probables today for next months series against India. Afridi was brought back along with Imran Nazir, Saleem Elahi and Naved Latif. The four replace Faisal Iqbal, Asim Kamal, Shadab Kabir and Bazid Khan in a 22-member probables list. Afridi, who has played 14 Test matches and 176 one-dayers, last represented Pakistan in a World Cup pool match against India at Centurion on March 1, 2003. We have called up these four players for the training camp in Lahore since they are specialist one-day players, chief selector Wasim Bari said. Bari added that selection of the Test squad for the India series would be made at a later date, based on performances during the one-dayers and also in Pakistan domestic cricket. The training camp for Pakistan cricketers would begin at the Gaddafi Stadium from February 24 while the squad for the one-day Internationals would be announced in the first week of March. THE PROBABLES Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Imran Farhat, Taufeeq Umar, Yasir Hameed, Yusuf Youhana, Shahid Afridi, Imran Nazir, Naved Latif, Saleem Elahi, Misbah-Ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Saqlain Mushtaq, Danish Kaneria, Moin Khan (wicketkeeper), Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Umar Gul, Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan, Rao Iftikhar.

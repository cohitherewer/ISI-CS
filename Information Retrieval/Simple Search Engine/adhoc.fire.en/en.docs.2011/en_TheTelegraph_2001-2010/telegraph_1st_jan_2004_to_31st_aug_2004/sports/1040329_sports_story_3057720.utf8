 Saha saves United
	 - EUROPEAN ROUND-UP  Chelseas Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink shoots the ball past Wolverhampton Wanderers Lee Naylor to score his 102nd goal for his club during their Premier League tie on Saturday. (AP) London: Substitute Louis Saha grabbed a dramatic late equaliser for Manchester United as the champions held Premier League leaders Arsenal to a 1-1 draw at Highbury Sunday. Arsenal looked to be cruising to victory after a spectacular 25-m strike by Thierry Henry in the 50th minute, only for fellow French striker Saha to poach an equaliser with four minutes to go. The draw dented Arsenals title hopes as a previous nine-point lead over Chelsea, who crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 5-2 on Saturday, withered to seven points. Arsenal, who meet United again next weekend in an FA Cup semi-final, now lead on 74 points, with Chelsea on 67 and United third on 62 with eight games left in the season. Consolation for Arsenal was establishing a record 30-match unbeaten start to a season in the English top-flight. Deportivo scrape through Meanwhile, in the Spanish League a last-minute own goal gifted Deportivo Coruna a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday, lifting them to third in the Primera Liga and soothing memories of the 1-4 Champions League thrashing by AC Milan. Deportivos second consecutive victory moved them a point ahead of in-form Barcelona, who visit Real Betis next. (Reuters)  Copyright

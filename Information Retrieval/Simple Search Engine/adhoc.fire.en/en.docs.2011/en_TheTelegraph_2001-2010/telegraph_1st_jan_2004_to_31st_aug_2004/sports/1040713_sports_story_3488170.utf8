The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Boycott praise for Akash Chopra
 Boycott Bangalore: Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott said on Monday that Akash Chopra had done well as a Test opener but needed to improve his average to make a strong claim for a permanent berth in the national squad. Akash Chopra has played well. I think he has really played well for the team. He has seen the new ball off and he has given the team a good start. He tired out the fast bowlers but has done nothing for himself, Boycott said. Boycott, who is here to give tips to India A players and under-19 trainees of the National Cricket Academy (NCA), said Chopra had not gone on and made bigger scores for himself. So, I have to find ways to get him to improve his batting average in Test cricket. He is a good player, the Yorkshireman said. The former opener and India A coach Sandeep Patil also interacted with the players as the week-long preparatory camp, ahead of the twin tours of Zimbabwe and Kenya, began here. Because of rain, they confined themselves indoors. Boycott felt India stood a good chance of beating Australia at home in the Test series later this year but warned of a strike back by Ricky Ponting and his men who he said would be keen to avenge their defeat in 2001. India can beat Australia later this year. If everybody is fit there is a good chance of beating them but it wont be easy. The Aussies are very keen to avenge their last defeat. They are pretty upset about it, Boycott added. Although Boycott described Indias drawn series against Australia Down Under last season as quite good, he said India were a bit lucky that Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath were not in action. But the win in Pakistan was excellent. Boycott described Sourav Ganguly as a very good captain who handles his players and is pulling them together, he is quite strong mentally. He rated Anil Kumble as the third best spinner in the world after Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan and placed Harbhajan Singh in the fourth spot. After that (four spots) there is a big gap, there is dearth of quality spinners in the world.  (PTI)  Copyright

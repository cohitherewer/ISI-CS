The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zidane decision by fortnight
Paris: Zinedine Zidane says he will decide whether to carry on playing for France before their opening 2006 World Cup qualifier against Israel in Paris on September 4. The Real Madrid playmaker met new France coach Raymond Domenech over lunch in the Spanish capital on Wednesday and said he still needed one week or two to make up his mind. I talked with Domenech and I gave him my point of view. I said what I had to say. He explained to me what his plans were, Zidane said. We are going to have another meeting soon to sort out what my future will be. I have not made up my mind yet. It may take one week or two. (Reuters)  Copyright

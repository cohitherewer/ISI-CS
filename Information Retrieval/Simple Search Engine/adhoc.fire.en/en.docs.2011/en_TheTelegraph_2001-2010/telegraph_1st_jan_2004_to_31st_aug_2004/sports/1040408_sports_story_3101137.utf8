 Baljit: Squad shouldve been ready 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Baljit Singh Dhillon, who feels a fitness trainer should be imported for the Indian team, at practice at the CC amp;FC on Wednesday. Calcutta: India international Baljit Singh Dhillon feels the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) should have finalised the Athens Olympics squad by now. Like the other countries, the IHF should have had the shortlist ready rather than still experimenting with the seniors and juniors, Dhillon said at the CC amp;FC ground on Wednesday after starring in Punjab Polices 5-0 win over Bombay XI. Dhillon hasnt found a berth in the India squad to take part in the double-leg, four-nation meet scheduled in Australia later this month. Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Sainis names, too, are missing. Though Dhillon hasnt heard from the IHF on the logic of the exclusion, he feels its not a case of axing. I dont think I have been dropped I have been rested as they are on look-out for juniors for the forthcoming Olympics, he said. Dhillon is confident of competing in his third successive Olympics. He feels hell walk into the Athens squad on the strength of a brilliant performance in the Olympic qualifying meet in Madrid. Dhillon is optimistic of Indias chances in the Olympics. We should do well if experienced players like me, Dhanraj and Saini are in the side as we know what it takes to fare well in such a high-profile meet, he remarked. The experienced forward is of the opinion that a fitness trainer from abroad should be hired for the national hockey team, taking a leaf out of crickets book. We should have one from abroad as we have to face the challenge of Australians, Dutch and Spanish players who are extremely fit and more powerful than us, Dhillon said. The Indian team will leave for the assignment Down Under on April 12, with their first match being on April 15.  Copyright

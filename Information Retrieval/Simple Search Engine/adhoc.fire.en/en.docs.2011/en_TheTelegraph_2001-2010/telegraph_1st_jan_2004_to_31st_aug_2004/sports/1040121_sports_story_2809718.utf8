Centurion: South Africa snatched victory between showers on the fifth day of the fourth and final Test against the West Indies at Centurion Park on Tuesday. With this ten-wicket win, the home side wrapped up the series 3-0. Almost four hours of play was lost owing to rain, but South Africa claimed the last seven West Indies wickets for 85 runs. Then they knocked off the required 46 runs in just 3.4 overs. Shaun Pollock took four wickets and bowled unchanged through three brief periods of play. After claiming only one wicket in 64 overs yesterday, when rain and bad light stopped play, South Africa took three wickets in 22 balls before lunch on Tuesday. Two more wickets after lunch left the tourists precariously placed before it started raining again. Finally, with only 24 overs left for the day, the players returned after tea and South Africa wrapped up the West Indies innings. They did suffer some anxious moments as Corey Collymore and Fidel Edwards put on 26 runs in 29 minutes for the last wicket, with an ever-increasing likelihood that bad light might stop play. The floodlights were on throughout the day and were used on each of the five days of the match. Play started 100 minutes late but man of the series Makhaya Ntini, armed with the second new ball, gave South Africa an ideal start when he had Chris Gayle (107) caught at gully with the last ball of the fifth over. Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan put on a record 174 for the fourth wicket. Shaun Pollock trapped Sarwan leg before wicket in the next over for 119 before Ntini bowled Dwayne Smith out for a duck. Sarwan equalled his previous highest Test score made against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2002/03, before he went back on his stumps against Pollock, played across the line and was adjudged lbw by umpire Srinivas Venkataraghavan. Replays suggested the ball would probably have gone over the top of the stumps. Smith tried an extravagant drive against Ntini and was bowled between bat and pad. He became Ntinis 29th victim of the series, equalling Pollocks record for most wickets in a series against the West Indies set in a five-Test contest in 1998/99. Tail-ender Mervyn Dillon took an aggressive approach and hit 29 with some lusty strokes before he was caught at first slip off Pollock. The West Indian tail wagged a little as Collymore and Edwards started playing shots. The latter slammed Pollock for a six over midwicket before he was yorked by Andre Nel. Though the light was poor and with a hint of drizzle in the air, Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs went on the offensive. Smith scored 21 off 17 balls and Gibbs eight off six. The match ended when Fidel Edwards bowled two successive wides that reached the boundary, costing five runs each. The first went over keeper Jacobs head and the second was fired down the leg-side.

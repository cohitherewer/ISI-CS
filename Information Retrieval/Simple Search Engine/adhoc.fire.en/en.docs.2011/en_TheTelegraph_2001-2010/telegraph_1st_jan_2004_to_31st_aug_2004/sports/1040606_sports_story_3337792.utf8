The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal out again
Dublin (Ohio), June 5 (Reuters): Calcutta pro Arjun Atwals poor form on the US PGA Tour continues. At the Memorial Tournament here Friday, he hit a low again failing to make it to the money rounds with an unimpressive total of 153, finishing tied at 96th place, with only four players who finished the rounds below him. That was while Britains Justin Rose double bogeyed the last hole to fall back into a share of the lead with Stephen Ames of Trinidad and Tobago and Ben Curtis after Rose fired a five-under-par 67 for a seven-under total of 137 at Muirfield Village.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rach, Tirkey yet to give up hope
 - India face New Zealand today - William Xalco ruled out of Games  SUJIT BHAR  Indias Deepak Thakur (right) celebrates with teammates after scoring against Australia during their pool B match in Athens on Thursday. India lost 3-4. (AFP) Athens: Indias last-minute loss to Australia on Thursday has pushed the hockey semi-finals to a rather bleak distance at the Olympic Games. However, neither coach Gerhard Rach nor skipper Dilip Tirkey was willing to say that the action is over here. Turkey said: We still have a very good chance of making the semis. Look, Australia have tough matches in South Africa (Saturday) and Holland. Holland are the best team around, so... But even against South Africa, I dont believe the Aussies will have a walkover. We have played South Africa and found them to be pretty tough. Coach Rach also remains hopeful of further progress. India, who come up against New Zealand on Saturday, have a bit of a problem. They will miss the experience of William Xalco. He hurt his right thumb and it has been diagnosed as a fracture. He will not be able to participate in the rest of the tournament. His absence is sure to come as a big blow to the Indians. India have won one and lost two, while the Aussies have won two and drawn one. Hence India will have to win both their matches now (the other is versus Argentina) and wait for a favourable result. The problem for India is what Rach had pointed out earlier  that India start play on the last pool match-day half an hour before the Aussies take to the field versus Holland. The Dutch are through with three consecutive wins. If they (Australia) need a draw then, well, they will be knowing our result before they finish their match... Rach did not complete the sentence. For all practical purposes, India go out Saturday for pride only.  Copyright

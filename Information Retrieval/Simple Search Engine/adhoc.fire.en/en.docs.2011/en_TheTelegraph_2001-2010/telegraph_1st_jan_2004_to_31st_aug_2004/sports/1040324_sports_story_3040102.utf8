The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Poll cloud over EBs May 5 tie
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal have enjoyed a smooth run in the AFC Cup so far. But with the Lok Sabha polls slated for May 10, the Calcutta Police has informed the IFA they cannot allow East Bengal to host their home match against Geylang United at the Salt Lake Stadium on May 5. This puts the India champions in some serious bother, because, as per AFC rules, the match cannot be rescheduled for another date. IFA, who are hosting the match on behalf of East Bengal, has started taking initiatives so that the match can be played on May 5 itself. Ive written to state sports minister requesting him to allow the game to be played at Salt Lake Stadium on that scheduled date, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said. Incidentally, the police wants the match to be played on May 1. See, this is a matter of national prestige and the state government had made exceptions earlier I hope they comply to our request, Dutta added. He, however, informed, if the police doesnt give the green signal, the ball will be entirely in East Bengals court. The AFC rules suggest that East Bengal will have to pay a hefty sum of $20,000 if they fail to host the match on the given date. Though, East Bengal secretary Kalyan Majumdar sounded clueless about the future procedure, another senior office-bearer informed it is impossible for the club to play the match in a venue outside the state. It can be noted that Mahindra United are playing their home matches in Goa. However, Howrah Stadium is an option which can be mulled if the situation goes completely out of hand.  Copyright

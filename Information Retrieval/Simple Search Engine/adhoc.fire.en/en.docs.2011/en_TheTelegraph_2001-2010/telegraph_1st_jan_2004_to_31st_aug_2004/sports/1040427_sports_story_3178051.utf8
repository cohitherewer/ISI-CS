 Lewis tempted by Klitschko challenge
 - Briton can add melodrama by claiming that he wants to surpass Ali in the number of times he has reclaimed his belt  FROM PAUL HAYWARD IN LOS ANGELES  Vitali Klitschko says he has never fought anyone as tough as Lewis Lennox Lewis is on his way out of retirement for a rematch with Vitali Klitschko. This was the inescapable conclusion when Lewis strode out of the arena and straight to the new champions dressing room after Klitschko had battered Corrie Sanders to claim the World Boxing Council title in Los Angeles on Saturday night. Before he called on the new king of the division, Lewis conceded: The temptation is always there. I will talk to Lennox Lewis very shortly about the possibility of us fighting again, confirmed the first universally recognised white champion since Ingemar Johansson 45 years ago. There were so many questions in my mind when Lennox retired. Ive thought about it a lot. I was upset with his decision and many other people were too. I just hope Lennox makes a comeback. Bouncing on his chair in support of Sanders, whose face was minced by Klitschkos fists, Lewis displayed none of the emotional characteristics of the non-combatant.  Nor did he talk like one after Sanders had hobbled back to his corner with an ear so badly traumatised that he had to go directly to hospital to have it drained. Like Klitschko in the first Lewis fight here 10 months ago, his face was a riot of lacerations and bloody eruptions. His courage was depicted in splashes and squirts of red. In the moment of release, he fell into the compassionate embrace of the referee, Jon Schorle, who sensibly stopped the onslaught 2min 46secs into the eighth round of a crude but stormy and gripping bout. Lewis watched the conflagration, thinking that a $ 20 million pay-day against a flawed successor is a good incentive to get back in the gym. Realists will wonder whether the retirement of Britains first undisputed heavyweight nonpareil since Bob Fitzsimmons in 1897 was choreographed to add greater value to the reprise. Lewis-Klitschko II is worth far more financially now that the younger man is in possession of the premier belt. Lewis would be bidding to become a four-time leader of the heavyweight pack. Having recovered the WBCs waistband from Oliver McCall and Hasim Rahman (both of whom knocked him out) Lewis can add melodrama to a comeback by claiming that he wants to surpass Muhammad Ali in the number of times he has reclaimed his belt. Lewis-Klitschko is certainly unfinished business: a state of affairs that is anathema to boxing promoters and spectators. The dramatic tension arises from the fact Klitschko was ahead on all three judges scorecards when hideous gashes round his left eye compelled the referee to stop the first fight. For Klitschko, June 21 of last year brought an honourable and ambiguous defeat, though many of us at ringside felt that Lewis was beginning to break his opponents resolve and eventually would have brought him crashing to earth. A brave fighter and a likeable soul, Klitschko puts you in mind of the childrens film character, The Iron Giant. He is a stiff, upright, inflexible piston-puncher from the old Eastern European school, and his lack of agility, footwork and suppleness render him vulnerable to more athletic opponents. He admitted as much himself on Saturday night when he said: Ive never taken as many punches as I did against Lennox Lewis, and Ive never fought anyone as strong as him. The most salient footnote 10 months ago was that Lewis had trained for a less taxing engagement  against the Canadian, Kirk Johnson  and delivered himself to the ring weighing the heaviest of his 13-year professional career. All last week, Lewis looked an incongruous addition to the Sanders camp. To go from being the most dominant heavyweight since the young Mike Tyson (and before him, Larry Holmes) to the celebrity cheerleader for a 38-year-old journeyman who resembles a retired South African cricketer was just too big a drop. But Lewis still looks, acts and talks like a serving prize-fighter. After Sanders had broken apart under relentless bombardment, Lewis recalled the more promising moments of round one  the only one his new student won  and admitted: I was so excited when I jumped up I almost knocked myself out. In the rush to clarify his intentions, it was put to Lewis that he might be the one to complete the job Sanders started with his quick and troublesome left-hooks (the only weapon, really, in his armoury). One or two people are already talking to me about that, he smiled. Id have definitely taken him [Klitschko] out tonight. He praised Sanders for going out on his shield and on his feet and then sped away to re-establish contact with the victor in the first all-white major heavyweight title fight since Rocky Marciano roughed up the Englishman Don Cockell in May, 1955. The economics are simple. In the first WBC title fight post-Lewis retirement, Klitschko and Sanders fought for less than Ali and Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden more than 30 years ago. Before the enfeeblement of heavyweight boxing, Klitschko might have chosen to retain his title and enhance his wealth by knocking over challengers one by one. But these days nobody wants to watch the legion of obscure big men doing the rounds. So the rematch with Lewis starts to look like a financial imperative  though Klitschko also says he is hanging on to the boyhood dream of a fight against Mike Tyson. Yes, him again. Lewis is right to be encouraged by the evidence of Klitschkos susceptibility to skill and speed. It took him three rounds to work out how to cope with the hay makers Sanders was throwing with his left. In essence the new champion appeared easy to hit. Klitschko threw 413 punches to Sanders 229 and landed 230 to his rivals 51. But here was an opponent 20 months short of his 40th birthday  who has fought four times in the last three years and showed up for the biggest test of his career with a layer of flab wrapped round his upper body. He was a mediocre world title contender in a mediocre age  however brave he happened to be. So while the bumped up and belligerent ex-middleweight James Toney tries to muscle his way into the picture with frequent hijackings of press conferences and weigh-ins, Klitschkos thoughts are fixed on Lewis, 38. Having avenged his brother Wladimirs defeat to Sanders, Vitali said this: Lennox Lewis came to my room to congratulate me, and I told him: Many millions of boxing fans hope to see this fight [the return]. In this arena10 months ago Lennox Lewis promised to give me a rematch because I was winning the fight on points. Lennox was the greatest champion in the world and I will be happy to fight him. Im going to take a couple of months off now, but after that, well maybe. Lets see. If Lennox wont fight me then I have another dream. When I was a 15-year-old kid I saw the youngest heavyweight champion ever  Iron Mike. I promised myself: Iron Mike, one day we will fight each other, and I will beat you. The Iron Giant against Iron Mike has a promotional ring to it, but little to commend it as a contest now that Tyson is in a psychic universe of his own. Mention of Tyson raises a different thought. What Lewis will have to do to reclaim his belt for the third time is deliver himself to Las Vegas or New York in the shape he was in when he gave Tyson a savage beating in Memphis two summers ago. However loud the groans when people realise that this was another of boxings temporary retirements, Lewis-Klitschko II works not just as a financial bonanza but as a valid piece of sport.

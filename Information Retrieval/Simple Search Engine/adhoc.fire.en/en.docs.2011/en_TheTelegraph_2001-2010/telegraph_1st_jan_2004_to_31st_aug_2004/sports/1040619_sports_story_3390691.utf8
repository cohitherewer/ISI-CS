 Croatia aim to emulate Ivanisevic 
Couco: Croatia goalkeeper Tomislav Butina wants to emulate tennis player Goran Ivanisevic and break English hearts in their decisive clash on Monday. The final group B match leaves the Croatians needing a victory to reach the Euro 2004 quarter finals at the expense of Sven-Goran Erikssons England, who just need a draw. Ivanisevic was a rank outsider at the 2001 Wimbledon championships but was feted in Croatia when he beat Tim Henman in a titanic semi-final before lifting the title. He was a small guy and in one moment he became a national hero, Butina, who made some fantastic saves in the 2-2 draw with France on Thursday, said during a rest day at the teams camp. If we win this match we will have 11, or even 25 heroes. Butina admitted his mistake cost Croatia the chance of a famous victory against France when his rushed clearance hit David Trezeguets arm and the striker rolled the ball into an empty net to earn the French a 2-2 draw. But the keeper insists matching the European champions, particularly in an impressive second half, has filled the squad with belief as they prepare for the England match. England are one of the best three teams in the world, especially when you play them with 75 percent of the crowd on their side. It will be a home game for them, said Butina. They are favourites and have all sorts of possibilities but we have a very good feeling after the way we played against France. You never know with us.  Butina said 18-year-old Wayne Rooneys double for England marks him out for special attention in the build-up to the match but believes Steven Gerrard is the biggest danger. If youre asking who I think is Englands best player I would say Gerrard, he is one of the best midfielders in the world at the moment, he added. Meanwhile, Croatia forward Ivan Klasnic says he is looking forward to going on holiday on Tuesday because he does not believe his teammates can beat England. Eriksson, on the other hand, is worried Rooney, who received a yellow card against Switzerland, may be booked against Croatia and collect a one-match suspension.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

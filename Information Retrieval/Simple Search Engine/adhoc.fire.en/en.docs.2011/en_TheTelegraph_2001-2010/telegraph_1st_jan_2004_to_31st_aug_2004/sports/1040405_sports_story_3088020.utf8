 Hoggard hattrick in historic victory 
 - THIRD TEST - Vaughan rendered speechless after clinching series; Lara devastated  Marcus Trescothick and Matthew Hoggard chill out after winning the third Test against the West Indies at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown on Saturday. (Reuters) Bridgetown: England, inspired by a Matthew Hoggard hattrick, romped to an emotional eight-wicket victory over West Indies in the third Test on Saturday to clinch their first series triumph in the Caribbean since 1968. Seamer Hoggard became only the 10th Englishman to take a Test hattrick as West Indies crumbled to 94 all out in their second innings, leaving England a target of just 93 (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). Captain Michael Vaughan made 32 and Marcus Trescothick 42 before Mark Butcher saw England home in just 20 overs to give them a 3-0 lead in the four-match series. It was also the first time England have ever won three Tests in a series in West Indies. The winning runs were greeted by roars of jubilation from thousands of England fans who all but turned the Kensington Oval into their home venue. Captain Michael Vaughan, however, seemed almost speechless before leading his players on a prolonged lap of honour in front of their chanting supporters. It means so much, he said. It hasnt really sunk in. Its an amazing achievement. We expected a tough day when we arrived this morning. Well definitely enjoy tonight and well probably enjoy tomorrow. Rival skipper Brian Lara said: Im devastated and in a state of shock. Its hard to put into words how the guys and I feel right now. The batting has to improve, said Lara. A lot of the guys have to look and see that they are getting out the same way, and work hard on it. While Man-of-the-Match Graham Thorpe kept England in the game on Friday with an undefeated 119 out of a total of 226, it was Hoggard who put the finishing touches. West Indies resumed on 21 for one but Hoggard ripped the heart out of the home side with four for 25 from 11.1 overs before lunch before the innings ended in 42.1 overs. Only Lara offered any resistance with 33 but he was helpless as his sides frail batting was exposed again, just as they had been in the first test in Jamaica when they were skittled for 47. Strike bowler Steve Harmison took three for 34 and all rounder Andrew Flintoff, the key bowler of the first innings with five for 58, chipped in with two for 20. West Indies lost Daren Ganga to Hoggard for 11 but Lara and vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan looked in the mood to battle. But Lara, who suffered a nasty blow on his elbow from a Harmison delivery, could only watch from the non-strikers end as Hoggard took Englands first hattrick since Darren Gough against Australia in Sydney in 1999. First Sarwan drove straight to Ashley Giles at gully. Then left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul was trapped lbw by a ball which nipped back and Ryan Hinds, rooted to the crease, was snapped up at second slip Flintoff. Hoggard, who finished with four for 35, conceded afterwards there had been an element of luck to his hat-trick delivery. I was thinking: Bowl your best ball, an inswinger, on to leg stump. It didnt really swing. It went straight across and thankfully he nicked it, Hoggard told Sky Sports. He had barely recovered from being mobbed by his teammates after his triple-wicket maiden before it was 48 for six as wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs gloved a Flintoff lifter to Butcher at gully. After light rain forced an early lunch, Lara and Tino Best put on 32 for the seventh wicket, but after a second rain delay, Best fell first ball back, caught behind off Harmison for 12. Lara was in the wars again as he suffered two more painful blows, one to each arm, but West Indies pain worsened when Pedro Collins was run out by Nasser Hussain. Any hope West Indies had of setting a defendable target ended when Lara was dismissed, caught at mid-on by Michael Vaughan off a mis-timed pull off Harmison. After more light rain, Vaughan signalled Englands intent with a pull over square leg for six and a sumptuous off-drive for four before he was caught by Jacobs off Corey Collymore for 32. Trescothick fell with two runs needed but a single to Butcher, off a no ball, gave England a famous victory. Long wait: Botham Meanwhile, Ian Botham, one of a long line of England captains who tried and failed to clinch a series triumph in the Caribbean, believes that Vaughans historic victory here can lead to Ashes glory next year. Botham was skipper when England lost 0-2 to the West Indies in 1981. The players have worked very hard and now they have the platform to face the Australians in the Ashes, said Botham. Its been a long wait since 1968. I was here in 1981 and it was a very painful time. But this is a great moment for the players. There has been progress in the past but then it all slipped away. However, in the last six months there have been changes. Now there are bowlers who have clicked. They are hostile, they swing the ball, there is bounce and pace and they have all gelled. The same applies to the batting. The middle order is firing and everyone is making contributions.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 UP govt. orders CID inquiry
Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh government has ordered a CID inquiry into the bribery allegations levelled against the state under-19 cricket selectors by a junior player, sports minister R. K. Chaudhary said on Friday. The decision was taken after the government took strong exception to the slow progress in the ongoing departmental probe into the allegations levelled by Ritesh Yadav. In keeping with the contradictory statements given by the cricketers and office bearers of cricket association and the rigid attitude of selectors during the inquiry being conducted by a special secretary level officer, it was decided to hand over the probe to CID, Chaudhary said in an official release here.

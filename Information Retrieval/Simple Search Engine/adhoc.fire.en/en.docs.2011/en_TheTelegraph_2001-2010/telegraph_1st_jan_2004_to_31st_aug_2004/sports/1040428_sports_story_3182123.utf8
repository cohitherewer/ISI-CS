The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We will deliver in Athens
 - Dont read too much into Australia defeats: Rajinder Singh  Gagan Ajit feels too many changes affect the team New Delhi: Their most disastrous showing in the recent past notwithstanding, Indian hockey coach Rajinder Singh put up a brave front saying not much should be read in the failure of his experimental team. India finished fourth in the second four-nation meet  featuring Australia, Malaysia and South Africa  in Sydney. In the Canberra meet the week before, India had lost to Australia in the final. It is an experimental team with lots of youngsters. Three of our key players suffered injuries. Even then, I am satisfied with the overall performance, he told newsmen at the Indira Gandhi international airport on the teams return from Australia in the wee hours of Tuesday. Even before we left for Australia, I had said this was an experimental side with as many as six youngsters being given a chance. We also couldnt get some good players as the junior Asia Cup was being held at the same time. So not much should be read into the defeats in Australia. India, who won two four-nation meets in Australia and Germany last year, went down to South Africa 0-1 on Sunday to finish at the bottom. In the league stage, their 0-3 loss to Malaysia cost them a berth in the final. Rajinder said the team played quite well, but some mistakes here and there cost them the matches. Barring the match against Malaysia, which we lost 0-3, we played good hockey but the result wasnt reflected on the scoresheet. The youngsters showed good promise but will take some time to achieve international standards, he said. The Indian coach is confident that the team would get back to winning ways before the Athens Olympics. Our problem has been, we win smaller tournaments before the big one and dont play to our potential when it matters the most. This time, Im sure well perform well in the Olympics, which is our main target. Asked whether senior players Dhanraj Pillay, Baljit Singh Dhillon and Baljit Singh Saini would be back in the side, Rajinder did not commit himself. If the senior players are fit, I have no problem in having them in the team, he said. Star forward Gagan Ajit Singh admitted it was the teams worst result since he started playing for the senior national team but attributed the dismal showing to injuries. Three of our key players were injured and this hampered us a lot. This is an Olympic year and we will have to guard against injuries, the Punjab Police player said. Gagan Ajit felt frequent changes affect coordination in the team. When changes are made frequently it does affect the team, but at the same time experimentation is also needed, he said. Meanwhile, Rajinder pleaded ignorance on forward Tejbir Singhs doping controversy and said he would only comment on the issue after talking to the player. Tejbir had said last week the coach had informed him about the positive dope test in Madrid, before the Olympic qualifiers. I was informed about it (positive test) in Madrid by the coach (Rajinder) and had to return home, Tejbir had said, adding that he would soon get another test done to sort out the matter. I dont know anything about it (positive dope test). I only read reports in the media while in Australia I would talk to the players in a day or two to get a knowledge of this issue, the coach said. Rajinder insisted the team management decided to replace Tejbir due to a hamstring injury and that he had no knowledge of the doping angle. Interestingly, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) hasnt till date intimated the player about any positive test.  (PTI)  Copyright

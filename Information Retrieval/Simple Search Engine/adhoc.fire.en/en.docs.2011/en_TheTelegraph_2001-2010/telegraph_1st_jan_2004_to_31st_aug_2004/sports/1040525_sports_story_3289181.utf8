The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB say Bhutia remains
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Douglas Calcutta: East Bengal are confident of retaining star striker Bhaichung Bhutia for the forthcoming season. It is learnt that the India captain had a good offer from Mahindra United and even Mohun Bagan was keen on roping him in. However, Bhutia decided to stay with the red-and-gold brigade for another season following a fresh round of discussion. It is certain that he is getting a satisfactory pay-hike. Douglas da Silva, after being at the centre of a lot of rumour, has fallen back on his old club. East Bengal had decided not to retain him once he demanded a big raise but the Brazilian failed to find a better opportunity elsewhere. The player is trying for Indian citizenship and it has been reliably learnt that fresh negotiations for a new contract started at his behest. East Bengal also confirmed the services of goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar from Salgaocar. Rajat, who had earlier given word to Mohun Bagan officials, changed his decision for family reasons. East Bengal also confirmed Sujay Dutta for another season and signed in Sandip Das (Tollygunge Agragami) and Prasanta Sarkar (George Telegraph). Mohun Bagan gained Tomba Singh of Salgaocar as the midfielder signed on the dotted line on Monday. They also retained Abhay Kumar. Mohammedan Sporting signed Mohammed Ali, Mohammed Yasin and Siddhartha Thapa of Durgapur Steel Plant Football Academy and Temzen Kibang of Tollygunge Agragami. Tashi Rapden Bhutia and Leezan Lepcha of Boys Club, Gangtok, signed in favour of Tollygunge Agragami. Barreto issue The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has sought a clarification from Fifa on whether Jose Ramirez Barreto can be issued a International Registration Transfer Certificate. The AIFF letter was sent to the world body following the suspended Brazilians appeal for a clearance to play elsewhere. His initial plea to get a transfer was turned down.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Makelele, Scholes doubtful
Lisbon: France could lose midfielder Claude Makelele after the dramatic 2-1 victory over England on Sunday, while England may have to bounce back without Paul Scholes. Makelele suffered a collarbone injury, the victim of Emile Heskeys game-turning foul in injury time. Zinedine Zidane equalised from the ensuing free-kick and, two minutes later scored the winner from the penalty spot. Despite the euphoria of winning, Makelele was in pain on Monday. It is a problem with my collarbone. I fell awkwardly after colliding with Heskey. I hope I will be okay for the next match but we will have to wait two or three days to see how it develops.

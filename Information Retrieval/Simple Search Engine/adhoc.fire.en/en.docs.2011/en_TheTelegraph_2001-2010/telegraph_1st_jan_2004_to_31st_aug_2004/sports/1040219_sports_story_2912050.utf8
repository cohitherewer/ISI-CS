The Telegraph - Calcutta
 AIFF no to Bagan plea
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The AIFF has turned down Mohun Bagans plea to register an extra foreigner in place of Jose Ramirez Barreto, who broke his contract and left for Brazil midway into the NFL. Rules permit four foreigners per team and Mohun Bagan had already registered three, including Barreto. Brazilians Leonardo and Eduardo are their other foreign recruits. The club requested the AIFF to allow one player in Barretos place, so that they could play the remaining 11 matches with four foreigners, including the one they are yet to recruit. It has been learnt that the club has abandoned plans of hiring a Ghanaian striker and chances are that Zimbabwean midfielder Noel Kasak will soon be registered. In a bid to lift the sagging morale of club members and fans, Mohun Bagan on Wednesday announced a unique tie-up with ICICI Bank to launch the countrys first co-branded football club credit card. The co-branded card, a variant of ICICI Bank International Sterling Silver Card, makes Mohun Bagan only the third football team in the world after Manchester United and Barcelona FC to seal such a deal, claim officials. We have fixed a target of introducing in the market 50,000 such cards in the next eight months across the country, to utilise Bagans support base, said an official for the company. Mohun Bagan will get a percentage of the fees and sales from the card, he said. But I can not give you the exact figures or percentage, as the financial details are being worked out. Tie on 26th The Mohammedan Sporting-Mahindra United NFL tie, scheduled for Salt Lake Stadium on February 25, has been pushed back by a day for the East Bengal-Negri Semblian (Malaysia) AFC Cup match on that date.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pressure not on us, says Miandad
 Series more than just cricket, says Miandad Islamabad: The war of words has begun. And Pakistan coach Javed Miandad on Wednesday fired the first salvo to kick it off, which is likely to dominate the highly-charged India-Pakistan series. Countering India coach John Wrights comment in Calcutta on Tuesday that the pressure would be on the home team, the firebrand coach shot back saying, this theory is entirely wrong. Once the series starts, it will release the pressure on our players. I have advised the players to remain cool and normal, Miandad told reporters in Karachi on Tuesday night where he is supervising the teams training ahead of the first one-day International on Saturday. The boys are focussed and anxiously looking forward to the series. They are committed and raring to give a good performance, he said. The wily cricketer also vehemently denied that he was a defensive coach. I dont know, who has floated this theory about me, he said angrily. It is absurd. Referring to the aggressive approach he adopted during his hey days as a batsman, Miandad said: I always advise the boys to fight out. So calling me a cautious or defensive coach is meaningless. The former batsman also said he did not view the series as a contest between Shoaib Akhtar and Sachin Tendulkar or Mohammed Sami versus Rahul Dravid. It would be Pakistan versus India and whoever plays like a unit will be successful. This series is more than just cricket. It is about building bridges between Pakistan and India and promoting peace. I would appeal to everyone in Pakistan to make combined efforts to ensure the series is held in a peaceful manner without any mishaps, he said. Meanwhile, Imran Khan feels the outcome of the series will depend more on which team could cope with the pressure. He tipped Shoaib as Pakistans trump card. The team with the stronger batting line up will carry the day. The team which has strong batting, which India does have, will have an edge in the one-day games, Imran said. However, there will be no walkovers for either side. A lot will depend on whether Sourav can take pressure better than Inzamam to determine the outcome of the match. Pakistans bowling strength would give it the edge in the Test series, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

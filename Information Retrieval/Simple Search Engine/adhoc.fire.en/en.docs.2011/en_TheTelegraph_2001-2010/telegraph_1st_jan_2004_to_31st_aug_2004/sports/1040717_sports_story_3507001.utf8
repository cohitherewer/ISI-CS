 Woolmer tips may destroy Shoaib, says Sarfraz
 Shoaib Akhtar Islamabad: Former Pakistan Test bowler Sarfraz Nawaz fears that coach Bob Woolmer may destroy the career of fast bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar by asking them to shorten their run-ups. It is difficult to understand why Woolmer is asking Shoaib and other fast bowlers to shorten their run-ups, said Nawaz who revels in controversies. During his coaching tenure with the cricket team of South Africa, he (Woolmer) never asked South African bowlers to shorten their run-ups. I have played cricket for my country for a long time and I feel that an Englishman cannot see any Asian player on top, he was quoted as saying by a news agency. Meanwhile, the PCB has yet to sign a formal contract with coach Bob Woolmer, who has agreed to work on a monthly salary basis.  (PTI)  Copyright

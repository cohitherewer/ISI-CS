The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Irish blow to Dutch confidence
	 - Portugal, Spain end warm-up fixtures with wins  Luis Figo takes the ball past Aurelijus Skarbalius of Lithuania at the Setubal Stadium on Saturday. (AFP) Amsterdam: Ten days before their Euro 2004 opening game against Germany, Dutch confidence took a big knock with a 0-1 home defeat against Ireland on Saturday. Robbie Keane sealed the deserved win just before halftime, ending a fine 40m run with a powerful, deflected shot from just outside the box. Elsewhere, Spain and Portugal recorded satisfying wins although against weaker rivals  4-0 and 4-1, respectively, against Andorra and Lithuania. The Irish had gone close to an opening goal after only three minutes when Keane intercepted a header away by Giovanni van Bronckhorst but his shot narrowly missed the target. After the break Dutch coach Dick Advocaat paired Rafael van der Vaart with Ruud van Nistelrooy while Clarence Seedorf replaced the totally out of form Kluivert. Ireland might have gone further ahead in the first seven minutes of the second half. A Clinton Morrison volley went just over the bar and goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar foiled a breakaway by Keane. The Dutch pressurised the Irish defence but kept searching for the solution through the centre. Despite the presence of wingers like Arjen Robben and Andy van der Meyde the flanks were hardly used. To add to their concerns Seedorf was forced off the pitch after only 18 minutes with a suspected pulled muscle. The Netherlands opponents in Group D at Euro 2004 are the Czech Republic, Germany and Latvia. Advocaat said: We played a very poor match and it was clear that my team performed not as they were supposed to do. It didnt work out with Kluivert and Van Nistelrooy but that is also to do with my midfielders who all gathered on a small area so we hardly had any space to create chances. Portugal eased to a 4-1 home win in Setubal in their final warm-up match. A header from Fernando Couto and a deft finish from Pauleta Resendes put Luiz Felipe Scolaris side 2-0 up by the 13th minute. Lithuania got a goal back after 74 minutes with a penalty from Donatas Vencevicius but Nuno Gomes scored with nine minutes to go and Helder Postiga headed home in injury time to complete a comfortable win for the home side. Spain cruised to a 4-0 win in their final warm-up. First-half strikes from Fernando Morientes and Ruben Baraja, a second-half header from Cesar and a fine individual goal from Juan Carlos Valeron meant Spain ended their week-long training camp on a high.

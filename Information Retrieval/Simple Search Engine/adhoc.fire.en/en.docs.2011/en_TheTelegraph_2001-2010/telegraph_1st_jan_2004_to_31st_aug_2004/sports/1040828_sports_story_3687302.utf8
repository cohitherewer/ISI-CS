 Diego rehab is harmful: Lawyer
Buenos Aires: The drug rehabilitation of Diego Maradona is harmful and will make him go mad, his lawyer Hector Leguizamon has claimed. Maradona is under a court order to remain in a psychiatric hospital in the western suburbs of Buenos Aires for refusing to follow medical advice which was putting his life at risk. To continue this treatment is harmful and will make him go mad, Leguizamon told a radio station. Leguizamon asked legal authorities to allow Maradona the freedom to continue his treatment in Havana. Maradona has been battling cocaine addiction since 2000 but doubts surrounded the treatment he had been receiving in Cuba. Judge Noberto Garcia Vedia told a Wednesday press conference he had no reservation in principle for Maradona to continue drugs rehabilitation abroad, as long as he was receiving proper treatment.

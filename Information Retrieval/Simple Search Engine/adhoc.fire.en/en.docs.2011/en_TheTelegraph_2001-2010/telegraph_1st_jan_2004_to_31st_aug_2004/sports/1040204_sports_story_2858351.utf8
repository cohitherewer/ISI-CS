 UCB faces legal threat
Cape Town: South African province Griqualand West have threatened legal action against the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) after being left out in a restructuring of the domestic first-class game. Eleven provinces were asked to submit bids  jointly or on their own  for one of six franchises in time for next season. Griquas and Free State refused to submit a joint bid for the central region and decided to bid alone, with the latter declared the winners on Sunday. It is with shock and dismay that (we) heard of the award of the franchise... to Free State on (television), Griqualand West said in a statement on Monday. It is unfortunate that an ill conceived, tainted and patently defective system has resulted in franchises being awarded on a basis that is clearly not in the best interests of South African cricket.

 France set up quarters date with Greece
Coimbra: Champions France advanced into the Euro 2004 quarter finals on Monday with a 3-1 victory over Switzerland with two late goals from striker Thierry Henry. France, needing a point to go through, started well, Zinedine Zidane scoring with a header from a Robert Pires corner in the 20th minute for his third goal of the tounament. But the Swiss struck back quickly when 18-year-old striker Johann Vonlanthen sprung the French offside trap to equalise six minutes later with a clever angled shot. He became the youngest scorer in European Championship finals history. Henry gave France victory with his first goals at Euro 2004 in the 76th and 84th minutes. France will play their quarter final against Greece in Lisbon on Friday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cloud over Agarkar fitness
 - TRI-SERIES - Sourav for intensity pick-up  vs Aussies today
 Agarkar has a stiff calf muscle through overload Brisbane, Jan. 17 (PTI): Indias threadbare bowling attack suffered a further blow here when the in-form Ajit Agarkar looked doubtful for the triangular one-day series match against Australia Sunday. Agarkar is suffering from a stiff calf muscle, a result of the excessive workload he has taken in the current series. His unavailability could upset Indias plans to make amends for their 18-run defeat in the tri-series opener to the hosts. Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, though, put up a brave front and promised to pick up overall intensity against the world champions in the floodlit encounter at the Gabba. And the Indians would again be expected to go into the match with seven batsmen and Rahul Dravid would continue to keep wickets. Agarkar did not bowl at nets and even as he contemplated whether to give himself a bowl, a fresh spell of rain drove the tourists indoors. Sourav is keeping an eye on Agarkar, worried his best medium-pacer of the tour might be ruled unfit. Ajit is a bit stiff in the calf, we havent decided on the 12 as we want to have a fresh assessment of the conditions and pitch tomorrow noon, said Sourav. The Aussies are perched atop the table with 17 points from three outings while India have seven points from a win and a defeat. Zimbabwe are yet to open their account. Sourav also appeared unperturbed by the return to form of big-hitter Adam Gilchrist and did not think that the Aussies hold an edge over them in one-day competition. We have to pick our overall intensity which served us so well in the past one year. We have to play to our standards and fire as best as we can tomorrow, he said as he inspected the pitch at the Gabba. It has been raining for the past one week, but Sourav admitted he was surprised to see the wicket was still dry. It had a spread of fresh grass and should assist seamers, he felt. More than anything, though, it is the injury worry to Agarkar which has been troubling Sourav the most on the eve of the match. If Agarkar is ruled out the Indian pace attack would have to rest on the inexperienced Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Amit Bhandari. Bhandari, Ashish Nehra and Pathan were all let loose at nets Saturday, and the way they went about their task it seemed a competition was up among them. Bhandari, having his first nets of the tour, was keen to impress, once hitting Yuvraj Singh on the inside of his left-arm and at another having a top order batsman caught and bowled. Nehra was slow to start with but then his run-up kept getting longer and his pace quicker. All the bowlers though were handicapped by lack of new kookaburra balls. This is probably 40 overs old, quipped Bhandari as he stretched himself for a good hour at the nets. Indias fifth bowlers slot worked nicely in Hobart and Sehwag, Hemang Badani, Sachin and Sourav are quite capable of taking care of 10 or more overs. The Australians bat very deep and even when their top order fails, the rest can significantly lift their game. Hence the seven batsmen and Dravid behind the stumps. Sourav said: We cannot drop our guard at this stage. Rahul would keep wickets, but added he would think of having a specialist wicketkeeper roped in when they have made sure of a berth in the finals. The Gabba usually produces high-scoring matches. The highest chase managed has been 284 for three by the West Indies against Australia in 1996-97. These are the benchmarks which quite as well may get revised tomorrow.

		 Thursday, February 19, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Durban: Dr Ali Bacher will visit India in early April to launch his book Ali: The Authorised Biography, written by journalist Rodney Hartmen.				 																																	Bacher, the former South African Test captain will be a guest of Penguin India, the publishers of the book, in Mumbai.				 																																	Former president Nelson Mandela has written the foreword for the book. The book tells a detailed and definitive life story of Bacher, the son of a Jewish trader, and at the same time, it is a riveting account of the development of modern cricket, the publishers say.				 																																	It was under his leadership that South Africa made its re-entry into international cricket after the apartheid when they toured India for the first time in 1991.				 																																	Antwerp: Elke Clijsters failed in her bid to set up a match with her elder sister, Belgian world No. 2 Kim, in the Diamond Games after losing 3-6, 2-6 to Spains Arantxa Parra in the first round on Tuesday.				 																																	Kim Clijsters was scheduled to meet the winner in the second round on Wednesday and the number two seed is likely to be relieved after saying on Monday she would not have been happy to beat her sister. She said the situation made her realise what Serena and Venus Williams must experience when they had to play each other in tournaments. Now I have a chance to feel what the Williams sisters are feeling, Kim said. If I beat Elke, I will not be happy.				 																																	London: Fifa have warned Leeds United that striker Mark Viduka will not be able to play in Saturdays game at Manchester United if he fails to join the Australian squad for Wednesdays friendly against Venezuela in Caracas.				 																																	Fifa said in statement on Wednesday that following a request from the Australian Soccer Association, it had asked the English FA to inform Leeds of their obligation to release Viduka for the match. Viduka had been scheduled to fly to Caracas on Sunday but did not travel. Leeds say the player has a hamstring injury, according to British media reports.				 																																	Valencia: Valencia supporters and shareholders are set to sue the referee of their match at Real Madrid for one euro on grounds of negligence after he awarded Real a controversial injury time penalty. Valencia were 30 seconds away from shattering Reals 100 per cent home record and ousting them from the top spot in the Spanish League. The Luis Figo penalty saved Real from all that.				 																																	In injury time, a posse of Valencia defenders tussled with Raul and when the striker went down referee Pedro Trustante ruled he had been fouled by Carlos Marchena. 				 																																	Margao: The Goa Football Association (GFA) has suspended four second division clubs - Curtorim Gymkhana, Sangolda Lightning, Wilred Leisure and Dona Paula - for one year and fined Rs 5,000 each. The suspensions come in the wake of match-fixing charges in the final round of second division inter-zonal play-off matches in which Curtorim beat Sangolda 61-1 and Wilred beat Dona Paula 55-1.				 																																	The executive committee of GFA also recommended to the general body that players and officials of the clubs be expelled for life.				 																																	Brussels: Female athletes will equal the number of men in the Olympics within a decade, IOC president Jacques Rogge has predicted. The prediction we have now for Athens is that we will already have 44 per cent womens participation, Rogge told a Belgian senate committee.

 Mallick shines for Orissa
Cuttack: Prabhanjan Mallick (96 batting) was involved in an unbroken 109-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Niranjan Behera that helped hosts Orissa post 217 for four at close on Day I of their Ranji Trophy plate division semi-final against Madhya Pradesh at Barabati Stadium here Sunday. The home team suffered a jolt before the match when Shib Sundar Das was ruled unfit due to a calf-muscle injury. He was replaced by B. B. C. C. Mohapatra. Meanwhile, in another semi-final in Pune, Shafiq Khan (103 batting) anchored Haryana to 218 for six at stumps against Maharashtra. SUMMARISED SCORES In Cuttack: Orissa 217/4 (P.

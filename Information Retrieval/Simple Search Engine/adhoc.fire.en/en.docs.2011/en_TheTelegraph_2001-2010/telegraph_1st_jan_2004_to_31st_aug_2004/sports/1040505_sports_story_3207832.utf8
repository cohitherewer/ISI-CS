The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rebels to renew boycott 
 Streak and 3 others wont play despite being in the squad Harare: The four rebel Zimbabwe cricketers withdrew from the 17-man national squad named by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) earlier on Tuesday to play Sri Lanka in the first of two Tests at Harare Sports Club starting on Thursday. Sri Lanka will therefore continue to face a second-string Zimbabwe team. Sacked former captain Heath Streak, spinner Ray Price, allrounder Sean Ervine and opener Trevor Gripper quit the squad because the ZCU and the striking players failed to reach an agreement on how to solve their month-long stand-off. The players want Streak reinstated as skipper and the selectors changed. The ZCU responded that neither issue was any longer a matter for discussion. Essentially, the ZCU offered mediation in the guise of internal negotiations under an independent chairman. Local businessman Much Masunda was named to head the talks. The players want arbitration, conducted by two international figures. One of those mentioned was former West Indies captain Jimmy Adams, However, Adams had not yet been approached. The ZCU did not accept our proposals and we do not accept theirs, senior batsman Grant Flower said after a players meeting on Tuesday. There is simply no agreement, and on that basis the four chosen for the squad are withdrawing. The ZCU still has one card up its sleeve. It had previously given the players an ultimatum to return to duties within 21 days or face action. This could mean suspension or dismissal. The 21 days will be up on Friday. I am extremely disappointed by their decision, ZCU chief executive Vincent Hogg said. Lehmann concern Darren Lehmann has revealed that he has concerns about the tour of Zimbabwe. Stuart MacGill has already pulled out of the tour on moral grounds and Lehmann said he fully supported MacGills decision. We are not a political side but I would be lying if I said there wasnt a concern about the whole scenario, said the South Australian. (AP)  Copyright

 Diego off respirator 
Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona was taken off an artificial respirator on Friday but remained in intensive care five days after being rushed to hospital with a swollen heart and breathing problems, a hospital statement said. The hospital, where a group of fans kept up their vigil in the street outside, also said the former Argentina World Cup winners pneumonia was improving, though he is still taking drugs to keep his heart and blood circulation stable. Shortly after midday (1500 GMT), the mechanical respiratory assistance was suspended and the tube could be taken out, said the statement issued by the Suizo-Argentino clinic. It added that Maradona was still receiving oxygen treatment with a mask. The ventilatory function is good at the moment, the statement said. Maradona, who has put on so much weight that he is scarcely recognisable from his playing days, arrived in Argentina last month from Cuba, where he has spent the last three years undergoing a drugs rehabilitation programme. He was rushed to hospital on Sunday in a serious, feverish condition, shortly after watching his favourite team Boca Juniors play Nueva Chicago and then going to a traditional Argentine barbecue. His doctor Alfredo Cahe has rubbished suggestions that drugs use might have been behind Maradonas illness. The 43-year-old has also developed pneumonia, which the hospital said is easing. He continues to require drugs to keep the cardiovascular function stabilised. Hes also receiving antibiotics and sedatives, the latter in smaller doses than when he arrived.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

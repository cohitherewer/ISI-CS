 NFL set for overhaul
New Delhi: The National Football League (NFL) is all set for an overhaul with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) recommending radical structural changes in its format aimed at giving the game the right push in the country. The AFC, which launched its Vision India project in January with an aim to make the country a soccer powerhouse in the next ten years, has recommended introduction of a licence system for players and increasing the number of teams playing in the premier league. According to the project report, the number of teams playing in the NFL should be increased from 12 to 18 and these clubs, as also the players, should be banned from playing in local leagues. The reportwas handed over to the AIFF delegation by AFC president Mohammed bin Hammam at Kuala Lumpur, last month. The Indian delegation, led by AIFF secretary Albert Colaco, has asked for two months time to study the report and are likely to file their observations by July end, highly-placed sources in AFC said on Wednesday.

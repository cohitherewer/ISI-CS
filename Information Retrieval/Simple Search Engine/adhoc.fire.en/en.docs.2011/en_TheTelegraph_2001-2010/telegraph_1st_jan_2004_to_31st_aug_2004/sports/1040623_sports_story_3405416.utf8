 The genius on grass still cow-tows Juliet
 FROM SUE MOTT IN WIMBLEDON  Roger Federer Roger Federer is becoming ominously more comfortable on grass even than his cow, Juliet. The defending Wimbledon champion looked as smooth as a vat of cream as he won his 18th successive match on grass in beating Britains Alex Bogdanovic in straight sets in the first round. But he is such a polite young man that he gave Juliet  the pet cow presented to him by a grateful Swiss nation for winning Wimbledon a year ago  the benefit of the doubt. She should be more comfortable because she spends more time on it, he said kindly. But if he is nice to farmyard animals, he was only going to give so much leeway to the Briton ranked 295th in the world who has been swirling in the outer darkness of Lawn Tennis Association disapproval ever since he failed to turn up at a tournament abroad after suffering a bout of food poisoning. How was that for punishment? A Centre Court appointment with the greatest grass court player of his generation. As it happened, Bogdanovic was delighted with his draw. He had nothing to lose and duly lost 3-6, 3-6, 0-6. But at least during the course of the comprehensive defeat he almost broke Federers serve on one occasion, holding two break points at 3-2 in the second set, and looked as though he had escaped the perennial British fate of keeling over with stage fright at the first swish of a cross-court backhand. That is not to say a bout of Bogmania is about to sweep the country. But the 20-year-old Belgrade-born wildcard acquitted himself well and even drew a compliment after the match from his exalted opponent. You know the match went very quickly, Federer said. But I definitely see potential because hes got good hands. He just needs to work on his conditional strength and the mental will follow the more matches he will play. Some would say the mental are too busy following the England team in Portugal to worry about the likes of a low-ranked British male tennis player in the rain, but if Henmania is to lure more people into watching tennis, then there will need to be a following horde of players who can capitalise on the new popularity. If not a horde, then some. If not some, then at least one. Perhaps Bogdanovic, the new chastened version, will be that one.His serve was efficient and his rallying competitive. He was let down, as Federer correctly identified, by his lack of strength and power from the corners and, ultimately, the conviction that he was only there to make up the numbers. While Federer has the aesthetic appeal of a Renaissance painting, all beautiful lines and fabulous spectacle, Bogdanovic was a little more earthy. His preparation to serve, for instance, involved such a protuberant elbow that he looked like a man trying to unfurl an umbrella in a gale. The crowd cheered him on as far as they were able, without ever straying into the waving of union flags (clearly being washed and pressed for Tim Henmans first appearance). He rewarded them with some adventurous points, three aces (two in one game in a glorious second-set burst) and moments when he out-rallied the champion. A few spots of rain descended on his final service game. He encouraged them. He indicated to the heavens that he would really like a downpour. I wanted a rain break so that I could walk out on the Centre Court all over again. I liked it so much. But Federer, unusually bullish, just told him to get a move on. So Bogdanovic lost his third successive first round at Wimbledon and now awaits a return to the LTA fold. If he has learned anything from all his recent experiences, it is that there is never any substitute for hard, hard graft. He is probably not a follower of all Lenglens little traits, like trailing fur coats on to the court behind him and swigging copiously from flasks of brandy, but then ideas of fitness training have changed a little since the Frenchwoman last won The Championships in 1925.

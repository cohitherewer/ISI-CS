(Reuters) Long Beach: Michael Phelps just missed out on the 200 metres butterfly world record at the US Olympic trials on Saturday, but he did swim the fastest time of the year in winning his third individual event. Phelps reached 100 metres in 54.63 seconds and was ahead of his own world record pace for 150 metres before he tired on the last lap and touched in 1:54.31. The 19-year-old recorded 1:53.93 at the world championships in Barcelona last year. Behind Phelps, Sydney gold medallist Tom Malchow just held off a fast-charging Michael Raab to earn the second team berth. Were halfway through the meet and Im halfway to my goal of qualifying in six individual events, Phelps said. Im just taking it one event at a time. In other events, Jason Lezak clocked 48.17 seconds in the semi-finals of the mens 100-metres freestyle to set a US record and world best time for 2004. The previous national mark was 48.33 set by Anthony Ervin at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. The remaining two finals of the day were won by teenagers. Sixteen year-old Dana Vollmer upset favoured Lindsay Benko to take the 200 metres freestyle in 1:59.20, while 15-year-old Katie Hoff out-sprinted Amanda Beard to win the womens 200 metres individual medley in 2:12.06.

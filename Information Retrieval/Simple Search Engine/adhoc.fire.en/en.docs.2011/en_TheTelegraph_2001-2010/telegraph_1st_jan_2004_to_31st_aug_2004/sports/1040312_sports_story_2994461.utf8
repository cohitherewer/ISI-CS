				 																																	Beijing: Former heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson, his finances down for the count, may fight in China this year for a purse of some $3 million, a sports promoter and state media said on Thursday. Zhang Heng, head of the Beijing Competition Administration Centre, said the centre was working with an agent of Tysons to organise the October bout, but it had not yet been approved by the Beijing sports authority.				 																																	We dont have any agreement yet. Its just a kind of intention, Zhang said. It should be no problem to get approval from the authorities because we have been working on it for several years. The only thing we are paying close attention to is funding.				 																																	Nairobi: Britains Paula Radcliffe, who suffered a shock defeat by Lornah Kiplagat in her first race of the year, will face the Dutch athlete again over both four and eight kilometres at the world cross country championships. Kiplagats Dutch husband Pieter Langerhorst said in Nairobi on Thursday that the Kenyan-born athlete, like Radcliffe, intended to run both distances.				 																																	She is ready and fit for a double victory. After winning the Puerto Rico road race effortlessly, she is psyched for the cross country challenge, he said. Kiplagat beat world marathon record holder Radcliffe by four seconds over 10 kms in Puerto Rico at the start of March. 				 																																	London: Former Chelsea chairman Ken Bates is suing the west London club for breach of contract, Chelsea said on Wednesday. Media reports say Bates has issued a 2 million ($3.64 million) writ against the club. Bates, 72, resigned as chairman last week blaming differences of eastern and western cultures. We can confirm that Ken Bates has instituted legal proceedings against Chelsea Village Plc and Chelsea Football Club for breach of contract, the club said on its website. We will be vigorously defending this action as we are satisfied that we have behaved both responsibly and honourably in every way in our dealings with Ken Bates.				 																																	Singapore: Lightning struck and killed a teenage Chinese player during training with his Singapore S-League club Sinchi FC, local media reported on Thursday.				 																																	Rescue workers pronounced 18-year-old Jiang Tao dead about 10 minutes after the bolt struck the pitch, the Straits Times said.				 																																	There was a light drizzle, dark skies, but no thunder or lightning. Suddenly, I heard the roar of thunder and then saw a lightning bolt hit the ground behind me, said coach K. Jamaludeen, who was standing near the player.				 																																	London: Former France international striker Christophe Dugarry has left Premier League side Birmingham City for personal reasons after revealing on Thursday that his family had struggled to settle in England.				 																																	After a good start at the club, the 31-year-old has been troubled by a knee injury that kept him sidelined for several weeks this season.				 																																	Frankly I was living on my own the past six months because my family did not like living in England, Dugarry said.				 																																	Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia will bid to host the 2010 Asian Games after losing out to Qatar for 2006 but will not be drawn into a fierce fight, a top official said on Thursday.				 																																	Sieh Kok Chi, secretary of the Olympic council of Malaysias (OCM) said the official bid document had been prepared and would be submitted to the OCA.

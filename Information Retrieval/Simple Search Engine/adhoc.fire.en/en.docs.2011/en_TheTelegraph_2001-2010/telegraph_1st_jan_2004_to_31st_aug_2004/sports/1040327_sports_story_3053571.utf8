The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jockey critical
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT  Amjad Calcutta: It wasnt enough that young jockey Amjad Khan suffered a nasty fall in the races here Friday, he was also trampled over by a horse that came up from behind. Khan is battling for his life at a city nursing home. Khan was rushed to Woodlands nursing home where preliminary diagnosis revealed multiple haematoma (blood clots, following internal bleeding) and serious head injury. Khan regained consciousness late evening at the ITU, but was under sedation, feeling irritable, according to one medical officer. Khan is under the treatment of neurosurgeon Dr Indrajit Roy. Boman Parakh, RCTC secretary, said Khans condition will not be clear before 72 hours. Doctors have drained excess fluid from his lungs and he is on artificial respirator, Parakh added. Sources put his chances at 50-50, that too because of the jockeys young age. Khan is in his mid-twenties. Khans mount Bit Of Luck fell as it clipped into the heels of the front-runner Finders Keepers. Khan fell on the track, on his head. He could have still avoided serious injury had jockey Malcom Maseyk and his ride Positive Thinker  directly behind Khan  been able to avoid Khan on the ground. Instead, the 400kg Positive Thinker ran over Khan on the ground. Maseyk too fell, but escaped with minor injuries.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 All records special: Johnson
 Michael Johnson at a press conference in Mumbai on Saturday. (AFP) Mumbai, Feb. 14 (PTI): Claiming every record in his career was special to him, five-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson on Saturday said he was proud of his consistency in diverse races over a decade. It took me nearly a decade to shave off 1.5 seconds off my own record and that illustrates how difficult it is to better world records even by a fraction of a second, Johnson, here to run in the Mumbai Marathon on Sunday, told reporters. Johnson, who will be running the dream run (7 kms), lamented the fact that todays crop of 200 and 400 metres runners were not special and lacked consistency. On the marathon, he said: It is a personal achievement. Some run to win, others to finish the race and others have a benchmark to achieve. Commenting on the drugs issue which rears its ugly head at each and every athletic meet, Johnson said some athletes take drugs to take a short cut to success. It is tantamount to someone robbing a bank to stay ahead of the law enforcers and this should be condemned. Johnson believes the controversial doping case surrounding world 400m champion Jerome Young has been complicated by the lack of uniform rules in the sport. Meanwhile, terming the entire route as a tough one, South African Hendrick Ramaala, thefavourite to win the full marathon (42 kms), said, adverse weather conditions, particularly humidity, will make us sweat a lot but no problem. The course is tough but I have trained a lot. Lets see what happens tomorrow. Ramaala clocked his best timing of 2:08:58 at the London Marathon in 2003. About his competitors, Ramaala said: There are good runners from Kenya, Tanzania and some other countries. Particularly, the Kenyans are to be watched. They are really tough guys.  Copyright

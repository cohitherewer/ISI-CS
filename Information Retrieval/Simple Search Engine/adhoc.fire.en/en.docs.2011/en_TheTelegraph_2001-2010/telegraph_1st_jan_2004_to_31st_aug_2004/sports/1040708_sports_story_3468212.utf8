 Kleberson set to miss first game 
Arequipa: Brazilian midfielder Kleberson is almost certain to miss the world champions opening game in the Copa America after straining a thigh muscle during training on Tuesday. The 25-year-old, who had a difficult first year with Manchester United, suffered the blow during a practice match and was unlikely to play against Chile on Thursday, team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said. He suffered a strain to his left thigh. Well take another look tomorrow, but he is unlikely to recover from this in just two days to make the Chile game, Lasmar told reporters. The absence of a player who participated in Brazils 2002 World Cup is a setback to a squad lacking in top-flight experience. Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira left several top class players out of the Copa America squad, including the Spanish-based trio of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos. Instead, he has opted for a younger group of players, many of who are on the fringe of the national team. The injury is also a blow for Kleberson himself, who has lost his place in the starting line-up in the last year and had been hoping for a good Copa America to help him win back his place. Brazil have two other injury worries. Flamengo goalkeeper Julio Cesar, standing in for the absent Dida, has recovered rapidly from a thigh strain and trained normally on Tuesday. Sevilla midfielder Julio Batista was also responding to treatment for inflamed foot tendons and was likely to be fit for Brazils second game against Costa Rica, Lasmar said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

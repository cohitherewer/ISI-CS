The Telegraph - Calcutta
 One-dayers from Oct. 5 next year
Darwin: The ICC Super Series between the worlds top side and a Rest of the World XI next year will kick off with three limited-overs matches that will be held indoors at Melbournes Docklands Stadium on October 5, 7 and 9, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced on Monday. These will be followed by a six-day Test at the SCG from October 13-18. The ICC has decided instead to play the match over six days to try to ensure a result. It, however, will recognise the match as a full-fledged Test. Australia beat rival bids from India and South Africa to stage the series that the ICC hopes will become a regular feature on the playing calendar. Australia last played host to a World XI in 1971-72 but ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said he hoped the series would now be held every four years. Cricket enjoys a tradition of national teams playing Rest of the World sides and these matches have provided terrific cricket, Speed said in a statement. Unfortunately, in recent years... these types of games have drifted off the schedule. Australias team is No. 1 in the world in both forms of the game now, but will only play in the matches if they retain their place at the head of the official rankings when the top nation is decided on April 1 next year. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said he was confident his team would keep their place at the top of the rankings and had received assurances from other countries that their best players would be available. All of the countries are fully behind this event and they acknowledged the fact that they need to make sure their players are available, he said. The Rest of the World team, which could include the likes of Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, Indias Sachin Tendulkar and West Indies captain Brian Lara, will also be chosen next year.

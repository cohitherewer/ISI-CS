The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly face troubled Bagan 
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Aloke hints at revamping defence line  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Leonardo will be Mohun Bagans pillar in defence Calcutta: Things are getting tough for both teams with every passing game. Mohun Bagan will be trying their best to regain some pride, while Tollygunge Agragami will look for a win to give themselves some breathing space in the National Football League when the two meet at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. There is little doubt that Tollygunge will not get a better chance to put it across Mohun Bagan, who are currently far below their best. The green-and-maroon brigade has been plagued by a plethora of problems going into Tuesdays game. While scoring goals is a huge worry, the midfield and defence have hardly inspired confidence. Skipper Rennedy Singh, the mainstay in midfield, didnt quite distinguish himself in the past few games. Something is wrong I want to make amends tomorrow, the captain said after practice on Monday. Aloke Mukherjee sounded worried. I have to effect a few changes we must forget the nightmare of the Haywards Sporting game and move ahead, the coach said. He indicated a total revamp of the defence that lost against 1-2 to the Goa side. Side-backs Rishi Kapoor and Manitombi Singh are likely to be replaced by Babun Kar and Lolendra Singh, while Harpreet Singh may come in for Sanjeev Maria to join Leonardo Almeida in the heart of the defence. The Brazilian has been the mainstay of the Mohun Bagan defence. Its a relief he is playing well, Aloke said. Though the coach is not at all happy with the performance of No. 1 striker Ashim Biswas, theres no way he can be dropped. How can you drop a player of Ashims stature He can be a matchwinner any day, Aloke argued. In fact, Aloke and assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee had a session with Ashim where he was told to forget what had happened earlier and look ahead. The coach informed the team will start in the 4-5-1 formation with Ashim as a single striker. Weve to ensure we dont concede soft goals, he explained. Eduardo Rebeiro, who is nursing an ankle injury, will be sitting out his second successive game. The Mohun Bagan coach conceded that Tollygunge Agragami will be no pushovers. Akeem (Abolanle) is a good player and weve to keep an eye on him. Tollygunge coach Krishnendu Roy will be depending mainly on Akeem to score. Barring Shamsi Reza, all the players are fit and the coach is confident of a positive result. See, we have reached such a stage that anything less than full points will put us under more pressure. So well be aiming for a win. While Mohun Bagan have 19 points from 15 games, Tollygunge have 14 from the same number of games.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hookes attacker already awaiting another trial
 - Condolences continue to flow in  Indian players at the Gabba, observe a minutes silence before the match on Tuesday as a mark of respect to David Hookes who was killed on Monday. (Reuters) Melbourne: Condolences flowed in from sporting figures, politicians and fans around the world on Tuesday as Australia went into mourning for former Test cricketer David Hookes, who died of head injuries from a weekend assault. The death dominated the media, with the country shocked over the attack on the 48-year-old former batsman whose carefree, swashbuckling style made him a hero to a generation of fans. It emerged that 21-year-old hotel bouncer Zdravco Micevic, who has been charged with assaulting Hookes, is already awaiting trial accused of intentionally causing serious injury to another hotel patron in late 2002. As police consider laying further charges, it was also reported that Micevic had trained as a boxer and that a manager of one of the pubs where he worked had complained recently about his excessively aggressive confrontations with patrons. Micevik was released on bail by a Melbourne magistrate who banned him from working as a crowd controller and ordered him to reappear for committal on a charge of assaulting Hookes outside the St Kilda pub. The Victorian state government promised an overhaul of legislation covering the conduct of security guards and hotel bouncers in the aftermath of the Hookes tragedy. Hookes is survived by wife Robyn and two step-children. People who know him will know that not only was he a good cricketer but a stimulating, innovative cricket teacher and thats just developed more and more over the years, said Tony Greig who described the death as an absolute tragedy. Australian golfer Greg Norman was one of many high-profile Australians left shocked by news of the death. For the life of me I dont understand senseless, stupid, friggin accidents like this. I mean, what a waste of somebodys life, Norman said in Los Angeles.  Game rescheduled Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) on Tuesday rescheduled this weekends Sheffield Shield match between Victoria and South Australia. The match would now be played from February 8 to 11 at the MCG. Victorian and South Australia cricketers and officials were with Hookes late on Sunday when the incident occurred. We have agreed to the request after consultation with everyone involved, a CA spokesman said. Considering the funeral arrangements have not yet been made, obviously the players are not in any frame of mind to get ready for an important domestic fixture. (AFP)  Copyright

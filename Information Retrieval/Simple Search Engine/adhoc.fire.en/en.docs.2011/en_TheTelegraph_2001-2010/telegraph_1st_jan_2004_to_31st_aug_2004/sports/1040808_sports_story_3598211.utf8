The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Afridi in, Nazir out
Karachi, Aug. 7 (AFP): Pakistan today named popular allrounder Shahid Afridi in the 14-member squad for the tri-series in the Netherlands and the ICC Champions Trophy. We have recalled Afridi because of his experience and for the need of a leg-spinner in the team, who can also bat, chief selector Wasim Bari said. The enigmatic 24-year-old, who holds the record for the fastest ODI century  off just 37-balls against Sri Lanka in Kenya in 1997  played the last of his 176 ODIs against India in March but was left out of the Asia Cup squad. Opener Imran Nazir and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria were omitted from the squad which failed to reach the Asia Cup final in Sri Lanka last month. Also included in the team was left-handed opener Salman Butt, who played his only Test against Bangladesh in Multan last year. THE SQUAD Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Yusuf Youhana (vice-captain), Imran Farhat, Salman Butt, Yasir Hameed, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq, Moin Khan, Mohammed Sami, Shoaib Akhtar, Shabbir Ahmed, Rana Naveedul Hassan.

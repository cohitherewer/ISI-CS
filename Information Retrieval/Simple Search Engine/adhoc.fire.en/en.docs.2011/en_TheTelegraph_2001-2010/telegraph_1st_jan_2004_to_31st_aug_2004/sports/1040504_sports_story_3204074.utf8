Singapore: Rahil Gangjees victory in the inaugural Volkswagen Masters China on Sunday has catapulted him into 13th place on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. The Indian rookie, playing in only his fourth event of the year, triumphed in the $ 300,000 tournament after prevailing in a play-off over South Koreas Mo Joong-kyung at Pine Valley Golf Club in Beijing. His winners cheque of $ 48,450 took his years earnings to $ 50,732 and just outside the top-10 ranking on the money list. Runner-up Mo moved from 28th to 11th place on the ranking with his total haul of $ 60,177. It was his fourth top-10 of the season. Thailands Thongchai Jaidee still leads the Order of Merit with $ 332,375 in earnings. The former paratrooper, winner of the Malaysian Open and Myanmar Open in February, is currently playing on the European Tour. Indias Jyoti Randhawa trails the Thai in second place with his haul of $ 221,422 while Japans Hideto Tanihara is third with $ 194,197.

The Macau Open is the 10th leg of this seasons Asian Tour. Meanwhile, professional golfer Ajay Gupta, coach of Gangjee for the past five years, was very thrilled, very excited and very proudof his protgs achievement. You know, Rahil is like a bull terrier, once he grabs hold of something, he just doesnt let go. I think that is one quality of his which helped him overcome the obvious lack of experience of playing at such level, said an elated Gupta.  (AFP)  Copyright

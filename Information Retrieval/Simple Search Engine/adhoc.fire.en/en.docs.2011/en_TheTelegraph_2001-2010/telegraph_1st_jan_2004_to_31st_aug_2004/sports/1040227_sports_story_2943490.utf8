 Tikolo to play for WI side
Nairobi: Kenyan cricket captain Steve Tikolo and opener Kennedy Obuya have been invited to play for the West Indies Cricket Board Chancellors XI against England in Jamaica next week. Its a big honour to have our two players going back to the West Indies, said Kenyan coach Andy Moles, who led the team back home after a seven-week tour of the Caribbean. This is an excellent reward for them, especially Kennedy Obuya who had a good tournament, scoring 520 runs in the series, added Moles, the former English county player with Warwickshire. However, he said he was disappointed that another of his players, veteran off-spin bowler Maurice Odumbe, who had also been invited to play for the invitational side, would not be returning to the Caribbean after he broke his toe during the tour.

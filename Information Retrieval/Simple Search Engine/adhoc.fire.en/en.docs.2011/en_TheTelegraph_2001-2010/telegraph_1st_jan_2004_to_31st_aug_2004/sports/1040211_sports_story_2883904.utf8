The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag lands following SoS, injuries dog Bengal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Deep Dasgupta will open the innings for Bengal Calcutta: Its crunch time for Bengal and Delhi in the national one-day meet. The North Zone champions are not leaving anything to chance and decided to fly in Virender Sehwag, Amit Bhandari and Ashish Nehra for Wednesdays match against Rajasthan. The trio reached Delhi on Tuesday morning, from Australia via Hyderabad, and received an SOS from the team management. Late into the night they reached the city. Bengal need to win with a bonus point to stay in hunt for the title in the last set of matches. Delhi will also have to win by the same condition against Rajasthan to stay in contention. Dogged by injury worries, Bengal have called up Subhomoy Das to help the team ahead of Wednesdays tie against Tamil Nadu. The hosts, though, have no such plans as those of Delhi. Neither Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly nor Rohan Gavaskar will make themselves available in the match. If Bengal get the bonus point and Delhi dont, Mumbai and Bengal will finish on 13 each. Mumbai will then edge out Bengal on the head-to-head count. The same rule will make Delhi the winners if they get the bonus point and Bengal dont. If all finish on 13 points each, net run rate will settle the issue. Subhomoy, who was dropped from the Ranji squad, will come in for Nikhil Haldipur who has a groin injury. Sanjib Sanyal has also been ruled out with a shoulder problem. First-choice replacement Shib Sagar Singh is down with fever and the thinktank had to shelve plans of trying him out. Allrounder Dibyendu Chakraborty will, thus, take Sanyals place. Haldipurs unavailability will mean Deep Dasgupta open the innings with Arindam Das. Bengal are planning to bat second. Chasing a target will help us. We have to get the score in 40 overs to bag the bonus point. We have to go all out, coach Karsan Ghavri said. The batsmen are in good form and thats an advantage for us, he added. The coachs apprehensions about the newly laid-out pitch at the Jadavpur University Complex in Salt Lake were put to rest after over 500 runs were scored in the last game there. Both Ajay Jadeja and Rajat Bhatia scored centuries in Delhis 19-run win over Tamil Nadu in that match. I hope it (the pitch) plays well tomorrow as well, he said. Ghavri felt Sadagopan Ramesh and S. Sharath will be the men to watch out for in the visitors ranks. Ramesh is a good bat and can always change the course of a match. Well have to dismiss himcheaply, the Bengal coach maintained. It has been a satisfying season for Ghavri. After managing to cling on to the Elite group in the Ranji Trophy, East Zone won the Deodhar Trophy under his tutelage. The National one-day triumph could just be the icing on the cake for the Mumbai-based coach.  Krishna Kumar doubtful Rajasthan allrounder and vice-captain P. Krishna Kumar is uncertain for the crucial tie following a rib injury. His condition will be assessed on Wednesday morning. Medium pacer Sailendra Gehlot is also likely to make his debut.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick not taking Md. Sporting lightly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick passes a few tips to Alvito DCunha and Bhaichung Bhutia at the club ground on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Two draws in three matches would have, in any other circumstance, sent shockwaves and evoked calls for a post-mortem of East Bengals performance among their local support-base. But with the focus having shifted to the tournament in Leicester City, the early part of the Super Division is only being treated as a preparatory phase. Coach Subhas Bhowmick said as much on the eve of the clash against Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium, though he termed it as equally important. The match will be East Bengals last tie before their departure for England. I am not taking Mohammedan Sporting lightly, he said on Friday. They have a loyal and vociferous band of supporters who will throng the stadium. One has to admit it has an impact on the players, enabling them to give off their best. A full-strength side was present at the morning workouts on Friday but Bhowmick didnt clarify whether he would field all his top guns. The stress was on set-piece movements and utilising dead-ball situations. The game will be an opportunity for Bhowmick to check out the form and fitness of Bhaichung Bhutia and Douglas da Silva. Both were rested in the game against Eastern Railway after looking completely out of sorts versus Mohun Bagan. A second-string side managed a goalless draw with the railway side. Debjit Ghosh may be fielded on Saturday. Mohammedan Sportings performance has been anything but inspiring in the league so far. They launched their campaign with a fortuitious 2-1 win against CFC before going down to Peerless. Coach Mridul Banerjee, though, is still optimistic. He is hoping the underdogs tag might just spur the players. You cant bet on the outcome the unexpected cant be ruled out, he said after Friday mornings workout. A draw will be a big bonus and a morale booster for the black-and-white brigade.  Copyright

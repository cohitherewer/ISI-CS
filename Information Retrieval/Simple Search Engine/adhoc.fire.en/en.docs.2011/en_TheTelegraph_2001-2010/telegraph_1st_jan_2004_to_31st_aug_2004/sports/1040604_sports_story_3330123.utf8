				 																																	Colombo: Sri Lankan cricket officials have their eyes on a 17-year-old schoolboy who has the potential to become another spin wizard, a la Muttiah Muralidharan.				 																																	Sameera Ranatunga, who hails from the same Kandy region where Muralidharan grew up, was being groomed by his school coach to follow in the footsteps of the worlds top Test wicket-taker, according to report in a local newspaper. The young off-spinner is showing much promise and turns the ball as much as Muttiah Muralidharan does by following a similar action, the report said.				 																																	Ranatunga, no relation of 1996 World Cup-winning captain Arjunas, is being guided by the same coach who spotted Muralidharans talent as a schoolboy in Kandy.				 																																	London: France coach Jacques Santini will take over as head coach of English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur after Euro 2004, the club announced on Thursday. I am an ambitious man and it has always been a dream of mine to coach a big English club in the most exciting league in the world, he said. Tottenham, without a manager since Glenn Hoddle was sacked in September, finished 14th in the 20-team Premier League. 				 																																	France have lost only one of their 23 matches after the 53-year-old Santini was appointed national coach in July 2002.				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munich playmaker Michael Ballack was set to meet Barcelona president Joan Laporta and his deputy Sandro Rosell in Zurich next Monday to finalise a move to Spain. The Bild said Ballack, training with Germanys Euro 2004 squad, had been given permission by the German federation to make the trip after Sundays warm-up against Hungary. Barcelona, who were reported to have made a 15 million euro bid, were also chasing Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Bernd Schneider. 				 																																	Lisbon: Sacked Real Madrid coach Carlos Queiroz has confirmed he will to return to English Premiership side Manchester United as manager Sir Alex Fergusons assistant. And he has his sights set on becoming the future Old Trafford boss. Fergusons contract runs out in June 2006.				 																																	Queiroz, who was sacked after a disappointing first season as Real coach said he is set to put pen to paper. Its practically a done deal. There are just some legal details to sort out, Queiroz told the A Bola.				 																																	Lisbon: New Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says he walked away from Portos Champions League celebrations last month because he had been threatened. 				 																																	Mourinho was criticised in Portugal for not joining his players after their win over Monaco at Gelsenkirchen. He pulled off his winners medal and strode into the tunnel to find his young children. These serious threats, which targeted my family, caused me to change my behaviour, he said. 				 																																	He said he was forced to call on professionals after the death-threats on the eve of the match. 				 																																	Budapest: A Hungarian soccer player collapsed and died on the pitch during a training session, Hungarian website Nemzetisport reported on Thursday.				 																																	The cause of death of 26-year-old Istvan Szabo was not known. Szabo, from third division village team Uraiujfalu, is the second Hungarian footballer, after Miklos Feher to die on the pitch this year.Sport on ScreenTennis, French Open, Mens singles semi-finals, deferred live from 8.30 pm on TEN Sports

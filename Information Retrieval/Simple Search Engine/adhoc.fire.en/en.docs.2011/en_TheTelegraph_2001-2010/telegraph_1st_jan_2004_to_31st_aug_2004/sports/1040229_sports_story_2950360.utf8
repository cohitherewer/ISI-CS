 Rivaldo quits Cruzeiro
Rio de Janeiro, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Brazilian World Cup winner Rivaldo left Cruzeiro on Saturday after less than two months at the club in solidarity with coach Wanderley Luxemburgo who was fired the day before. I took the decision overnight, he said. I havent got (another) club, nothing like that. At the moment, Im being faithful to the coach who brought me here. Rivaldo failed to settle at the Brazilian champions, who he joined after spending most of the previous 18 months warming the substitutes bench at AC Milan. He played only ten competitive games for Cruzeiro, who have made an indifferent start to the season, and scored only two goals, both in last weekends 7-1 win over Mamore. He was frequently jeered by the Cruzeiro supporters. Cruzeiro spokesman Valdir Barbosa said the club had accepted Rivaldos decision even though he had signed a one-year contract when he joined on January 5.  Copyright

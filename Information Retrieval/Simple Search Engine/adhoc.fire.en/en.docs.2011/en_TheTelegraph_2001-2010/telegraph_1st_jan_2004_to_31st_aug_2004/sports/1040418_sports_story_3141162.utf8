The Telegraph - Calcutta
Dont pick on Shoaib for criticism
- Pakistan erred by not playing Younis Khan BY RASHID LATIF  Shoaib must have found out he was in no condition to bowl It makes me laugh when people suggest Shoaib Akhtar should have been in the field when India were piling up a massive score on the third day of the Rawalpindi Test. He should have tested himself out for an over or two is the popular refrain. How do they know he didnt check himself out? He must have done so in the nets prior to the days play and found out he wasnt in any condition to bowl. Please also do not pick him for throwing his bat around in the final moments of the Pakistan second innings. Someones physical condition can improve after an extra nights rest. No cricketer would hold himself back when the opposition is tightening the screws on a match. I also must clarify he never told me Inzamam-ul Haq was not giving him the field he wanted. Some imaginative writer has been working on this. At the end of it all, the truth is that the Pakistan fast bowlers failed to subdue the famed Indian batting line-up. Shoaib tried all through to get his outswinger going but could not summon it. Mohammed Sami was nowhere near his best and suffered from a fault in his action. Sami is a different force when he is able to bowl his outswingers. But in this series most of his deliveries, instead of leaving the batsmen, were going on to the pads and were easy pickings for the Indians. He also had a few rough decisions and dropped catches piled on his agony. How we wanted Umar Gul to be available in the final Test! He did in Lahore what Indian bowlers did throughout the series  bowl from stump to stump at a good length and allow the ball to move. Pakistan bowlers could not get the reverse-swing they wanted and, as I had said before the series began, Indians were too good to fall to reverse-swing alone. Pakistan should have picked Abdul Rauf at some stage of the series. . Indian bowlers, hitherto believed to be the weak link, also operated out of their skin. Lakshmipathy Balaji was splendid in the final Test and Irfan Pathan throughout the series. Rahul Dravid is a mobile coaching clinic. You just have to watch and imbibe his technique. Pakistan were on a roll after Sehwags first-ball dismissal, but he just blunted them and was rock-solid. I also think it is wrong for critics to pick on Virender Sehwag or V.V.S. Laxman for their technical deficiency. All the Indian batsmen have a remarkable body-balance at the point of executing strokes. It gives them very good control. The Indians finally appear to have a good combination. The team has been together for the last two or three years and it is now well settled. Pakistan did not have batsmen who could match them. . Pakistan erred greatly by not including Younis Khan. He has five centuries in 15 Tests and could have steadied the innings. . Most of the Pakistan batsmen were falling over and playing away from their body. They looked worse in the second innings but then it is understandable. After fielding for two days in the sun, it is difficult for openers to get their feet going. They needed better footwork to survive the moving ball. It is not as if the sun has set on Pakistan cricket. We have always been blessed with exceptional talent and we dont lack them even today. But we need proper people to run the show. The chairman of our board is weak and so is the case with the coach and manager.  (PTI)  Copyright

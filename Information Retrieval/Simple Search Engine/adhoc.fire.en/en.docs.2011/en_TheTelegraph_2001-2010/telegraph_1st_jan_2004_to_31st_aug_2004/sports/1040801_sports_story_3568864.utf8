The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Too close to call, says Moin Khan
	 - THE NEUTRAL VIEW FROM COLOMBO  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Moin Khan says both teams have strong points Colombo, July 31: Tomorrows Asia Cup final is too close to call  that, at least, is the opinion of former Pakistan captain and current keeper Moin Khan. Frankly, I cant pick the winner... Both India and Sri Lanka look good and, really, either a veteran or one of the younger players could make all the difference, Moin, who has stayed back for a day, told The Telegraph this afternoon. Moin and Shoaib Akhtar  who has commitments with an Indian TV channel  apart, the rest of the Pakistan team left for home yesterday. According to Moin, both finalists have strong points, but the past isnt going to matter significantly: I wont read much into Indias win on Tuesday... After all, in the earlier round, India finished losers... What counts is performing on the day in question... One-day cricket mein aap aur kya boliye ga? Obviously, Moin is disappointed that Pakistan got knocked out, but said the season had just begun. He added: We will get better. Incidentally, owing to the PCB-imposed ban on interacting with the Media  captain Inzamam-ul Haq is, of course, exempt and Shoaib has special permission  Moin declined to be drawn into the bonus point controversy. Conceding that, to India, put Pakistan on the exit-road even though they won the game by all of 59 runs.  Copyright

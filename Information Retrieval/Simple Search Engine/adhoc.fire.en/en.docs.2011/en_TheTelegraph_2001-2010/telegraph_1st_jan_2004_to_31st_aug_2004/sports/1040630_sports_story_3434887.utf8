 - Capriati sets up quarters date with Serena

(Reuters) London: Wimbledons teenage upstarts were upstaged by the stolid establishment of womens tennis on Tuesday as the old guard stamped their mark on the championships. Holder and top seed Serena Williams and fellow former world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport both swatted teenagers aside while Jennifer Capriati stomped on young Russian Nadia Petrova. But 17-year-old Siberian sensation Maria Sharapova bucked the trend, beating Japanese 11th seed Ai Sugiyama 5-7, 7-5, 6-1 to reach the semi-finals of a Grand Slam for the first time. The 13th seed, left out of the Russian Fed Cup team earlier on Tuesday, said: This moment ... I am speechless, really... I always wanted to play on Centre Court but never thought about reaching the semi-finals. She will face 1999 champion and fifth seed Davenport in the last four after the 28-year-old American thrashed Croatian teenager Karolina Sprem 6-2, 6-2. Rain delays earlier in the tournament meant the top half of the draw was a round behind, playing to reach the quarters, and Serena meted out the most one-sided scoreline of the day. The twice champion flattened 16-year-old French girl Tatiana Golovin 6-2, 6-1 to reach the last eight. Serena pummelled the fastest serve ever by a woman at Wimbledon  a 126 miles per hour (202.8 kph) scorcher  and gave Golovin the runaround from the start. But still she felt she could have done better. Golovin claimed she had been neither overawed nor overpowered and that next time she would beat Serena, although how much of that can be put down to 16-year-old bravado is debatable. Playing Serena ... of course, beating her for the first time, would be really amazing. But Ill do it next time. Im getting used to the big courts. However, it will take more than a familiarity with the worlds showcourts to enable Golovin to beat Serena. Someone with a much better chance of wrestling Serenas crown from her is Jennifer Capriati, the fellow American who beat her in the quarter-finals of the French Open last month and who plays her in the quarters here next. Capriati swatted aside Russias 10th seed Nadia Petrova 6-4, 6-4 in the fourth round. Also in the top half French fourth seed Amelie Mauresmo moved into the quarters, outfoxing Italys Silvia Farina Elia 7-5, 6-3. She will face Paola Suarez next after the Argentine beat Italys Rita Grande. Paes-Martina up Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova advanced to the third round of mixed doubles on Tuesday. The Indo-US combine won 6-1, 6-3 against Sebastien Prieto of Argentina and Emmannelle Gagliardi of Switzerland. On Sunday, Paes and Czech partner David Rikl had bowed out of the mens doubles, losing in the second round.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Mahindra down Goans
			Margao: Mahindra United registered a 2-1 win over Haywards Sporting Club in the National League on Wednesday. With this win, the Mumbai team which has 19 points from 11 outings, moved into the second spot behind Dempo, who have 21 points from 10 matches. Sporting have 15 points from 11 matches. Haywards SC started on a positive note and were leading by a goal at half time through a injury-time strike by Bibiano Fernandes. But Mahindra were rewarded in the 79th minute when substitute S. Venkatesh capitalised on a lapse by Sporting goalkeeper Richard Sanchez to restore parity. Minutes later Steven Dias guided the ball in the net after Sanchez blocked Venkateshs shot from inside the box to give Mahindras a 2-1 lead.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lokuarachchi set to return
 - There is no greater challenge than taking on Australia: Atapattu  Adam Gilchrist attends to his knees after a practice session in Colombo on Monday. (AP) Colombo: Sri Lankan leg-spinner Kaushal Lokuarachchi, coming off a suspension after allegedly causing a fatal accident, is likely to return in the upcoming matches against Australia, Sri Lankan Cricket (SLC) said Monday. Lokuarachchi is in the list of probables and that makes him a strong contender for the final XI, said SLC spokesman Ray Illangakoon. Lokuarachchi may play in the solitary limited-overs warm-up game against Australia Tuesday, followed by the two one-dayers starting Friday. SLC suspended Lokuarachchi from all forms of cricket until December 31 in September, after the car he was driving allegedly hit a woman and her son in a Colombo suburb while the cricketer was returning from a late night party. The mother died in a hospital while her son was badly injured. Lokuarachchi, 21, was released on Rs 50,000 bail. His trial date will be set after the attorney generals office files charges against him, said S. Priyantha, a police officer at the Kadawatha police station situated near the accident site. Now that the ban time is over, he is free to show his potential, Illangakoon said. SLC experts believe Lokuarachchi has the potential to replace Muthiah Muralidharan. The SLC has rejected an Australian proposal to allow their entire 15-man squad to play in Tuesdays practice match. We have told them we may agree to 12-a-side match, not 15, SLC vice-president Aravinda de Silva said. Sri Lankas ODI captain Maravan Atapattu has said the world champions will find it difficult to cope with turning tracks and hot weather. Aussies surely will depend on comeback star Brett Lees fine form, turners notwithstanding. Australia have always struggled to do justice to their stature in Sri Lanka where they have so far won just three of their 14 ODIs. Sri Lanka beat Steve Waughs team in a triangular series final in 1999 before reasserting their home supremacy with a seven-wicket win over Ricky Pontings team in the 2003 Champions Trophy semi-final. The heat and slow pitches are a factor that would be a matter of concern, Atapattu. I am sure the climatic conditions are going to surprise them. Whether we like it or not, we get turning tracks during this time of the year. Atapattu said his team was ready for Australia as victory over the world champions would be a great achievement. There is no greater challenge than taking on Australia. Everyone is keen to get on the park. Playing on home soil and in front of our own crowd will be our greatest strength. Atapattu said his team will play attacking cricket. Australia is more attacking than any other team in the world. We should try and give them a hard time. It is not that we are going to lose all five matches, we can match them at their own game.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

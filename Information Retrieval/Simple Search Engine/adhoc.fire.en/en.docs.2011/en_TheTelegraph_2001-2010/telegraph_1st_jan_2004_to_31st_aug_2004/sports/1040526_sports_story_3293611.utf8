The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jones still under doping shadow
 The chapter hasnt closed for Marion Jones San Francisco: Olympic track star Marion Jones said on Monday that the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) does not have her old blood or urine samples that she could use to clear her name of steroid use and compete in Athens. Her lawyer Joseph Burton said the agency might have other evidence that could be used to stop her from competing in the 2004 Olympics where she has a chance at five gold medals. Burton said he and Jones met for three hours on Monday with officials of the anti-doping agency  a meeting she requested and one in which Burton said Jones answered every question. The meeting came amid growing concerns about steroid use among top track and field athletes after indictments against the San Francisco area BALCO lab earlier this year. Four people have been indicted in the scandal including two BALCO executives. Jones, who has always denied steroid use, was a witness before the grand jury in the case. Jones former husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter, tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone four times before the 2000 Olympics and decided to retire in March 2001. The re-testing of old blood and urine samples is an issue because new tests can detect designer steroids that did not show up in previous laboratory analyses. Burton released a May 19 letter from USADA chief executive Terry Madden in which the agency admitted not having the old samples but said that would not bar investigation. It is not unprecedented for USADA and other anti-doping agencies to proceed with disciplinary action against athletes based on evidence other than positive tests and admissions, Madden wrote in the May 19 letter.Indeed, where evidence of doping exists, we are compelled to go forward. Burton questioned the fairness of the USADA investigation if the agency has no tests to suggest steroid use. There is certain information that they have what they would term evidence that I would gather that they would want to think about whether it provides the basis to go forward, Burton said. I think the point is they dont have tests and that should be the basis for going forward. USADA legal affairs director Travis Tygart said in a statement that the agency would continue to investigate information related to BALCO. To avoid any subsequent misunderstanding we had asked if Ms. Jones would agree to have a court reporter present at the meeting or otherwise have it recorded. She would not agree, he said. Without further comments on the substance of the meeting, USADA does confirm that Ms. Jones was given documents related to its investigation, which she took with her. Jones meeting with USADA came just days after American sprinter Kelli White, 27, admitted taking the drugs and accepted the minimum ban for her first offence involving the use of prohibited substances. She accepted a two-year suspension for taking banned drugs. In recent weeks Jones has found herself under intense pressure to explain her relationship with BALCO. I have co-operated fully and in good faith with the Justice Departments investigation, she said in her statement. There is nothing more I can do. It is time to allow me to put this issue behind me once and for all and focus all of my energy on where it should be focussed  bringing home some gold medals for the US from Athens.

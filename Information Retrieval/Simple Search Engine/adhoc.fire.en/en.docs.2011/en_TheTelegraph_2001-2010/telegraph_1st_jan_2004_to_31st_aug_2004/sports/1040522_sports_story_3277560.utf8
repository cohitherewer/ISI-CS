 Camp shifted to Delhi 
New Delhi: Springing a surprise, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) cancelled the on-going fitness camp in Barog on Friday while including a fresh destination  the United States  in their Olympic training itinerary. The Barog camp was scheduled to continue till Thursday but the players will now travel to Delhi and continue training there so that formalities for their US journey can be completed. We have shifted the Barog camp to Delhi since the presence of players is required for visa and other travel documents for going to United States where we would be having a fitness camp, an IHF official said. Weve decided to have a two-phase training camp  the first in US followed by Germany, he said, adding the players would leave for US as soon as travel formalities are completed. The venue of the US camp is undecided yet but it would be attended by 18 players including the nine who had earlier been named for the camp in Germany. The camp slated to be held in Chandigarh from May 27 stands cancelled. Meanwhile, Indian hockey is all set to go hi-tech with the introduction of a special software aimed to help the custodian in identifying his mistakes and taking corrective measures accordingly in less time.

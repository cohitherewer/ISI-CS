The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fixtures come in for flak 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Indian Football Association is in a desperate hurry to finish the Super Division league on schedule. And if one studies the fixtures, the message that comes out is clearly against the players. No care has been taken whatsoever, in giving the players any rest. East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, for example, play three matches this week (Sunday to Saturday), and Mohammedan Sporting arent getting any rest either. Club officials arent too eager to address this situation, though coaches are aghast. Mohun Bagan assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury said: The IFA did discuss this aspect with us before the league, but we do understand that the IFA is in a fix about grounds and the tight scheduling We had to agree. Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said: This is an extreme actually, but this can happen only in India. We have to go by it. East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said: The IFA draws the schedule in consultation with club officials, so I cant possibly comment on it. But as far as I know, three matches a week for a team dont happen elsewhere in the world. It surely happens in IFA secretary Subrata Duttas world. And to hell with the player.  Copyright

 Murali doosra cast in video
New Delhi: Muttiah Muralidharan has devised a novel way to silence his detractors, who have accused the spin wizard of bowling with a wrong action. Frustrated with the criticism and the ICC ban on his doosra,the Sri Lankan has come up with a video which shows him bowling with a cast on his arm which does not allow him to bend the arm beyond the defined limit. The ICC has defined a tolerance in arm bend (flex) for fast bowlers. But there is no such defined flex for slow bowlers. To show to people that my doosra is legitimate, I have done a video where I have bowled with a cast on my arm, Muralithran has said in a TV programme to be telecast on Tuesday. The cast does not allow me to bend beyond the defined limit. I have delivered the doosra with that cast on. I will circulate that video when it is ready to show people that I am not doing anything wrong, said Murali, the highest Test wicket-taker with 532. Its frustrating to have to justify myself even after achieving so much in world cricket. Every time the question has been raised, I have felt that way. First they said my off-spin was not good. They went into a test and then said that off-spin is okay. Now they say doosra is not good enough and I cant bowl it. Muralis action was reported to the ICC by Match Referee Chris Broad after the Australia-Sri Lanka series in Sri Lanka earlier this year. Though subsequent tests did not find anything wrong with Muralis normal deliveries, his doosra  that spins away from the right-hander  was deemed improper.  (PTI)  Copyright

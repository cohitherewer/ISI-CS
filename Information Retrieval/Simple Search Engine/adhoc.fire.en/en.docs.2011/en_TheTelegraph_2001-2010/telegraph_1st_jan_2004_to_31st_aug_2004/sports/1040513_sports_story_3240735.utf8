The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Overdose of gym at top level, says Borde 
 - Natural Chopra gets ex-India captains vote  BY A STAFF REPORTER  NCA coach Chandu Borde demonstrates the finer points of batting to a couple of eastern zonal academy trainees at the Jadavpur Universitys Salt Lake campus on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: A sweltering, leisurely afternoon at the Jadapur Universitys second campus in Salt Lake, a camp of the eastern zonal centre of the National Cricket Academy is set to start. Assistant coach Dattatreya Mukherjee warms up under a shady tree as chief coach Ashok Malhotra taxis in, in his Toyota Qualis. The kids roll in, brought in from their airconditioned rooms of a city hotel, 21 of them aspirants, fancy sunglasses guarding eyes against the evil of the suns rays, sun block preventing skin-strain. Mineral water bottles and glasses of nimbu-pani (mainline prescribed ORS) go down quickly. Much activity is expected. After all, this is the zonal centre of the national school, from which we should one day see another Sourav Ganguly emerge (the weird analogy is because there hasnt yet been any name worth his salt emerging from the zone). And then you notice that white Indica. Chandu Borde, former Test batting star, captain, former chairman of selectors and coach of the NCA (batting advisor) arrives. Its 3.10 pm. Borde gets into the act, and for two hours helps the kids through batting practice, stance correction and more ORS. When he speaks, he talks about feeling. He says he sees promise, (I need the four days here to make an assessment), but at the top level he sees an overdose of exercise, and gym and power. Cut down the gym, cut down the physical strain, put them back at nets, let them feel the game, get them to adjust mentally, let their bodies adjust and co-operate. Its a motto, he says, he will try to push into the NCA brass heads. Look, players today dont get the chance to recover. They either are in match situations or in gym situations Your body needs to get the natural recovery time. TLC, in other words. Cricket, after all, is a gentlemans genteel pastime. Adrenaline isnt an interesting topic. But Borde has a point, or three. The (Ashish) Nehras of the world are generally injury-prone, like Salil Ankola was Thats the physiological situation he points at; and then comes the stress factor (where the Umar Guls, the Shoaib Akhtars fall, too). And natural selection is a special accent for Borde. The same standards, almost. Talk about the opener issue for the national team, the Akash Chopra-Yuvraj Singh issue, and he talks about choosing the one who is a natural, one who wants to. Chopra has done his job at the top very well He has seen off the new ball, helped take the shine off, and settled the batters innings in. Hes a natural. Borde doesnt say it in as many words, but read his lips, perhaps, and he isnt liking the Yuvraj talk. As to the zonal academy and the NCA, he feels it is a great opportunity for the kids. And what happens when they have gone through the paces and are left with no more than their personalised CDs and memories? Look one has to join a club to play for their states, and use whatever they have learned in whatever they do. Thats the way to improve, thats the way to the top, thats the way to continue the good work. So many are now in the B category, it takes a big push to move to A category Its upto you, really. The help has been handed down, with attendant paraphernalia. And requisite TLC. The kids are pretty steamed out by now, and run to the shades and pant, cold nimbu-pani in hand, sandwiches and bananas waiting. A hard-afternoons afternoon. The campers go to Bangalore for a meet where they take on a combined team first. Depending on whether they travel by train or fly (and thats a big possibility), the camp here ends on May 23 or 24. Borde leaves May 16.  Copyright

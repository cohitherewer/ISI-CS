 Rio Ferdinand slams FA 
 - It is not possible for anyone to forget a drug test now I was the scapegoat  Ferdinand praised Erikkson for supporting him London: Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has criticised the Football Association (FA) for trying to get his eight-month suspension for missing a drugs test increased. I cant believe what the FA have done to me, the England international told the Sun newspaper on Saturday. What is it that they want? They have made their point, no player will ever miss a drug test again. The FA wanted Ferdinands ban extended to 12 months but the independent commission that heard his appeal on Thursday decided to leave it unchanged. It is not possible for anyone to forget to take one (a drug test) now. I have been made the scapegoat and the rules have been changed in the light of what has happened to me. Ive always accepted that I missed the test. But I think most people now realise it was a genuine mistake, even those at the FA. So why did they find it necessary to push for such a harsh punishment? The 25-year-old will not be able to play again until September 20, ruling him out of the rest of the Premier League season and the European Championship. Ive had huge support from my family, fans, players and mates from all over the country, he told the Sun. But there are people who work or represent the FA around the England scene who I thought were friends. And they just didnt want to know me once this whole drug-test problem started. Ferdinand praised England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson for his backing.Sven supported me from the start and it was fantastic he was not afraid to state his feelings publicly, he said. Sven rang me on a number of occasions to tell me he had his fingers crossed and that he hoped that I could be with him at the European Championship in Portugal. Ferdinand also thanked Manchester United, who signed him for 30 million from Leeds United in 2002, for their support, particularly his manager Alex Ferguson. From the start the club have been right behind me, he said. Mr Ferguson never had a go at me and said hed back me whatever decisions I took. He left it up to me but said hed be there if I needed help. My future is at this club. Im only sorry I havent been there to do my bit when theyve needed me. Since Ferdinand began his suspension on January 20, United have had the worst defensive record in the Premier League, slipping 12 points behind Arsenal and failing to reach the Champions League quarters.

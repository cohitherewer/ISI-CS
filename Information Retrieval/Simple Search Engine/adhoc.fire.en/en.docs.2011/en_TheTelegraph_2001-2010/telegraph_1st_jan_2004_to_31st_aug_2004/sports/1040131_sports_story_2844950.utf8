The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A rebel called Agassi
 - The American is the last saviour of mens tennis: Pat Cash  BY ROBERT PHILIP  Though not an artist like McEnroe, Agassi is just as exciting When Andre Agassi first appeared before us 18 years ago, it is fair to say precious few liked the cut of his jib. As a mullet-haired, brash and bumptious Las Vegan teenager, there was something about his personality that grated. Perhaps it was his tendency to greet a particularly flashy winner by screeching: Eeee-haaa!. Maybe it was his weird and wonderful sense of dress (he looked more like a kid playing basketball in Brooklyn than a tennis player), or simply the swaggering cockiness he displayed, but the friends of Andre were few. Like Madonna, however, Agassi has always had the happy knack of reinventing himself, from rebel without a cause to the idol of millions, from fast-living bachelor to marriage and fatherhood under the calming influence of Steffi Graf, from perennial under-achiever to one of the greatest players of his or any other generation. As one of only five men to have won all four Major championships (following Rod Laver, Donald Budge, Fred Perry and Roy Emerson), Agassi has long since won our hearts. A legion of fans were disappointed, therefore, when defeat at the hands of the Russian, Marat Safin, in the semi-finals of the Australian Open cost him the chance of bidding for his ninth Grand Slam title on Sunday. Three months short of his 34th birthday, this setback may hasten Agassis retirement at the end of the season and tennis is sure going to miss him when he rides off into the Nevada sunset with Mrs A. After John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors retired, Andre was the saviour of mens tennis, says Pat Cash. He has been tremendous for the game by capturing the imagination of youngsters the world over. The sport owes him a huge vote of thanks. Look around the locker room, bemoans Ilie Nastase. Twenty years ago you would have seen Borg, Ashe, Rosewall, Orantes, Panatta. Great players, but also great personalities. In the future, maybe youll still see great players, but where have the personalities gone? Tennis needs new heroes, players who will attract a younger audience. Andre has been really quite brilliant for the game. Hes not an artist like McEnroe or Santana, but hes just as exciting to watch, yes? As a man, Agassi has also grown in stature over the years, raising more than $30 million for the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, launched to provide educational and recreational opportunities for at-risk children in the Las Vegas area.  A great champion on court, Andre Agassi has also emerged as a great champion of those born without hope. The Daily Telegraph  Copyright

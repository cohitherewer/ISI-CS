The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004  Bold Raider for Stakes 
 BY STAR RACER Calcutta:It may pay to  follow jockey B. Prakash in Wednesdays seven-event race  card which also features the Calcutta Fillies Trial Stakes,  the first classic of the monsoon season. Prakash has accepted  five rides on the day, including Bold Raider in the Trial  Stakes. Bold Raider, from Daniel Davids yard, is a winner of three races from her seven starts. The Diffident-Cadenza filly has also run her rivals close in races she got beaten. The challenge to Bold Raider may come from her stable-mates  Regal Fortune, the easy winner of the 1,600m Grand Annual Handicap last winter and Make A Wish who is also well in at the weights.				 										Prakashs other rides  La Fantasie, Gallant Romeo, Royal Command and Predecessor may take some beating in their respective events. Accuser and Gypsy King, on the other hand, may win trainer Bharath Singh the other trophy events.Read as Sl no, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

Bottom (from left): Karthik, Kumble, Harbhajan , Agarkar, Nehra, Balaji and PathanCalcutta: The injury-prone Zaheer Khan has been rested, while rookie wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik is in Team India for the tri-series in Holland and the two tournaments in England  the bilateral NatWest Challenge and the Champions Trophy. Significantly, Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar has made it as the XVth player for Holland and the series versus England. He wont, of course, be around for the September 10-25 Champions Trophy. As expected, Ajit Agarkar has taken Zaheers place. Karthik, who got the nod ahead of Bihars Mahender Singh Dhoni, is going to occupy the slot held by Parthiv Patel. That Parthiv will be dropped was, in fact, reported by The Telegraph in Thursdays edition, hours before the present selection committee (Syed Kirmani, Kirti Azad, Pranab Roy, Kiran More and Sanjay Jagdale) met for one last time ahead of the Boards AGM. According to well-placed sources, Karthik made the cut largely because he is seen as a better batsman.  Rohan Gavaskar will be the 15th member for the first two meetsAs one source put it: When the discussion warmed up, just about everybody felt it would be unfair to ignore somebody with a hundred in both the semis and final (for Tamil Nadu) of the last Ranji Trophy Moreover, a few days ago, Karthik scored 96 against the Zimbabwe Select XI One understands captain Sourav Ganguly had left it to the selectors. If you feel Karthik is better suited for our needs, I dont have a problem, he told the quintet. Sourav and coach John Wright have been keen on a wicketkeeper who, if necessary, can be counted upon to contribute with the bat as well in ODIs. Parthiv, though, is going to remain choice No.1 when the next Test series, versus Australia at home, gets underway in two months. While there wasnt any debate over Agarkar (currently doing well for Middlesex), some time was spent over the extra berth for the first two engagements. Indeed, the selectors picked the Champions Trophy XIV and, then, deliberated on the XVth spot. Gavaskar, who went to Australia as Mohammed Kaifs replacement for the tri-series at the start of this year, got a headstart when the selectors were informed rival Hemang Badani has an ankle problem. It then became a Gavaskar-Dinesh Mongia clash, with the selectors opting for continuity instead of recalling somebody who has been in the dumps for 16 months. That Mongia figured rather strongly in the discussions is itself quite remarkable given that he didnt feature in the pre-season list of 20 probables. Mongia came into the picture after handsome performances for Lancashire in the ongoing County season. Quite sensibly, the Board isnt asking Karthik and Gavaskar to abandon the India A squad, now in Africa, and rush home in time for the August 17 departure. Agarkar too has been asked to head for Amsterdam from where he is  London. Meanwhile, Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya reviewed Team Indias show in the Asia Cup, specifically the final against Sri Lanka, when he interacted with Sourav and Wright before the selection meeting. Dalmiya wasnt available for comment, but one learns he expressed deep disappointment at the way an eminently attainable target (229) was messed up. The Board president also spoke (over the phone) to physio Andrew Leipus, seeking clarifications on Zaheer. After all, not many days ago (in Colombo), Leipus gave Zaheer the green signal after a fitness test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Day of the bulls ahoy
 - This could be the Azzurris year  BY HENRY WINTER Students at university in Coimbra, where England engage Switzerland next Thursday, host a bizarre annual competition. Bull-fighting is the rag-week sport of choice among Coimbras intelligentsia, who then graduate in gowns and bandages. Over at Coimbras Old Cathedral (distinct from the New Cathedral which is a mere 400 years old), the altarpiece proudly carries a carving of a pig playing the bagpipes. They love their swine in Portugal; one local delicacy, papas de sarrabulho, is pigs blood stew. So welcome to Portugal, to a voyage of discovery. Even Euro 2004s odd-looking match ball is named Roteiro, honouring the logbook used by Vasco da Gama. Welcome to a four-week quest for glory affording genuine hopes of victory for England laced with familiar fears of hooliganism. Welcome to a land rich in history, architecture, scenery, gored students and a joyous passion for football which could make this summer odyssey memorable. As a competition, the Euros gleam with more intensity and danger than the World Cup, offering no respite in group stages fraught with ambushes. Of the fancied runners, only Italy enjoy a straightforward-looking section, and are this observers choice to contest the July 4 final with France. Englands drive towards a re-match with France, whom they open against Sunday, may run into a semi-final roadblock called Gigi Buffon, Alessandro Nesta, Francesco Totti and Christian Vieri. This could be the Azzurris year. Any team declaring any frailty to customs at Lisbon, Porto or Faro airports may just as well seek stand-by on the first return flight home. Unlike Fifas global pageant that invites the occasional makeweight, brutal inspections of teams strengths and weaknesses are conducted from the first whistle in Uefas summer hothouse. England versus France, Germany versus Holland: the road to Lisbon begins at full throttle. Just feel the quality. France, inevitably, are favourites, understandably so with a cast list plucked from the front-page pin-ups of World Soccer magazine. Thierry Henry, Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira are icons on a mission. Spain rarely travel well but should make it over the border, guided by the technical class flowing from Iker Casillas, Xabi Alonso, Vicente Rodriquez, Raul, Fernando Morientes and one of the potential young stars, Fernando Torres. Portugal may shine if Deco is unleashed. Germany have little to offer, beyond Vorsprung Durch Taktik. No flair. Just organisation. Guaranteed stadium-clearers. Holland, if they focus on being united, possess class acts in Ruud van Nistelrooy, Edgar Davids and the youngsters Rafael van der Vaart, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder. Chelsea fans will be intrigued by watching Robben and the Czech Republic goalkeeper, Petr Cech. The Czechs deserve respect simply for the busy involvement of Pavel Nedved. Making hundreds of millions from all these star turns will be the commercial men, exploiting the events lustre. En route to the venues, fans will explore the beaches of Faro in the south via the bagpipe-playing pig in Coimbra to the aristocratic port houses of Oporto in the north, where Manchester United fans have taken to enjoying three-hour lunches on Champions League match days. The Portuguese anticipate 500,000 fans from the 15 visiting nations, the biggest wave coming from England. The global TV audience is estimated at nine billion. The interest is phenomenal; even the least alluring game, Czech Republic-Latvia, is being covered by 313 newspaper reporters, while 360 photographers are getting their Nikons in a twist over the fight to gain accreditation for England-France. The Algarve Stadium in Faro, where England met Portugal in February, is stunning, with two high stands. Aveiro carries shades of a gaudy high-tech cake. The roof rippling around Leirias four sides resembles a wave. Braga has already been called a work of art with its steel cables and rocky backdrop. Portugals modern sporting citadels are designed by architects who understand that fans need to be close to the action. Coimbra apart, the touchline is almost within touching distance from the tribunes. Capacities are intimate: seven of the stadia (including Coimbra) are 30,000-seat arenas. These are real football homes in a real football country. Euro 2004 is in good hands. This expanding brainchild of Henri Delaunay, the erstwhile secretary of the French Football Federation, has thrown up many famous images in its 44 years. The memories are unfading: Michel Platini lighting up Euro 84, Marco van Basten toying with Tony Adams and then volleying that goal in the final. Euro 96 brought a long hot summer when Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer tore Holland apart, when David Seaman was given a standing ovation at the centre court at Wimbledon, when Stuart Pearce punched the air and screamed in delight as his successful penalty brought redemption for Turin 90. Football was coming home. It felt that 30 years of hurt might just end until Gareth Southgates missed penalty sent a nation into mourning. Why didnt you just blast it? inquired Southgates mother. The semis beckon again for England. At least the Italians are bad at penalties. Portugal promises an exhilarating time. Maybe Coimbras finest minds could take Englands thickest bull-fighting.

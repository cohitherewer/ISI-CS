 Fixing alert for Pakistan team
Islamabad: Pakistan players have been warned by the PCB to be very cautious of attempts by the illegal betting mafia which may employ fancy fixing methods to influence outcome of matches in the Asia Cup. The players, before leaving for Sri Lanka on Tuesday, were issued a note of caution by the PCB following advice and feedback from ICCs anti-corruption unit (ACU), PCB chief Shaharyar Khan said. The ACU told us to caution our players to be very aware of such attempts by the betting mafia operating from Pakistan, India, Dubai and other countries, Shaharyar was quoted as saying in a Pakistan newspaper.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI to seek clarifications
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has put on hold the awarding of telecast rights for the next four years. The BCCIs marketing committee did meet in Calcutta on Tuesday, but decided not to take a decision till clarifications had been sought from the highest bidders  Zee Telefilms ($ 260 million) and ESPN-STAR Sports ($ 230 million). According to The Telegraphssources, the BCCI wants to be satisfied with the track record of the top bidders as also the manner of their payment before deciding on a tie-up. Also, particularly where Zee is concerned, the BCCI wants to be clear about its experience vis--vis telecasting cricket events. Bottomline, of course, is that the BCCI isnt rushing into an arrangement and, so, no movement is expected till after the August 21-28 tri-series in Holland.  Copyright

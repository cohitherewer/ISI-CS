 WI need better stadiums: Bacher
 Bacher feels Windies can do a good job Barbados: Ali Bacher has said he is confident the West Indies can stage a successful World Cup in 2007 despite fears that their infrastructure is not good enough to hold the sports biggest event. Security worries, under-developed stadiums and a lack of planning have led many to suggest that the region will not be suitably equipped to cope with the World Cups demands. Bacher, speaking in Barbados on Tuesday, said he believed it would be a success. I am confident that there is plenty of time to get things into place, Bacher said. Having served as managing director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa and as executive director of the 2003 World Cup, Bacher knows what it takes to stage the sports biggest event. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity  dont throw it away, Bacher warned. Youve got to invest in improving the stadia, as if you dont do it now you never will. Many of the West Indies grounds need updating, while the cities will have to cope with an estimated 100,000 fans arriving to support the 16 teams involved. The allocation of tickets during the Test series against England was also an issue, with more tickets sold to visitors than home supporters. I understand that there is a process underway to plan everything, Bacher said. You have some wonderful attributes here  wonderful people, great islands and with a chance to expand cricket. Bacher said safety would be one of the toughest challenges facing the events organisers. I think security will be the big issue, he said. We live in a world of increasing terrorism and you have to be very conservative and make sure everything is right. While stressing the problems, Bacher also emphasised the opportunity that staging an event like the World Cup can bring to a region. At the 2003 World Cup, 1.5 billion people around the world watched South Africa at the opening ceremony and the same thing will happen in 2007. You have a great tourist industry here and a great opportunity to make it a success.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India win
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bennet King believes India are one of the favourites for the under-19 World Cup in Dhaka while Robin Singh says, Well hopefully reach the final. The hosts wrapped up the three-match preparatory series 3-0 at Eden Gardens on Sunday. Chasing 308, the visitors folded up for 282. Shikar Dhawan stole the limelight for India with a well-paced 127. The Delhi under-19 opener took advantage of the poor fielding. Callum Ferguson, one of the three Academy boys in the Australian squad, also put in a spirited display with some superb strokeplay but fell nine short of his hundred. Ken Skewes gave him good support. The Indian bowlers, however, dashed their hopes in the closing stages. Skipper Ambati Rayudu failed with the bat but claimed four vital wickets to force a collapse. The Indian innings revolved around Dhawan as all other batsmen failed to build on their starts. The second highest in the innings was extras at 42. The left-handed Dhawan hit into the open spaces with ease and was brilliant in running between the wickets. Rayudu and Dhawans batting along with the allround showing of Suresh Raina is sure to give the coach some optimism to look forward to in the coming days. I had put the boys through a tough training session on Saturday and they all woke up stiff this morning, King said of the teams poor fielding. His Indian counterpart was looking for some more consistency from the medium-pacers. It will be a question of sticking to the basics and mixing pace between deliveries. But the boys are fast improving. Both teams will have a couple of practice matches in Bangladesh before the tournament begins.  Copyright

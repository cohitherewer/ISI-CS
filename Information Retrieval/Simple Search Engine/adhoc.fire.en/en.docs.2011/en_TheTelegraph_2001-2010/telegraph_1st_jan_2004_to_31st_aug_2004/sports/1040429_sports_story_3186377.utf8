 Popov loses election
Moscow: Four-time Olympic champion Alexander Popov failed in his bid to become president of the Russian swimming federation on Wednesday. He lost by 33 votes to 40 in his effort to oust incumbent Gennady Alyoshin. Popov lost despite receiving heavy backing from several top Russian sports officials, including IOC vice-president Vitaly Smirnov, president of the Russian Olympic Committee Leonid Tyagachyov and the countrys sports minister Vyacheslav Fetisov. In his election campaign, Popov, among the greatest swimmers of all time, promised sweeping changes in Russian swimming, including giving a huge financial boost to the sport. If elected, Popov had promised to return permanently from Switzerland to live in Moscow to have a better grip on the federations needs. (Reuters)  Copyright

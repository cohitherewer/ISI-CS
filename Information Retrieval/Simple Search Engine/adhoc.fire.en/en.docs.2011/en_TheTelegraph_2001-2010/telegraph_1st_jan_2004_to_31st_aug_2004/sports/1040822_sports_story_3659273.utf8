 Russian lifter tests positive
Athens: Russia pulled former womens world superheavyweight champion weightlifter Albina Khomich from the Athens Olympics on Saturday after she tested positive for a banned steroid, Russian team officials said. She has been withdrawn from the competition, team spokesman Gennady Shvets said. We are awaiting the results of a B test. Further action regarding her career would not be taken before the second set of results was known, he added. But since she was due to compete in the over 75 kg class later on Saturday, she had been withdrawn from the Games. Khomich, who turns 28 on Tuesday, had tested positive for the steroid methandrostenalone, one Russian Olympic source said. She won the world title at Antalya in 2001 and has finished second in the class in the past two world championships. At least eight other weightlifters have been hit by doping bans during the Athens Games. The sport was threatened with exclusion from the Olympic movement after doping marred the weightlifting tournament at the 2000 Games in Sydney. (Agencies)  Copyright

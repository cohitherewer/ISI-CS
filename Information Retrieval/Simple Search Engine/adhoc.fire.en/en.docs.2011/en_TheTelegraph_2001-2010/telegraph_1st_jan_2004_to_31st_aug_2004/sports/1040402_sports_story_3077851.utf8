 3-man team to visit England
London: A three-man delegation from Zimbabwe will visit England later this month to discuss Englands tour of the country scheduled for October, ECB said on Thursday. England are expected to pull out of the tour on moral grounds as a protest against the regime of Zimbabwes president Robert Mugabe, following concerns from the British government. However, the ECB has invited Zimbabwe Cricket Union chairman Peter Chingoka and two colleagues to a meeting at Lords cricket ground on April 20, when the Zimbabweans are expected to make a final bid to persuade England to confirm the tour. England could face a heavy fine and exclusion from the ICC Champions Trophy if they cancel, after the ICC ruled countries could only cancel a tour for security reasons or if ordered to by their governments.

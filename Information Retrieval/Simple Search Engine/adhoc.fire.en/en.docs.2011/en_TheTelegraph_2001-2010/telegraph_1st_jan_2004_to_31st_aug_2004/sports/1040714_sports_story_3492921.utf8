 Inzamam not seeking revenge
 Inzamam-ul Haq lights a ceremonial lamp at the teams hotel in Colombo on Tuesday. (AFP) Colombo: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said on Tuesday his side was not seeking revenge against India for the home series defeat, but warned the Indians to be ready for a tough fight when they meet in the Asia Cup. We dont use words like revenge and we are not seeking one here, the batsman said after arriving here to take part in the six-nation tournament. We are here to play good cricket and we are going to play our best and win, Inzamam said. India, in their first full tour of Pakistan in 14 years, won the ODI series 3-2 and the Test series 2-1 earlier this year. The defeats cost coach Javed Miandad his job. The former captain was fired and replaced by Bob Woolmer. The Asia Cup will be Woolmers as coach of Pakistan. The main attraction in the Pakistani team is fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, whose trip to Sri Lanka was not certain. He joined the training camp on July 5 and went through a strenuous fitness test. Under orders from team management, Shoaib did not speak to mediamen after arriving here. Team manager Haroon Rashid confirmed that apart from the captain, nobody is permitted to speak to the media.

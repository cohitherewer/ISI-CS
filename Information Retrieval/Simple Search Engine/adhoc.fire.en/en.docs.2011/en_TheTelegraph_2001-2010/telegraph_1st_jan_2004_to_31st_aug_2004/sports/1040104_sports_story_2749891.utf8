 Klusener back in the fold
Cape Town, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Lance Klusener and the UCBSA have reached an out-of-court settlement over the players legal action against the Board, the UCBSA said on Saturday. Klusener had been suing for loss of earnings after his national team contract was not renewed in April last year.

Klusener has been awarded a contract until April when it will be reviewed but details of the settlement are confidential. Its wonderful to have Zulu back in the fold, said UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola. Klusener said: Its good that we can now all concentrate on cricketing matters again...Im looking forward to this era in my career. Kluseners last Test was over two years ago versus Australia. in Melbourne.  Copyright

 Austria smash Martina hopes
	 - FED CUP - France, Spain and russia complete semi-final line-up  French Open champion Anastasia Myskina of Russia makes a return to Argentinas Gisela Dulko during the Fed Cup quarter finals in Buenos Aires on Sunday. Myskina won 6-1, 7-5. (AFP) Paris: Martina Navratilovas dreams of ending her career with a Fed Cup win were crushed on Sunday when 17-time champions America were knocked out by Austria in the quarter finals at Innsbruck. The 47-year-old could only watch helplessly as Barbara Schett and then Barbara Schwartz won their reverse singles to give Austria an unassailable 3-1 lead. That became 4-1 when Navratilova and Jill Craybas lost to Schett and Patricia Wartusch 3-6, 6-0, 3-6 in the doubles to mark Navratilovas first- ever defeat in the competition in her 41st appearance. Austrias opponents in the semi-finals will not be known until the re-draw of the four nations prior to the final round of ties, which are scheduled for the week commencing November 22. Austria will be playing in the semi-finals for only the fourth time, thanks to Schwartzs dramatic 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 10-8 win over Lisa Raymond which followed Barbara Schetts earlier 6-2, 6-3 victory over Chanda Rubin. The Americans, who had only lost once to Austria in seven previous meetings, went into the tie without the services of Serena and Venus Williams as well as Jennifer Capriati. Schwartz missed out on Austrias last semi-final in 2002 through injury and she said she was determined to make up for that disappointment. I couldnt go two years ago which hurt, so maybe we can win it this time. We will fight hard. Austria is such a small country, I am very proud, said Schwartz. Meanwhile, Amelie Mauresmo put her Wimbledon disappointment behind her, beating Francesco Schiavone to help holders France into the semis with a 3-2 win against Italy. Mauresmo, who lost a marathon last-four clash to Serena at the All- England Club last week, won both her singles rubbers in Rimini, having seen off Sylvia Farina Elia on Saturday. France already had an unassailable 3-0 lead before Italy scored consolation points with Elia defeating Emilie Loit 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, and Tathiana Garbin and Roberta Vinci seeing off Mary Pierce and Tatiana Golovin in the doubles 6-0, 7-6 (7-5). In Buenos Aires, Vera Zvonareva clinched victory for Russia against Argentina with a 6-3, 6-0 win over Mariana Diaz-Oliva. Earlier, French Open champion Anastasia Myskina scored her second straight-sets victory of the weekend when she defeated Gisela Dulko 6-1, 7-5. Russia wrapped up the tie when Kuznetzova and Elena Likhovtseva beat Dulko and Patricia Tarabini 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 in the doubles. In the weekends other quarter final, Spain came back from an overnight 2-0 deficit to beat Belgium 3-2. Maria Sanchez Lorenzo drew Spain level at 2-2 with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Kirsten Flipkens after her teammate Anabel Medina Garrigues got Spain on the board with a 6-4, 6-0 win over Els Callens. Then in the decisive doubles, Virginia Ruano Pascual and Anabel Medina ensured victory with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Flipkens and Callens.  (AFP)  Copyright

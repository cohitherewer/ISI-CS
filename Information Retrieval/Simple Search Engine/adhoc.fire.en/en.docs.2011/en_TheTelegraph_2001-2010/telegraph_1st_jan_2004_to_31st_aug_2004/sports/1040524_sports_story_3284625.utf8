 Cristiano my MoM: Ferguson
	 - Accolades galore for uniteds 19-year-old Portuguese  Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Ruud van Nistelrooy with the FA Cup after Manchester United beat Millwall in Cardiff on Saturday Cardiff: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson celebrated their 30 FA Cup final win over Millwall on Saturday and predicted a great future for goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo. The 19-year-old Portuguese winger, who lit up a dour game with his dribbling skills, gave United a 44th minute lead before second-half goals from Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, one of them a penalty, sealed Uniteds record 11th FA Cup triumph. Were delighted, as you should be, to win the Cup, Ferguson told a news conference. You always say at the start of the season at this club that youll try to win a trophy and weve done that. The first half wasnt easy. There were periods when we found it difficult to get a flow to our game... but we got the break of scoring just before halftime which killed it for them. It opened the game up for us and the second half was a convincing performance. As for Ronaldo, who finished his first season in English football in real style, Ferguson said: Everyones got their ideas about what his potential is but weve seen potential in that player better than anything in Europe. What we have to do is to realise that potential. It took him time to get used to British football but with every passing week hes got better and better and to my mind he was the Man of the Match, Ferguson added after England coach Sven Goran Eriksson had given Ruud van Nistelrooy the honour. Along with Ronaldos pace, physique and balance, Ferguson said: Hes got a fantastic personality, great strength of mind and I think those things will help him more than anything. Its less the coaching, its the character that I think hes got within him that will take him really far in the game. Van Nistelrooy, who scored with a penalty after 65 minutes and a simple tap in 10 minutes from time said: Winning the final and scoring two is fantastic. I missed the last one (penalty) I took but I was convinced I wouldnt miss this one, the striker added, referring to his miss in a 11 draw with Chelsea earlier this month. The prolific Dutch international has now scored 29 goals in all competitions for United this season. Im very proud that I have won the FA Cup. Its the biggest cup final in the world, said Van Nistelrooy. I watched the final when I was younger but to be here with everyone the fans, the teams the support was fantastic. Ill just enjoy this moment and I will never forget this. United keeper Tim Howard, the first American to win the FA Cup, said: To get a medal and a cup in my first year is awesome. I cant say anything else about it. I didnt have a lot to do but what we did, we did well so well take the win. Captain Roy Keane was finally able to hold aloft a trophy for the fans after a season of disappointment in Europe and a third place Premier League finish. He said: Its always nice to win a trophy and the latest is always the nicest. We knew we were in for a hard game and all credit must go to Millwall, I thought they were outstanding. Full back Gary Neville, who provided the cross for Ronaldos goal said: The goal just before halftime really settled us down and we gave Millwall more problems in the second half, he said. Neville said of Ronaldo: He can be a worldclass player, right up with the very top players in the world. Hes only 19 and to come here with this massive price tag on his head, hes done sensationally well this season for us. (Reuters)  Copyright

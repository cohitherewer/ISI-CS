 Mongia ton in Lancashire victory
London: Dinesh Mongia cracked a superb unbeaten century to lead Lancashire to a thrilling two-wicket win over Warwickshire in the Division One league at Old Trafford. The Indians 104 not out off just 105 balls with 10 fours and two sixes in the day-night encounter on Tuesday also kept Lancashire in the hunt for the title. After Warwickshire scored 251 for five in 45 overs with captain Nick Knight scoring an unbeaten 122, Lancashire won with one over to spare. Initially it seemed Lancashire would win easily when opener Ian Sutcliffe and Mongia were at the crease. But Sutcliffes dismissal for 68 sparked a collapse and briefly put the match back in the balance. However, Mongia held his nerve to take the side to victory in the penultimate over. BRIEF SCORES: Warwickshire 251/5 in 45 ovs (N. Night 122 n.o., N. Carter 40, B. Hogg 34) lost to Lancashire 255/8 in 44 ovs (D. Mongia 104 not out, .I. Sutcliffe 68).  (PTI)  Copyright

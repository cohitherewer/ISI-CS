 American Paul Hamm, who become the first American to win the Olympics mens all-around gymnastics title, should not have been awarded the gold, the sports governing body ruled on Saturday.				 																																	But Hamm will keep his medal despite a scoring error which robbed South Korean bronze medallist Yang Tae-young of the title, FIG said.				 																																	The FIG rules do not allow for a protest against judges marks. The judges marks have to be accepted as a final decision and cannot be changed.				 																																	Three technical judges were suspended on Saturday after South Koreas protest over the difficulty level score of Yang was upheld.				 																																	Had Yang been credited with the correct difficulty score on the parallel bars, he would have finished with a total of 57.874, 0.051 of a point ahead of his American rival. Anti-doping watchdogs will start testing aspiring athletes in Greek schools after the country was hit by a wave of doping-related scandals at the Olympics.				 																																	Overshadowing the long-awaited homecoming of the Games to their spiritual home, Greeks have been stunned by controversy on the use of banned substances involving their most high-profile athletes in the first week of the games.				 																																	From the next school year Greek officials will intensify their focus on younger athletes in schools in a bid to keep them on the straight and narrow. Our focus will be on prevention, but there will also be tests for banned substances, an Education Ministry spokesman said.  The Olympic archers were expecting strong winds and searing heat. But giant moths?				 																																	A plague of thousands of meaty moths, some up to 7.5 cm (3 inches) long, have swarmed over the Panathinaiko Stadium in central Athens, the home of the first modern Games in 1896 and the venue for the archery at this years Olympics.				 																																	Top Korean archer Im Dong-hyun was just about to shoot in the teams competition on Saturday, when one irritatingly fluttered in front of him. Four years ago, Australian oarsman Drew Ginn feared his rowing career was over after injury ruled him out of his home Sydney Olympics and doctors told him to give up.				 																																	On Saturday, in Athens, he completed a remarkable comeback to take an emotional mens coxless pair gold with James Tomkins, his teammate in Australias winning Oarsome Foursome of 1996.				 																																	I think the human spirit can overcome many things, said the 29-year-old Ginn. When I ruptured my disc I thought Id never row again. 				 																																	But the desire to compete was still there and when Ginn visited Tomkins at his house after the Sydney Games, the pair made the decision to try again.  New Zealand identical twins Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell won gold in the womens double sculls on Saturday, just holding off a late German surge. The duo have dominated the event for the last two years, winning the 2002 and 2003 world championships and two World Cup events this year. 				 																																	They shot out of the blocks and had a length lead by 500m and looked to sit comfortably in front for the rest of the race.				 																																	But Germanys Peggy Waleska and Britta Oppelt mounted a late charge which just failed by half a boats length. Britains Sarah Winckless and Elise Laverick took bronze.  A South Korean TV technician accredited at the Olympics drowned late on Friday while swimming in an Athens seaside suburb, police sources said.

 Bergkamp eyes Champions League
London: Dennis Bergkamp has won countless domestic honours in his nine years at Arsenal but in what is likely to be his farewell season, the Dutch striker has his eyes on European glory. Bergkamp, was handed a one-year contract extension at the end of Arsenals record-breaking 2003-04 season and now hopes he can contribute to an assault on the club games biggest prize, the Champions League. I feel we are getting better in that we are getting more experience in it, said Bergkamp. I feel you need a little bit of luck as well and if you look at the two games we played against Chelsea last year, normally we would have done better against them. We are playing well enough, we just need a little bit of luck as well I think, said Bergkamp, speaking at the British Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday. (REUTERS)  Copyright

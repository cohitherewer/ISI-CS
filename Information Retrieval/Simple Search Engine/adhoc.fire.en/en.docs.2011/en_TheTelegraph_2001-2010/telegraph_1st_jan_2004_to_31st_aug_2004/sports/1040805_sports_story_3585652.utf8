The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Alex dealt a lucky hand by AFC
Beijing: Japan midfielder Alex, booked in his last two games, is set to play in the Asian Cup final, thanks to a controversial decision by tournament organisers. The Brazilian-born player will benefit after the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) decided not to carry over yellow cards picked up during the knockout stage to the final. The players were laughing about it in training this morning, Japan media officer Ichirota Fukushi said. They were wondering how Alex was still playing. Yellow cards are rescinded, apparently. The AFC confirmed they had changed the rules regarding yellow cards since the last Asian Cup in Lebanon four years ago. The decision puts the AFC at odds with accepted practice at competitions run by soccers world governing body Fifa, though Asian officials claimed there was nothing controversial about it. If it was a red card he would be out but people do not want to see the top players miss the final, AFC director of communications Michelle Chai said. The decision was taken within the laws of the game and for the good of the game.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

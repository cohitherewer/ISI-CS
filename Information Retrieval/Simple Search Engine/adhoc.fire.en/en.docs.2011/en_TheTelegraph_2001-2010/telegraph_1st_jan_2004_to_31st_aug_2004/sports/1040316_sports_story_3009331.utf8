 Leicester trio back on field today
London: Three Leicester City players, granted bail by a Spanish judge after being accused of sexual assault, will return to the pitch in a reserve team game on Tuesday, the Premier League club said on Monday. Striker Paul Dickov, defender Frank Sinclair and midfielder Keith Gillespie will all be in the line-up when Leicesters reserve team takes on Southampton at St Marys Stadium. The important thing for them now is to get back on the training ground and play games, manager Micky Adams told the clubs website. This is the opportunity for them to get the event somewhat out of their heads a little bit and have a game for 90 minutes. Adams also confirmed there would be an internal investigation by the club into the events in Spain, but said there was no timescale for this. The trio spent almost a week in a Spanish jail after being accused of sexual assault by three women during a training programme in the resort of La Manga. The three players have protested their innocence.  (REUTERS)  Copyright
